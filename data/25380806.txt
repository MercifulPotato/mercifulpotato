Low vitamin D levels are an indicator of frailty, so all the observational evidence may be showing something other than a causal relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID outcomes.<p>IV vitamin D seemed to be beneficial in early COVID-19 patients in one randomized trial, which is the best evidence of a causal relationship we have between vitamin D and prevention of severe COVID.  Attempts at giving oral vitamin D after diagnosis showed no benefit, but wouldn&#x27;t really be expected to, either.<p>There&#x27;s probably some protective effect, but it&#x27;s also probably much smaller than most are estimating.  That said, taking a small to moderate dose of vitamin D is likely to do more good than harm to people for other reasons, and may provide a small margin of protection against severe COVID.  Further, it&#x27;s cheap and easy to do.<p>Since March, I&#x27;ve been taking a multivitamin that includes a moderate amount of D.')
