Even assuming there are no other callers of `get_users` that you might be breaking here (possibly silently, since lists and tuples in Python have overlapping interfaces), you&#x27;re making `get_users` less useful by dropping structure that at least someone, at some point, thought was useful.<p>Also, you should annotate the type of your lists :)<p><pre><code>  def get_users(f) -&gt; Tuple[List[User], List[User]]:\n    return (logged_in_users(f), logged_out_users(f))\n\n  def user_count(f) -&gt; int:\n    logged_in_users, logged_out_users = get_users()\n    return len(logged_in_users) + len(logged_out_users)</code></pre>')
