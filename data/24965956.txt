I don&#x27;t think this justifies the claim that &quot;it is a meaningfully distinct kind of type safety&quot;: newtype-based approaches may have further pitfalls that ground-up construction approaches do not, but ground-up construction approaches do still have pitfalls.<p>To get more specific:<p>* Safety holes of this sort are remarkably <i>uncommon</i> in practice, in my experience.<p>* Modules should be small and easily understood. If maintaining a module&#x27;s invariants becomes too complex then you can, and should, recursively apply the same techniques within the module, breaking it up into smaller modules. This is good development practice anyway, as is periodic refactoring. So these cautions are a lot less costly than they sound; in fact the cost may well be zero.<p>* You need to resist the temptation to add unsafe trapdoors in any other approach as well; this simply isn&#x27;t a disadvantage that&#x27;s in any way specific to using newtypes.')
