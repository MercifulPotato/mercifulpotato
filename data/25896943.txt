I had two car accidents due to lack of sleep the night before. Whenever I don&#x27;t get my sleep I can&#x27;t focus, my recollection is poor and I have trouble doing basic stuff. You can find texts online about people literally dying from chronic insomnia. I always wonder how some people can function well with little sleep and almost everybody seems to do better than me. And I&#x27;m convinced that lack of sleep accumulates because I can sleep till noon if I have no obligations that day.<p>For my schizophrenic sibling one of the most troubling aspects of his condition is bad irregular sleep. Sometimes he can&#x27;t sleep all night and then he sleeps the whole next day. But it&#x27;s never enough sleep, nothing but constant drowsiness and lack of energy. Psychosis sure does resemble dreaming while awake, you accept weird ideas, things just happen etc, same as in a dream. And once medication kicks in, seems like slowly waking up and dream fades out.<p>Somehow it&#x27;s all connected and whoever figures out the puzzle of sleep will make the world a much happier place.')
