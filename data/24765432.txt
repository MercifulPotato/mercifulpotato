But everytime I update archlinux, it was restored and I had to apply my change again!<p>There&#x27;s no normal setting or config file to turn it off...<p>I&#x27;m using Cinnamon now though, that one is much better at just being exactly how it should be (= KDE 3.5-ish) and not changing in annoying ways all the time. Or running undesired, not easy to disable, CPU hogging &quot;nepomuk&quot; and other oddly named things in the background. Or being too integrated with other software like PIM stuff, while all I want is a good window manager.')
