Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603524857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876444, text='&gt; To play devil&#x27;s advocate, I wonder if it can really be said that when you watch a youtube video you have been<p>&gt;&gt; invited to witness in its entirety free of charge<p>&gt; when you consider advertising. It could be argued that when you watch a monetized youtube video you are being invited to view the video in exchange for also viewing advertisements as a form of payment.<p>The problem with this idea is that you&#x27;re quoting a case about recording televised broadcasts. The quote you pulled your quote from begins &quot;when one considers the nature of a televised copyrighted audiovisual work&quot;.<p>Televised works were shown with embedded advertising a lot more intrusive than what can appear on a YouTube video. There is no way for the presence of advertisements to affect how this argument applies to YouTube, when it was originally cast in terms of television.')
