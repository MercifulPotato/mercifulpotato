So, according to CAPM, the discount rate should be the risk-free rate. The logic being is that any risk within this one assets is diversified away at scale.<p>&quot;Just imagine that you were given the option of buying this asset for $98 or something like a US bond for $98, both of which will yield $100 at maturity in expectation. Which one would you choose?&quot;<p>I&#x27;d pay $97.99 at these odds. I wouldn&#x27;t put all my money in it. But I&#x27;d look for as many risky-but-uncorrelated assets as I could with these. As long as I have enough of them, I have a very very high chance of being better off than if I had bought the &#x27;safer&#x27; securities with known payoffs.')
