I forget) finally made them stop holding pseudo-cash accounts for people until&#x2F;unless people specifically requested it. Laws take time to catch up.<p>&gt; why not obvious billion dollar ones? why would anyone expect them to take it on given how risk averse they are?<p>Again: I&#x27;m not opining on what they should or shouldn&#x27;t be doing. All I&#x27;m saying is, if you think <i>the fact that it&#x27;s not a utility</i> is a good supporting argument for this, I&#x27;m saying their classification is far from obvious to me. But if you have other arguments to make, I&#x27;m not expressing any opinions on them; I&#x27;m solely replying to the &quot;it&#x27;s clearly not a utility&quot; bit.')
