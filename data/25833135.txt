Lobbying is a form of corruption unique to politicians, but it&#x27;s just as possible that someone who has access to everyone&#x27;s data via the CLOUD act uses such data in a corrupt way, or sells their access to that data to the highest bidder. Corruption is a problem that can occur anywhere down the trust stack.<p>A focus on individual responsibility for security and for integrity refocuses the issue on foundational Confucian principles (for every individual, be: benevolent, righteous, have propriety, build wisdom, and have fidelity), creates a culture of trust, diversity and competence. These things are much better for a thriving society, whether the label for the systems is democratic, dogmacratic, bureaucratic, or plutocratic.<p>(p.s. I am Australian, not Chinese. I just have an appreciation for learning from your rivals)')
