In fact much of DeFi can be frontrun. Most commonly it’s large trades to AMMs, where the original buyer ends up getting significantly more slippage than they expected.<p>The future is likely private smart contracts like Secret (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrt.network&#x2F;)in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrt.network&#x2F;)in</a> which the contract’s internal state and the function calls are entirely obscured using sMPC or by leveraging SGX enclaves. This makes it impossible to frontrun in most cases.<p>Whether an unauditable financial system is a good thing or bad thing is still up for debate.')
