I&#x27;m one of those people whose entire job is interacting with people. I do have about 3 hours of scheduled calls every week. The other 37 hours are mostly written communications via email, slack, Aha, Jira, Confluence, Zeplin, comment threads in Office docs... and probably other tools I&#x27;m forgetting. And of course, a few hours each week of ad-hoc calls as questions come up.<p>I admit, it took me months to break down exactly which conversations truly need to happen each week, and the smallest groups that still made them effective. But it is quite possible.')
