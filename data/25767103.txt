Granted, these scanners largely use machine vision tech but lasers are still used as a form of &quot;dumb&quot; auto focus aid.<p>On another tangent, I still CANNOT believe that one company at least within the US controls 100% of the issuance of UPC codes.  They sell them for up to *$30 A PIECE*!  We need a &quot;LetsEncrypt&quot; for UPC codes - granted they serve an important role in load balancing across online stores, preventing counterfeit goods and in Amazon&#x27;s case... penalizing sellers when they find the same UPC being sold on another online platform at a lower price ;)<p>Lasers will always be cool')
