Doesn&#x27;t matter if you your name is hnaccy or SoSoRoCoCo.<p>I change details, times, various things, just a little. Whenever I need to make a reference as a citiation, 20% of the facts change just slightly. Sometimes I&#x27;m a woman, sometimes I&#x27;m from a different state, sometimes it is a different company I worked for. These details don&#x27;t matter to the content, but there is so much contradiction in my history that I hope to defeat the algorithms. I got the idea from how Firefox defeats browser fingerprinting (or tries to).<p>I also create new accounts routinely.<p>However, even HN knows who I am because I occasionally forget to use my randomized VPN, and HN keeps track of you.<p>I know this because I was banned from an IP address once and had to renew it from my ISP to come back to HN.')
