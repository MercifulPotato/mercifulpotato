These are some of the most annoying syntax warts.<p>Another thing - that probably has no resolution - is the struct-tag thingie. Even after all those years I&#x27;m not decided if it&#x27;s worth typedefing structs to remove the struct tag. Like<p><pre><code>    typedef struct _FooBuffer FooBuffer;\n    struct _FooBuffer {\n        ...\n    };\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; now we can declare FooBuffer variables without struct tag:\n    FooBuffer foo;\n\n   &#x2F;&#x2F; had we just declared struct FooBuffer { ... } (without\n   the typedef), then we would have to do\n   struct FooBuffer foo;\n</code></pre>\nAs almost everybody, for a new language I would not want to have any struct tags.\nEven though the argument from the Linux Kernel code style guide makes some sense to me\n(&quot;don&#x27;t typedef struct tags away because we want to see it&#x27;s a struct&quot;). Each struct keyword moves the following code 7 columns to the right, which is annoying in lines where there are 3 or more of them.')
