Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[25377429], score=None, time=1607624819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376374, text='&gt;Most wars have been fought by people that value their form of liberty over death.<p>Most wars have been fought by conscripts, slaves or soldiers who otherwise only wanted to come back home alive, pawns in chess games played with human lives by the elite powers. Even the American Revolution was for the most part a tax revolt by the wealthy against the British Crown.<p>And none of those wars have been against the tyranny of medicine and science. Benjamin Franklin, the man responsible for the famous (and almost universally misapplied) quote about those who trade a little freedom for security deserving neither, lost his son to one of the many smallpox outbreaks in the early US. In his autobiography, he mentions bitterly regretting not having given his son the smallpox vaccine[0]. He did <i>not once</i> declare that affording his son the &quot;liberty&quot; of dying from smallpox was worth the sacrifice versus the &quot;temporary safety&quot; of vaccination - and this was during a time when vaccination was new, still controversial, and much less safe than now. Rather, he became a passionate advocate for vaccination and public health.<p>So believe what you like, but the Founding Fathers very likely would <i>not</i> have been on the side of the anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers or their form of liberty.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2653186&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2653186&#x2F;</a>')
