The distribution collapses into a binary outcome at the end.<p>I have a dice. I claim the distribution is of equal outcome for each side. Well...we don&#x27;t get to test the dice more than once. 1 sample size does not prove that the 538&#x27;s predictions were right (or wrong).<p>Thanks for assuming I can&#x27;t do math, no way to argue with someone but I am actually pretty bad at it. :-)')
