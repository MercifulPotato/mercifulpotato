Item(by='gregmac', descendants=None, kids=[25930695], score=None, time=1611766565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928934, text='That&#x27;s a great idea, I&#x27;ll definitely be doing that in the future!<p>I&#x27;ve added L-brackets to key spots on Ikea furniture before, and it often increases how sturdy it feels by an order of magnitude.<p>Just the other day I fixed a 5 year old Billy bookshelf (that I broke while moving it, while partly loaded with books) by securing the cardboard back with screws instead of finishing nails and adding a couple metal brackets to the bottom. Cosmetically, despite being (ab)used by my kid, it still looks fine, and now feels even more sturdy than before. Wish I had thought of adding some glue (or maybe No More Nails) to secure the back even more.')
