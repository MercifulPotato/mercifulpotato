The tech market here is extremely dry with only ARM and DeepMind being the only non-gaming tech companies that come to mind that are actually relevant, with DeepMind needing the backing outside of the EU to be where it&#x27;s at today and ARM being bought by NVIDIA.<p>The way you improve the tech scene is by providing better alternatives. Music piracy was reduced through services like Spotify rather than some business&#x2F;political people getting sites &#x27;removed&#x27;. Elon Musk creates OpenAI with the goal of building safe AGI, the JS creator created Brave for privacy.\nGood luck trying to start any of these projects here.<p>Laws that try to moderate only create a chase that goes in circles.
