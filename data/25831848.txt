So feel free to downvote, like other cultures and eras would have felt free to upvote.<p>&gt;<i>As a side note, before you start gatekeeping literacy you may want to avoid grammar mistakes in your own writing.</i><p>Ah, the ad hominem attack that has nothing to do with the substance of the argument.<p>Never mind that I&#x27;m not a native speaker, and I would like to see how you would have fared in my language :-)')
