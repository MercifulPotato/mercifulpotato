They are always reactive to (not predictive of) &quot;download counts&quot; - they almost certainly take money to rank higher in their charts, or such a mechanism exists through whatever flawed data gathering approach they take. Anyone who can afford to pay AppAnnie and SensorTower is already well capitalized to some extent, and it is definitely effective to arbitrage $1m of cheap fake downloads through AppAnnie into a $10m investment from dumb money.<p>Compare to Steam, which publishes realtime concurrent player counts and sales data that is irrefutably true, with rare exceptions caused by bugs. (1) There are always big surprises in the Steam data, especially when you compare the genres that lead the charts to the genres that giant companies most aggressively market. Such transparency has been instrumental to the continued success of indie game developers on that platform. Steam has the fattest tails in the business, at least in terms of something we can actually validate, so it&#x27;s still your best bet for information.<p>Despite the information, there is still not a viable venture capital model around Steam games. You&#x27;ll never see a Y Combinator gaming startup list on Steam, and the ones that do, they&#x27;ll fail to raise money because all that investors will talk about is &quot;how many users u got?&quot; It&#x27;s a vicious cycle<p>The problem is lack of simple ideas for analyzing this data, something so simple and straightforward that the kind of people who become Managing Directors can process in a deck.<p>Anyway, a startup is never going to release numbers it can&#x27;t fudge.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;DotA2&#x2F;comments&#x2F;aflabl&#x2F;psa_stop_hyping_up_auto_chess_player_numbers_they&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;DotA2&#x2F;comments&#x2F;aflabl&#x2F;psa_stop_hypi...</a>')
