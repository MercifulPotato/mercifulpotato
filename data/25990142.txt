In my experience, that collaboration goes better when I have some &quot;casual rapport&quot; (not sure if there is a better term) with my colleagues--people are more willing to work with me, exchange favors, etc. In a physical environment, the requisite social interactions happen more naturally, but in my new remote role it seems like it requires a certain amount of intentionality. And provided that social time is &quot;on the clock&quot; or otherwise compensated, I don&#x27;t see how I&#x27;m being exploited.<p>In other words, I agree with everything you&#x27;re saying, but I don&#x27;t see how it rebuts team building.')
