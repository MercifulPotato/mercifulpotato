I can see where the author of the article is coming from and I agree that Git has a lot of commands and it&#x27;s hard to pull it all together, especially if you are new. And I agree that these commands could be better organized and presented and I think that&#x27;s something the project is actively trying to address.<p>But isn&#x27;t the core idea of Git, everyone has their own repository and they share branches, kind of complicated and tricky? In my experience the developers I see having problems with Git are having trouble with the hard stuff, not the easy bits like committing and pushing a change.')
