If you score highly on everything, they&#x27;ll give you a pat on the back to tell you that you&#x27;re amongst their most &quot;sophisticated&quot; users.<p>This seems common in the enterprise sales world. Another example I&#x27;ve seen is Adobe, which holds an annual Symposium every year where they hand out awards to the most advanced users of their products. The &quot;winners&quot; get to feel like they&#x27;ve been recognized for their incredible digital marketing skills and the rest of their clients are shown how to increase the amount of vendor lock-in and dependence on Adobe. Everyone wins!')
