RNA vaccines are winning the COVID battle, based on extremely cool technology (pseudouridine to evade innate immunity, two prolines to lock the spike in prefusion conformation, lipid nanovesicles for delivery,...). RNA drugs are also being developed to treat cancer (by vaccinating against patient-specific neoantigens), MS (by inducing immune tolerance to suppress autoimmunity), etc.<p>AlphaFold2 appears to have solved the protein structure problem entirely in software, which will lead to breakthroughs in drug design.<p>Deep learning is being used to augment microscopy leading to amazing advances in resolution.<p>I could go on. Last year saw the greatest number of new drug approvals in a long time, and VC funding levels were also very healthy.<p>Biotech is where it’s at.')
