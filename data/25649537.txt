I&#x27;m always tempted to ask &quot;How is this different or better than XYZ lang?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t have the time&#x2F;inclination to learn every new fangled language that comes by, so it would be nice to have an easy way to understand what scenarios any given language is best suited for.<p>For example, every time I read about Go, I&#x27;m left wondering: How is this better than C or Java? Presumably it&#x27;s better in some ways I&#x27;m not perceiving, otherwise why would it be built and used?')
