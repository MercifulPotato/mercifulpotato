Texting is hard, opening spotify is a chore, unlocking isn&#x27;t instant, and it&#x27;s made me way more mindful and apprehensive about unlucking my phone. It just being bad, has made me a better more present person and I&#x27;m honestly now going to wait to go back to a &quot;real&quot; phone so the habits I&#x27;m learning stick')
