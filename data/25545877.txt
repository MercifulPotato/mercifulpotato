You&#x27;re focused on just the system&#x27;s outcome and find NIST to be instrumental in delivering those outcomes. I agree.<p>But that fails to address the unneeded stress on the system by antagonizing these isolated groups that have made decisions for reasons and have their own history. Appealing to this top-down system ignores how participating is dehumanizing even as its purpose is to serve the people.<p>I&#x27;m arguing you can have your cake and eat it too, we&#x27;re just choosing not to because decision making carries risks. We want to limit decisions to specific people out of fear of that risk, not out of respect for a system that has proven it&#x27;s correct.')
