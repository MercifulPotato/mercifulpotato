And color arithmetic pretty much by definition implies dealing with distances and angles in a perceptually uniform color space, doesn&#x27;t it ??<p>No. Linearity is about physical light intensities relating to perceived color. Imagine having two light sources on the same spot that you can turn on or off separately. If you turn the first one on you perceive a certain color, if you turn the other on you perceive an other color and if you turn both on you perceive a third one. It turns out the perceivable colors (under normal viewing conditions) are representable in a three dimensional vector-space (for most people) so that the first two colors add up to the third color for every possible two light sources. Such a linear colorspace is XYZ for example [1].<p>This has nothing to do with perceptual uniformity. Perceptual uniformity is about the capability of distinguishing near colors. This defines a distance between colors, and there are three dimensional colorspace representations where the Euclidean distance approximate this perceptual distance well. cieLAB is such a colorspace, but AFAIK there are better state of the art colorspaces for the same purpose. I&#x27;m not very well versed in this, I learned from them from this video [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CIE_1931_color_space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CIE_1931_color_space</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU</a><p>edit: gimp 2.10 now defaults to use a linear colorspace (not perceptually uniform!) for most if not all of its functionalities. This affects alpha-blending layers, the paintbrush, resizing, blur, and pretty much everything that involves adding&#x2F;averaging colors. There is still a &quot;legacy&quot; option on these tools to turn back to the probably wrong sRGB methods, probably for compatibility with old gimp files. There is a dramatic difference when you use a soft green brush on a red background for example, it&#x27;s worth to try out.')
