The Lite editor plugins also give a good modular way to understand how specific features are implemented and to experiment with etc. The implementation overview (linked in post above) gives a great understanding of what is happening where. Overall its a really nice starting point for playing with the code base and thinking about how to extend or modify for your own use.')
