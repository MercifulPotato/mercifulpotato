The doctors performing reconstructive surgery are not taking advantage of vulnerable individuals, they are helping support people&#x27;s recoveries.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand ... ?<p>First, I certainly didn&#x27;t say that the doctors are taking advantage of anyone and certainly don&#x27;t think so! I don&#x27;t even know what ulterior motive the doctors would have. Please don&#x27;t attribute things to me.<p>The job of mental health professionals is to help the patient achieve whatever their goal is, whether that&#x27;s &#x27;getting back to normal&#x27; or to help with a difficult decision or situation.<p>Who are you saying would be &quot;asking very personal questions and making hurtful comments&quot;? Mental health professionals? Mental health treatment is not an inquisition; there&#x27;s no judgment made. Just like the surgeon, their job is to help the patient.<p>----<p>The doctors have asked us to take a survey. It&#x27;s reasonable to raise legitimate concerns about that survey; we&#x27;re not and shouldn&#x27;t be thoughtless and unskeptical.')
