In the present order, the left is advocating for censorship because they believe that it will only be used against the right. Of course, the shoe has been on the other foot in the past.<p>The only correct answer is a principled answer: censorship is wrong regardless of political affiliation.<p>Part of this, of course, needs to be an understanding that &quot;free speech&quot; was always intended to be <i>speech</i> first and foremost, i.e. political speech, scientific dialgues, etc. with a focus on defending things which are iconoclastic.<p>Obscenity is not the same thing at all, there&#x27;s no need for confusion here, we can continue to ban people posting things that all good people believe should be illegal (i.e. the exploitation of children).<p>It&#x27;s also totally reasonable for people to want to carve off curated spaces; this is why the law needs to be nuanced enough to differentiate between platforms, subforums, communities, publishers, bloggers, etc. rather than hoping to lump everything together with blanket statements that fail to accomplish the real goal of free speech.')
