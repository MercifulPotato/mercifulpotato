They just stretched out a ring bus a bit further to add in more of the same CPU cores they&#x27;d been shipping for years, with <i>very</i> incremental improvements&#x2F;fixes. Aside from some of the clock speed increases and some of the integrated GPU updates, all the big improvements they&#x27;ve made to their consumer 14nm chips since 2015&#x27;s <i>Skylake</i> are things they could have delivered in 2016 if there had been competitive pressure.')
