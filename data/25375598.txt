I use a minority email provider, mapping provider, cloud storage provider, backup provider, webdav, caldav, browser (on desktop and mobile), search engine, ebook reader, lock down my android phone in various ways to diminish google&#x27;s control of it (my work uses Google so to be employed by my current employer I must use google), don&#x27;t have a facebook account or a twitter account, try to use windows with most of the reporting back turned off and accounts signed out, don&#x27;t use voice assistants at all, etc.<p>I think it&#x27;s the right thing to do, and generally I think it&#x27;s a good idea to use non dominant service providers as a way to encourage competition.<p>All this, and I&#x27;m sure all the big companies have huge amounts of data about me from when I mess up or from how my life impinges on other people who are more thoroughly tracked.<p>This definitely makes my life significantly more complex, and various things that are trivial for others are a bit of a palaver for me and for many people I know it&#x27;d be completely unreasonable.  It&#x27;s a trade off I&#x27;ve decided to make, but the comment you are referring to highlights the convenience, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong.')
