You can do this in software if you want to sit on your laptop in front of your audience. You can do the BinkLooper workaround if you want a simple external hardware device to interact with things but it&#x27;s really complicated. I would truly love to find out a way to do what the Push 2 does for launching clips without having to spend $800 for it on top of the Live license. Granted, a Push 2 can be bought for slightly less on sale but it&#x27;s still a lot.')
