A glowing Glassdoor profile is as much a reflection of engagement with Glassdoor as it is the quality of company and work environment. An &quot;engaged employer&quot; badge on a company&#x27;s profile almost certainly means the numbers are juiced upward.<p>My previous company of 7 years had 4.9 stars on Glassdoor. They cared a lot about maintaining their profile.<p>My current company of 2 years has 3.5 stars on Glassdoor. They don&#x27;t care much at all about maintaining their profile.<p>Even accounting for the jadedness that comes with tenure, my current company is a much better place to work in many ways. Old company was fine, good even, but lol at 4.9&#x2F;5. I won&#x27;t be going back anytime soon, despite the standing invitation.')
