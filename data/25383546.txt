A constant uphill battle for payment processing is that people spending money on porn sites often have &quot;regret&quot; (or, less charitably, they chargeback when their spouse finds out). I believe this is the reasoning for Stripe not taking adult stores as customers. While it isn&#x27;t consumer friendly to get rid of chargebacks, it&#x27;s something that would help out these sites a lot.')
