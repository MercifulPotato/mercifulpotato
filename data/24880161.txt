Hosting arbitrary binaries isn&#x27;t cheap, so the economics of sites like this almost encourages shady behavior, not to mention the possibility of malicious users.<p>Edit: I realize my broken certs problem must be caused by an extension (probably HTTPS Everywhere) here. Anyway, probably don&#x27;t want to download binaries over unencrypted channels in 2020...')
