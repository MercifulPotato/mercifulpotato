What you&#x27;re describing is a sure path to slavery; which is inescapable poverty.<p>The minute you lose all bargaining power, you become a slave.<p>Employees of corporations who think that less freedom leads to more prosperity may feel protected now but the minute that your master no longer needs your support, you will become one of the victims.<p>In all of history, people who live in free countries have always had the upper hand over those who live in oppressed countries.<p>If your country becomes an oppressed country, many of the rich people (the best among them) will leave and they will bring their money along with them to a free country. Most rich people don&#x27;t want to live in an oppressed country. They simply don&#x27;t like to see misery. I&#x27;m betting on island nations with relatively small populations.')
