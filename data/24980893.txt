There isn&#x27;t a fundamental reason this should be the case.<p>* Women (and men obviously too but we&#x27;re talking about women) are conditioned constantly from birth to have those preferences and have to deal with pressure from everyone in their lives to not deviate from what&#x27;s expected from them. (Same with men too -- try being a manly man who wants to bake wedding cakes or go into fashion.) And then when women try to be mold breakers and go into &quot;masculine fields&quot; they&#x27;re pushed away and become lower status.')
