In the recent past both FB and Twitter have linked to &quot;fact checked&quot; articles&#x2F;sources that represented only the narrative they wanted you to read.  If they wanted to show neutral behavior they could have linked to articles that represented both sides of an argument which would keep their independence and educate their audience better since rarely is one side 100% correct.')
