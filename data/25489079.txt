Everything in the home connects to my own router. The loss of bandwidth is minimal, if any.<p>Are there any benefits to what you&#x27;re doing over just doing that?<p>Edit: In my case, bandwidth drops from 970mbps at the ATT gateway to 930mbps at the internal router (2nd NAT). Latecy drop is higher, from 3-4ms at the ATT gateway to about 9-11ms, but most likely that is due to the Moca 2.5 that I&#x27;ve had to run between ATT and my internal router.')
