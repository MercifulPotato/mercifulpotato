Maybe you don&#x27;t fully understand why &quot;being friends&quot; won&#x27;t be as helpful for either party as desired.<p>It&#x27;s important to be <i>capable</i> of being friendly with your exes, all the more so the less you actually get along. But it&#x27;s probably unwise to put this to the test.')
