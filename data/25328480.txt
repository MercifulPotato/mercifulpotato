It was a review of the 13&quot; M1 MacBook Pro as an end-user device.”<p>Possibly, but if it was, it shouldn’t have a sentence <i>“The new M1 processor is impressive, but far from perfect- it has many warts, that nearly nobody is discussing”</i> in the second paragraph of the article.<p>Take that entire second paragraph away, and I don’t think we would have this discussion now. I thought it is bad writing, but am not sure anymore. It also could be a very good attempt at getting lots of page views.')
