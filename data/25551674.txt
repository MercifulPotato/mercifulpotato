That said, partitioning in PG still isn&#x27;t great, and though it&#x27;s better now than in say, v9.x, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s ever going to get where multinode NoSQL is without sacrificing core ACID that makes PG so great. I know it&#x27;s not in keeping with the general HN dislike of Mongo, but if you have large scale data that has a stable partition key, data that you write and store authoritatively elsewhere like a relational DB, that you don&#x27;t have to update with real time writes, but you need to do a lot of heavy reads of most of the fields, I think Mongo makes a lot of sense. To be clear, ALL of those things have to apply. And when you factor in ease of setup, adding new nodes, and training new devs that, doubt you will find a better solution.')
