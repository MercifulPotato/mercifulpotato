I personally refrain from using them as I am starting to see them in the light of logical fallacies.<p>Now on pointing it out, I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realize they are trying to sway the discourse thru the use of projection rather than logic and reason. I think it is one of those insidious things that just creep in and people don&#x27;t realize they are doing it. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and think they want to appeal to reason (at lest in life and on HN) and I think many don&#x27;t see these words work in direct contrast to that, they literally appeal to the mob. I point it out not to gain net fame or quake guns (I will take a pack-o-punch&#x27;ed gun in BO Zombies though) but rather I would hope at least one reader of this thread would have the &quot;I never really though about it that way&quot; moments.')
