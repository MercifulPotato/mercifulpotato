Item(by='baybal2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603570572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880901, text='&gt; I&#x27;m in complete and utter disbelief reading this. How can stuff like this be happening in 2020?<p>&gt; I mean this seriously but as a lowly computer programmer is there any way we can help these poor people other than offer our sympathy?<p>You are not a lowly computer programmer, but a person near the top of income vertical for as long as salaried people go.<p>The two most potent political instruments ever are the money, and firearms. You may not have the second, but certainly have first.<p>Saying this, people have to ask a question not who are the bigger enemies to the civilised mankind, but who are the biggest threat. Are they are the people who perpetrate genocides in parts of the world where the light doesn&#x27;t shine, or the people who cover for them in the West, while living a comfy life, and enjoying all benefits of life in a civil state.<p>Without any hesitation I will say that while Xis, Putins, and Sisis are the biggest enemies of the civilised mankind, but <i>the biggest threat to civil state as we know it comes from people in the West who made their ascension to power possible.</i><p>I believe the majority opinion of WW2 historians is that the war was very well preventable, or it was possible to nip it at the bud if the West wasn&#x27;t stalled in its tracks by internal political sabotage by people who were not much dissimilar to those Western politicians who now flirt with rouge regimes, and sometimes directly facilitating them.<p>A very good reason to think to all of HN readers who were fortunate to be born in the free world.<p>From my lifelong misfortune with politics, I can affirm the saying that it&#x27;s much, much, much more hard to &quot;create&quot; new power, than it is to take, or receive existing power from somebody else.<p>My advise, join all major political parties, and fight, fight, fight, until you can do something real, and the money you have can help you in this a lot.')
