You shouldn&#x27;t be calling it fraud when in the next paragraph you say that FB does work for impulse buys and not &quot;ozonetel&quot;<p>Just because your ads didn&#x27;t convert, or 90% of the traffic you buy didn&#x27;t convert, doesn&#x27;t make it fraud. Fraud is malice, with the intention to defraud someone and not deliver what you promise, with intent. This is completely different to you setting a target demographic on FB and Google and it not converting.<p>I imagine most people calling fraud in this thread aren&#x27;t actually talking about fraud, just non converting traffic. There could be a million reasons for this. You haven&#x27;t set up conversion tracking, your targeting could be off, or your product or landing page is just crap. Calling it fraud is not helpful.')
