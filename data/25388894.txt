Do they all have the same mum?<p>ETA: you are not my ‘nightmare’. You are however a social anamoly in this day and age. it is unlikely that our paths would have ever crossed except on this little online outpost.<p>I come from a very large multi generational family totally (at times) 15 members. I am also from a country with a 1+ billion people and am aware how quickly exponential population growth will eat through the resource pile. I was able to migrate to America. Where will your children and grandchildren go?  It’s already a crowded and resource dwindling world out there.

The pros only benefit your family. The cons hurt the whole community. This is called a win-lose situation.<p>Unless of course, you belong to a cult&#x2F;religion that encourages this and then I am interested in hearing more about why you made a decision to have 13 children.')
