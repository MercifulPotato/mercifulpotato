There&#x27;s the infamous Whitehall study and Sapolsky&#x27;s research linking perception of status as the driver of stress in workers rather than the effort expended at work. In a sense, people who are aligned have a completely different relationship towards work to the point where it probably can&#x27;t be considered the same thing. I don&#x27;t mean that just sociologically, but physically and physiologically in terms of the long term costs to their bodies and minds as well.<p>I may be misremembering the exact argument, but some insightful commenter here once mentioned a while ago that although Hannibal Barca would in all likelihood have had a stressful life, his relationship to that stress would probably be much different from what we imagine due to our perspective as worker bees whose relationship to work isn&#x27;t defined by autonomy, glory, or decisions that really have an impact.<p>When I see Altman&#x27;s quote:<p>&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US.... I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice.<p>It strikes me that for a person to be confused by this, they would have to be completely isolated from the working reality of most people. I&#x27;m not familiar with Altman&#x27;s life, but if I had to guess he was never in a position where the long-term connection between effort and gaining autonomy&#x2F;mastery&#x2F;meaning was broken.')
