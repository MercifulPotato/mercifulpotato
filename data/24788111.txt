The skills that are increasing? Reflex time. <i>Ability to solve abstract, short-timespan problems</i>. Basically the skills we need to interact with our entertainment. More and more, Indians and Chinese – people coming from cultures who have been shut out of the technical world until recently – are writing software for hardcore western appetites to consume.<p>&quot;Ability to solve abstract, short-timespan problems&quot;<p>I wonder about this.  I speculatively propose that there also seems to be a curious inability (or unwillingness) for people who happen to be blessed with the skill of abstract thinking, to apply that skill to the greater world (the complex system we have built for ourselves to live within).  I would say that abstract thinking, done right, allows the one wielding it the ability to step out of the ~axiomatic frame in which they live, and use to evaluate the world with a relatively clean mind - to set their individual political beliefs and preferences aside and consider things from a disinterested 3rd party perspective.  At least to some degree.  And I think mass social media, including forums like this one, likely contribute in significant ways that we do not currently understand.  Whether a <i>change</i> in our aggregate ability has taken place over time, I have no opinion, but an ambitious person could likely pick up on it if it had by reviewing conversations from a decade ago or so.<p>&gt; If you believe that the species as a whole has never been this unstable before, then the real question is this: what has changed? Whatever it is, it&#x27;s obviously happened in the last 20 years, maybe even in the last 7 or so. The thing to do would be to identify those changes and come up with a testable theory that can be tested using the data.<p>This seems like the kind of abstract thinking (disconnection from the <i>specific</i> object level characteristics of the problem) that we need more of.  Do you happen to have any theories on what steps we should be considering to get us out of this mess, that could plausibly be applied at national or planetary scale (or, know of any formal or informal organizations that are working on such ideas)?')
