I remember one study that said the US students were one of the lowest in terms of education but the absolute highest in terms of self confidence. We are reaping what we have sowed for decades now. We have such a vast uneducated population that this coronavirus is almost more like a horrifying culling of the uneducated than anything else. The utter confidence in these patients to not believe the doctors is staggering but not surprising.<p>I hate to be so blunt, but 50% of the population has IQ below 100. Nothing to me has demonstrated this more than the reaction to the pandemic. When you are so uneducated that you think a mask won’t help prevent a disease that is spread via respiratory droplets, that is a big problem and unfortunately those people are all sitting ducks. Of course many won’t believe the doctors when they don’t have the capacity to understand even the basic concept?<p>If you were to ask a child what might be a good way to help prevent a disease that originated from their mouth, I’m pretty sure one of their top two answers would be a mask. It’s such a basic concept that a child would have the solution, and you need to do mental gymnastics to convince yourself otherwise.')
