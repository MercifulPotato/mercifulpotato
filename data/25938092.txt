If you were less talented you&#x27;d likely call the current you a genius as well. If you were more talented maybe you wouldn&#x27;t consider Carmack a genius, who knows? He probably doesn&#x27;t consider himself a genius at least, he can point to the likes of Einstein and Newton and say that he is very lacking in comparison.')
