The context surrounding the story is extremely relevant.<p>The Workers in the Vineyard is a story being told by Jesus within the larger story of the Gospels. It is a <i>parable</i>. It&#x27;s not a beast fable with some clearcut moral. The whole story itself is intended as a metaphor for salvation and heaven.<p>He&#x27;s not even indirect about it this time, he makes it clear from the beginning:<p>&gt; For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard...&quot;<p>The workers object because (surprise) this actually <i>is</i> unfair in a landscape of mortal human struggles. It&#x27;s jarringly so. It defies common sense and notions of fairness. In that confusion, Jesus is trying to make a point about just how incomprehensible the generosity of the godhead is. He&#x27;s saying it breaks your prior notions and that salvation doesn&#x27;t map to time and money.<p>There&#x27;s literally no other point being made by the parable, and it&#x27;s a total error to try to divine another message.')
