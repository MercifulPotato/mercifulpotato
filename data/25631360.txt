Just another case of &quot;640K should be enough for anybody&quot;.<p>But we have to admit that storage has leapt hugely in size <i>and very rapidly</i>. In 1990 or thereabouts, a common hard disk size was about 30 megabytes. Today I have <i>files</i> that are many times that size, and we think that that is quite normal. A mere five or so years later around 1996, that size had jumped to 4000 megabytes! These days my laptop has 6 million megabytes.<p>We can&#x27;t blame filesystem planners for lack of foresight. They were blind-sided by progress just like the rest of us were.')
