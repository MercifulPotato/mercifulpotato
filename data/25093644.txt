You can borrow up to 2x your principle at this rate.<p>If you were extremely optimistic, you would borrow 2x your principal and expect to 3x your annual return.<p>If you were optimistic but wanted to avoid risk of ruin, you would borrow between 0-1x of your principal.<p>Curious if anyone here has considered this or has a strong opinion on it.<p>Side-note: I&#x27;m assuming my &quot;principle&quot; in the above scenarios is the remaining cash I have on hand after my rainy day fund (i.e. the saving like a pessimist part).')
