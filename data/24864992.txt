If the drivers are the employee of anybody, they don&#x27;t get to choose when they work, or how often, or where. Some of the drivers need that, so they lose work. The riders in the areas or times served by those drivers can no longer get rides, or have to pay more, and then more people drive drunk and lower income people pay more for transportation.<p>If the employer has to provide benefits, those costs have to be passed on to the riders, even if there are drivers who don&#x27;t need those benefits, e.g. because they get them through a spouse or a second job. Then costs increase even more and there aren&#x27;t as many riders, which means there aren&#x27;t as many drivers and even more lose their jobs.<p>How is a staffing agency supposed to solve any of that?')
