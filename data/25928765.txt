A lot of people feel alienated from the modern world and IKEA registers as fake and  therefore alienating. Mass produced, cheap culture with a copy in every house. The best criticisms of these kinds of &quot;problems&quot; are in pop art, as opposed to rational discourse.<p>Fight Club is <i>the</i> canonical example. The film picks IKEA to symbolize the enemy and justification for subversive nihilism ... it resonated well. &quot;Friends&quot; features IKEA the alienation theme as well. Phoebe thinks she has an antique apothecary table. You can smell the history of opium and medicinal brews. Turns out it&#x27;s IKEA. She has a similar storyline with Nestle. Her grandmother&#x27;s mythical cookie recipe turns out to be Nestle&#x27;s.<p>I think the fact that IKEA does, in fact, have decent style&#x2F;taste makes it a standout symbol of plastic consumerism. Does the cookie taste worse because it&#x27;s Nestle. Does a handcrafted antique table actually have value? Is our culture worth anything or can it be replaced with mass produced, cheap alternatives?<p>I personally quite admire IKEA for doing what they do well. The corporate structure under a a charitable, tax-free organization is totally bogus and crass... but tax evasion is so prevalent that it&#x27;s hard to single them out. That said, the cultural aspect is the relevant one and rationalisations aren&#x27;t necessarily relevant to that.<p>As a side not, it&#x27;s disheartening that what IKEA pretends to be doesn&#x27;t actually exist. Imagine if an organisation with the size&#x2F;competence of IKEA actually did exist for charitable reasons. 11,00 acres of wilderness might be an average afternoon.')
