Statements like this require a lot of context. How the recruiting workflow works today is that context is surfaced in actual interviews.<p>Would it be better if we could somehow accurately assess professionals on the sum totality of their experience, contributions, behaviors and traits? Yes, indeed it would.  But it would also be a lower-paying world because managers would only have sufficient information to hire the people they know closely, and have personally observed over sufficient periods of time.<p>Our modern system that enables people unknown to a company to be hired based on a simplifying process is a feature, not a bug. Because of this system, companies can scale, hire hundreds or thousands of engineers, and create world-defining products. That success is what enables companies to pay the extraordinary compensation that the technology profession currently earns.<p>In a world historical context, or even a 21st century capitalism context, the compensation paid to professionals with only a few years experience is absolutely without precedent. Many technology professionals earn more per year in their first year of employment than their parents or grandparents ever earned in a year in their entire lifetimes.<p>So while I agree there are downsides and negative aspects to the tradeoff of the modern, anonymous, meritocratic system of hiring, the benefits, for technology professionals and the world, far outweigh the negatives.')
