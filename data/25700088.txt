Pennsylvania lawsuit; it&#x27;s up to the court itself to decide standing (which also isn&#x27;t even a legislative concept, but that doesn&#x27;t matter either way).<p>I agree there were a ton of crazy claims and people flying around (e.g., Lin Wood, either crazy or a scammer or some combination of both), but not all claims were on the face of it crazy.<p>As a practical matter, if you want your democracy to function well, you need  most people to have confidence in the election process; I think you do this by (1) allowing free discussion of claims of fraud in public forums and (2) allowing interrogation of serious claims in court, so everyone can see arguments &amp; counterarguments put forward, and also feel that they&#x27;ve been given a fair shot at legal remedy.<p>To a large extent (1) was supressed (on e.g. youtube and twitter), and (2) mostly did not happen.<p>Now we&#x27;re seeing massive purges on social media of Trump-supporting accounts, which is again, not a good way to increase people&#x27;s faith in the results of the election.<p>&gt; Bush v. Gore<p>Not that meaningful of a difference between contesting votes based on hanging chads vs. poor signature matches, imo.')
