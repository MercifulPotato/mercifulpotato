I have the same problem at work - 4GB repository that is redownloaded on every single pipeline run.<p>Another reason (which is why we went for ephemeral runners in the first place...) is that if you have stuff that mounts a directory from the repository directory as a volume in a Docker container (e.g. for processing data), you may end up with the Docker container frying permissions in the repo folder (e.g. 0:0 owned files). Now, you <i>can</i> put a cleanup step as part of the CI (=docker run --rm -v $(pwd):&#x2F;mnt sh -c &#x27;chown -R $runner_uid:$runner_gid)... but unfortunately, Gitlab does not allow a &quot;finally&quot; step that always gets run, so in case the processing fails, the build gets aborted, the server hosting the runner crashes, ... anything happens, the permissions will be fried, and a sysadmin will need to manually intervene.<p>An ephemeral runner using docker:dind however? It simply gets removed.')
