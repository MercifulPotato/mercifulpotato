If you just skip past that entire discussion you may think that there is this nefarious worldview of &quot;injecting bias&quot; but that requires a false or at least simplified premise to begin with.<p>There is a lot of just-world fallacies behind this sort of thinking. The same that leads to suggest that if &quot;X started a business and made a lot of money&quot; X must be by-definition hard working or talented etc. ignoring aspects of generational wealth, opportunities, fallback options if they failed, etc.')
