Finishing up college remotely and starting full-time work without meeting anyone in person has been an odd experience--not to mention political news, social injustice, and climate change looming over all our heads or affecting our lives directly.<p>Here are a few things that have helped me:<p>1) I try to remember that I don&#x27;t have control over (most) external events, but I do control how I react to them.<p>2) Having a daily routine is good, but change up that daily routine--introduce some randomness--so the days don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re flying by.<p>3) Find something to commit to, like a mindfulness practice or workout routine. Walking or running daily can be a great way to bookend your work day and decompress. I know some folks who use walks as a &quot;virtual commute&quot; at the beginning and end of the work day.')
