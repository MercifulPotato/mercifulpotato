It doesn&#x27;t seem coherent to order two NULLs, so that would always be false.  I&#x27;m not attached to the syntax, which is intended to be illustrative.<p>The most important of such operators would be<p><pre><code>   WHERE col1 ?= col2\n</code></pre>\nwhich coerces two NULLs to be equivalent. It says &quot;yes NULLs aren&#x27;t comparable, but for this query, I want to treat them as equal&quot;.  Because that is only usually true, not invariably so.')
