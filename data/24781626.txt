You can kind of tell from some of the photos (but the video makes it more obvious) that these aren&#x27;t using the pierced hole of the model&#x27;s ear. They&#x27;re sitting on the ear canal opening. The video also shows some of the interaction similar to an airpod tap.<p>edit: Yea, I assumed wrong as several commenters pointed out.')
