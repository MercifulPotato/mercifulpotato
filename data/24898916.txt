In fact, when I used Clojure a decade ago, there was an Emacs command that would expand the macro invocation under your cursor, so you could see what code was actually being generated.<p>Exactly. On common lisp, for example, it&#x27;s just a keypress, and it has a &quot;macro stepper&quot; so it shows the first expansion possible, then the second expansion, and so on and so on... until you end up with compiler primitives!')
