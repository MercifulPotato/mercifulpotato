I&#x27;m not saying power every appliance, just have both DC and AC circuits in the home. DC circuit would power &quot;DC native&quot; things like LED lighting and computing devices, while AC would power &quot;AC native&quot; things like motors. By using AC everywhere we have to bundle AC&#x2F;DC converters for <i>every</i> lightbulb in the house, and in my experience those converters are prone to failure <i>way</i> before the LEDs themselves.')
