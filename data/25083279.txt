Decided to try doordash because I had a $5 coupon in the mail + free delivery on the first order. I was suspicious of pricing so decided to check what the total would be for same order through restaurants site. All of the item prices were inflated on doordash. The $5 coupon + free delivery brought the total down to about the same price if I ordered directly from the restaurant.<p>I don&#x27;t like that they inflate prices and will not order directly from them because of it. They should be transparent about how much their service costs rather than hiding the true cost of their service in the item prices. I feel like it&#x27;s likely their fault and not the restaurants since it seems like every restaurant has inflated doordash prices. My only theory is that they may be charging the business service fees in addition to the service&#x2F;delivery fees they charge the customer.<p>They do white label delivery for a fast food restaurant I order from. I&#x27;ve had it take 2 hours to deliver multiple times and even had one order get cancelled by doordash after they couldn&#x27;t get anyone to pick up the order. Most of that delivery time is made up of it switching between multiple people who they expect to pick up my order. Once someone actually picks up my order it only takes about 5 minutes to get to me.')
