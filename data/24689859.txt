If I only store the first date of each pair, I can never accidentally have an overlap or gap.  But if my code has a logic error that incorrectly calculates a range, being able to represent it could throw an error.  If that code error translates to an incorrect break-point instead, I haven&#x27;t prevented a bug, I&#x27;ve hidden it.')
