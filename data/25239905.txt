For instance, in the language that CS majors use the phrase &quot;Kolmogorov Complexity&quot; is sufficient to encode the concept of KC itself. And in the context of that language plus the concept of KC and adding in this entire thread, the letters KC themselves encode Kolmogorov Complexity in entirety.<p>So the &#x27;real world&#x27; version isn&#x27;t so easy to tell in absolute terms like that because the languages can differ. But if you were thinking of it like a compressor&#x2F;decompressor pair, then moving things into the language is like moving things into the compressor&#x2F;decompressor.<p>Naturally then you conclude that the &quot;human complexity&quot; depends greatly on the humans since any pair of humans creates a new universal description language that we can see as some base language plus the jargon that they are both familiar with.')
