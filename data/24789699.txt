At first, you fall down with mostly constant gravity acting on your entire body.<p>But there is some distance between your head and foot, so your foot&#x27;s gravity calculation begins to yield higher forces than your head as you get closer to the singularity.<p>As this effect plays out, you get elongated, and the distance from head-to-toe increases even more, magnifying the effect, which in turn magnifies the effect more and more until you&#x27;re spaghettified.<p>&gt; We are talking about forces stronger than strong nuclear force, but somehow affecting body locally.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be a black hole if it didn&#x27;t outmuscle whatever gets close enough.')
