However, I think the Gemini fits in that very awkward space where the keyboard is too small to touch type on, yet too big to use in handheld mode.  I much prefer the slide out keyboard on the Nokia N810 (but still wouldn&#x27;t be able to &quot;code&quot; on it).<p>The best micro keyboard I&#x27;ve ever typed on is an Apple Newton keyboard that I interfaced with a Palm Pilot.  The key spacing is 90% of a regular keyboard, which is about the smallest I can go and still touch type.  I really wish I had a modern day portable device with this keyboard form factor.')
