I remember some noise about exoplanets during my teenage years - there was a Polish astronomer[0] involved in the first discovery. But I thought to myself, surely everyone expected this to happen? I was later surprised to discover that even in the 90s, people seriously believed there were no extrasolar planets.<p>(Perhaps theirs was the more scientific position, and I was just a nerd biased by science fiction stories. But then, I was taught the Sun was just another star, and if God wanted our solar system to be special, surely He wouldn&#x27;t need to create more planets than just the Earth? I guess I had some intuition for Occam&#x27;s razor before I knew it by name...)<p>I only got a more complete picture of the timeline of discoveries much later in life, from this video[1].<p>(EDIT: it seems that the first discovery was in 1992, when I was single-digit years old, so the noise I remember about Wolszczan must have been about the other discovery in 2007.)<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aleksander_Wolszczan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aleksander_Wolszczan</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gai8dMA19Sw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gai8dMA19Sw</a>')
