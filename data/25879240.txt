It isn&#x27;t obvious how organised they were organised since they lacked guns and riots sometimes start spontaneously from protests. AWS didn&#x27;t have time to work out who they were, what they were trying to achieve, how they were organising, what there motivations were or what was going to happen next. Using that as a trigger to ban Parler - when they could easily have been organising on Facebook or in person - would be strong evidence of political bias.<p>&gt; Businesses aren&#x27;t courts that need to prove guilt.<p>I don&#x27;t mind if AWS is biased, but part of the fun of kibitzing is assessing whether decisions are good or bad. AWS making decisions on bias rather than rational thought process would be bad. People who use evidence and can think in a consistent manner have a big advantage.<p>Twitter made the mistake of trying to rationalise their bias, giving us a memorial of them trying to rationalise &quot;To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.&quot; as a call to violence. It is a legitimate concern that the same sort of evidence-free thinking could take root in AWS&#x27;s leadership - they might easily be drawing their leadership from similar pools of people to Twitter since the big tech companies are acting in the same direction at the same time.')
