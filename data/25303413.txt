While I believe that mail should always be an option, ease of access is something that I think is over-valued when it comes to government.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t appreciate convenience. Convenience and a broad range of availability are good things. But at the same time, I don&#x27;t hold the belief that government owes us convenience.<p>So with that said, and excepting arguments of convenience of availability of internet, I think it&#x27;s hard to make the case that someone may be excluded just because they don&#x27;t have internet. Used to be some people had to ride half a day on a horse to conduct some government business. To me, that is the baseline, and anything beyond that is a privileged blessing, NOT a necessity.<p>I know this is a very unpopular opinion.')
