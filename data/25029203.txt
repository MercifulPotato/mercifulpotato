If truly ancient societies did have women hunting big game, and more recent hunter-gatherer societies pretty much exclusively do not, that would point strongly in the direction of something bad happening when you have the child-bearing half of your small population hunting big game.  Probably NOT the conclusion the researchers were looking for.<p>Regardless of which, a better conclusion would have been &quot;Early big-game hunters of the Americas were not exclusively male&quot;, which is not what the headline says (although it may be what the researchers meant, rather than the reporter).')
