For example, if you&#x27;re afraid something you post on HN might cause an oppressive regime to come after you, securing your phone, or for that matter your laptop or desktop, isn&#x27;t going to help you at all. Same goes for pretty much any place people say things on the Internet. Unless you never say anything except in a private, locked chat room secured by unbreakable encryption, and never send any email to anyone without using PGP and without being certain that <i>they</i> are also taking the same precautions you are, anything you say on the Internet is out there for the finding if anyone gets interested enough in you to look.')
