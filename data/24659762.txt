There are at the margins different classes, like the owner class, the landlord class and the destitute class, but those account altogether for less than 10% of society, and actually see a lot of class mobility.<p>So while people tend not to marry in such a way that their income will be drastically reduced, it&#x27;s not really fair to say that outclass marriage is rare, because it generally isn&#x27;t, and because western societies are fully proletarized and dominated by the working class, which is actually a good thing in many ways.')
