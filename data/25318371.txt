Do you not believe that she stipulated that she&#x27;d resign under certain conditions? Do you not believe those conditions then came to exist? Do you not believe that her managers accepted her resignation?<p>I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion in the matter (and have no connection to Google), but if she in fact unambiguously offered her resignation conditioned on her paper not being approved to publish and Google accepted her offer, I don&#x27;t see how she can turn around and claim she was fired.')
