Considering the ICANN board rejected the sale April 30[1], two weeks after the letter, I suspect the AG&#x27;s office is no longer looking into the matter. Because the sale was never completed, and everything else seems to be business as usual, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything for the AG to continue looking into. The AG&#x27;s job is to make sure charitable trusts adhere to their purpose, not to police potential impropriety that doesn&#x27;t materially effect the trust. (They basically play the role of a shareholder, who in regular corporations can sue if the corporation doesn&#x27;t adhere to the articles of incorporation; or the role of a beneficiary in a regular trust, who can sue if the trustee misappropriates the assets.) I&#x27;m also not sure if there&#x27;s any criminal exposure here. Usually self-dealing is a civil matter, even for charitable trusts, unless it involves some other criminal act--e.g. fraud, but in this case nobody really thinks the board was being duped by the former ICANN CEO. If there was potential criminality then probably the AG wasn&#x27;t confident it could make a case beyond a reasonable doubt without an actual sale and evidence about how .org would have been administered in fact.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icann.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;board-material&#x2F;resolutions-2020-04-30-en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icann.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;board-material&#x2F;resolutions-2...</a>.
