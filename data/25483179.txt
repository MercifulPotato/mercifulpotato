Item(by='BearOso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608429681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482264, text='&gt; Apple will have 16 high-performance core variants of the M1 soon<p>I doubt that’s coming soon. The M1 is a HUGE chip. The decoders and pipelines take up a massive amount of space, and the L2 cache is apparently unwieldy, too. They’ve focused on making a limited number of cores perform very well, but there isn’t enough room. They need another die shrink to add any more.<p>I think the upcoming pro hardware will just be tweaks to the current formula.')
