Rather than saying &quot;we disagree on what should be considered free speech&quot;, you describe the people who disagree with you as confused and ignorant, who need to be educated with more debate.<p>I have news for you: people can have different ideas about what should be within the limits of free speech and what should not. In fact, different countries have entirely different laws regarding what is protected as free speech and what is not.<p>Let&#x27;s consider the harassment example that you brought up: in principle I agree with you that people should not be allowed to harass each other. However, when you can quell unwanted speech by labeling it &quot;harassment&quot;, you create an incentive for people to label more and more speech as harassment. We see this issue in practice all the time. In many places, stating facts such as &quot;men and women have biological differences&quot; is now considered harassment and can lead to losing your job.')
