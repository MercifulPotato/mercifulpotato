Such a description also makes it very hard to recommend Signal to lay people because they donâ€™t know or care much about security but do want convenience. If Signal is meant to be for a small echo chamber group to use, this is fine. If not, the convenience aspect cannot, and should not, be ignored to increase adoption.')
