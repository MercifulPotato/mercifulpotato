Item(by='627467', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607030284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290787, text='for some reason, on my last long haul flight on a 250+ people airplane I counted at least 20 cats and dogs being boarded (in cabin, not hold). Only one of them was classed as a service dog. I was hoping for the worst as I never seem so many animals on a flight before but in the end the flight was almost uneventful. BUT... in the middle of the night, a cat did wandered about the isles, and the stewardess did have to go catch it and look for the owner who clearly didn&#x27;t mind a wandering cat.<p>If this trend continues (of loose animals in cabin) I bet we&#x27;ll start having serious problems between pets and people inside an enclosed metal tube. Flying experience is already bad enough...')
