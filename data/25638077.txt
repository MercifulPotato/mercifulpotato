First he cited the high upfront cost to buy the machines (Usually meaning you need to be a big hospital). The second fact was a bit more interesting, which is that doing one expensive test (Genome sequencing) which then your health care provider could do cheap queries against (&quot;Which other users have your symptoms and similar mutations in key genes&quot; for example) does not align with the current billing model.<p>I think that&#x27;s the &quot;What&#x27;s next&quot;.  Finding a way to effectively bring genomic care to the general population, to allow for better research into genetic conditions.  If you&#x27;re interested in how &quot;big&quot; this can be, here&#x27;s a case where &quot;This American Life&quot; covered how just a few genetic differences was the difference between an olympic athlete and a muscular dystrophy patient [2].<p>There&#x27;s also the bio-terrorism and pandemic response angle, which is why the DoD is investing in third-generation sequencing systems where portability has finally become more of a priority.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Knome" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Knome</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;bio-eats-world-podcast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;bio-eats-world-podcast&#x2F;</a> (About 13 minutes in)\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;muscular-dystrophy-patient-olympic-medalist-same-genetic-mutation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;muscular-dystrophy-patien...</a>')
