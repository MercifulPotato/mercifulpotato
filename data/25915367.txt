Probably even more for specialized electronics requiring academic knowledge.<p>It doesn’t behoove me to care about repairing any electronic worth less than $5k probably.  Any decent brand lasts so long and the ratio of probability of failure to cost to replace is so low that it’s just not worth it.<p>When something breaks, the decision is to spend $x to fix versus $x+$y to buy new.  I’m not buying electronics to last more than 10 years, the protocols and everything are going to change anyway.  I might as well buy new and get an update rather than fix old and be stuck with old tech.<p>High value purchases on the other hand make sense, since a few thousand dollar fix for a $30k to $50k car might be worth it compared to buying another $30k to $50k car.')
