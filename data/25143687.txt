This reads like an assumption that the article is about tech companies in the United States and their effects to combat election misinformation.  It&#x27;s not.<p>The part about the United States says this:<p>&gt; While the United States saw a small uptick in blocking, mostly driven by individual companies or internet service providers filtering content, the study did not uncover widespread censorship.<p>And you say:<p>&gt; Now that anybody can reach anyone with any information, bad actors use these techniques to control people to their advantage. Governments&#x27; are now in an awkward position - ramp up education in these areas and forever give up a tool that worked for ages, or censor the information in hope that bad actors will not influence the public.<p>The first major heading in the article is this:<p>&gt; Poland blocked human rights sites; India same-sex dating sites<p>Not exactly the same thing as individual companies trying to combat misinformation.  Even if those things could be twisted as good faith efforts, how would this help make politics more honest?<p>Having a conversation about the United States is fine, I suppose, but I&#x27;d much rather understand how actual governments are censoring things around the world.  It&#x27;s at least what the article is mostly about.  If nothing else, it&#x27;d be nice for discussions here to actually have some relation to the article rather than being something people quickly upvote and jump in to espouse whatever preconceived opinion they had.')
