On hindsight we can say we should have bet on Pfizer and Moderna, and screwed the rest - such a bet would have allowed them to increase their supply even faster.  However that is hindsight, at the time we didn&#x27;t have any reason to believe their vaccine would even work at all - while the ones we are waiting on we had good reason to believe would work.  That some of the ones we are waiting on seem to be much worse is a shock to everyone.  Even this much worse is a qualified - they are doing within the expected range, it is just that mRNA is doing so well that makes them bad.')
