And for non-violent offenses I&#x27;d probably also be on board.<p>But this person committed a &quot;serious, violent crime&quot; that sent them to prison for 13 years. Are you comfortable sitting next to someone who is capable of a &quot;serious, violent crime&quot;? Are there certain crimes that cross the line for you? Would you expect your employer to inform you of their record?<p>Edit: Just want to remind people, 13 years could very well mean that they murdered someone. Context around the charge is key, and no one seems to be acknowledging that.')
