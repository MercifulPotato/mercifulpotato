You have a video of ballot counters counting ballots. That&#x27;s not incriminating in any way.<p>Anyone who is dissatisfied with this election should logically be dissatisfied with <i>every</i> election, so should pick their battles wisely and attempt to fix the system such that their concerns are possible to alleviate. Raising concerns with this election in particular makes it seem as if this election was in any way exceptional, which except for the candidates, it was not. It&#x27;s equally concerning whether the 2016 election was legitimate. Or 2012. Or 2008. Or...<p>There is absolutely no tracability on ballots, by <i>design</i>, at this stage. There is no way to prove who voted for whom, due to abuses of this knowledge in the past. There is no proof that can be provided at this point that the election was &quot;legitimate&quot;, whatever standard of proof that requires. To provide such proof would require a change to the entire electoral system, and absolutely cannot be done retroactively.')
