Take your pick:<p>- Impeaching Trump and attempting to remove him from office after the Ukraine call (which Trump supporters believe to be perfectly normal presidential behavior, and Trump opponents believe was naked corruption tantamount to solicitation of a bribe)<p>- The recent insurrection in the American capitol to prevent the certification of Biden as the next President (which Trump opponents believe to be the result of a legitimate process, and Trump supporters believe to be an entirely fabricated victory)<p>I happen think the former was a fully warranted reaction to a real (if ineffective) attempt to undermine American democracy, and the latter a reckless and contemptible reaction to nothing.  It&#x27;s irrelevant to my point, though:  if you can look at either of those and say there&#x27;s nothing there, then the other side is completely capable of reacting to nothing.')
