I wasn&#x27;t a senior engineer but I was doing the same type of work as the seniors on my team. And I felt like my role could have more ownership. They did have team leads, a few architects, and agile related roles. But there wasn&#x27;t much else for devs who didn&#x27;t want to be managers.<p>My current company in the bay area is a lot better. I feel like I have more ownership, and the IC roles are more granular. I think technically senior can be terminal, and staff&#x2F;principal roles here require influencing other teams. But my company has thought about promoting ICs, and I clearly see how staff&#x2F;principals have a more challenging job.')
