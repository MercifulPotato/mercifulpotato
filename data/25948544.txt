That said, on matters such as these, I think we&#x27;ve entered an era where the government of China does not care about the Western viewpoint. They see a potential threat to their economy, and they deal with it their own way. That&#x27;s not good or bad, it&#x27;s the reality of the more multi-polar era we&#x27;re entering.<p>How do we operate in this era? That&#x27;s up to really smart people in the bowels of Western capitols.
