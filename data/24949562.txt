It iMac needs the sound to be split but Safari is not allowing it. So they recommend Chrome and changing it’s settings. Then setting up aggregate device. But it is not working. The only way it is working is if the sound is also coming out from the speakers and the microphone is picking it up. Too complicated, there is a feedback and no streaming to the hearing aids. So Zoom + Otter is out of the picture. Teams has the captioning and the best quality. What happens is a lot of companies are demanding in using only Zoom. This is a misters why they just don’t use the link of the Teams invite. If they don’t have it installed it is working from the browser too.')
