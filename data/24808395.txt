Use Mac or Linux.<p>Are you the person in charge of this at msft or something? Because frankly I can&#x27;t see a way to say that with a straight face. &quot;let your computer tell you what to do or use an OS that is inferior because the competition paid literally millions of dollars and abused extreme nepotism to make it that way&quot;<p>Trust me, I&#x27;d love to use Linux. But it sucks, because billg and the other founding Microsoft members went out of their way to make it that way.<p>E: I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m getting down voted for this, it&#x27;s a documented thing that really happened. Here&#x27;s one example of one (of the many) times that it happed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-bill-gates-mother-influenced-the-success-of-microsoft.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-bill-gates-mother-influe...</a><p>Another example would be the fake error messages they put out on computers that ran DRDos instead of their own DOS <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DR-DOS#DR_DOS_6.0_&#x2F;_Competition_from_Microsoft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DR-DOS#DR_DOS_6.0_&#x2F;_Competitio...</a><p>&gt;In December 1991, a pre-release version of Windows 3.1 was found to return a non-fatal error message if it detected a non-Microsoft DOS.[7] ... It was a simple matter for Digital Research to patch DR DOS 6.0 to circumvent the AARD code &#x27;authenticity check&#x27; in the Windows 3.1 beta by rearranging the order of two internal tables in memory (with no changes in functionality) ... With the detection code disabled, Windows ran perfectly under DR DOS and its successor Novell DOS. The code was present but disabled in the released version of Windows 3.1.[23]<p>You might not remember it if you weren&#x27;t alive 20 years ago but microsoft played <i>dirty</i> to get to the market position they are in today. FOSS had no hope, and acting like people should just forget this and use crippled software instead is unfair.')
