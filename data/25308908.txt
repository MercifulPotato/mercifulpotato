Item(by='aylmao', descendants=None, kids=[25309566], score=None, time=1607119957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308023, text='&gt; If i were a shareholder i can see how i may have questioned why a person being paid $1M+&#x2F;year (my understanding this is minimum what a manager in AI at Google would be making) for publicly disparaging Google.<p>Salary aside (because I do doubt she earned $1M+&#x2F;year, my guess is probably more on the ballpark of $300k~$500k and either way not really denting Google&#x27;s finances), you are not wrong, but also it&#x27;s worth understanding here we&#x27;re entering the realm of the notion that companies can (and for many reasons should) be about more than maximizing shareholder value.<p>Also, if I&#x27;m being completely honest, from a PR perspective this could be worse than Timnit&#x27;s paper might&#x27;ve been just given how public it has become and the people involved. People internally are perhaps more comfortable having that paper not be published and not having Timnit in their ranks, but as far as PR for Google goes this isn&#x27;t great.')
