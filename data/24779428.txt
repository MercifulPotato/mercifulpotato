So the season 5 we got ended up being a bit weak and wandering, with only the last few episodes (which were part of what would have been the ending of season 4, if he hadn&#x27;t found out in time that there would be a season 5) having the same strength and memorability as the season 4 episodes.<p>All of season 5 was in the original plan as the side-stories for seasons 4 and 5, not written after the series was renewed.  That&#x27;s mainly why the filmed season 4 was so action-packed - the main plot wasn&#x27;t really compressed in terms of screen time, instead there were no side plots.<p>Aside from that, the finale, <i>Sleeping in Light</i>, was filmed during season 4, that&#x27;s why Claudia Christian was in it.  They found out about the renewal just barely in time to use some season 5 budget to film <i>The Deconstruction of Falling Stars</i>, which  only then became the season 4 finale.  I think that was really the only thing not in the original plan.')
