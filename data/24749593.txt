The fact that there are <i>only</i> 225k lines of assembly in the Linux kernel, across the 30 or so major architecture families Linux supports plus any number of variations within each family, is rather impressive. If you ported DOS 2.0 to one variant of each of those 30 architectures, assuming roughly equal code density, that would be over a million lines of assembly code altogether, for a far, far less capable system. That&#x27;s considering only the OS core, not device drivers, which is reasonable since DOS 2.0 didn&#x27;t really have any drivers worth speaking of by modern standards. Most of the real low-level I&#x2F;O was handled by the BIOS.')
