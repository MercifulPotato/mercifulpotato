What is that supposed to mean? Filecoin is just a medium of exchange for people buying and selling storage services. Filecoin does not offer anything specific and its platform has to compete with plenty of mature, efficient alternatives.<p>&gt; the value of the coin is driven by the interest in the tech it provides.<p>What &quot;tech&quot; does it provide? Not IPFS, for sure, that already was under development and could have come to fruition as a regular open source project. A decentralized market for storage, &quot;proof-of-spacetime&quot;? These might be interesting. But again, if we want to fund these things there are surely better&#x2F;cheaper ways to do it. $250 million is a lot of money for the tech that was developed so far.<p>More importantly: there is nothing about the &quot;tech&quot; that requires $FIL to make it work. The market dynamics will be the same whether they used FIL, DAI, ETH, wrapped BTC or even a dollar-pegged token they decided to issue. People are not going to pay more or less for their storage because the price of the token went up or down.<p>&gt; Currently at $22, not bad for a random coin.<p>These are the kind of statements that almost make me side with the buttcoiners. At this point, with all the speculation, market manipulation and naive FOMO &quot;investing&quot;, there is no useful information to be had from the price of the token.')
