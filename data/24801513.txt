Like anything else, find a niche somewhere (possibly related to performance&#x2F;memory for clients not using React) and serve it with a modest upsell. But it&#x27;s an enormous market, with entrenched competitors who don&#x27;t need to make a profit on their offerings, so expect fierce competition all the way.')
