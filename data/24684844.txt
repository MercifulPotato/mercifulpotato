BigCo has a lot more to lose compared to SmallCo.<p>SmallCo has little or no profit and little revenue so BigCo gets no money from them for patent infringement. BigCo has a bunch of money. If SmallCo has good patents BigCo will go away or make SmallCo a deal to avoid millions of dollars in damages or license fees BigCo would owe SmallCo for infringement.<p>IP litigators will take such cases on contingency.<p>If you don&#x27;t have good IP you are a commodity.')
