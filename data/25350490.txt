Thanks for the thoughtful reply. :-)<p>&gt; <i>That said and if I read you correctly, the backend must be some sort of a dumb relay that just routes blobs of data between clients based on how they are grouped. Correct?</i><p>You&#x27;re correct. It is just a dumb relay. That&#x27;s the reason why it&#x27;s so difficult (impossible?) to come up with a freemium monetization strategy. The server can&#x27;t see the contents of your communications, so it can&#x27;t restrict functionality.<p>&gt; <i>If so, then nothing restricts you from relaying any type of data, which is a fantastic foundation to have.</i><p>I suppose so. What did you have in mind?<p>&gt; <i>Do you have any details on how two clients would establish trust, exchange keys, if there&#x27;s a replay protection, etc.? It would make for a good read.</i><p>I don&#x27;t have anything written up about this (other than the code in the repositories), but if there&#x27;s interest, I could compose a blog post about it. For the time being, users can verify the privacy of the communication with another friend by comparing the safety number of the friendship (tap the friend&#x27;s avatar on the map, in the info panel that pops up click the triple dots at the top right, then select &#x27;View safety number&#x27;). If you&#x27;re safety numbers match, you know your share with that friend is secure. I got the idea from Signal messenger.<p>&gt; <i>PS. One thing I&#x27;d change is the name.</i><p>Yeah, I&#x27;m still reconsidering the name. I&#x27;ve already changed the company name once, but I may have to change it again. It&#x27;s just hard to come up with an easy to remember+spell name that also has an available domain.')
