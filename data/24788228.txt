When I&#x27;ve reported issues, I&#x27;ve been told &quot;That&#x27;s not an issue, just do your plan&#x2F;apply manually in two steps&quot; which is pretty contrary to what you should need to do with Terraform. So many providers github repos have it set to automatically shut down an issue if no one commented on it for 30 days, which means a lot of things that are unaddressed get swept under rugs.')
