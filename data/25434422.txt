It&#x27;s personally identifiable information and tracking it requires consent.<p>Private investigators - not sure how legal that is around here and what are the constraints.<p>Example - for a job application I recently needed a background check by a US company. As soon as I filled out my current location as a European country, a consent form popped up. They can&#x27;t go sniffing around even in the public records and compile stacks of background info on people at the scale a company does this.<p>Lots of things are public outdoors only with the common sense understanding that it&#x27;s ephemeral, is just remembered by people&#x27;s imperfect memory and won&#x27;t be meticulously categorized and stored somewhere, unless there is consent. Now, you can make small scale notes and a personal journal about whom you got to know at a party etc. You can take tourist shots and have random people in the pictures but you can&#x27;t follow people around and photograph them specifically as the main subject of the photo without their consent. Public figures and officials like the police don&#x27;t have such privacy rights on duty.<p>It&#x27;s about the scale of it, and common sense judgment of whether it systematic data collection or something just happening normally as life goes on. But I&#x27;m not a lawyer, I&#x27;m just describing the broad principle.<p>The law and people&#x27;s intuition may be different in the US.<p>----<p>If you don&#x27;t like this, think about another example: hitting&#x2F;patting your friend on the back as banter or congratulations or something. How strongly do I have to hit them to commit assault? What if it&#x27;s my frail grandma? Intent, scale and common sense matter. There is no law saying the exact amount of force I am allowed to apply.')
