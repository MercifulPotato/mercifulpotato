My partner and I decided to build a direct to consumer ecommerce brand due to some of the downtime we&#x27;ve had from our regular jobs.<p>Knowing the amazing community of growth hackers and tech people. It would mean a lot to us if we got some feedback on how we can improve and grow our business, especially on how we can grow with ad buying etc. Any critique is welcome and look forward to any comments.<p>Regards\nMert')
