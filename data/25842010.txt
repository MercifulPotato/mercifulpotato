Bringing their cellphones, recording video of themselves committing felonies and then posting them online.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as simple as &quot;these people were idiots because they recorded themselves committing a crime&quot;, to paraphrase this line of thinking. I&#x27;m pretty sure these people convinced themselves, and each other, that they were breaking the law to save the country.
