You have to go on some shady websites to get to that kind of content and I&#x27;m sure even there some censorship happens so the admins are not legally liable for content.<p>How about text? Highly classified government information and informant data can put peoples&#x27; lives at risk so some text must be &quot;moderated&quot;.')
