Control plane problems - these will manifest as latency or errors when calling the IAM service itself to make updates&#x2F;additions&#x2F;deletions of users&#x2F;roles&#x2F;policies&#x2F;groups&#x2F;etc. This is the most likely scenario if the dashboard names &quot;IAM&quot; specifically as the issue.<p>2. Propagation problems - problems with propagation will manifest as delays in seeing your control plane (IAM) actions reflected in the dataplane. For example, if you remove a user, but the user is still able to authenticate to AWS services for a lengthy period of time.<p>3. Dataplane problems - this will be problems with authentication or authorization to any and all AWS services. A widespread problem with authentication is less likely, but extremely bad, and will probably not be categorized in the dashboard as a problem only with IAM, since &quot;IAM&quot; is technically the name of the control plane.')
