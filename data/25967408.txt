White is white and black is black but you&#x27;ll get more color precision in between.  Gradients will have less color banding because of less rounding and color aliasing.<p>Its a bit different because of some of the intricacies of how the new formats are represented.  The range is indeed dynamic and that can be exploited to get more precision in a smaller range.<p>However, calling it HDR is (imo almost purposfully) confusing because of HDR photography which has a lot of other concepts as well as hardware vendors promising the moon.<p>TV vendors also like to conflate it with brightness or accuracy which are goals for any TV, HDR or not.  Brighter whites and blacker blacks is what you are promised but I think its better to think of it as less crushing (greys getting rounded to white and black).')
