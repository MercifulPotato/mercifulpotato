The &quot;autopilot&quot; is used for driving on highways and mostly uses radar for obstacle avoidance. It works great with handling traffic, that is cars moving around, but not for static obstactles. The problem is the low spatial resolution of the radar, so nonmoving obstacles are difficult to distinguish from the background reflections.<p>&quot;FSD&quot; is creating a 3d-model of the environment based on the camera image. But so far it is only active outside of highways. This should be much better at avoiding static obstacles. In any case, they are different systems so experiences with one cannot always be transferred to the other.')
