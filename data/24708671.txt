This usually manifests as disabling either whole cores, or substantial portions of last level cache memory.<p>Features like HyperThreading or IOMMU are integral to the design of functional units that aren&#x27;t optional. Those features aren&#x27;t implemented as separate physical regions of silicon that take up non-trivial space, so it&#x27;s very unlikely that a defect could break HyperThreading without breaking the entire CPU core, or that a defect could break IOMMU functionality without breaking the entire PCIe root complex. Disabling features like this does not meaningfully change the fraction of dies that pass quality control.<p>The IOMMU in particular is probably not going to be affected by overclocking, because it&#x27;s probably in the same clock domain as the rest of the PCIe IO stuff, and that clock domain doesn&#x27;t usually get overclocked when the CPU or DRAM is overclocked. So there&#x27;s no reason to expect IOMMU functionality to affect what CPU clock speed a given die can reach.')
