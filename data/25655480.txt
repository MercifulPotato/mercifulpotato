(...)<p>...and then you proceed by suggesting ID code generation methods that replicate UUIDs.<p>It sounds like you are trying to criticize UUIDs while being totally unaware of what UUIDs are.<p>I mean, UUIDs are nothing more than integers that are generated following one of half a dozen different methods so that they can be probably unique without relying on a central authority.<p>One of the UUID versions is a pure random number. Another is a MAC address concatenated with a timestamp complemented with a local counter. There are literally two UUID methods that consist of hashing data.<p>Your supposed solutions to the alleged problem posed by UUIDs is a reinvention of what UUIDs have always been. But UUIDs have been though through and are standard and ubiquitous.')
