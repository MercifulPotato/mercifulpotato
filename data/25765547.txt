It&#x27;s a bit slower than Linux, a bit too many moving things by default and I definitely prefer the env vars and config files over registry and control panel. But. I didn&#x27;t use WSL or WSL2. I just had nushell and Microsoft&#x27;s terminal app, with winget and all that. Some keyboard shortcuts and multiple desktops enabled, writing Rust software with emacs, firefox and a good terminal was not bad at all. I would not dislike working more in there, but in the end find Arch Linux to be the end game OS for me, so keeping the installation just when I need to debug some Windows issues.')
