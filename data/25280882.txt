They only care that they <i>think</i> it’s possible. Judges aren’t programmers and the law isn’t black and white like code.<p>Also, you can’t just <i>not</i> respond to a deposition or refuse to hand over your phone as evidence in a crime. That’s obstruction of justice and possibly contempt of court.<p>Basically, you can sit there for hours on end explaining that it’s impossible to break the “wall”, but that’s time and time in money in the court system (literally), or you can just fork over the phone because it’s not your personal one.')
