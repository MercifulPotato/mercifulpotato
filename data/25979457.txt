Kudos to you and the teams for the great job at managing this challenge (that never should have been created by Google in the first place)!!  I&#x27;ve been a fanboy of matrix since the beginning (both the protocol and the teams building it), and it is behavior like yours and the related teams (incljuding all contributors!) that keep me as a fanboy for both the protocol stack and the software.  Keep on truckin&#x27;!!! :-)')
