Nothing is a ticket. I regularly see drivers going 20 MPH the speed limit in the bike lane passing or even into on coming traffic forcing people off the road, all without plates. I don’t think I’ve seen a car pulled over on city streets in my life. It’s just normal for cars to run red lights and stop signs, to veer drunkenly all over the road, and to go 50 in a 30, and to shout slurs and spit on pedestrians.')
