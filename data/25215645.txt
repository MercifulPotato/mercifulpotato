I think the money trickles up exactly the way you described, and I agree that government programs should be paid for by taxation instead of money printing--but what can be taxed to make up the multi-trillion dollar difference?<p>You either pay for it up front via taxation or later via inflation (increase in money supply). You are focused on increasing revenue but why not exercise some restraint and, oh I dunno, cut back on the ridiculous military overspending that doesnâ€™t improve quality of life for the people paying the taxes?')
