It&#x27;s fiddlier than buying through the integrated Amazon store, but it&#x27;s a fully supported way of using your Amazon device.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of them blocking sellers from listing books on Amazon and also at a lower price elsewhere (though it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they did), and they certainly don&#x27;t block sellers from telling their customers how much Amazon&#x27;s cut is.')
