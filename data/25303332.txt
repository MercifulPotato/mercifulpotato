If they get sick on Monday you&#x27;re potentially forcing someone to choose between unpaid time off, burning a day of PTO, or going into the doctor&#x27;s office Wednesday or Thursday (if they&#x27;re lucky) and saying &quot;I feel find but had a cold Monday, can I get a note?&quot; And how to juggle the logistics of that Wed&#x2F;Thur doctor&#x27;s visit with work?<p>I feel like a &quot;sick day pool&quot; or sick days burning PTO is just a shitty way for companies to try to save 0.02% on payroll while simultaneously pissing off the few employees who get burned by the policy. I can honestly say if I had to use PTO for an unexpected illness and it either messed up a vacation or caused me to have some vacation be unpaid, I would leave no matter how happy I was otherwise.')
