I mostly go in, make notes on what looks bad, then fix it later, but the majority of the work isn&#x27;t writing code and sometimes even I have to look up the proper `case` statement syntax or something. I can imagine being nervous, going in to do FizzBuzz, and bombing it, even as someone who has coded since I was 14 (I am now much older). We need to stop worrying about coding expertise and start thinking about how a programmer visualizes and thinks about data and code flow, that&#x27;s the important part. Syntax can be forgotten, the semantics of programming are the important thing.')
