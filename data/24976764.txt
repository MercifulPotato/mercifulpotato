Well, they spend a lot of time working with these interfaces and thinking about it, so it makes some sense--the thought-energy needs to be expressed.<p>Anyway IDK if one can easily demonstrate that kind of deep specialist insight and also pay attention to how it makes them sound in relation to the author and the author&#x27;s gift to the world. It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in what your own perception is offering the world, and kind of steal the stage with what is likely to be perceived as a weirdly negative energy.')
