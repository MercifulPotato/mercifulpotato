PFS prevents an adv who obtains the keys from decoding previous messages -- even with access to your unlocked phone (and the long lived keys) they couldn&#x27;t obtain cleartext on any message you had deleted, even with the ciphertext. Also, having a plaintext message does not confirm it was a particular ciphertext.<p>But it really isn&#x27;t available to the software author to know how long we want to keep a message for. If I want I can set a disappearing message timer.')
