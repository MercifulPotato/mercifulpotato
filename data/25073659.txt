Given enough time I could probably implement a given benchmark in assembly, beating C# (and pretty much anything).<p>This is used to good effect in Go runtime and some really niche applications but in real life I don&#x27;t have infinite amount of time to micro-optimize my code and write parts of it in assembly.<p>What I want to know is the performance of competently written code.')
