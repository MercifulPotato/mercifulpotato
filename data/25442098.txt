The video starts with a good 3 second disclaimer about just this. Either way, I&#x27;ll bite.<p>It&#x27;s been shown that SARS-Cov2 is transmitted through the air[1], amongst other ways.<p>Visualizing the flow of one person&#x27;s breath you can identify the route that the breath takes. Generally, if the breath goes past or through a lot of fabric, the larger water droplets tend to stick to the fabric. The virus is usually carried in the air on tiny airborne water droplets. This means that if water droplets stick to the inside of the mask&#x27;s fabric, a lot of the viruses will as well, thus decreasing the spread. \nYou know a mask works because it feels a bit damp inside. That&#x27;s a sign of it doing the job.<p>A mask will not fully &quot;stop&quot; the spread. It helps to reduce the velocity of the air exiting your body, and captures a lot of the water vapor that carries the virus.<p>&gt; It seems like this is the year all science is done through videos and diagrams.<p>There is no better way to relay the information gathered through schlieren imaging than to just show the recording. That&#x27;s why its called &quot;imaging&quot;.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;26&#x2F;14857" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;26&#x2F;14857</a>')
