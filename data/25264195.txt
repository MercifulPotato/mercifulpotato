I&#x27;m sure you picked up that I&#x27;m pretty mad, but I&#x27;ll try to tone it down a little bit. I&#x27;m not an Amazon employee or someone who is personally harmed by this or anything, aside from being a developer for Apple&#x27;s platforms who occasionally looks around for CI services. I&#x27;m mostly arguing about the principle of the thing.<p>Anyways: I read your blog post back when it came out. Whether Apple took your input into account when making the EULA, I don&#x27;t know; I am sure that you must have some sort of amicable relationship at the very least. Running services &quot;on the border&quot; like this is never easy, but I would think that your business model (which includes buying a huge number of Macs) has probably kept Apple mostly on your side. I know the work you&#x27;ve done to keep it this way and to be honest, I was happy for you when Apple announced their rack-mountable Mac Pros and gave you a mention at the Mac Mini event.<p>The problem from my side (at least where you and MacStadium are involved) mostly lies with the blog post you wrote. Look, I get it, Apple&#x27;s changes make the EULA work for you. That&#x27;s great! But I&#x27;m sure you also realize that spelling this out clearly in the way that they did means that the &quot;gray area&quot; becomes a <i>black</i> area for basically everyone else. What I didn&#x27;t appreciate is you calling it a &quot;gray area&quot; and coming up with rationale for why what they want is not reasonable. Apple came in, almost certainly looked at your business specifically, made its rules to hurt developers and these companies, and now you&#x27;re writing blog posts about how Apple is your friend and you were right all along. It feels like you&#x27;ve decided to start singing praises for a bully that decided to leave you alone, and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<p>There&#x27;s still a huge hole for a service that lets you rent a Mac for the a couple minutes so you can build your Xcode project. It&#x27;s not your fault that doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s. But could you maybe not publicly celebrate that Apple has created a situation that happens to help you and make it generally worse for others? Can we stop trying to normalize or even argue that sharing a Mac is something wrong, something that Apple would think is ruining the &quot;performance experience&quot; you should get from a Mac?')
