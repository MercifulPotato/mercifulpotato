But to my knowledge, it&#x27;s difficult to bring all the accumulated backlog of email backups and unify them in one archive.<p>My imagined ideal solution is a tool that allows you to import all the different saved backups from old accounts, that will discover and deal with duplicates if you have overlapping backups, and which will allow you to query the archive to discover interesting patterns like volume of email sent&#x2F;recieved or time between receiving and replying.<p>Are there tools out there that could help to ingest and organize all that email history, and potentially remain in sync with current accounts moving forward?')
