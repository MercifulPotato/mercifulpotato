Large structures become corrupt over time and occasionally need to be demolished partially or fully because they stop serving their purpose but start serving their self-interest. Only an individual, not groups, as ultimate indivisible units is the last resort for all values that any civilisation is built on: starting from justice, democracy etc. Thus, e-2-e encryption empowers individuals (putting aside criminals that cane be considered as a necessary evil) that doesn&#x27;t make groups in power happy. So, by shifting the power from individuals to groups, the first loose an ability to use their intrinsic, built by billions of years of evolution, judgements what is good and what is now, to keep the system in check and press a red button when needed to destroy a government (like Nazi) that went out of control or a corporation.<p>2. Introducing these kind of anti-individualistic laws creates a bad example for already corrupted and authoritarian countries lie Russia, China and others, that would use this as an justifications to toughen already draconian laws to control their citizens. Once they do loose a good example of freedom that is meant to exist in western countries, they would become corrupted even more, causing not only troubles, but potentially military confrontations that would cost way more than those relatively small issues caused by criminals.<p>Even just this simple example shows that stepping aside from principles for the sake of expedience may create unforeseen consequences that left governments (because all governments in europe are large and trying to become even larger) don&#x27;t want to realise because of one simple reason: they have already transformed from serving their initial idea and purpose to being self-serving.')
