Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=[25259459], score=None, time=1606771744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258899, text='<i>&quot;We don&#x27;t know too much about the exact model they made but it looks sufficiently generalizable to be able to give a candidate protein structure for any given sequence. It doesn&#x27;t automatically cure cancer and inject the drug but that by itself is an amazing tool that if available to everyone will revolutionize biology experimentation.&quot;</i><p>They say on their own press-release page that side-chains are a future research problem, and nothing about their method description makes me believe they&#x27;ve innovated on all-atom modeling. This software seems able to generate good models of protein backbones; these kinds of models certainly have uses, but a backbone model is not enough for drug design.<p>This is certainly an advancement, but you&#x27;re exaggerating the scope of the accomplishment.<p><i>&quot; I only feel pity for the graduate students still trying to crystallize proteins in this day and age.&quot;</i><p>Nothing about this changes the fact that protein crystallography is a gold-standard method for determining a protein structure. CryoEM has made it possible to obtain good structures for classes of proteins we could never achieve before, and it&#x27;s certainly <i>interesting</i> if we can run a computer for a few days to get a 1Ã… ab initio model for a protein sequence, but we could <i>already</i> do that for a large class of proteins with homology modeling. These predicted structures still aren&#x27;t generally that useful for drug design, where tiny details of molecular interactions matter.<p>To put it in perspective: protein energetics are measured on the scale of <i>tens of kcal &#x2F; mol</i>. Protein-drug interactions are measured in <i>fractions of a kcal</i>. A single hydrogen bond or cation-pi interaction or displaced water molecule can make the difference between a drug candidate and an abandoned lead. Tiny changes in backbone position make the difference between a good structure and a bad one. Alphafold isn&#x27;t doing that kind of modeling.')
