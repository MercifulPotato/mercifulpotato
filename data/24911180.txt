I know I could be working on some kind of revenue-generating side project, or volunteering my time on a political campaign I believe in, or working to feed the homeless, but instead I play video games. Is that.. okay? Is it &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot;? I don&#x27;t know that I have a perfect answer.<p>I know this much: without <i>some</i> amount of leisure time, I&#x27;d go crazy, nor would I be much use in any of my &quot;productive&quot; capabilities; so clearly, there&#x27;s <i>an</i> amount of leisure time that is a net good for me. I think the question becomes: what is that amount?')
