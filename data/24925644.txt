I feel annoyed when tech changes because I spent time learning the old thing and I can&#x27;t get that time back. I think the core idea here is that with more demands on my time, I&#x27;ve become more choosy about how I spend it.<p>This study isn&#x27;t about that. They&#x27;ve found an area of the brain in mice that seems to be related to motivation to make decisions with complex cost benefit analysis. This type of decision making is impaired when under stress, by mental health diagnosis, or, according to the study, by an aged brain. If any conclusion is worth drawing here it&#x27;s the increased importance of mental health as we age.<p>This is not an argument for all of us to try to keep up with the shiny new language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;whirlwind.')
