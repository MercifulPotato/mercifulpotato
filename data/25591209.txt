Item(by='nemothekid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609408218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588376, text='&gt;<i>If society decides that everyone should have minimum standard of living despite their skill level or net contributions</i><p>There is a fallacy here where you assumed society operates in a certain manner but provided no evidence to support that. The idea that people&#x27;s standards of living is a directly a function of their skill level and not deeply influenced by other uncontrollable factors is a very contested and argued point of view. On the contrary, it&#x27;s clear to see that despite individual productivity sky rocketing over the last 40 years, wages have remained stagnant.<p>Even the framing of your question is odd - who is the &quot;society as a whole&quot; that bares that burden, when most people who make up society are working class? Rephrased you could have simply stated that the majority working poor shouldn&#x27;t cause undue burden on the aristocrats.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ll add that the <i>state</i> is already burdened in one way or another. Having a large amount of uninsured people due to corporations off loading their social contract creates a <i>public policy</i> problem. The state can&#x27;t have people dying in the street or spreading disease because the vast majority of them are underinsured - and to solve these problems the state then increases taxes on everyone just so a corporation or two and get away with the bare minimum.')
