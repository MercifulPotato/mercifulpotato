Their binaries are in-fact installed in read-only &#x2F;usr as shipped by apple, but the matching include files live in the Developer folder of either the command line developer tools or Xcode.<p>No open source package will be able to link to the system libraries by default with this split and when all they support is pkgconfig, you’re SOL without additional manual work')
