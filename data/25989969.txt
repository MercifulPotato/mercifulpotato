Even today, horses are profoundly dangerous.  Go to any hospital warn dealing with neck injuries.  Young men fall off motorcycles, and so are generally a little older (16+).  Young girls break their necks falling off horses.  That particular fall (head first off a horse) is horrible.  The neck takes all the load.  Helmets protect the skull, not the neck.  Obama once said that if he had sons there would be a conversation about them playing football.  If I had daughters, they would not ride horses.')
