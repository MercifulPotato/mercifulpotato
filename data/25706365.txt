I&#x27;m going to be honest,  at worst it is e-waste, at best a toy. You wouldn&#x27;t really use it as a phone. Its too slow, too flaky, feature lacking.<p>Pinephone is a very raw product lacking basic functionality that would be essential in modern phone - encryption at rest is one.\nOne day, it might turn into a usable product, but there are many, many years from this being something you would actually want to carry. It feels less useful than the first iphones a decade ago.<p>That being said, I would strongly support people buying these devices and building the ecosystem. We need alternatives.<p>The reality is today you have no escape from the big players if you want a modern usable phone device. Maybe in n years.')
