It is the lack of internal voice saying &quot;good job&quot;. NPD is not self-aggrandizement although that is a common coping mechanism used to deal with the underlying disorder. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m some sort of minor deity, but I&#x27;m also told by my doctors that I&#x27;m considerably more introspective than the typical narcissist (the irony of my docs being a source of praise is not lost on me).<p>Because I do not have an internal source of validation I seek out validation and praise from others to fill the void. Psychiatrists call these sources of validation &quot;narcissistic supply&quot;. That supply is a finite resource, eventually I either exhaust or build up a tolerance to the individual &#x2F; group supplying the validation which causes me to seek out new sources. Some people have compared it to an addict trying to find their fix, a metaphor I find distasteful since it does people suffering from addiction a disservice.<p>In this way I don&#x27;t think I can be happy because I cannot remain satisfied. Sometimes I feel good, but I understand that no matter what I do, success I achieve, or people I help it will never be enough. I have a hard time staying still because I know that whatever source of supply I&#x27;m currently tapping will eventually run dry. It&#x27;s a rather restless experience.')
