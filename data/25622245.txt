Just seems a little backwards.<p>I don&#x27;t really see why that&#x27;s backwards? The mechant pays for a service (accepting card payments) from Mastercard. Mastercard take some of that fee and give it to the card provider so they can cover the costs of running your card, such as their website and phone lines, or in this case planting trees as well. Where&#x27;s the backwards bit?')
