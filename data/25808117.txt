You can hibernate... by running &quot;sudo pm-hinernate&quot; on terminal.<p>- There&#x27;s no session save, like, really.<p>- pm-hibernate sometimes fails without a single error message.  Turns out it would refuse to run when the kernel was updated, OK fine that makes sense, except that the error message is redirected to &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;something and hidden beneath hundreds of lines of noise.<p>The only nice thing about it is that fractional scaling mostly works, which is nice, because I happen to have one 1080 and one 4K monitor.  I&#x27;m sorely tempted to move to KDE but then I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make fractional scaling work there.<p>It&#x27;s a total mess.')
