Any tips?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I want to praise an employee to an employer. The employee is a location manager. Due to the nature of my problem, I ended up listening to the employee manage that location for about six hours over three days, which is a fairly unusual customer experience.<p>I am fairly confident that this employee is known by name several tiers of management upwards for exactly the traits I would like to point out, but I would like to remind them of that yet again. This is one of those people who you sure can pay, but you can&#x27;t get the value that they contribute just by paying someone enough money. Sort of like the 1000x developer, in a different industry.<p>Any tips? Any dos or don&#x27;ts? I don&#x27;t need to deal with companies or workplaces in my regular life and am pretty gormless.')
