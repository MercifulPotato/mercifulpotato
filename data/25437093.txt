They&#x27;ve removed one extra point of mechanical failure and gave their laptops and phones a consistent feel with minimal delay (instead of a vibrating motor). A disassembled Taptic Engine is actually a bunch of small coils of different sizes and oil filled inside. Quite the engineering masterpiece.')
