If you don&#x27;t have enough verified data then you cannot make an informed decision anyway. \nMany people simply feel they &quot;trust&quot; a source. What is that? Your brain taking input and deciding it &quot;likes&quot; the pattern it concocts? That&#x27;s okay for lesser decisions but not major nation changing ones. \nIf you cannot form a consistent logical chain of events that you can extrapolate a decision from then what you are really doing is guessing or gambling. No matter what your &quot;feelings&quot; may tell you.')
