Uh huh.<p>Well, I&#x27;m glad you feel all that was &#x27;wrong&#x27;, because apparently what replaced it, mentally ill people living in squalor, exposed to the elements and diseases, in makeshift shanty-towns ... that&#x27;s been a real improvement. A homeless individual suffering from schizophrenia and unable to make rational decisions, I&#x27;m sure he appreciates you fighting for his right to live in squalor.<p>Unbelievable.<p>&gt; It was just kept out of your sight.<p>That&#x27;s what we have now. Homeless, and homeless encampments are so normal in progressives cities, it&#x27;s like background noise. You&#x27;ll literally step-over a sleeping homeless on your way to work without a second thought (and I can guarantee you do that every day, if you live in one of those cities). Sorry ... I forgot, we&#x27;re protecting their rights to not receive institutional care.')
