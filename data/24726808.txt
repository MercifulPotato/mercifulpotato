I assume that AMD has significantly higher wafer counts than Xilinx so this would primarily benefit the Xilinx business.<p>From a technology perspective, this acquisition may succeed where the Intel&#x2F;Altera acquisition fizzled due to AMD&#x27;s chiplet approach. Swapping a processor core for an FPGA chiplet might be an &quot;easy&quot; win in some markets.')
