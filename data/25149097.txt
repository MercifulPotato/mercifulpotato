Item(by='hannob', descendants=None, kids=[25149242], score=None, time=1605791458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148956, text='&gt; Operating systems can and should implement DoH<p>I see a comment like this basically every time something about DoH comes up.<p>What I haven&#x27;t seen: A plan how this should be implemented, a proposal to OS vendors and developers, ideally with patches.<p>This raises a few questions. How should the OS decide which server to use? It obviously can&#x27;t be DHCP, because that&#x27;s not a secure thing to begin with. How does this interact with things like captive portals if you have a disconnect between the DNS functionality and the gui application? Do you have good answers for these?')
