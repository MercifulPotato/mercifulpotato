Why isn&#x27;t React still using `createClass()` and mixins? Why were ES6 classes and hooks invented? Why did JS add arrow functions and `async&#x2F;await`? Why did C++ add an `auto` keyword? Why is there ever a new version of a language or library? Wasn&#x27;t enough thought put into them in the first place?<p>I think the comment you are responding to is a little harsh, but I find this part of your argument disingenuous. JavaScript&#x27;s syntactic expansion is not definitely a good thing â€” it isn&#x27;t all progress.<p>The rhetorical questions you have presented seem to imply that JavaScript gaining classes is obviously a good thing, whereas I strongly doubt everyone agrees. Did prototypical inheritance work? Yes. Does JavaScript still have prototypical inheritance? Also yes. Is it better to have more choice? Not necessarily. The result of this has been more fragmentation, more documentation, more for beginners to learn, more framework churn, etc.<p>JavaScript the language was originally invented in just 10 days, and the author himself has explained that aside from the deadline pressure, there are regrettable reasons for the language&#x27;s inconsistent API.')
