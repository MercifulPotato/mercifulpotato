It&#x27;s that comments are one color, function&#x2F;method&#x2F;class&#x2F;struct definitions are another, keywords are another. And it&#x27;s the same, no matter what language I&#x27;m programming in. Heck, I can open up a language I haven&#x27;t touched in years (or ever) and just start to get a feel for the structure based on the syntax highlighting alone.')
