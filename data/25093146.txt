I&#x27;ve been obsessed with this subject over the last ~4 years since i heard about Camlistore (Perkeep).<p>Oddly, in the time span my love for content addressable stores has only grown - but my desire for &quot;retaining&quot; any online data has shrunk to near nothing. With the exception of Spotify, i avoid not only giving data but leaving a footprint on the cloud. I know it&#x27;s happening, but i rotate accounts frequently, delete old posts, etc - and try to scrub with limited effort.<p>This hasn&#x27;t affected my motivation for a data warehouse; but it has limited my desire to spend any effort on keeping things in sync. Which is good for me, because watching the effort Camlistore went through to constantly scrape and maintain syncing behavior from Facebook, Twitter, etc.. i&#x27;m glad to avoid it.<p>These days i mostly focus on writing a Camlistore with some of my own preferred interfaces. Notably &quot;normal SQL database&quot;. I didn&#x27;t enjoy Camlistore&#x27;s app interface, i just want the feeling of using SQL. But i also love content addressable stores so that&#x27;s where i sit.<p>My efforts currently work towards merging concepts between Camlistore and Noms DB, with a SQL and Git like interfaces. Large problem for side projects, but plenty to keep me interested.')
