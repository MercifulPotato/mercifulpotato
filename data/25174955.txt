Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=[25180370], score=None, time=1606019711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25174627, text='USB type A&#x2F;B connectors lasted for &gt;10 years, but were obviously inadequate for most recent devices (which is why there were mini and micro B types, a type A “superspeed” connector with an associated &quot;extended&quot; micro B type, alongside a large number of proprietary other connectors), without even mentioning the worst type A misfeature of appearing symmetrical at a glance but not being symmetrical. Keeping type A&#x2F;B as the default for another 10+ years would be horrible.<p>There is no apparent reason why USB Type C connectors will not last significantly longer. They support a much wider range of use cases (collapsing what were previously at least 4 or 5 different connector types into 1, and using the same connector at both ends), and were explicitly designed to be future proof. The people involved in the design <i>were</i> thinking decades ahead.<p>It is unfortunate that many device makers (e.g. people making power strips) have taken a while to adopt Type C. But in another 5 or 10 years the transition will just be a memory. At most you’ll need an occasional dongle for your legacy hardware.<p>The biggest future competitor for USB type C plugs is various kinds of wireless transmission.')
