Item(by='angrydev', descendants=None, kids=[25828268], score=None, time=1611014128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25827086, text='&gt; The tool should have been designed (IMO) as a consumer tool, either a kiosk at CVS&#x2F;Walgreens&#x2F;pharmacies to assist with OTC med selection or possibly as a website with ads&#x2F;referrals.<p>Sure but... would you really need any clinical data to make this valuable? A pharmacy could just make a decision tree with some common symptoms and do the same thing based on their own recommendations. Including data from studies is a neat enhancement but not necessary IMO.<p>I think perhaps there&#x27;s greater value in the platform or methodology the author built for doing this type of meta analysis for medication. Could it be applied to other research fields I wonder. Could the software be licensed?')
