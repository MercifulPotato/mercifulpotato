I often see similar sentiments on this website. I don&#x27;t understand it. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>High technology is fragile. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s nowhere close to self-sufficient. It&#x27;s the pinnacle of a massive edifice whose foundation is biology: in particular non-human life. Kick that out and the whole thing collapses.<p>&gt; And if we don&#x27;t make it... multicellular life will continue to flourish and evolve.<p>This does seem reasonably likely. Life is resilient. Human life and human engineering, not so much.')
