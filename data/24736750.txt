I would never try to build a website in anything low level like that. It’s optimizing for completely the wrong set of problems. The world has lots of network bandwidth, cpu cycles and volatile memory. You won’t find many situations where having a better performing website is worth sacrificing the savings in human labor you get from high level abstractions.')
