Money? Censorship is almost always about power and the desire to destroy opposition. It is a means to instill fear and stifle the discussion of any &#x27;unpopular&#x27; ideas. It separates people. Money comes later.<p>I have few issues in communicating with friends or family.  But now I have to think twice about what I say in public. Conversations must be limited to topics approved by the tech giants and the people who hold power. And I can&#x27;t easily hear what a lot of other people say. It&#x27;s definitely limiting.
