Perhaps the region was once a genetic way station, allowing interbreeding up and down the Pacific Coast, says Dr. Larson, who did not participate in the current work. And that implies that Alaskan otters can be used for reintroduction programs.<p>One issue might be climate change. The waters off the Oregon coast may have gotten warmer, with possible changes in the sea life living in the waters. It may be better from a long term perspective to introduce the Southern species which would be better adapted to warmer waters.')
