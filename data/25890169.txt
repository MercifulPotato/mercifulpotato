Sure, I don&#x27;t agree with every single thing Black does, but it&#x27;s still infinitely better than trying to enforce code style <i>manually.</i> And don&#x27;t get me started about those who just don&#x27;t want a code style enforced - the diffs end up a serious mess, and forget dealing with merge conflicts in a reasonable time.')
