I needed to do a password reset on my old ebay account, but the hotmail account it was attached to was deleted, so I just created a new hotmail account with the same name, and reset my password. I&#x27;ve done this maybe three or four time, because I haven&#x27;t used hotmail since high school, so they keep deleting it.<p>A lot of people also have password resets on gmail linked to their old hotmail accounts, so you can just re-create their old hotmail to hijack their current gmail.')
