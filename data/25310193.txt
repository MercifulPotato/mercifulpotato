Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607127528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308966, text='If it&#x27;s just the inside pocket that wears, and not the pant leg itself, that&#x27;s pretty easy to fix with scrap of fabric, plus needle and thread. I&#x27;ve done that myself with plenty of pants, even sewn a completely new replacement pocket for one pair.<p>For the shirts, you could sew patches on the elbows, but the would probably be at-home&#x2F;casual shirts at that point.<p>The skill of mending clothes is one I think many people don&#x27;t think about, out maybe they just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something they want to do. It&#x27;s not rocket science at all, and there are tons of guides and videos or there to show the various stitches and techniques.<p>I mend all of my clothes when they start to wear, fix and replace buttons, even slight alterations to fit. When a piece of clothing finally becomes overall too threadbare, I harvest buttons and sometimes zippers, as well as scraps of remaining good quality fabric, all for future repairs.<p>My current pants are all from the Finnish store Varusteleka. Their ordinary jeans are good, their tactical jeans are amazing, and their worker pants are a breath of fresh old-fashioned air, with high waists, pleats and buttons for proper suspenders.<p>The materials chosen are solid, as is the workmanship, although you wouldn&#x27;t call it superlative. Like the style, it&#x27;s practical, not flashy.<p>I like their wool shirts too.')
