I like VSCode because it’s a simple&#x2F;light weight text editor which helps me with small tasks like auto-imports.<p>I feel like these things are especially helpful when you’re a beginner and just started learning a new language.<p>Anyways, thanks for the hard work Steve and I’ll give it a second try with RA soon!')
