This is because it defaults to trying to take the environment by reference. The &quot;move&quot; in this case means that it will try to take it by value instead. This feels tricky semantically because references are types too, so &quot;taking it by value&quot; means taking a &amp;T rather than a &amp;&amp;T, just like you may think about how taking a T is by value as opposed to &amp;T.')
