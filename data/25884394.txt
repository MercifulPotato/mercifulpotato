The basic one is that it adversely impacts portability, as mentioned, and is complicated in implementation because file system behavior under direct I&#x2F;O is not always consistent.<p>The bigger challenge is that PostgreSQL is not architected like a database engine designed to use direct I&#x2F;O effectively. Adding even the most rudimentary support will be a massive code change and implementation effort, and the end result won&#x27;t be comparable to what you would expect from a modern database kernel designed to use direct I&#x2F;O. This raises questions about return on investment.')
