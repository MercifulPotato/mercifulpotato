I was able to get one and I don’t even have anything in the App Store at the moment. As for Apple gifting them to OSS projects, I mean, I guess that would be nice, but frankly the corporate stewards of Go and Rust can buy their own, just as Electron and others did. I imagine some Debian people may have been given loaner machines or stuff gratis, given the custom Debian build proof of concept at WWDC, but I have no insight into that.<p>The real challenges with AS are going to be for anything that uses virtualization or lots of lower level libraries that need to be compiled for ARM64 and to be honest, that was clear to anyone who watched any of the Apple Silicon sessions at WWDC and read the accompanying documentation.<p>You’re exactly right that many popular developer toolchains aren’t ready right now. Most of us didn’t expect that and some of us were screaming that loudly (and getting yelled at and called haters by fanbois even though we almost exclusively use Macs and Apple hardware) to prepare people for exactly this reality. The support will come over time and it’s also clear to me at least, that the way at least some stuff works, might not be as nice as the way it was under Intel or even PPC, just because of changing priorities with macOS, and we&#x27;ll need to come to terms with that too.<p>You&#x27;ll notice the 13” MacBook Pro that was replaced in the lineup, a device I’ve always found odd period (just get a MacBook Air), is the tweener device with two ports, and originally , no Touch Bar. This isn’t the much more powerful 13” MacBook Pro that got a big update on Intel alongside the fixed keyboard this May. This is the one that got a fixed keyboard but was still running a two year old 8th-gen Intel processor, AKA, the MacBook Pro you shouldn’t buy and should really just get a MacBook Air instead (the Intel MacBook Air refresh was running a newer processor than the two-port MBP).<p>Honestly, this is a huge boon for non Apple Silicon ARM64 projects and libraries because a lot of developers won’t do this sort of work for Raspberry Pi or Pinebook or any number of ARM boards, but they will for Apple. And that will trickle downstream.')
