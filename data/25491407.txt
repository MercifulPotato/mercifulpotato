For example, maybe they could work a day job (stereotypically waiting tables) and still make enough money for a studio in a bad part of town.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like that&#x27;s the case today. Unless you have a profession or work multiple jobs (both of which prohibit having enough time to seriously pursue art) you are completely priced out of America&#x27;s cosmopolitan cities.')
