Windows 7, assuming you have installed all updates before January. Microsoft can update the roots as they please (and historically issued updates up unto Windows 2000, so root updates are a demonstrable solved problem).<p>BSDs and Linuxes: (Usually) Uses Mozilla&#x27;s trust list. Also updates separately from system updates, so unless you stick somehow with unsupported systems you already have this (and can be manually included into the trusted roots if you insist on using that outdated version).<p>macOS: bundled with the system updates (see caveat with Firefox independently managing roots). Here, I don&#x27;t know what version is the oldest one with ISRG root certs.')
