I&#x27;ve enjoyed each, and have no major complaints about any.<p>With the right hardware, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed installing and using Linux, while I struggle when drivers for networking have to be procured - I&#x27;m not experienced enough in that area to figure it out (or rather, I&#x27;m not <i>motivated</i> enough.)<p>For me, Windows and macOS alike <i>just work</i> and while I&#x27;ve had more issues with Windows, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used it 100x more often and thoroughly; a price I pay for the ease of getting into games. (I am not speaking about right now, a moment in time, but the decades through which I gamed.)<p>In my career, I was largely a developer of Microsoft-focused technologies, and the support for tools was always sufficient or better.<p>Anyway, to my point, the parts of the software and experience that would pain me would be the things I couldn&#x27;t control, and the things that were meddled with. I avoided pre-configured laptops if I could, and if I couldn&#x27;t, I would do a clean install of the OS immediately. With desktops, I could select the best performance&#x2F;experience&#x2F;price (including reliability, features, etc) compromise for each compatible component, assemble it myself, and have not only a perfectly customized kit suited to my personal tastes and needs, but also the experience of learning and building on my own.<p>Now all of that is irrelevant if your preference is either just very strongly what comes from Apple, or you&#x27;re only looking at complete systems and comparing them. Since I can be ambivalent about OS, except for gaming, and the experience was quite good (for me, not for everyone, obviously), I could pick a Windows-compatible laptop that gave me the best &quot;features for the price&quot;, or rather, great hardware for the price without too much software meddling (or meddling I could remove.)<p>Now, does it sound like I don&#x27;t consider the experience, or that I&#x27;m buying hardware because of insecurity? It certainly does not seem so from my perspective. To say a &quot;feature list has no meaning&quot; is to claim that the features do not contribute to the experience, but that isn&#x27;t accurate. Of course you have to understand how an experience is derived from a feature, or that feature list can&#x27;t be used to aid in your decision-making process.')
