But yeah. &quot;Companies&quot; (really senior people within those companies) hire people who are known in their field, bring an outside perspective, have an independent voice, etc. And then those people (or perhaps different senior people) get unhappy when the individual who was hired doesn&#x27;t go through channels or otherwise toe the party line. Either both sides find a middle ground by some combination of putting certain opinions in a box and choosing to ignore the use of channels or messages outside of official guidelines--or you part ways.<p>I have some experience with this. Not to nearly the same degree. But I had something of a tiff with an exec my second day on the job in a prior role.')
