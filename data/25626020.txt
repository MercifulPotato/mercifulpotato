Why are Reddit and HN labeled as non-productive? Is it because it doesn&#x27;t do anything to us or because we&#x27;re trained to only label &quot;skills&quot; as productive?<p>I learned more through HN than I did with many books. Reddit improved my day through stupid memes that made me laugh more times than I can remember.<p>Yet when I&#x27;m browsing those sites, I feel guilty. Even while writing this very comment.<p>That&#x27;s what saddens me.')
