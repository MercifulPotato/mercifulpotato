Item(by='heisenbergs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611272084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863637, text='&gt; One of the biggest drawbacks is that you can’t brace your hand against anything whilst typing – think how much easier it is to type on a smartphone with your thumbs versus trying to stab at a virtual keyboard on a large tablet with just your index finger<p>This is a common problem for large touch screens, that I&#x27;ve experienced for instance in Tesla&#x27;s massive displays too. the way around it: always rest part of your hand against something stable, ie in the tesla wrap your pinky around the display and then use your thumb or index finger. For me it increased accuracy from 80% to 99%. This doesn&#x27;t work if you need to touch the center of the screen, all other parts work great.')
