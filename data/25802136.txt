For many decades feminist theory used to consider the feminine to be aberrant and the masculine to be the cultural norm and a pure good, only investigating the ways in which femininity trapped and harmed people. &quot;Toxic masculinity&quot; was a re-evaluation of these assumptions, identifying ways that masculinity, like femininity could trap and harm people. The term was positioned against the assumptions of the time and &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; expresses this position much better than &quot;toxic gender roles&quot; since it was explicitly about changing how feminism thought about masculinity.<p>That is no longer especially significant to the term, but inertia exists.')
