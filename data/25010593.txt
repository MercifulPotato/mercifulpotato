These billions are provided by investors who must have some reasonable chance at making a profit (or at least not losing a lot of money).  Non-profit enterprises simply don&#x27;t have the money or the expertise.  The government has no expertise in the development path.  The U.S. gov&#x27;t (through the FDA) has vast amounts of expertise in analyzing clinical trial proposals and data, but not actually running them.')
