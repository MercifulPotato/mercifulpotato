Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605034539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048617, text='&gt; My main issue with all these platforms supposedly being born to defend &quot;free speech&quot; is that they&#x27;re a reactionist measure from certain ideas being deemed inappropriate by the common populace, so it&#x27;s less about all kinds of free speech and more about protecting their speech.<p>Protecting your free speech also protects everyone elses. Typically you can post whatever you like on these plaforms. 4chan is always derided because of the infamous &#x2F;pol (which tbh is mostly people just trolling) but they never talk about the LGBT channels.<p>The issue with the large platforms is that they are interfering with people discussions based on what they think is best and they frequently get it wrong. This can be not understanding the irony or not understanding a &quot;shitpost&quot; or they don&#x27;t understand regional customs. Recently a diner was censored for using the word &quot;faggots&quot;. Faggots are a dish in the UK.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faggot_(food)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faggot_(food)</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.birminghammail.co.uk&#x2F;black-country&#x2F;woman-advertising-faggots-fannys-cafe-16886019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.birminghammail.co.uk&#x2F;black-country&#x2F;woman-adverti...</a><p>Also I don&#x27;t consider parler to be free speech platform. They have removed people for certain posts normally anime breats and other forms of shitposting. Nonetheless it isn&#x27;t a free speech platform.')
