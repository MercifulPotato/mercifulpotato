For example, if the candidate struggles with basic syntax, or if they struggle with refactoring, or they don&#x27;t react to feedback well, these are all things that get considered, even if they do solve the question optimally on paper.<p>I had one where we solved the problem half way through the session and went on a big tangent about how to engineer a solution to a related fuzzy problem.<p>I do agree though that interview standardization can lead to mediocre interviewer practices if the interviewer isn&#x27;t truly committed to improving their recruiting skills (which is sometimes the case if a team is on a crunch, for example).')
