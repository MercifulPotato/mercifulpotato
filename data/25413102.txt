An example of this would be compiling stuff to GPUs, e.g. SPIR-V. Such things are planned but not implemented. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2683" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2683</a><p>* Things that will never be in scope. An example of this would be code obfuscation, which is a use case the Zig project does not recognize.<p>* Object formats that are drastically incompatible with the von Neumann architecture. It would be infeasible for Zig code to be compiled to such things. For example, attempting to compile to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).<p>I think that&#x27;s it. Anything else would be supported, provided there were enough people interested in providing maintenance for the respective parts of the codebase.')
