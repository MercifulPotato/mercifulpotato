Transport and shipping cost is low since the syrup doesn&#x27;t take up much space. A typical fast food soda (any size) costs about 15-20 cents for the cup and soda, and is sold for $1 on the low end. Larger chains can optimize the price down to 5-10 cents on the most popular sodas. Labor costs are insignificant if the customer self-serves from the fountain.')
