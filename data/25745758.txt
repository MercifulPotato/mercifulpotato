Let&#x27;s say for example you are one of the world&#x27;s leading immunologists when a global pandemic breaks out.  Going on TV because you &quot;by definition want to appear on TV&quot; is tautological, you could say that about anything on the list.  A leading expert may see that they have a responsibility help lead the public, it&#x27;s perfectly possible that want for media attention for personal fame is completely irrelevant.  Want for media attention to help guide the course of a pandemic to a safer path qualifies as &quot;because they wanted to appear on TV,&quot; but the GP reads uncharitably.')
