Do the math, you&#x27;ll see a 60-70% final value pension on 100k salary (60-70k&#x2F;year) with a 3% cost of living increase (standard in Illinois) is worth 1.8-2.0 million dollars (25 years @ 3.5% discount rate). This is equivalent to having nearly 2 million dollars saved in a retirement account and when you retire, buying an annuity with credit quality equivalent to a promise from a major government (not a junk bond which may become insolvent).<p>Anyone who thinks that&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot; really needs a reality check. 600k pensioners in Illinois [1], many of them living out of state, and the ones that live in-state aren&#x27;t even taxed on their pension income. They also don&#x27;t have to pay for health insurance. This is simply insane. There&#x27;s really no other word for it. This needs to be indexed to private benefits or otherwise tethered to reality.<p>Sidenote. We need a rethink of public service in this country (US). The old bargain of &quot;you get paid less working for the government but the benefits and job security are better&quot; needs to go. Everyone receiving this $2 million entitlement is going to say, well, I work for the government so I deserve my &quot;better benefits&quot;. It shouldn&#x27;t matter if you work private or public sector. There needs to be some equivalence otherwise you get Illinois, where politician after politician promises great treatment to AFSCME and SEIU and to nobody&#x27;s surprise, no real attempt is ever made to fix this broken system.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Public_pensions_in_Illinois" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Public_pensions_in_Illinois</a>')
