Treating the two schools as equal understates cost, as the <i>per student</i> average is higher.<p>Also, did you &quot;forget&quot; about people without degrees again? They live in the same places, they&#x27;re also affected by the high cost living, but the ROI of a college degree doesn&#x27;t help them at all. It&#x27;s a red herring.
