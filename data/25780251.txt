Google has an advantage there.<p>I&#x27;ve had a different experience, I prefer being able to choose the location. For technical queries it gives me better results, for general queries less SEO&#x27;ed content and when I want something local I change the switch. \nBonus is that I can choose a different location, which has been useful this year because my travel pattern has changed to staying at a remote location for longer periods - I can still easily get my home country results when I need them without trying all sorts of extra keywords.')
