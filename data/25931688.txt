I am aware that confronting a personal project really settles that knowledge in, but I still postpone personal projects whenever I think “I don’t really understand what this means, maybe I should just finish that online course and I’ll be ready”.<p>Also fighting perfection over progress is tough. “This is not the best way of doing it” is constantly in my head when trying to do thing, which is mental space that could be used towards figuring out the next step.<p>But I finally started, as stupid and useless as it may sound, I’m just making a counter in Java that stores that in a MySQL database.<p>Why? Idk, I am learning how to connect my program to a DB, the quirks to learn from that, and then I plan on doing this from a browser. I also plan on trying SQLite because MySQL is overkill, and so just by doing this simple thing I learn a bunch of things going down the rabbit hole.<p>Does anyone need an app with a button that just adds a number to a row? No, but the different aspects of getting that to run with no errors are what’s important to me.')
