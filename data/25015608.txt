Or LibreOffice.<p>If you put a formula into any cell starting with an `=` character, the office suite will give you a terse warning about updates or something, and when you accept, it will run every formula.<p>For example, you could write a formula to convert cells A1:D10 to params, and make a GET request to an address on your personal server. If the CSV contains user submitted data, e.g. if someone has set that formula as their name, and the CSV hasn&#x27;t been carefully sanitised, then hand someone from the business your CSV to build some sort of report, they may well be sending much of the data to a 3rd party.<p>While maybe not a CSV-specific issue, certainly CSVs are believed to be safe (it&#x27;s just a text file! We&#x27;re only using it internally!) They really are not safe, and it sometimes takes a non-trivial amount of work to make them safe.')
