Is Google a publisher because you have a gmail account? What we are talking about at its core is a platform that allows you to talk to people you know or might want to know. Is it objectionable that my text messages are displayed in terms of arrival time? What if I want it sorted alphabetically by contact but the SMS app won&#x27;t let me? And you can still send all the same information to people you know off of Facebook or on peoples walls or through messenger. Facebook doesn&#x27;t create the content, you do. So how are they publishers?<p>Also, there is no meaningful difference between &quot;publisher&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; here[0]. So the entire conversation is built on a faulty premise.<p>What specific regulations does the NYT have for showing you news? What specific regulations does Google have for promoting different sites? The NYT gets to decide what they report on, they have no obligation to show you &quot;the other side&quot;. How is that any different than the FB algo?<p>Now, their lack of moderation is a different discussion worth having. We can argue that it&#x27;s harder to moderate at scale and be forgiving, or we can say that doesn&#x27;t matter and that they still have the obligation all the same.<p>[0] eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;publisher-or-platform-it-doesnt-matter')
