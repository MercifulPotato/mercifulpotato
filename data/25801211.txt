I would like a language that forces me write single-threaded batched (or &quot;blocked&quot;) algorithms with low cache misses.<p>How many pieces of code are out there where an easy x4 speedup could be achieved today if there were written with batched operations from the start? (It also shows how limited are the compiler in autovectorizing)<p>Rust gives me guarantes regarding memory safety, I would like a language that gives me guarantees that SIMD instructions and 2 cache levels are correctly used, without having to read the source code and compiler output.')
