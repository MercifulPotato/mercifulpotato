Item(by='madhadron', descendants=None, kids=[25585213], score=None, time=1609352104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25579583, text='&gt; larger group of people abusing non-traditional power does not sound like a great &quot;fix&quot; to me.<p>Sounds reasonable. How do we define abuse? Do we have a clear notion of when consequences for your speech is abuse?<p>Some things are clear. Mobs threatening your children because of what you said is clearly abuse. But what about customers of your employer demanding that you be fired? There are clearly cases where that would be legitimate. Up until a couple years ago, flying the swastika and wanting to start up the Nazi party again would result in you being &quot;cancelled&quot; pretty thoroughly.<p>Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences. It&#x27;s freedom from the government taking you away because of what you said (though even that isn&#x27;t universal if your speech is a direct incitement to an act, such as shouting fire in a movie theatre or calling for someone&#x27;s death with an expectation that someone listening to you will go do it). You still get all the legal protections of any other member of our society.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s a better way of coming at it? If large groups abusing non-traditional power is a problem, should we define a larger set of individual legal protections to define what the consequences of speech cannot be?')
