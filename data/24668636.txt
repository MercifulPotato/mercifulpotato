You&#x27;re all together in a society competing for the top spots.<p>Whereas certain other cultures are more about working together to create an ideal environment for all to be emancipated and enjoy life to its fullest.<p>Personally, I prefer the latter, as it just seems much more enjoyable and fun to live in such a culture. The former culture is stressful and doesn&#x27;t really seem to bring as much value out of my life, it feels a lot more artificial in its end goal. Instead of appreciating the time on a planet full of wonders, you spend the time feeling good knowing you beat others and ended on top. I honestly couldn&#x27;t really find salvation in that goal, on my last day breathing, I&#x27;d feel like the king of fools, a fool none the less, and like I just missed out on a life that could have been so much more. But off course that must just show my cultural bias. And I wonder if happiness is cultural, while I would be happier in the latter culture, someone born in the former might be happier in that one. Just something for me to keep pondering about')
