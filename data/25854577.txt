Even if safety never improves, coal plants dump more radiation per kwh.<p>- waiting the last 30-40 years to decarbonize electricity generation was much more harmful to the environment than nuclear plants would have been (even with multiple meltdowns, and it wouldn’t have cost much to avoid that).<p>- france and china have successful nuclear industries, and france did it with now-obsolete technology.<p>I haven’t seen much correlation between being on the left or right and being pro- or anti-nuclear.<p>I have noticed that pro-nuclear people tend to have a more balanced take on covid (by “balanced”, I mean somewhere between “masks are a hoax” and “full-on panic”)')
