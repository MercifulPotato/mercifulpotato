Item(by='notahacker', descendants=None, kids=[24815536], score=None, time=1602975257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813150, text='&gt; I personally know someone whose father likely died due to being unable to access health care in a timely fashion, as well as someone else who died of cancer after their chemotherapy was postponed. And I also know of two suicides in my extended social group in the past few months. It&#x27;s tough to pin specific blame on lockdown for things like that. But it&#x27;s certainly plausible that deaths like that would lead to excess deaths.<p>Sure, but we can look at <i>when</i> the excess deaths happened. Instead of being evenly distributed across the lockdown period, or peaking towards the end when people had longer without access to support, they came exactly when you&#x27;d expect deaths from an epidemic wave to peak before plummeting to normal levels towards the end of the lockdown period. Undoubtedly, individual deaths have resulted from lockdown, but the pattern of excess deaths matches COVID rather than lockdown being behind the aggregate increase.')
