See: Negative Externalities.<p>The problem with Bitcoin is that energy waste is inherent in its design. As Bitcoin value goes up, the value of a Bitcoin relative to energy changes, which encourages more mining, which results in higher energy spend and emissions as the algorithm difficulty adjusts to the new hash rate.<p>Generating 10,000,000 bitcoins could be done at low energy with a few miners - but the more valuable they become the more energy they use.<p>My issue with Bitcoin is that while other industries try to save power, Bitcoin tries to waste it and waste is built into the algorithm.<p>And the more popular Bitcoin gets, the more our planet gets polluted trying to make magic numbers on a ledger.')
