Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=[25144842], score=None, time=1605744335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138827, text='&gt; Saying it’s a power relationship is another way of saying the same thing that you are saying here.<p>The way you frame the power imbalance is framed suggests that there is always something coercive and manipulative going on. A market rate suggests that a the hourly or daily rate for labour has settled naturally around a particular point through market forces in that particular area. Developers are more in demand in London so the day rate offered reflects that (typically £100-200 more).<p>You seem to be conflating two concepts into one.<p>&gt; The amount of power that employer and employee have is based in large part on supply&#x2F;demand.<p>What do you mean by power? I don&#x27;t want to sound rude but the way you are talking about it is akin to how people talk about the force in star wars.<p>&gt; However, power includes a little bit more: an employer who has a better knowledge of the market may be able to extract lower pay from an employee who doesn’t know their market rate, and an employee who is exceptionally well suited for a given job has more power to negotiate a better rate.<p>What you are arguing there is being informed about the market means that you won&#x27;t get ripped off. Generally though there will be an approximate wage for a particular type of work based on how valuable the employee is and whether they can be replaced or not.<p>There are job boards these days online for almost anything you can work out what you are going to get paid for a particular type of role.<p>&gt; Of course, this can also be reframed as a supply&#x2F;demand scenario taking into account imperfect information for a given scenario, but that’s largely my point. They aren’t equivalent concepts, but they are closely related.<p>Again don&#x27;t want to sound rude. This all read likes double speak to me. If you want to talk about a coercive power imbalance then talk about that. If you want to talk about market rates talk about market rates. Simply call things what they are.')
