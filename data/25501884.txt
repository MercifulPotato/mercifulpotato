Anecdotal for sure, but number 2 on that list is way behind. Extra abstractions for a future that has yet to happen and abstractions because the IDE makes it easy to click through the layers is the number 1 by far reason I’ve seen code based be very difficult to maintain.<p>If you just keep in your head, “Can I see exactly enough on this page to know what it does? Not more, not less?“ It’s an impossible ideal but that concept is a fantastic mental guideline for maintainable\ncodebases.')
