Item(by='samizdis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610279686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706993, text='The Economist has published an article [1] that discusses what it sees as increasing scrutiny of social media networks. In one paragraph, it says:<p><i>... it is hard to avoid the sense that the social-media firms have reached a point of no return. Disquiet about the power and reach of social media is not confined to political partisans. Britain, Australia, Singapore, Brazil and the EU have passed, or are mooting, new rules designed to regulate social media. The banning of the world’s most powerful politician will raise the temperature even further. The firms’ in-house enforcement policies—which are spotty and inconsistently applied—will come under even more intense scrutiny.</i><p>I found the article to be well-reasoned and thoughtful, so am posting it here because I think that it might be of interest to other HN users.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-expulsion-of-donald-trump-marks-a-watershed-for-facebook-and-twitter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-expul...</a>')
