It might have been a double digit percentage lesser than that.<p><i>&gt; There was also less automation then.</i><p>The total ratio of labour per output of light industry for lion share of goods did not change since eighties.<p><i>&gt; The takeaway is world demand is not sufficient to uplift even a majority of Chinese population to barely middle income status.</i><p>This is the sole ultimately true point.<p><i>&gt; There simply isn&#x27;t enough global demand or resources for every Chinese to live as well as the west.</i><p>A moot point with resources. We have enough of pretty much everything as extraction technologies improve. The only natural resource we may ran out soon is wood..., ammusingly a largely renewable one.<p><i>&gt; Manufacturing is increasingly automated,</i><p>No<p><i>&gt; China is rapidly integrating industrial robots to retain industrial base.</i><p>No<p><i>&gt; Even when those 600M can work wages cheaper than Vietnam or Bangladesh. Pending focus on neglected interior development, maybe they will at the expense of rest of region trying to replicate export led development.</i><p>Again, no. Chinese establishment don&#x27;t give a flying .... about those 600M Chinese in inland provinces. Why would they? Why should they? They didn&#x27;t even at the time when the digit was a double of that.<p>And the Chinese business, it has largely no interest working with middle age, expensive to train, and largely unruly social bottom feeder workforce.<p>They will rather go where they can get prime rib workforce for cheap. They need malleable young workers who are well schooled, trained, have low demands, no family to feed, no health issues, and are cream of the crop of their part of the social ladder. And yes, they need them in tonnes, and rock bottom prices on top of that.<p>China largely ran out of high quality factory employable workforce.')
