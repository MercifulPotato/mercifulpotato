To contrast, a novel wouldn&#x27;t give away the ending on the first page, but a scholarly article absolutely has to give the take-away in the abstract.<p>I personally think for informative reporting, it&#x27;s maximally respectful of the reader&#x27;s time and attention to give a quick summary up front. Then they can decide if they want to continue for the full details and story-telling experience. Many people won&#x27;t, but those people would probably skip the story in the first place and click through to the comments for the punch line.<p>Thanks for bringing up this discussion!')
