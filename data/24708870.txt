Item(by='panzagl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602082387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707987, text='&#x27;Welfare&#x27; on a federal level now means a combination of Social Security disability and redeemable income tax credits- basically they have no income, but Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Credit, means they get money back on their taxes anyway.  And of course if they have children there are a number of federal and local programs that ostensibly help feed the child, but are easily worked around to turn into money- in the old days you&#x27;d spend all day buying individual kool aid packets (pay with a dollar voucher, get 75 cents real money in exchange), now you&#x27;re more like to buy high end food items and sell them on, or else some sort of item return fraud.')
