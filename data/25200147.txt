Why does a console need a noisy, mechanically complex, and expensive optical drive just to read a license? Professional software has long used USB peripherals, or dongles as they are semi-affectionately known, as the physical manifestation of licenses. The disc has become a dongle, so why not just use a dongle?&quot;<p>Why not take it a step further and use a digital licensing scheme which achieves the same purpose without the inconvenience of a dongle? There can be an industry-wide standard that aims to replicate the benefits of physical disc ownership (loaning out&#x2F;renting the disc, selling&#x2F;buying used, etc...), but in digital form. If you don&#x27;t trust companies to do it right, get the government involved.')
