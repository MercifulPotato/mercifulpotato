You risk bankrupting social programs otherwise.<p>Mass migration also hinders assimilation. When you have a steady stream of migrants, those migrants can integrate into the local culture. When you have a massive burst as you would if you suddenly deregulated immigration, those individuals have enough non-native support as to never come under pressure to assimilate. This is not a good thing and is precisely what leads to massive nationalist backlash.<p>All that being said, I do support generally increasing quotas while also largely uncapping skilled immigration.')
