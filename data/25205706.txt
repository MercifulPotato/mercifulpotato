One can imagine several situations where we&#x27;d have to go back to basics - wars, catastrophes and&#x2F;or colonies on other planets or even generational ship, etc. I mean in the situation without modern technology available, we know how to make simple crystal diode and with a bit of small effort transistor and that would let us build very simple computer along the lines of the MyNOR ...<p>One can also imagine it in the other direction - how a traveler from the year 3000 would try to build a quantum-quark-multidimensional-time-accelerated MyNOR of the year 3000 using the year 2020 technology - i mean we probably already have some pieces allowing to build a crude version of it.')
