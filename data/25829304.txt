They might have been afforded the chance to invade by Trump insiders, but they would never have toppled our government. In reality, they stood zero chance of threatening our democracy.<p>Big media and big tech are using this to show you that it&#x27;s okay if they deplatform and take free speech away. Don&#x27;t trust it. This is the real threat to democracy. Shutting off dissent. Promulgating only allowed thoughts. Cancelling.<p>The best way to reach these people and talk them down is by addressing them in a non-violent manner and meeting their needs. The boom years are over, and our economy only works for the top earners. Everyone is unhappy. Left, right, north, south, urban, rural. We are under attack from foreign and domestic powers seeking to divide and polarize the electorate and take advantage of it. The chaos makes it easy for them to distract and compel.<p>The fix is the hard path. Addressing systemic inequalities, reaching across the aisle, addressing income disparities, and educating our nation&#x27;s children.<p>Free speech is one of the things that makes our nation great. Not because it permits hate, but in spite of it. Because it enables love.<p>I dislike Parler as much as you do, but what&#x27;s happening right now should shake you to the very core.')
