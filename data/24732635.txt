I wish I were writing your comment. It seems like we&#x27;re coming from a similar place but have much different read on the present situation - you&#x27;re optimistic.<p>&gt; <i>I continue to believe that the chaos Trump sows acts as sand in the gears of the powerful</i><p>Arbitrary chaos tends to benefit the powerful, as they&#x27;re able to take advantage of it. For example I had been hoping that the pandemic-induced economic slowdown would have unwound the debt treadmill by a bit. Instead the powerful just had the government print money to prop up asset prices. Meanwhile Main St continues to suffer.<p>&gt; <i>My concern is that if we throw Trump out and elect yet another insider, we will immediately resume the former status quo...lip service towards the genuine problems in the world, and plenty of catering to powerful corporations and the military industrial complex</i><p>From what I can tell, Trump has not stopped the sabre rattling and foreign military interventions. How are things better by not even paying lip service? Don&#x27;t mistake upsetting specific individuals with upsetting the overall system.<p>&gt; <i>exposes the media and other politicians for the propagandists they are</i><p>He may <i>call</i> them for what they are, but his own reality distortion field prevents him from gaining any high ground. I had been working to keep an open mind on this, putting aside the media&#x27;s complaints about Trump, and trying to see what he was actually doing (eg I appreciated when he scrapped the individual mandate). Covid itself was my breaking point, as it was an objective threat that he just rejected dealing with. I (still) agree the media is a giant propaganda operation, but in 2020, I listen to them over Trump.<p>&gt; <i>What&#x27;s missing is, the people that have woken up don&#x27;t know what to believe, or believe in. The West has no vision for the future, other than the same old bullshit story politicians of both sides of the aisle have been selling people for decades (as our military lays waste to 3rd world countries over completely manufactured pretenses, while the media runs cover for them). We need a new story, and it has to be at least fairly true, and plausible, and acknowledge the real barriers to achievement, rather than making up a whole bunch of fantasy land fake problems.</i><p>I agree with this in general. But IMO Trump looks like yet another conspiracy red herring rather than a productive path forward.')
