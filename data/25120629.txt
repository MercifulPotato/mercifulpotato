Item(by='4bpp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605591685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113482, text='I understand that the arguments both for and against the current DKIM regime are fairly nontrivial (should we analyse it as a loss of rights to the public (your past emails can be attributed to you) or a gain (you can hold the powerful to account)?), but either way, it seems that the only position that is consistent with the author&#x27;s would be one that is enthusiastically in favour of improvement and proliferation of DeepFake technology. After all, we already live in a world where technology has created a novel form of attribution that could be used for blackmail: slightly over 100 years ago, nobody could prove or disprove that you said or did something in the past, whereas nowadays a video (given some pixel-level forensics) works as irrevokable proof positive.')
