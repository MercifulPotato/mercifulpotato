Probably doesn&#x27;t work for reasons above my head but I was just trying to think about the mechanics of the transition between satellites.  Having a chameleon mode with one eye pointed at one satellite and another pointed at the next seems like one way to ensure a seamless transfer.  But realistically the dish probably knows where to steer next within an approximation of its beamwidth, so it probably just flips like a channel.<p>Thanks for the answers!')
