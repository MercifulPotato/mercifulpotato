But 0.1s might be fast enough.<p>I get 2x on std::sort pretty easily. I am hoping to get a general speedup like that for half the algorithms in the C++ Standard Library into C++23. Maybe the other half a little later.<p>Caches mean nobody knows how fast anything should be, so lots of things seem fast until you see one faster, then the old one suddenly looks slow.')
