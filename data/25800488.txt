The university forces him to show up and deliver an in-person lecture for the undergrads. After a few weeks the students figured out that the lectures are streamed anyway, so it&#x27;s easier to just watch it at home and there&#x27;s a lot of lecturing to an empty room.<p>The grad students still show up to seminars though.')
