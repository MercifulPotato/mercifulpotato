I used Google Takeout recently, had it set to split into 50GB tar.gz chunks, and it worked perfectly fine. I wasn&#x27;t logged out once, and downloaded the archive with around 90 MB&#x2F;s (720 mbps). It was a very smooth data export experience. I&#x27;m very much not a Google&#x2F;Android fanboy and avoid Google&#x27;s services wherever possible. The OP is being downvoted because their experience isn&#x27;t representative.<p>EDIT: It does seem that there are more people than I expected for whom the experience isn&#x27;t as good as the one I had, so maybe Google should test this with (and make it work better on) internet connections that aren&#x27;t as good as their office lines.')
