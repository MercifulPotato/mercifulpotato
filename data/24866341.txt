Item(by='xyb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603431732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848503, text='&gt; My only gripe (and its relatively small) is I don&#x27;t like its compiler directive syntax using the `{.directive.}` style, its a little ugly and noisy to me, I&#x27;d prefer something like rust&#x27;s `#[]` (I think this is actually how you use a Rust macro, but its a nice syntax regardless)<p>Me too. I think the `{.directive.}` style comes from pascal[1], but put it at the end of the procedure definition line. Lines that are too long are not easy to read. It would be better if each directive syntax had its own line.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freepascal.org&#x2F;docs-html&#x2F;current&#x2F;prog&#x2F;progse5.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freepascal.org&#x2F;docs-html&#x2F;current&#x2F;prog&#x2F;progse5.ht...</a>')
