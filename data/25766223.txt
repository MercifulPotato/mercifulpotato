Individually, farmers&#x2F;distributors absolutely have (and in my mind, <i>should</i> have) the right to avoid shipping to areas which would actively lose them money.<p>When <i>everyone</i> avoids those areas, though, <i>bam</i>: food desert.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know the right balance to strike here. On the one hand, I fervently believe that businesses shouldn&#x27;t be forced to act against their interests. On the other hand, though, the sum of these individual actions produces an unacceptable outcome.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some balance of regulation, incentives, and public-private partnerships that would strike a good balance here, but both the extreme solutions (Groceries can locate wherever they want vs. groceries <i>have</i> to establish branches in food deserts) seem to be totally unsatisfactory, at least in my mind.')
