While you may not have encountered it, some libraries <i>do</i> label books for content[0]:<p>&gt; Some libraries block access to certain materials by placing physical or virtual barriers between the user and those materials. For example, <i>materials are sometimes labeled for content</i> or placed in a “locked case,” “adults only,” “restricted shelf,” or “high-demand” collection.<p>(emphasis mine)<p>Here’s another real-world example. In the physical world, book publishers often print updated editions of books with corrections, distribute errata, attach disclaimers[1], and sometimes recall books entirely[2]. (If you feel the urge to split hairs here about how one entity is a third-party publisher and the other is a third-party library, please think seriously on how this distinction is relevant to adding context.)<p>The concerns that the ALA have with labelling in the physical world don’t apply to what IA is doing, since IA are not creating barriers for patrons to access content, they are just <i>adding context</i>—as book publishers, museum curators, librarians, film distributors, documentarians, historians, and others have done for centuries.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ala.org&#x2F;advocacy&#x2F;intfreedom&#x2F;librarybill&#x2F;interpretations&#x2F;restrictedaccess" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ala.org&#x2F;advocacy&#x2F;intfreedom&#x2F;librarybill&#x2F;interpret...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;publisher-to-put-asterisk-on-primates-of-park-avenue.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;publisher-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;books&#x2F;naomi-wolf-outrages-errors.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;books&#x2F;naomi-wolf-outrages...</a>')
