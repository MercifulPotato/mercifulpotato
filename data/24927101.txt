CoCs are aimed at providing a basis to persecute those who arguably don&#x27;t comply with a given notion of acceptable conduct, punish them for their sins, and turn them into examples to enforce a chilling effect on the community.<p>This example shows a CoC working exactly as it was intended to work.<p>People have turned a blind eye to the oppressive and abusive nature of the CoC concept because they tend to believe that it can only ever oppress those we deem undesirable. But unless you&#x27;re the one doing the oppression, nothing ensures that the rules only apply to those you don&#x27;t like.')
