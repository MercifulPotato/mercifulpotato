I live in a smaller city, not really close to a big metropolitan area, but I haven&#x27;t seen a thermal camera in use yet.  I see they are available on Amazon, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is an issue of availability.  Are these being used by businesses in other areas of the U.S.?  Seems like it would be a no-brainer to use these to non-invasivly screen patrons.')
