When you learn something well you don&#x27;t forget, it is like riding a bike. If you learned how to ride a bike 10 yards and then stopped and never did it again then you would forget how to do it, saying &quot;I passed the bike riding test when I was 10, I don&#x27;t need to do it again&quot; isn&#x27;t a good defense.<p>I mean, why did you even go to college if you intended to just forget everything afterwards instead of learning the things properly for life? I&#x27;d rather not hire people who just do the work necessary to pass and get the degree and don&#x27;t want to learn more.')
