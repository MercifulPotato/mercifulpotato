It feels like an absurdly niche feature to focus on though.<p>The way I would personally do it I would maybe create a multiplayer game and for each ten cameras spin up a game client instance.<p>According to the other comments here it looks like Amazon wanted to create some type of bizarro system where if you use their engine you had to use AWS as your cloud back end. Which does sound pretty horrible, like I can&#x27;t even do a HTTP request to get weather data unless it goes through AWS ?')
