Interpreting that to mean that all participants in these discussions are hypocrites or anti-China is either an emotional reaction or a failure to consider the truth of diversity on a forum.<p>Some people view high profile Chinese business people to effectively be extensions of the Chinese political class. Look at what happened to Canada after they arrested Meng Manzhou for the rationale behind these views. The success of a Chinese company in a foreign market should be considered as a potential security risk for any security analyst that still knows the meaning of the word dilligence. Whether it is only potential or actuality is another matter.<p>As for lying low, some people are still hoping to hear from the panchen lama; it is totally rational for people to consider that China will arrest critics or people it views as risks and that those people may never be heard from again or their apparent freedom may be staged. There are many other examples. People in the West have a concept of due process that the government--and perhaps the people--of China does not seem to accept as reasonable or necessary.<p>All of these views are possible to hold simultaneously with varying degrees of nuance, and certainly some people hold some or none of these views again with varying degrees of nuance. There is an understanding of China and how China does not necessarily share some things viewed as ideals by some participants here. There is no West vs China, because &quot;the West&quot; is not a unified set of ideals or viewpoints, as any cursory survey of views on healthcare, military, the treatment of Assange, etc. will quickly reveal.')
