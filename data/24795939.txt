If you are working on something yourself and not as part of a team  then the age-old save-document-and-reopen-elsewhere method could work as well as it ever did. You don&#x27;t have to have it open on your phone, laptop, desktop, and fire stick all at the same time with immediate sync. Have your offline documents on each machine, automatically back them up to &quot;the cloud&quot;. If you edit one in two places because of disconnection issues then do a manual merge like we did in the old days (hopefully it won&#x27;t happen often enough to be <i>that</i> much of a pain). In version 2+ of your product, once the base features are proven viable (and for commercial use, profitable), start to worry about automatic sync&#x2F;merge&#x2F;other with a granularity smaller than a whole document.<p>A lot of offline-first efforts are trying to solve every possible use case from day one, from single person with a laptop to huge international teams all working on the same asset at the same time and everything in between &amp; beside, and in that direction madness lies. Implementing a useful, viable, relatively minimal product, and expanding its capabilities later would make more sense, though of course that suggestion is immediately countered by fears that the next clone of the idea will implement something first and be crowned king leading the thought process back to &quot;must do it all, must do it all now&quot;.')
