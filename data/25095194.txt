Item(by='matz1', descendants=None, kids=[25099839], score=None, time=1605384443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094706, text='&gt;You&#x27;ve found a fringe group sponsored by an American right-wing think tank<p>So you just dismiss many of epidemiological or public health experts and accused them selling out.<p>&gt;When in fact, again, all public health experts agree that lockdowns, masks and social distancing are crucial to avoid an even larger tragedy than today.<p>Not all public health experts agree, as I just show you the site. Currently it has signature from 11976 medical and public health scientist, 34570 medical practitioners.<p>&gt; Population vs individual-level impactsSome of the interventions here can have a significant impact on the individuals who are affected, but a relatively minor effect at the population level as they are comparativelyrare. Whilst we have tried to maintain a population-level approach (e.g. evidenced through our use of the population indicatorR) the weaker, anecdotal or theoretical arguments on the evidence for harms is often at the individual-level. Adding up these individual potential harms is more difficult. The model provided by ONS does attempt to do this, though as with all models there are limitations to its scope and accuracy.<p>They says it difficult to measure harm, and they didn&#x27;t even attempt to do so.  They says Weaker evidence for harms as it&#x27;s on the individual level. This paragraph pretty much sums up the dismal science of infectious disease epidemiology. It is massively focused only on a few metrics, puts them all into unchallengeable, un-falsifiable models and then dismisses negative impacts as not being &quot;population level&quot;. So basically, Sure the restrictions we advised resulted in SOME suicides, SOME domestic violence, SOME horrible mental health impacts, SOME livelihoods destroyed, SOME people dying alone, SOME relationships ending, SOME relationships never starting, SOME educations missed, SOME rights violated, SOME protests quashed etc etc. But none of these issues in isolation was ever as significantly significant as our modelled, unfalsifiable, and tightly qualified impact of ALL of these restrictions on R.<p>Please stop advocating against measures that harm hundreds of thousands of live. Many epidemiological or public health experts oppose the lockdown policy.<p>&gt;As citizens of democratic countries, our place is NOT to question experts recommendations and risk estimates<p>So you only agree the experts that fit your view.<p>Yes, I care more about saving human lives thats why I oppose this lockdown policy. You can&#x27;t just dismiss economic health. Its closely connected to human lives.')
