Item(by='nextos', descendants=None, kids=[24850876], score=None, time=1603304980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850528, text='Temporary Containers has an option &quot;Delete no longer needed Temporary Containers&quot; which defaults to 15 minutes, but can also be set to immediate.<p>Are you setting this option to something else?<p>Temporary Containers works really well for me. I have per domain isolation, which only breaks very very few sites (Gmail and Outlook 365). For those I have regular persistent containers. Alternatively, I can always open a new private window where I don&#x27;t have this plugin active.<p>uBlock Origin + Temporary Containers + ClearURLs are a great setup for privacy and security. Actually, I don&#x27;t need much else aside from a VPN and a few settings in my user.js.<p>The only thing I miss is Vimperator. Modern alternatives are full of glitches because of inherent limitations in the WebExtensions API.')
