Today the ideal of the Open Society is in tatters largely because of systematic and relentless attacks on the truth.<p>I think the seeds of many of our problems today are found in the birth of modern marketing and and the manufacture of &quot;needs&quot; to create a consumer society.  And also, I think that the very idea of &quot;intellectual property&quot; is at odds with a commitment to truth and a truly open society.  This combined with the fact that the primary beneficiaries of these two concepts also hold most of the economic power in our world create the fundamental distortion that has led to where we are today.')
