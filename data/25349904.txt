Additionally, flightcrews can set the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches on the center control stand to CUTOUT to stop and disable MCAS.<p>So pilots would be able to override MCAS (and they could before, though it was less explicit). They can&#x27;t routinely override it at take-off or landing because 737 MAX without MCAS is non-compliant and:<p>&gt; when MCAS and Speed Trim are disabled, SPEED TRIM FAIL is annunciated and a maintenance item is recorded.<p>e: Also, there were changes for when&#x2F;how MCAS is in effect')
