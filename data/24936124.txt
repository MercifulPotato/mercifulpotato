Item(by='hirundo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604006791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936024, text='&gt; I think if I had to do it again I&#x27;d just store the entire API response in a single &quot;document&quot; column and query it dynamically as needed.<p>You&#x27;d quickly find that it is a lot of code to parse that column and read and write data to it, compared to a normalized database wrapped in ActiveRecord. I&#x27;ve done just that, and it&#x27;s just a lot more work in the long run. A relational database really is a good thing when you want to slice and dice that data and keep it consistent.')
