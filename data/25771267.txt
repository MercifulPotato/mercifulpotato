If I go from German to France to Spain, I&#x27;m almost certainly not going to see the same grocery store chains. In the US, there are regional chains, but also a high proportion of homogeneity. In Europe you have strong national and cultural differences that lead to economies more isolated from the whole. In the US, there&#x27;s regional differences, but I can order at a Starbucks pretty easily in all 50 states without breaking a sweat.<p>Maybe why US brands tend to get big in the US and then export overseas? US has a homogenous and large market, which brands can make a lot of money in and develop a solid profitable base. That&#x27;s probably very hard to do in Europe.')
