When Cantwell and Chris Rogers wrote the pilot for Halt and Catch Fire, they had little in mind but jumping on board one of the shows they already liked. &quot;We&#x27;re both in our early 30s, so the shows that made us wanna do this were the great &#x27;difficult men&#x27; shows: The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire,&quot; Rogers says. &quot;We wrote the pilot in a way that was set up to ape them: Joe McMillan is a traditional antihero, and the world is organized around him in that way.&quot; But when the pilot was bought by AMC for production, rather than simply used as a staffing script to land &quot;The Chrises&quot; (as Halt&#x27;s cast and crew universally call them) in a writers&#x27; room for a preexisting series, things changed. &quot;As we got in there and started doing it, we had a writers&#x27; groove.
