In addition to defining DFS, it also provides for Transmit Power Control (TPC). I was under the impression that it&#x27;s an FCC requirement for 5Ghz 802.11a Wifi devices.<p>Here, it appears to be working as expected. I see messages like &quot;Limiting TX power to 27 (30 - 3) dBm as advertised&quot; in the kernel logs of my linux devices.<p>Is TPC not well supported?<p>edit: Whoops, I think TPC isn&#x27;t really that interesting, and I&#x27;m confusing it with DTPC which is Cisco-proprietary.')
