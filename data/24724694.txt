That act of organization likely implies that the Java API (taken as a whole) constitutes a copyrightable work, even if the individual method signatures are not.<p>The problem with this theory is that class and package declarations are still just recipes. There is a recipe for making chocolate chips. Then there is a recipe for making chocolate chip cookies where one of the ingredients is chocolate chips. It&#x27;s recursive but it&#x27;s not fundamentally different. Saying you can copyright a recipe for chocolate chip cookies because it&#x27;s just organizing the recipes for chocolate chips and butter and brown sugar is pretty ridiculous.')
