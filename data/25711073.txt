This is the beauty of the web. They can scale it up as traffic grows and deal with all those headaches if they want. I fully support the owners of Parler if they want to do this.<p>Twitter, FB, AWS, Google eventually came along and said “ok, you want to share your ideas or host a community, we can make that really easy with our tools and platforms!” You can post what you want without worrying about servers in your basement. But in exchange for that convenience you have to accept that they reserve the right to terminate the contract at any time. They should not be required to help you promote ideas that they deem harmful or toxic.<p>So Parler can go back to how we used to do things in the 90s...it’s a little harder but not <i>that</i> hard. No one is being censored. This is simply a few companies deciding to terminate a relationship with one of their clients.')
