Educate yourself by listening to people who invented it, not Java consultants or FP zealots.<p>OOP is about interacting with things via interfaces and messages, rather than data. An OOP solution to inconsistencies of this sort would be an interface that either automatically corrects inconsistencies or throws errors when you try to introduce them. <i>The whole point</i> of OOP approach is that you&#x27;re not locked into a single data representation, so, for example, you can improve how you store data without re-engineering everything in your system that relies on that data.')
