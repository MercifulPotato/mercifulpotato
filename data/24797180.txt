It&#x27;s more likely to have that effect on people who were already in denial, of their belief system, or relationship, or political views, because it often forces you to confront the hidden&#x2F;denied parts of your psyche. This can be incredibly liberating for some people, scary for others, while for people with latent mental health issues it can be downright dangerous.<p>For this reason, I would usually recommend mdma as a first drug experience since it has a similar liberating effect for many people but also makes you feel loved and at one with the world.')
