I think it&#x27;s the culture. We used to have a monoculture in the US (basically whatever the TV told us).<p>Nowadays we have an almost uncountable number of subcultures operating independently, and many of them despise each other. I do think that many of the new subcultures in the US praise personal hedonism over any kind of collective responsibility.<p>As long as we allow people to worship themselves without thinking about external costs, this will probably continue.<p>Another factor is that technology tends to centralize control. And the people running the technology want us to be like this. Medical costs skyrocket, they make money. Smartphone use skyrockets, they make money. etc.')
