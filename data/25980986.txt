Item(by='Youden', descendants=None, kids=[25981227], score=None, time=1612116609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979521, text='&gt; you&#x27;re basically saying that if you&#x27;re not looking to learn and completely disregard the veracity of your own experience in every statement you do, you&#x27;re better off not saying anything at all.<p>That&#x27;s really not what I&#x27;m trying to say at all. If I had to condense it down to one sentence it would be: &quot;if there&#x27;s a difference in opinion between two reasonable people, it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;ve had different experiences; you&#x27;ll have a more productive discussion by finding out what they are than simply stating your opinions&quot;.<p>&gt; It strikes me as exceedingly dishonest to pretend that you&#x27;re genuinely interested in someone&#x27;s opinion if you already know you strongly disagree with it, and it&#x27;s by no means a requirement to lack an opinion to have a respectful debate. Telling someone that you believe they&#x27;re wrong is not an insult.<p>If you&#x27;re not interested in somebody&#x27;s opinion, what value could there possibly be in having a discussion with them?')
