Fortunately RH had sufficient funding for that, but it&#x27;s conveivable that the next time if there&#x27;s an even bigger collateral call by the clearing houses (or some other issue) they won&#x27;t be able to cover it-- sort of like Bear Sterns in 2008, which collapsed more because of lack of confidence than actual liabilities, which it could otherwise have weathered, but panic set it, they lacked credit necessary to stay afloat, and were basically liquidated at crazy fire sale prices. (I&#x27;m Not saying they didn&#x27;t have a lot of responsibility in their downfall: they played fast &amp; loose, and when that collapsed it caused a general panic on them as a whole)')
