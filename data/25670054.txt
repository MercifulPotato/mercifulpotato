AoT compilation is usually done on a completely different machine, or at least at time other than when the application is run.<p>If your applications were recompiled every night while you slept, you wouldn&#x27;t mind so much.  In fact, that&#x27;s what the latest Android Runtime does.  Running applications dump profile information to the filesystem, and when the phone is plugged in and idle, the runtime goes back and re-optimizes the binaries for your usage pattern.  Presumably, there&#x27;s something like a statistical distance metric[0] to estimate how much the profiles changed since the last compilation, to avoid wasteful recompilation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statistical_distance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statistical_distance</a>')
