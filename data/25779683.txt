Not only is that community sizable, but it&#x27;s experienced- surveys of attendees at my conference (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;empex.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;empex.co</a>) consistently show that 50% have &gt;5 years and 30% have &gt;10 years in the industry.<p>Elixirists really are senior developers and Elixir is usually their fourth or fifth language.  If it&#x27;s taking your hires years to get up to speed, then I would look at your hiring practices before blaming the community.<p>As for libraries, I challenge anyone to name an unmet dependency in Elixir that is 1) trivial to implement and 2) not for some niche application.<p>My company has built a scalable platform with 3 engineers.  I don&#x27;t even think about maintenance, I just think about delivering new features.  So business wins are higher velocity + lower hosting costs + less downtime + senior team.  You don&#x27;t need to be WhatsApp to appreciate those benefits.')
