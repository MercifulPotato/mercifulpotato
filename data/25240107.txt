One trick I find useful is to use Go modules (and therefore goimports, not goreturns) and structure your build so that it <i>looks</i> like a standard Go module build, even though it&#x27;s really being built by some other system. In other words, it&#x27;s a mix of making the build system conform to Go norms and making your IDE adapt to the remaining differences.')
