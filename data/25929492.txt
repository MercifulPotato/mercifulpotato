How are the decisions communicated? Who decides? Do initiatives steamroll people and teams? Are people able to filter up suggestions or start their own initiatives? Can decisions get made team-by-team, or do they have to be made for the whole company? Do they change their mind when they get new evidence? Do people change their mind too much? Do they have trouble saying &quot;no&quot;? If they want to tell you &quot;no,&quot; do they actually say it? Are they too afraid to make decisions that can change the culture, and just kinda drift?<p>As an IC engineer, this is what I have the least control over (and can find the most frustrating). So I want to hear exactly how broad change happens. It helps me imagine how it&#x27;ll feel to spend four years in the environment.<p>This is the kind of question that you need to ask everyone. You won&#x27;t get a good answer from one person. You want to ask a few people and see if their stories line up.')
