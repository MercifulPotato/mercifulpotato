I never saw a truly dark sky or the milky way until I was in my early 30s. Now I take regular road trips out west to experience it.<p>People are so oblivious to light pollution. They don&#x27;t realize how absurdly bright our lights are and how little they&#x27;re actually needed. At minimum, they shouldn&#x27;t be lighting the undersides of airplanes.<p>I didn&#x27;t know what else I could do about this, so I inserted a light pollution level in my indie game. You have to replace these hideously bright outdoor lamps with full cutoff fixtures to gradually get the stars back. I wish there was more I could do.<p>The problem has to be educational. If the public valued the night sky, they would be amenable to fixing it. But how do you accomplish that if you&#x27;re not any good at marketing or communicating?')
