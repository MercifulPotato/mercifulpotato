The study I saw put alcohol at the top of the list, due to the social cost of drunken fights, spousal abuse, and DUIs.<p>I’m sure there are some public safety issues that we should deal with for the various “hard” drugs decriminalized here, but I also find it fascinating how much social desirability affects which drugs we decide are a problem that require special treatment, since I’ve never seen anyone recommend house arrest or curfews for alcoholics.')
