But they&#x27;re not.<p>Right now, to the extent that they&#x27;re conditioned on anything at all (and I&#x27;m going to refrain from a broader critique of Trump&#x27;s goals and methods of negotiation here), they&#x27;re conditioned on trade balance, intellectual property, currency manipulation, 5G, and the like.
