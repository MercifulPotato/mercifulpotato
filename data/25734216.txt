Item(by='tome', descendants=None, kids=[25735052], score=None, time=1610391444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733544, text='&gt; But my argument is this is not often done. I&#x27;ve seen tons of giant IO functions wrapped in do notation. Generally, no big attempt is made to segregate IO or side effects away from pure logic. Everyone just writes a monad and starts using do notation.<p>Yeah, &quot;functional core&#x2F;imperative shell&quot; or &quot;pushing IO to the edges&quot; is a weird myth.  Really the strength of Haskell is &quot;functional core&#x2F;IO code carefully threaded through functional core&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s a good descriptive slogan for that?  &quot;Functional pipework&#x2F;imperative reactants&quot;, invoking chemical engineering?<p>To cycle back to your point, I don&#x27;t think the failure of this slogan actually points to any weakness in Haskell.')
