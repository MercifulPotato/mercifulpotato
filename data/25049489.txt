Psychosomatic issues are absolutely legitimate. Knowing it&#x27;s psychosomatic means there may be other avenues of addressing it than if it wasn&#x27;t, but calling the issues &quot;not legitimate&quot; is very problematic, akin to telling someone with depression &quot;just think happy thoughts&quot;.')
