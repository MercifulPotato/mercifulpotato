It might weaken the basis for copyright <i>applied to computer programs</i> entirely, but that&#x27;s a very different thing.<p>&gt; if the unique expression of those Java APIs are not protectable by copyright<p>In order for use to be &quot;fair use&quot;, the thing used must, in fact, be protectable by copyright.')
