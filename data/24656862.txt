However, there is one situation where background checks are mandatory and that is when you work with children below the age of 15. You have to pass this check not only for a proper job but also if you are doing volunteer work with children (e.g. sports association, scouts etc.)<p>The check is only for crimes against children so you can be convicted for violent crimes and pass this check.<p>Any entries in your criminal record will no longer appear in background checks after some time (depending on the severity of your offense). However, any offense against a child will always appear on this special background check no matter how long ago it was committed.<p>You have to approve that this background check is performed but if you can&#x27;t produce a clean &quot;child certificate&quot; then you are prohibited from working with children by law.')
