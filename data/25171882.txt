For some data generating process from parameter <i>m</i> to a random dataset <i>D</i> (random like if you do the same experiment again, you’ll get different data), the probability that <i>i(D)</i> contains <i>m</i> is x%. That’s the definition of an x% CI.<p>In my example <i>i(D)</i> is a function of the data (a function of the ordering), and <i>D</i> is a random dataset. Since it’s iid by assumption (sneakily also assuming the probability of an exact repeat is zero), the probability that the interval contains all numbers is 93.75% (1-1&#x2F;2^4). Otherwise it’s the empty set.<p>Unpacking that, suppose you have a real number <i>m</i>. The probability that <i>i(D)</i> will contain <i>m</i> (with D as the random variable) is 93.75%, so it is a valid confidence interval for <i>m</i>.<p><i>m</i> could be the population mean, the population median, your dog’s age, whatever. The interval depends on the data, but not on the parameter, and the definition of a CI says that’s <i>fine</i>.<p>It’s a demonstration that definition of a CI alone isn’t really useful for reasoning about a parameter given an interval. You need to know more about the specific data generating process and function <i>i</i> that led to it in order to make sure it’s useful.')
