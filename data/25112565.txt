I really love this concept for two reasons.<p>First I&#x27;m always fascinated by smart solutions that make use of existing free (as in beer) infrastructures to provide a service with open-source software. In this way we truly get FOSS.<p>Second, I really like the idea that the information on where the shortened url redirects to is publicly available. I know that solutions like bitly.com do provide a way to preview the shortend url, but I think this is just more transparent, although admittedly a little bit less obvious.')
