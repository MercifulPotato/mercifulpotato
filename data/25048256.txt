And incidentally, that&#x27;s also the expected mode of acquisition (vs. feature films for instance, which are almost as trivial to copy for free but discouraged culturally).<p>With physical goods or services, knowing the recipe or at least composition is also often desirable, but the actual product&#x2F;service itself is hard to replicate and brand inertia is heavier.<p>I believe some small changes in the delivery methods associated with a decent cultural shift could bring open-source software development into a position more similar to older creative professions. For instance, stronger security concerns could incentivize users to subscribe to privileged, paid update channels directly from the developers (like done by Unreal Engine or the TradingView charting library).')
