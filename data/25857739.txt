There are a few RTS games (Halo Wars for example) but not many. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely that it&#x27;s due to the hardware though - I was playing RTS games on a 486 in the mid-90s. The Xbox is more than capable of running them. It&#x27;s almost certainly just that gamers who buy consoles choose other games.')
