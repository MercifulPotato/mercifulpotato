So they not only are bad at teaching it, the primary thing they teach their students is that &quot;Math is scary stuff and something to be feared.&quot;<p>And they teach it to really young kids who are very impressionable and don&#x27;t have some means to avoid being brainwashed into believing it.<p>My one and only goal with homeschooling my son was to get him past the math phobia he had developed and teach him &quot;Math is your friend.&quot; He&#x27;s genuinely bad with numbers, but he no longer has a math phobia and has a better grasp of the concepts than a lot of people, even though he can&#x27;t calculate anything in his head and routinely asks me or his brother to calculate it for him.<p>A math phobia is <i>crippling</i> and many people never get over it.')
