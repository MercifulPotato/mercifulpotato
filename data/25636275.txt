Cutting a person open without their consent  could be murder or a lifesaving surgery depending on context. Breaking and entering is justified if you did it to save a child out of a burning building, breaking someone&#x27;s bones is OK if it happens during CPR (varies by country).<p>Your right to privacy conflicts with the State&#x27;s desire for surveillance, your right for self-defence can clear your of charges of manslaughter, and depending on exact circumstances the judge will decide if your actions were justified or if you belong in jail.')
