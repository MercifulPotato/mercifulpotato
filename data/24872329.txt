Item(by='klmadfejno', descendants=None, kids=[24872415], score=None, time=1603477527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869429, text='I&#x27;m in a relatively high status career, followed that just right path, and more or less planned it all out since middle school. For what its worth, I don&#x27;t give a crap about status. I think most of my peers don&#x27;t either, at least relative to the past. I think materialism and arbitrary status seeking is one the decline for the young professional. High end professional fashion and fancy watches are nowhere to be seen in my office (well, pre-covid at least). Sure, there&#x27;s social media doing its thing, but in the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s importance to the average person&#x27;s self image is small.<p>I do care about access to high paying wages with work that gradually grows more high level over time. I do think working at a startup could be more fun, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be a good idea worth doing, ever, given what I&#x27;ve got now.<p>I am happy with what I&#x27;ve got. I make a chunk less than $200k, which isn&#x27;t close to the very top tiers, but it&#x27;s way more than I need. Yeah, probably could have gotten even more going a CS FANG route or a lucrative start up that just works. But personally I think everything more or less went as planned and I think that&#x27;s great.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go assuming that folks in similar positions aren&#x27;t aware of the calculus here either. If someone says running a startup sounds really interesting, that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a lot of cool stuff in it. The same could be said of being a commercial fisherman, or being a detective, or running a small restaurant. I mean running a small restaurant sounds awesome. But it also probably sucks. If someone asks me about it, I&#x27;m likely to focus on the positives. I&#x27;m not exactly being asked to sign my name on a career form here. If you decide to call me out on not actually wanting to drop my lucrative career for that startup&#x2F;restaurant&#x2F;fish boat, that&#x27;s not me being sheepish, that&#x27;s me trying to downplay an uncomfortable situation coupled with an apparent assumption that I&#x27;m unaware of my own vanity for status :&#x2F;')
