I think a lot of the kickback against apologising that we&#x27;re seeing is coming from the numerous public examples of this tactic and the follow-up where any good-faith apology will be used to make a further example of the heretic.<p>This is rarely about the apology itself, but about establishing that something wrong has happened to begin with. The fact is, a lot of pretty messed up stuff routinely happens and is simply taken as a given. The apology is simply a marker that some behavior will no longer be considered acceptable. It&#x27;s hardly even a measure of accountability, unless someone is so egotistical that taking responsibility is personally harmful to them.')
