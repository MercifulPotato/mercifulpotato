They obviously showed it on a Tesla but I thought it was really well made in that they talked about other designs and what will be in common and what won’t. I am not a first responder so there is little direct reason for me to know this but I spent several hours watching the videos anyways simply because they were so interesting and so well made.<p>Similarly, I really liked the video from an ER doctor who races motorcycles about responding to motorcycle crashes. Highly recommend learning more about this as you very well might be the first person there and the dangers are non-obvious. And of course I highly recommend taking a CPR course and carrying a first aid kit, including a mouth to mouth membrane, with you in your vehicle. You never know when you’ll be in a position to save a life.<p>Edit: Tesla emergency responder resources: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;firstresponders" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;firstresponders</a><p>Motorcycle crash response: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MsZBXlTHPCg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MsZBXlTHPCg</a><p>Red Cross CPR certification: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redcross.org&#x2F;take-a-class&#x2F;cpr&#x2F;cpr-training&#x2F;cpr-certification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redcross.org&#x2F;take-a-class&#x2F;cpr&#x2F;cpr-training&#x2F;cpr-c...</a>')
