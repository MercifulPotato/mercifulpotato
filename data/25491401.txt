Unity aside, GNOME is bold enough to stick out and do something different. The GTK human interface guidelines result in apps that are something different (also usable!) and the activities view is a genuinely awesome approach to alt+tab.<p>KDE is just windows and a bunch of panels. It&#x27;s expertly put together, but there&#x27;s really nothing more to it than that. Rainmeter can do much the same that it can on Windows.')
