Often bad.<p>I disagree with this part, respectfully of course, based on my own personal experience. I can see how external forces do lead to poor decision making and short sightedness; on the other hand I also think of the vast ways I&#x27;ve grown and new things I&#x27;ve learned from designers who drew something I originally thought was impossible, or clients who wanted something built in a language I&#x27;d never had any interest in using before. Generally speaking these external forces may push you beyond the limits of your own imagination.')
