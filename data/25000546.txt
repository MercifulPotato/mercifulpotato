Item(by='izacus', descendants=None, kids=[25000688, 25006306], score=None, time=1604600396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24997293, text='There is a huge hole in functionality of IPv6 in most common networking equipment. I have a Mikrotik and the IPv6 functionality is signifiantly worse than the IPv4 one:<p>- There&#x27;s no caching DNS and I can&#x27;t set static DNS entries for IPv6<p>- There&#x27;s no way to use DHCPv6 to give out addresses.<p>- Because of lack of DHCPv6, there&#x27;s not way to give out static addresses to devices on LAN and manage them centrally.<p>- Because of lack of DHCPv6 and static addressing, it&#x27;s really annoying to configure firewall to allow outside access to services on LAN devices (on IPv4 you either have static entries or NAT-PMP).<p>- There&#x27;s no fasttrack functionality so IPv6 traffic will max out CPU and prevent me from fully using my Gbit fiber line.<p>- There&#x27;s no UI way of announcing DNS to clients via DHCPv6 - you can set some option amanually but it&#x27;s far from setting a nice UI entry like for DNS.<p>And yes, those are all holes in my routers Firmware, but it&#x27;s been YEARS and they&#x27;re still lacking. Other SOHO routers aren&#x27;t faring any better, I haven&#x27;t seen these features configurable on any of them.<p>I have a LAN which has a PiHole and a Synology NAS at home + some entertainment devices. Configuring IPv6 to allow access to same services as IPv4 from WAN via public DNS has been practically impossible, undocumented and huge pain. For pretty much no gain and loss of bandwidth.')
