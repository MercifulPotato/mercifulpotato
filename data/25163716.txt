The only thing I&#x27;m afraid of that I&#x27;ll somehow put me into the category of business gurus like Grant Cardone &amp; others which I&#x27;d really hate to because I don&#x27;t want to be associated with any of them.<p>Of course I won&#x27;t be selling any courses &amp; stuff, but is this enough to not become a &quot;business guru?&quot;.<p>People who managed to do something meaningful before they started talking about business (take Naval) have a successful businesses&#x2F;careers so they are always known as entrepreneurs&#x2F;investors first. I don&#x27;t have any successful business to my name yet, so that&#x27;s another element that I&#x27;m afraid will put me into this business guru category.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts. What are actually the differences between an entrepreneur sharing what he&#x27;s learned so far and a business guru?<p>Thanks')
