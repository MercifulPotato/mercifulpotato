If your goal is to produce then your method is probably good for dipping your toes in the water if you have literally no music experience whatsoever. Most digital production doesn&#x27;t require you to play complicated passages for a long period of time, so you&#x27;d succeed in realizing your goals on that front.<p>But if your goal is to perform; sure, you&#x27;ll be able to play simple compositions, but anything complex will pose a challenge without a teacher (or even good material that makes you aware of what to look out for). I think that&#x27;s what your critics are trying to point out.<p>The real problem here is you&#x27;re equating learning music theory with &#x27;learning the piano&#x27;.')
