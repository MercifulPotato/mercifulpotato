After 30+ years of my humble existence in this universe, these are the times I want so badly to see a glimpse of the future, a scene from 10.000 years later. SO, SO curious. Thinking is leading me to nowhere with my limited capacity, dreaming with mostly unrelated fantasies and visions. A real one would be nice, even from the exact location I&#x27;m sitting now, the street, the sea nearby, everything around, how they evolved.<p>Mind-blowing universe, amazing planet, very little time sadly.')
