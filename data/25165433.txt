Just for anyone else, though: keep an open mind and open ears about these kinds of classes.  There is a whole lot of &quot;fun STEM&quot; out there that is really... not.  Nothing is more soul-crushing than something that&#x27;s supposed to be fun being mindless small steps way below one&#x27;s ability.<p>I do my very best to -not- have my classes be in that category, most of the time.')
