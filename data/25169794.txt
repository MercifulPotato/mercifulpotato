As to on-time&#x2F;on-budget rates, I&#x27;d love to see some data. Significant cost overruns and delays certainly still happen. E.g. this non-CA building was at least 20% over and a year late: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inquirer.com&#x2F;philly&#x2F;business&#x2F;comcast&#x2F;comcast-tower-cost-overruns-philadelphia-four-seasons-20180418.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inquirer.com&#x2F;philly&#x2F;business&#x2F;comcast&#x2F;comcast-tow...</a><p>And I&#x27;ll note that the Empire State Building was not a standard office building of the day, but the tallest building in the world. (A title it held for 40 years.) People building today have an 80-year advantage, plus the rise of computers. You&#x27;d think we&#x27;d be able to do at least as well with every building, but we don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s in stark contrast to building safety, for example, where we&#x27;re very good about learning lessons about keeping buildings from collapsing.')
