It&#x27;s no fun to be envious, and while people think it must be enjoyable to be envied, it&#x27;s really not. When you&#x27;re aware of it at all, it&#x27;s just uncomfortable. It&#x27;s a shitty emotion on both sides, but it&#x27;s great for capitalism.<p>Comparing yourself against others is a loser&#x27;s game. If the person is better, you lose. If the person comes out worse, you&#x27;re taking a dip by comparing yourself at all to that person, so you still lose.')
