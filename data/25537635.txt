So Chelsea Manning talking about and releasing videos of war crimes and the deliberate shooting of reuters journalists by US soldiers is considered terrorism by this logic.<p>Here’s the idea behind stochastic terrorism:<p>A leader or organization uses rhetoric in the mass media against a group of people.\nThis rhetoric, while hostile or hateful, doesn’t explicitly tell someone to carry out an act of violence against that group, but a person, feeling threatened, is motivated to do so as a result.\nThat individual act of political violence can’t be predicted as such, but that violence will happen is much more probable thanks to the rhetoric.\nThis rhetoric is thus called stochastic terrorism because of the way it incites random violence.')
