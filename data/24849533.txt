Thanks for this thorough and thoughtful review.<p>We are totally serious about building a world-class, privacy-first, free analytics product. At risk of HN cliche, this is our &quot;early work&quot;. We are actively working to fix many of the rough edges mentioned here; if we had waited to fix all of them before shipping, we never would have shipped!<p>For folks who haven&#x27;t seen it, I suggest checking out our launch blog post[0] which gives some more context around edge vs browser analytics (spoiler: we do both!), why we count visits the way we do, and how we handle bot traffic.<p>We know we have work to do on the &quot;jagged lines&quot; problem. For some low-traffic websites, we might show noisier, low-resolution  data than is ideal. (We&#x27;ve artificially constrained our analytics to query a maximum of 7 days at a time because this problem is exacerbated with longer time ranges.)<p>My colleague Jamie wrote a nice blog post about how and why we sample data [1]. In short: we have an existing customer base of 25 million+ Internet priorities, whose traffic volume spans 9 orders of magnitude! Sampling data is an elegant approach that allows us to serve fast, flexible analytics for all our customers. Sampling shouldn&#x27;t be feared, but we know we can do better in some cases. We&#x27;ve recently merged some deep-in-the-weeds improvements to ClickHouse [2] that should result in improved resolution. And we&#x27;re currently working to store full-resolution data for the smallest websites.<p>Happy to address any other specific points that folks have questions about.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;free-privacy-first-analytics-for-a-better-web&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;free-privacy-first-analytics-for...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;explaining-cloudflares-abr-analytics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;explaining-cloudflares-abr-analy...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ClickHouse&#x2F;ClickHouse&#x2F;pull&#x2F;14221" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ClickHouse&#x2F;ClickHouse&#x2F;pull&#x2F;14221</a>')
