I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s somewhere that actively tracks this stuff, especially the popular ones.<p>The park &amp; diamond helmet for example (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiegogo.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;park-diamond-foldable-bike-helmet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiegogo.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;park-diamond-foldable-bik...</a>) raised over 2.5MM EUR and I lost track of how late it is but they&#x27;ve easily sent 10-15 updates saying &quot;sorry, we didn&#x27;t get it in time for [MONTH], but we&#x27;ll be ready in [MONTH+2], promise!&quot;.
