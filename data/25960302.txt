Item(by='bennettfeely', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611943441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959646, text='The &quot;Avoiding animation pollution&quot; section has a few minor typos,<p>`transition: * 0.6s ease` won&#x27;t work anyway, `*` is a selector, they&#x27;re looking for a value of `all`. Omitting the transition property all together (i.e. `transition: 1s`) is what people often do but this is bad practice for the reasons they stated.<p>Also, for the CSS examples I believe they mean to set `.animated:hover` to `opacity: 1;` not 0.<p>I like the idea of using an SVG mask to make a transparent background on the jpg.')
