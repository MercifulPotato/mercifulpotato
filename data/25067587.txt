Turns out the HTTP cache is <i>complex</i> so I gave up.<p>If fully implemented, it ought to be able to cut render times dramatically, and to eclipse the performance benefit of cdn&#x27;s (where the main benefit is reducing latency for static assets).<p>There are potential privacy concerns, but no moreso than first party cookies.')
