Maybe these companies are ruthless and evil, but to all the people who are thinking &quot;yeah I just watch the movies in my basement and it&#x27;s better&quot; - I think you&#x27;re missing the point.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in multiple cities where the movie theater wasn&#x27;t just about watching movies.  The racial makeup of my area is overwhelmingly white, but when I go to movies easily half the people in the theater are people of color.  It&#x27;s a constructive way for teenagers and younger people to spend their time and hang out, particularly if they come from poorer neighborhoods with limited options, or they have many siblings at home and they need a reprieve.<p>With the theaters, schools and other obvious young-person activities closed, petty crime where I live is way up, mostly being committed by young people of color.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised - without constructive things to do the young people will still find amusement.  Young affluent teenagers have video games and entire basements to play them in.  Poorer kids don&#x27;t have those options.<p>Personally, I wish there&#x27;d be less glee over this and other closures.  I was never a fan of the term &quot;privilege&quot; - but rich white tech people really do need a lesson in empathy.')
