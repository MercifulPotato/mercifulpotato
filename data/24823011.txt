Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24825981, 24823409], score=None, time=1603077130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822909, text='<i>&gt; you can observe what happens as you approach it</i><p>Yes, but you cannot extrapolate from this to say that the time lapse for a photon would be zero. A photon is not the limit of objects with mass going closer and closer to the speed of light, because &quot;closer and closer to the speed of light&quot; is frame-dependent, but a photon&#x27;s speed being c is not. I can find an inertial frame in which each of your objects is at rest, and in that frame, <i>you</i> are the one who is &quot;close to c&quot; (in the opposite direction). But that doesn&#x27;t mean your elapsed time approaches zero. By contrast, it is impossible to find any frame in which a photon is at rest. The two types of objects are fundamentally different.<p>In more technical language, the action of Lorentz transformations on photons is fundamentally different from their action on timelike objects. So it is simply not valid to view photons as some sort of limit &quot;as speed approaches c&quot; of timelike objects.')
