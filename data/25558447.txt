There&#x27;s a similar idea there, where programs are compiled to a virtual instruction set called TIMI then statically recompiled to whatever the machine&#x27;s native instruction set is at the first load on a given machine. As a result, you can just drop a System&#x2F;36 binary on a modern PowerPC system and not even notice that you&#x27;ve just crossed two changes of instruction set.')
