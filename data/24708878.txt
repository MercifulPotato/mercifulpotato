The original strap and guard were custom, but deficient.   Any other car company would have kept shipping the deficient design until a new component was designed, validated, tooled and produced.   That takes most of a year.   Tesla will eventually replace their ad-hoc hold downs.   But in the meantime they&#x27;d rather look unprofessional than ship deficient designs.  Kudos.')
