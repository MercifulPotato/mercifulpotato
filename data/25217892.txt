It&#x27;s a good problem to have yes. But it still sucks, while I know some will disagree, that more than half of that will be taken away.<p>As W2 income, there&#x27;s also very little tax mitigating strategies, now that I talked to an army of tax advisors. More than I&#x27;d otherwise need in a lifetime.<p>The W2 income spike is not steady and all peak next year (due to lockup period deferring this year&#x27;s income to next year), so I want to preserve &#x2F; defer as much as possible.<p>For those who&#x27;ve been through those tech IPOs, what would you recommend?<p>These are what I know that could work in today&#x27;s tax code:<p>1) Go the real-estate professional route to offset non-passive income, and even if I do, putting down several multifamily units next year, it won&#x27;t be enough depreciation to offset my 1M+ W2 income.<p>2) There&#x27;re a few other aggressive tax strategies far less well known that I got exposed to recently, mainly those in Family Office for the wealth. Those will 100x the audit risk for sure.<p>3) Maybe I should just stop worrying about this, and learn the lesson of never overstaying this &#x27;W2 slave&#x27; stage and should shift to business and capital income sooner.<p>Thoughts?')
