Except after the last few weeks of scrolling through comments, I have come across less than 10 users sitewide who have actually set a picture. It&#x27;s now just a sea of default icons and a ton of wasted space.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine people use the chat function either. It seems like they are prioritizing features for the sake of ad revenue or product team egos over making much needed infra updates. General latency and error rates while browsing reddit.com are almost unbearable now. And search always was and still is a mess. And don&#x27;t get me started on the mobile apps..')
