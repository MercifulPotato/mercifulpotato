Item(by='jgwil2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602861481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801059, text='&gt; The usual result with piano teaching apps of all kinds - as someone else commented below - is kids get up to Grade 1 (maybe 2) and then hit a brick wall.<p>How many kids or adults who start with traditional piano lessons will actually make it past this level? I&#x27;m sure that it is the case that most people will eventually plateau using an app, but I doubt that a control group of people taking lessons would perform much better, and apps at least solve a problem of access.<p>The vast majority of children and virtually all adults starting piano will never achieve a high level of musicianship, but their lives may well still be enriched by the musical knowledge they gain.')
