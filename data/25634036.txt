Most may <i>never</i> experience a bit flip, and most of the flips won&#x27;t be obvious anyway (e.g. no visible effect).<p>So your hypothetical dialogue will sound more like a scam to a regular user. You&#x27;re charging money to tackle a problem they don&#x27;t have or see, only addressing a single one of the root causes that trigger that same result, and in the end you&#x27;re not even completely fixing it, just reducing the already infinitesimal odds it happens.<p>It will become mainstream when manufacturers just decides to include it everywhere and not really give the user a choice. Apple is a prime candidate for a company with enough clout to afford this.')
