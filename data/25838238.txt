Not all software is created equal, some might be more secure and have fewer vulnerabilities than others. But a single exposed vuln, no matter how severe, is pretty much never enough to judge which software is which.<p>I remember hearing about this exact bug in Facetime, but I had no idea that, as OP demonstrated, an analagous bug effected <i>pretty much every popular similar A&#x2F;V group chat software</i>. Including the vaunted Signal.<p>Did this one OP find and reveal it in all of them? wow.<p>Also, I really wonder how many of these the NSA knew about before we did, but who can say (except the NSA).')
