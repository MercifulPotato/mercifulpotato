As such, we know that cellular life has evolved multiple mechanisms to efficiently kill external RNA.<p>If cellular life can efficiently outcompete non-cellular life for resources (and perhaps for RNA itself), then this outcome is not unreasonable at all.<p>Counter-example: There are (far) more Homo sapiens on the planet than other primates in total.')
