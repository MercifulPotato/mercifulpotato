I actually did pretty much the same a long time ago: an API around GDELT data.<p>Your map looks fantastic, btw.<p>The problem with GDELT is that they don&#x27;t have that much coverage. I discovered it when we began to build our own News API [1].<p>I failed to sell this data over an API. I think you should see much more interest for an application. API like that is a bit complex. Almost all potential clients who really needed GDELT already parsing this data from Big Query, Redshift, or GDELT&#x27;s dump files.<p>Anyway, check our solution, probably we could collaborate somehow. Map is cool! Feel free to reach me over artem [at] newscatcherapi [dot] com<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newscatcherapi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newscatcherapi.com</a>')
