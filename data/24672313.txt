They let me see if there are problems that I can&#x27;t do anything about through the browser UI. If there&#x27;s no power, then obviously its a hardware problem and if there&#x27;s no WAN then its an upstream problem that I cannot fix myself. All other lights are meaningless to me and I use the browser UI instead, like you.')
