I don’t think it has ever just worked the first time I have plugged it in, and the only palatable solution is to install the tray tool to restart Facebook’s own trash software. If you search for connectivity issues you find forum post after forum post of people getting the runaround from support. Facebook just releases broken shit and don’t care. A social media website company does not have the discipline to sell and maintain hardware, goes I’m not surprised.<p>I’m ultimately not that upset, the Rift S is good for the price and was my first HMD. I’ll take my money elsewhere when it’s time to upgrade, but I think I’ll be happy with this for a while yet as pretty much all I play is beatsaber lol')
