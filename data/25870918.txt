Ads are also clearly labelled so users can decide if they want to ignore sponsored results. I typically click the first result below ads or use an adblocker but that&#x27;s just me. So this seems like a clear distinction between paid and organic results.<p>I completely agree on the second point. Google&#x27;s &#x27;Featured Snippets&#x27; are a clear overreach where Google uses people&#x27;s content at no cost and gives nothing in return. This needs to be regulated because nobody is going to opt-out. For example, I&#x27;ve had some featured snippets and they bring a lot of traffic. Much less than a normal first place listing but more than a second place listing. If I opt-out of Featured Snippets in protest then someone else will just happily take that spot.<p>Perhaps the balance lies in just indexing headlines of sites. Then publishers could decide if they want to give up that information in their headlines. It&#x27;s a tough to know where to draw the line but that seems like it&#x27;s been the fairest balance so far.')
