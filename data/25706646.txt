Otherwise their shareholders withdraw investments and invest elsewhere. Deplatforming is a money making strategy (it might succeed or it might fail but the goal is to make money).<p>To add more data, in Nov 2020 7 MM more “potential customers” voted for Biden compared to Trump. Additionally, the “potential customers” that voted for Biden were predominantly younger i.e. more time to purchase good and services from company X. It seems clear to me deplatforming is a medium-term and long-term financial numbers game.<p>&gt; The 1964 Civil Rights Act didn&#x27;t mandate equal access because of Big Restaurant or Big Bus Stop--it was because segregation was an exceedingly immoral ...<p>The way I see this is:<p>Historically we thought free market economics only applied to the monetary aspect of socio-economics. “deplatforming”&#x2F;“cancel culture” seems to be the free market “solution” to social issues. It is basically the “popular vote” weighted by capital, forcing social change.<p>Historically social issues were dictated by one person one vote and required government regulation, and moved very slow (for many reasons, one of them being a disproportionate voting power to low population states). Perhaps we are now witnessing the efficiency of the free market to solve social issues?<p>Which is an interesting&#x2F;ironic result, given historic Republican policy about free markets.<p>P.S. FWIW, I’d be happy with more regulation in this area, even though the free market “solution” is in my favor.')
