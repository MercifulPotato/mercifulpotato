Turns out maybe it&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s not as important as all the text books say?<p>The important bit is removing object allocating, removing boxing, deep inlining, and specialisation... when you&#x27;ve done all that work the exact registers and instructions don&#x27;t seem to really make a huge difference.')
