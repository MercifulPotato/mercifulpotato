I also grew up playing AD&amp;D 2nd Ed., loved it, glad others are keeping the fun alive. But I’m aware of a few niche hobbyist publications that are relatively rare and will be lost to time unless someone steps forward to sacrifice their own and digitize them. The copyright is not expired but the holders are not easily identifiable after bankruptcies, deaths, etc. This might be a good avenue, but I’m skeptical that they’re as resilient to claims if a quilt work of state-level status recognitions are the only defense.')
