There are people who like to create complex analysis&#x2F;structure around their lives. I don&#x27;t say they are unnecessarily complicating their lives, because that&#x27;s part of their personality. So, yes, you are correct. An double-entry ledger doesn&#x27;t add much insights.<p>2. After $200k&#x2F;year income and $1m+ wealth, and if your wealth is very diversified (inherently complex), then I can see the value in it. ie: An engineer with $200k has less complexity than a freelance with $200k&#x2F;year. At a certain point the freelance will benefit from an accountant, but maybe he&#x27;s running some stuff in the dark economy or something.')
