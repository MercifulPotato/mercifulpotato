I don&#x27;t think you can pack exactly these things in a single device any more. Maaaybe if there was a next-gen console, but with an open OS and hackable hardware?<p>But graphics are reaching diminishing returns (RTX is nice, but not a leap like going from cyan-pink CGA to HAM). Audio is good enough. Hardware for games has been mostly commoditized by big game engines. If you want to reinvent UIs or games, you can do that on any hardware now.<p>Demoscene was cool because it was pushing limits of the hardware. For a while now the hardware has been powerful enough that these limits aren&#x27;t that interesting any more. Demoscene now thrives on artificial limits, like Pico8 or 1&#x2F;4&#x2F;64K demos.')
