The UK&#x27;s cycling infrastructure is embarrassingly bad.<p>An example.  Local to me, recently, the government spent over £100m on a new road junction, to replace an old one.  One of the main reasons that they had to build a new junction was that they claimed they could not remove traffic lights from the roundabout to improve traffic because pedestrians and cyclists both crossed the junction at &#x27;street level&#x27;.  A local cycle organization submitted a proposal with modelling (I can&#x27;t find the link atm.), that showed that the desired increase in capacity could be achieved by adding bridges for pedestrians and cyclists, removing traffic lights, and altering the road layout.<p>And save about £90m.<p>Needlessly to say, the junction was built.  I have no idea whether their proposal was considered, or not, unless I submit a freedom of information request to the UK government.<p>Regardless, the bridges should have been built anyway, because the junction is between two suburbs.<p>The new junction did get a new cyclist&#x2F;pedestrian bridge to replace the old one.  Except it&#x27;s about 1km further away from the suburbs that the previous junction, so adding 2km to bike journeys.')
