I understand you put a lot of work into reading books about diets or whatever, but I also make my arguments based on the findings supported by a large body of research.<p>I&#x27;m not going to ask you to read through all of the reference material I&#x27;m using to build up my arguments. At best, I&#x27;m going to point out the FDA + Department of Agriculture studies on health and nutrition which inform my decisions and arguments.<p>But anyone who says &quot;my argument is in a book elsewhere&quot; is just... going to be ignored by me. Just an FYI. That&#x27;s also why I&#x27;m not shoving FDA or Department of Agriculture whitepapers into your face.<p>-------------<p>The mainstream science of food, eating, and nutrition is pretty simple and straightforward. Have a balanced meal (multiple forms of fruits and vegetables. Roughly 1&#x2F;2 the meat of the average American. Grossly lower sugar intake compared to the average American). That&#x27;s it.<p>These papers on &quot;ultraprocessed foods&quot; or &quot;alternative diets&quot; may have something about them, but it is the job of its advocates to make solid arguments about why the mainstream thought is insufficient or inadequate.<p>---------<p>What can I say about diets? Some people have a strong ability to stick to diets, while others do not. Studying the psychology of &quot;what makes people feel full&quot; is an important part of the equation.<p>Some people just can&#x27;t help themselves. For those people, you teach them psychology, so that they trick themselves into healthy eating.')
