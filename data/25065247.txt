Convolutional neural networks work by recursively recognizing shapes. In theory, the first layer should match the picture on something like this and conclude &quot;it&#x27;s probably an eye&quot;:<p><pre><code>  o o X o o\n  o X X X o\n  o X X X o\n  o o X o o\n</code></pre>\n(above, &quot;X&quot; denotes low relative brightness, &quot;o&quot; denotes high relative brightness).<p>The next convolutional layer is supposed to see something like this and conclude it&#x27;s a face:<p><pre><code>  (eye)        (not a bumper)    (eye)\n  (not a door)    (nose)     (not a wheel)\n  (not a shovel) (mouth)   (not a window)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s in theory. In practice, each input to the second layer will be a vector of probabilities. Like 90% eye, 80% wheel, 1% door. The output will also look like a vector of probabilities, and the layer is supposed to figure out a linear formula matching inputs to outputs that results in the best statistical outcome. So it can very easily come up with kernels like this:<p>* A: (an eye or a wheel) and maybe a bumper to the right of it<p>* B: (an eye or a wheel) and maybe a bumper to the left of it<p>* C: (two wheels) side-by-side<p>In this case, the baby face will be encoded as A together with B and definitely not C. Because each next level produces a linear combination of the previous level&#x27;s outputs, the &quot;or a wheel&quot; parts will get nicely canceled out as long as the &quot;2 wheels&quot; kernel input is a low value, concluding that it&#x27;s a face with a confidence of 99%. Until the light falls from a different angle and the baby holds a round lego brick near their face, suddenly yielding 80% confidence that it&#x27;s a car.<p>Drawing parallels to organic life, neural networks are good at replicating inborn instincts. Like animals instantly recognizing predators, food or poisonous plants. But they are still far away from having a situational awareness needed to make judgement calls in most real-world situations.')
