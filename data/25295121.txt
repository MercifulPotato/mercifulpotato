Do you think China would like this?  Even Europe?  You think Europe would be gung ho for a bunch of Columbian cocaine rolling into their country?  Really?<p>Maybe Columbia will legalize but I would tend to think 95% of the rest of the world will say &quot;we&#x27;re going to make importing it illegal&quot;  and after that the Columbian government is going to have a lot of people knocking on their door asking them to help stop Columbians who are exporting to places that don&#x27;t want it.  And when they either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t do that there are going to be consequences.<p>But who knows.  Maybe it&#x27;ll all work out.  I don&#x27;t think so though and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just a matter of U.S. thinking it a bad idea.')
