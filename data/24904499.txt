For me it&#x27;s much simpler now:<p>- Use python :)<p>I learned using a variety of languages from calculator assembly to C++ to GUI game scripting languages. Each had its quirks and C&#x2F;C++ boilerplate definitely created friction. I was always really easy to write complicated algorithms and math but doing anything practical alluded me.<p>Now with python you&#x27;re one library away from doing anything really interesting. There&#x27;s almost zero boilerplate. &#x27;import pygame&#x27; and with a bit of googling and basic knowledge you&#x27;re off to making a pretty cool game! (learning physics, algorithms and more along the way)')
