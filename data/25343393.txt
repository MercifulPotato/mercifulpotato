I have an x470 Taichi and there the IOMMU grouping is pretty bad, it also has only a single USB controller in its own group, and all PCIe slots except the top x16 one are grouped with other stuff so it&#x27;s not even possible to plug in a separate USB controller card or a second GPU for passthrough. A ThreadRipper would have been a much better choice considering I also use this machine for development and can use all the cores I can get.')
