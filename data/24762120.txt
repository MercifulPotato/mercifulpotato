It&#x27;s more the bottom feeders of OVH and Choopa&#x2F;Vultr. I blacklist them instantly in every network I end up responsible for.<p>Digital Ocean is a weird bird because to me it&#x27;s more of an educator than a hosting company (but people will of course abuse it the same way). I&#x27;d never run prod on it and I usually end up blocking their ASNs, though I feel a little worse about it.<p>I wish they&#x27;d sell technical writing as a service. Their documentation (especially for common tasks that they don&#x27;t even directly sell, like OpenVPN setups) is superb.')
