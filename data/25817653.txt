Facebook is toxic because it creates big echo chambers for political (including religious) opinion which makes for a toxic society. Facebook was successful long before it became the cesspit it is today, so it’s possible for a social network to solve these problems and flourish. It wouldn’t be as successful as Facebook due to the inability of users to shout opinions at each other, but I think there’s a big enough niche to be exploited.')
