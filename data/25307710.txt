Did they just switch from sequential to a grouping that checked all but a small portion of each million undone until November?<p><pre><code>  September 17, 2020 All tests below 53 million verified.\n</code></pre>\nMakes me think part of it is them spending extra time verifying old tests. Just curious 1. if that&#x27;s all it is and 2. why &#x2F; whether this was triggered by something. Was there a bug found that raised doubt in previous tests?<p><i>EDIT: Formatting</i>')
