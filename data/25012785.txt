But he isn&#x27;t a micromanager. He will do whatever it takes to get things done and done right. Same with Steve Jobs. If you can get it done and done right, you wouldn&#x27;t hear a peep.<p>No one at that level has issues with delegation either. It&#x27;s far too much work and too many people. So what they activily manage are results. And because results involve people, you can get yourself steamrolled if you&#x27;re in their way.<p>The way Elon gets his hands dirty in so many parts of the business attest to this. A micromanager would manage everything all the time. Elon simply goes from one hot spot to another with uncompromising focus on detail.')
