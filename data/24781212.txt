I stumbled on Altered Carbon on netflix, and enjoyed it in fits and starts. Taken as a whole the first season has some great moments.<p>The local library had the audiobooks, so I listened to them on a long car trip between the first and second season being released. The writing isn&#x27;t great but the stories definitely have their moments, even if its smothered in the usual &quot;action flick&quot; mindset.<p>I think netflix would have done a lot better to just stick to the plot of Broken Angels for the second season. But I think there was some rumbling on the message boards that it would have actually cost real cash to pull that off and netflix apparently wasn&#x27;t willing to do it. So its the worst kind of serial scifi rubbish.<p>Its really too bad. The trash they invented as filler, was just that. But you can see their problem, the first book took place on an earth city, so they didn&#x27;t need a lot of custom sets, and loads of CG.<p>My wife signed up for the hbo trial for a month and then canceled it. That was just about perfect. I watched the last season of game of thrones and a couple other things, and was getting bored with it just as the trial ended. I actually think that model might be the right one for the entire streaming ecosystem. Just rotate the streaming services every couple months.')
