Many MUAs are using whitelists of elements to support (don&#x27;t expect &lt;video&gt; to make it through, and especially not &lt;iframe&gt;), and scrubbing CSS themselves with whitelists. In effect, this means that virtually everything added in HTML5 probably won&#x27;t work, so the support is more akin to HTML4 in that regard. Infamously, Outlook uses the same HTML rendering engine as Word, which is (was?) based on the IE 5.5 rendering engine.')
