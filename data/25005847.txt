So either those documents are irrelevant except to show why she is a <i>former</i> UN human rights lawyer (evidently her complaint was unsuccessful) or revealing the attendees of events in advance is exactly what she leaked back then, in which case it&#x27;s a bit suspicious that she suddenly got multiple outlets to report on it only 7 years after the fact.<p>&gt; I will humor you, and add yet more sources (though I am sure you will be able to find something objectionable about each)<p>The problem common to all of them is that they&#x27;re not independent sources, but just different write-ups of the same person&#x27;s statements, namely that former UN employee. Adding more links isn&#x27;t the same as adding more information.')
