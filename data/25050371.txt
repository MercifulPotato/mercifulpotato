China is 3x larger in population than all other SCS claimants together with 7x higher GDP. PLA Navy is building more tonnage in ships than the region combined. There&#x27;s also the fact that they will never align with each other against China because they are simultaneously disputing against EACH OTHER, a fact that many people conveniently forget. USN is pretty much the only entity preventing full blown Chinese Munroe doctoring in SCS, and in many ways they&#x27;ve already been squeezed out. Everyone in the region is just leveraging the situation for better deals with China, i.e. Philippines and China are finally doing co-oil exploration in the region.<p>&gt;border dispute and solidify it<p>This would be a huge win for China. A large reason China is pressing Ladakh so hard is because India is incapable of resolving border disputes with China who has ratified 12&#x2F;14 land borders, while India has poor record settling border disputes. It&#x27;s hard to cede land as a democratic leader, but Modi might pull it off. India ratifying Chinese borders would basically end Chinese fears of western theater and allow China to focus on east &#x2F; Taiwan &#x2F; SCS and maybe allow India to get it&#x27;s shit together.<p>And until they do, they don&#x27;t substantially matter. India always matter as potential, on paper, but Indian democracy hasn&#x27;t delivered, and IMO won&#x27;t.')
