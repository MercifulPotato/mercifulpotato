Although I understand why this study is helpful, I believe it would have been much more helpful had we been asking a different question.<p>Violence, per se, is not as relevant as the context for that violence. The more revelatory question is not whether &#x27;violent video games <i>do</i> lead to agression&#x27; but instead whether they <i>could</i>.<p>If, for example, the protagonist in a video game has an attitude or behavior that is treated as aspirational then it&#x27;s more likely that players of that game (especially those with less life experience) will themselves ascribe to that attitude or behavior. And if that newfound attitude or behavior persists, then over time it is likely to lead to changes in action.<p>The study that would be more helpful is not the one that evaluates the impact of violent content due to its mere presence but rather evaluates the impact based on the context in which that violence is presented.')
