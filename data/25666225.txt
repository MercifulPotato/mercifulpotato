I hate this thing, would rather give my data to facebook then use it because it creates class separation between poor and rich. I have seen it with my kids who wanted iphone because they couldn&#x27;t communicate with all the iphone kids who used iMessage. That&#x27;s in itself much worst to me than some privacy which i already gave up on.')
