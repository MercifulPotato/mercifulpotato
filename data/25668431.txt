That seems like an architectural problem that can also be solved in a monolith.<p>Try to run your monolith in kubernetes, it&#x27;s possible but not much fun. Since single machines can not longer scale at large, we have to run distributed software, small pieces across hundreds or thousands of machines in order to scale efficiently.<p>&gt; But in general, I have never seen a company that switched to micro-services, and didnâ€™t end up regretting it a few years later<p>Netflix?')
