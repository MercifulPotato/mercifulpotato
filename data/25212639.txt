Here is my advice in a nutshell:\nImagine dating as a funnel, where you have the following steps:\n1. Your profile (landing page)\n2. Initial message\n3. Banter\n4. Initial phone call\n5. 1st Date\n6. Follow up banter\n7. 2nd date\n8. Deepening of relationship\n9. Go&#x2F;no-go determination<p>Where I personally initially struggled was the first two steps. What I learned most was there is an art to taking good profile pics. Doing a great job here makes 95% of the difference. Learn how to take the best profile pic you can. We can’t help our natural attractiveness, but even the best looking guy can look horrible if they don’t focus on this. Best way to help yourself is use an objective “scoring” method. I used this site:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photofeeler.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photofeeler.com</a>\nIt is somewhat painful initially (as you get scores below 5), but if you work on taking better pictures of yourself... it gets better, currently my best pic is a 9.4&#x2F;9.5&#x2F;8.0... but it took me literally 3-4 weeks of taking TONs of photos... I started at 4.5&#x2F;4.8&#x2F;4.5.\nOnce you master your pics, then you need to practice grabbing their attention, and keeping it. I can go farther, but hopefully that helps at least a bit.')
