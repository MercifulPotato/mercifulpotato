(I do this in part because I don&#x27;t regularly use my Mac and these other programs have web versions that can be used on all platforms including Windows PC.)<p>If you&#x27;re curious about demographics I&#x27;m in my mid 30s. My particular social group is not big into Facebook or Facebook Messenger (though I know they own WhatsApp) since we are techies and privacy-conscious. I&#x27;d rather have a 1on1 or small group chat than blast thoughts out into the ether when in that mode of communication. (Hacker News is different. It&#x27;s cultivated, moderated, and oriented around exploring curiosity.)')
