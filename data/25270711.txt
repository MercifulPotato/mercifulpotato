We were very happy to help Percona integrating VictoriaMetrics in PMM. Some interesting details:<p>* Prometheus has been completely replaced by VictoriaMetrics at PMM server. The end result is lower disk space usage and RAM usage.<p>* There is no need to convert Prometheus data to VictoriaMetrics format during PMM upgrade.<p>* PMM clients support both pull and push model for sending metrics data to the server.<p>* PMM clients transfer all the collected metrics to the server via encrypted https connections when push model is used. There is no need to open tcp ports at PMM client host for metrics&#x27; scraping.<p>* PMM clients do not lose collected metrics when they cannot connect to the server. The collected data is buffered on local disk until connection to the server is re-established.')
