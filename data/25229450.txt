The natural gas I use to heat my home is dangerous too so I had to use approved professionals to install it, and I have to have approved professional come and check my installation every 2 years. When electricity would be better for my job I will use it.<p>Isn&#x27;t a failure in logic to believe that batteries will get better and greener over time but for some reason hydrogen related stuff won&#x27;t get better as well? Maybe chemists will find some efficient way to make a denser liquid fuel if we would invest enough in research.')
