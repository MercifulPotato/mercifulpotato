I&#x27;ve seen it happen multiple times due to pure mistakes. It takes an appeal and time to resolve the issue, in the meantime you are stuck.<p>Their appeals form only lets you submit 1,000 characters, no images or attachments. So in many cases, it&#x27;s hard to even provide proof of the mistake. For example, if they falsely takedown your app for trademark infringement, but you have priority rights in a country or a registered mark, how are you supposed to effectively prove that in 1,000 characters with no images? In one case, we had a decision from the trademark office in our favor, but we were unable to attach it in any way and had to try and summarize it in like 300 characters.<p>There is no reason in most cases to not provide a warning period and the opportunity to provide evidence and exhibits.<p>They act so much like a monopoly in this case that they are stupidly making things harder for themselves. Sundar and Google&#x27;s legal team should take all the PMs aside and tell them they are going to start losing antitrust cases left and right if they can&#x27;t provide more due process for decisions.')
