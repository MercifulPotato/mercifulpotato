Also long duration attitude holding is harder in space than it is on the ground.<p>If we wanted to build something similar in space it&#x27;s essentially a 5x larger James Webb Space Telescope which is having some trouble last I heard with it&#x27;s folding mechanism so building one 5 times larger to fit into a faring is a big task.')
