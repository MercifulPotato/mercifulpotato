Seems like if a company stops investing in positive ROI projects, it won&#x27;t grow, and then won&#x27;t survive as long? I haven&#x27;t thought about it much, but I think on a macro scale even a negative return project still circulates that money back out, in the form of salaries or materials or something, but that may be a naive thought.<p>Obviously there are ways to break that, like tax evasion, but hopefully there are other ways to deal with that.')
