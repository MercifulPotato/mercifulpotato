As I understand it the Spark approach does not embrace a &quot;flat&quot; layout, but rather does lots of pointer chasing, which can really slow things down. Because Spark isn&#x27;t very careful about memory usage and layout, you outgrow a single node quite fast, and then you&#x27;re back to really bad distributed scaling characteristics.')
