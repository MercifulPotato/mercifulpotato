I am not exactly kicking myself- at the time I was not an exercise bike enthusiast, and my few trips to Soul Cycle with my wife really turned me off- and regardless, I ended up landing a more lucrative role, even factoring in what stock grants would have been worth. About a year and a half ago, the wife bought a Peloton, and I rolled my eyes about our new expensive coat hanger, and I am currently on a 42 week streak.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can pass this off as a fad- Soul Cycle first hit the scene around 2009, its still around- and they have just released a bike and service as well. Other look alikes have come on the market as well- Tonal and Mirror being the biggest. This is looking less like a fad and more like they were the leading edge of a smart exercise equipment industry.<p>Sure the specific piece of equipment that is in vogue might come and go, but I think Peloton is here to stay. This doesn&#x27;t mean that gyms are going to close in the long run, but workout equipment as a service is a class of product that I feel is with us for the long haul.')
