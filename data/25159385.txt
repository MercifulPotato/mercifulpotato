Having faced and survived numerous extinction events, they are now under severe pressure from multiple threats.<p>They are bled (harvested) not once, but twice for their blood, which holds their immuno-active ingredient. That and the pre-bleeding cleaning process severely weakens the specimens. Preferably the females are bled, since they are larger in body (and thus blood mass). Farming and pollution are two more threat vectors.<p>Then conservation agencies are often in line &#x2F; sponsored by the CROs are interested in their harvest.<p>Disclaimer: Had a startup based on Horseshoe Crab sourced LAL. We had quite a bunch of them in our biotech startup lab.')
