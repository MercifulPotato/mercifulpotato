If the hard drive is a hoax, I think it&#x27;s important to have an open discussion to shine a light on it. Banning the article in a way that appears to validate its claims will only embolden claims of a conspiracy.<p>I think it&#x27;s also interesting that the &quot;hacking&quot; ban doesn&#x27;t have an exemption for the press. Even though the NY Post is fairly partisan even by tabloid standards,it seems like a double standard if I can still link to an NY Times article containing information about classified government activities that were revealed via hacking')
