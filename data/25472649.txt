I only started noticing cookie banners on GitHub in the last month or two.<p>So... in the past, did you not have cookie banners because you didn&#x27;t have tracking cookies until recently, and all this is a big publicity stunt? Or were you breaking the law up until a month or two ago by having tracking cookies but not asking for my consent?')
