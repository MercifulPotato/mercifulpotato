I mean the json has markdown syntax in it. That&#x27;s a lot nicer than html tags for markup, but it&#x27;s still markup.<p>In case anyone reading hasn&#x27;t seen it before, browsers have a thing called XSLT built into them that does something similar for XML documents. You serve up your data as XML, add a tag that points to an XSLT document, and the browser will use the transform on your document automatically. If the resulting output is renderable XHTML, it&#x27;ll display it like a regular webpage.<p>That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t <i>recommend</i> doing that, since XSLT is a programming language whose syntax is XML itself. Apparently web standards folks in the early 2000s thought the future was XML all the way down.')
