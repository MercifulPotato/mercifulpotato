If you could find a way to separate out the part of &quot;total compensation&quot; that actually contributes to income, such as stock grants &amp; such, then we could talk.  But, just &quot;total compensation&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to get a true picture of how screwed the American worker is, take a look at housing and education costs over time, as well.  Both have increased faster than inflation, and vastly outpaced wage growth; yet everyone needs a home, and a college degree is practically a requirement for any vaguely middle-class career.')
