A lot of time and effort has been spent by major players, with very little to success to show for it.<p>Intel, quite infamously, tried to make &quot;something better&quot; work with several generations of Itanium and failed impressively against the reality that a sufficiently smart compiler cannot be made to work. You can&#x27;t blame any of the big players for holding back - Intel, MS, and HP were &quot;all in&quot; on Itanium as the 64-bit future - if it could have been made to work, it would have been widely adopted.<p>At the same time, Transmeta was building a X86-on-VLIW, which, guess what, also failed to be a competitive product. Nvidia, of course, decided to pick up from where Transmeta left off to build what ended up being an aarch64-on-VLIW design. In both cases, the hope was that the low-level translation would allow the benefits of a VLIW architecture while avoiding the &quot;sufficiently smart compiler is impossible&quot; problem, and in both cases performance just wasn&#x27;t good enough to be competitive.')
