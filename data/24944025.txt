They&#x27;re ranchers.<p>Second, it hardly &quot;destroys the environment for their convenience&quot;. Where I live the cattle graze down the grasses and prevent fires from spreading. In return, they leave manure which is super useful as a natural fertilizer for gardens and such.<p>Third, ranching is about food security. The areas where cattle are grazed are typically not much good for food crops, and it&#x27;s a far more humane way to keep cattle. They got to roam around some pretty vast tracts of land, and you have a really healthy source of locally-sourced protein.<p>Finally, cattle are property. The idea that you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to protect your property is nutty. There are plenty of other wild animals for wolves to prey on, and there&#x27;s no good ecosystem argument for why they should be permitted to slaughter cattle willy-nilly. Allowing ranchers to shoot wolves threatening their cattle would result in surviving wolves being much more reticent about going after cattle in the first place.<p>See: why bears and cougars rarely attack humans, even though their populations are healthy enough to be on the &quot;hunt all year round&quot; list for property owners in many areas.')
