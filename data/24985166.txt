I run into situations where I must make some assumptions about a codebase and its context which aren&#x27;t translated into the type system. I add comments to remind readers whenever I feel like an assumption should be stressed.<p>However assumptions change with time. I&#x27;d like to be able to cross reference all the places in the code base where certain assumption was made to a readme section with necessary details and background. In my ideal world IDE would resolve these links and made them easier to maintain.<p>_EDIT: word order_')
