We test them to specific standards for general driving skills, and only then allow them to drive on public roads. And if they commit specific egregious mistakes we suspend that right.<p>The AP&#x27;s learning curve is unknown, we don&#x27;t train it to any specific standard, we don&#x27;t expect it to pass any test to validate it can or should be allowed to &quot;drive&quot; on a public road, and the AP&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; to drive is neither officially given, nor withdrawn after making repeated, serious mistakes. Keep in mind that the AP is &quot;the same driver&quot; across all cars.<p>Your &quot;argument&quot; has no merit.')
