As to why the lack of diversity in existing platforms (non-usage of various protocols): the reason many platforms&#x2F;protocols aren’t adopted is because the commons has been plundered. Trade secrets create walled gardens that are great for advertisers, but crap for individuals.<p>&gt; People don&#x27;t want everyone to have a complete platform to them to say anything they want. So somewhere someone has to be doing some deciding of who gets a platform. Protocols can&#x27;t magically solve that problem.<p>Who is &#x27;people&#x27;? Who do you speak for?<p>From your quick dismissal, I’m curious if you looked at the actual tech? I’d be curious if you have any critique on the underlying tech?<p>I agree that any community needs moderation but that doesn’t mean we should have a faceless company doing it. It can be done by making cooperative block-lists&#x2F;blacklists, and sharing those among participants. We don’t need the middlemen at all, in fact they are unaccountable, and are dangerous by themselves since their only focus is to exploit users and extract a profit for shareholders.<p>As I said though, I’m curious about any critique about Holochain tech (the software pattern). Personally I think it’s inevitable that we will move in that direction imo: the direction of an agent-centric web, a space of direct protocol negotiation and renegotiation.<p>I’d like to make you aware that Holochain also paves the way for new types of value accounting systems. If you are curious, check out the work of Lynn Foster, Bob Haugen, Pospi and others on hREA &#x2F; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;Valueflo.ws" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;Valueflo.ws</a>. They are in the later stages of developing a fully featured, fully distributed, Resources Events Agents (REA) accounting system built using Holochain - creating one of the world’s first Network Resource Planning software [1] that uses an official ISO standard.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.p2pfoundation.net&#x2F;Network_Resource_Planning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.p2pfoundation.net&#x2F;Network_Resource_Planning</a>')
