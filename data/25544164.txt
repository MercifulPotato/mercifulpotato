With wave lengths under 370nm the efficiencies are quite high; at 380nm it falls to 33,6%. That could either mean that the catalyst works well with light at small wavelengths or that it only works at this specific range.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2278-9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2278-9</a>')
