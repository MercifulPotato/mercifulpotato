If we look at the age of nationalism, Italian and German nations are good examples - the nations formed&#x2F;consolidated long before they got united governments; the late 19th century pan-Slavic movement was arguably an expression of nationalism that transcended Russian Empire; if we look at nationalism in Latin America, it again precedes formation of the respective governments and survives substantial changes in political values. Etc.<p>Nationality is not formed or defined by a (system of) government, quite the contrary, nations have a certain tendency to obtain a separate (system of) government - the desire for national self-determinism works against government systems that include other nations. The dissolution of Yugoslavia and USSR are some examples, but the instability of various regions in Middle East and Africa are also in part caused by national identities that do not map to the post-colonial set of governments and borders.<p>Furthermore, the national unity and values is not really defined by the current political system. Many nations have had multiple <i>huge</i> changes in political regimes over the last hundred years while unquestionably staying the same nation, and political values generally are not the core thing forming a national identity.')
