Even in what you mentioned - what are the types of taxes that exist and whom do they impact? How are taxes levied, how is tax burden calculated, and within each society, how is that changed?

What are the historical monetary systems that have been developed? What is debt? How does fiat currency work and how does this system work globally? A basic discussion of inflation&#x2F;deflation, monetary theory and practice.
