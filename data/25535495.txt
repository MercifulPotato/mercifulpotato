Beginner and often intermediate users often do not understand the importance of good audio in a video.  When they do it still takes a steep learning curve to understand the complexity and nuances of even the basics.<p>Most video editors don’t help users with audio.<p>Ideas:<p>Templated signal chains for individual audio tracks that include simple things such as gate, subtractive eq, compression, additive-eq<p>Templated master audio signal chain that can include simple compression &#x2F; limiting , eq, and maximizing with a specific target LUFS in mind (based on where the user intends to upload as different sites have different ideal loudness)<p>Level suggestions for tracks, based upon if they are dialog, music-bed, room tone etc<p>Automatic level adjustment to bring the music bed up and down based on other tracks.  Or simply the ability to generate suggested level automation.<p>Actually, automatic suggested level automation on any track independently would be really useful for things like dialog and interviews.<p>Not specifically audio, but being able to output multiple different renders depending on target website with a single click. (Ideal container, codec, resolutions, ratios, LUFS, etc). Even with predefined templates in other editors I have used, I still need to select and queue each render specifically.<p>Of course these suggestions are very reductive, but even the basics go so far in making a video not be bad.<p>Ultimately bad audio can make the best video unwatchable.  Give the user some optional guard rails.<p>Oh yeah, don’t forget to transparency account for audio processing latency.  Else lips won’t sync with dialog. Saw that happen with a beta version of an editor a few years back when they added VST support.')
