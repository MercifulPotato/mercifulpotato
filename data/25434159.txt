You have to appear before a judge to ask for a default judgement, and the defendant can offer a defense (the options are narrow in scope, but not nonexistent).<p>This was in the context of the optics of &#x27;suing their students&#x27;. So you serve the student, pay a lawyer to appear in court to ask for a default judgement, then student offers a defense, and a judge potentially grants the judgement. There&#x27;s functionally no difference with respect to optics.<p>Also ISAs have not been heavily litigated, so no one really knows what would happen if a company tries to enforce them.')
