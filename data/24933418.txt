But as a tool, I find meal replacement mixes to be useful in multiple contexts:<p>- when traveling somewhere and I expect the options which meet my dietary requirements to be limited<p>- when trying to fit extra calories to gain weight<p>- when the other low-effort option would be snacks I won&#x27;t feel good about (this used to mean the office)<p>Especially if you have a dietary restriction and a metabolism that requires a lot of calories to avoid unintended weight loss, arranging to always have nutritious _real_ food can require a lot of effort and planning, and I can&#x27;t always be bothered. If the other options are eating too few calories, eating crappy snacks, or picking something at a geographically convenient restaurant, a meal replacement shake can quickly become best easy option.')
