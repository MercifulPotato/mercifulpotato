Best to avoid.<p>A trend I&#x27;ve noticed is that people take longer words that sound like shorter words, and start using them to &quot;sound smart&quot;.  Consider &quot;utilization&quot; and &quot;usage&quot;, which are just synonyms for &quot;use&quot;.  Start throwing around three letter words when you could use an eleven letter word and people will think you&#x27;re dumb.<p>I still call a pushbutton switch &quot;momentary on&quot;, though.  I hope people don&#x27;t think that means that the circuit turns on after a delay.')
