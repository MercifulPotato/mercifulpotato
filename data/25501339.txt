Shareholders and investors absolutely need to be rewarded for this.<p>The person I was responding to was acting as if there is NOT a division of capital and labor. I agree with you that we need both. You can&#x27;t treat only capital well, and you can&#x27;t treat only labor well. And the person I was responding to seems to have been suggesting that we treat only labor well. Production at our modern scale needs owners and investors and shareholders. That doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t improve things for the worker, though.')
