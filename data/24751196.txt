There are numerous parallels - accusations without evidence, damaging impact without due process, changing definitions&#x2F;goal posts, hyperbolic accusations, political repression, and the destruction of many careers. Labeling people with pejoratives is exactly the weapon used to silence opponents. Most typically I’ve seen it used against those that don’t align with progressive viewpoints, although that’s not always the case.<p>We’ve already seen the damage that cancel culture can do, and so Yelp giving random people a way to damage an individual or business without a principled process (like that of the courts) seems like a really messy and bad idea that’ll make cancel culture worse.<p>As for your notes on Communism - to me banning visas of those associated with such policies&#x2F;parties seems reasonable. Marxism&#x2F;collectivism is responsible for tens of millions of deaths in the 20th century and we have numerous data points showing that these ideas not only don’t work, but that their implementation requires brutal governance that is in conflict with our most basic principles, like free speech. So yes I do not welcome anyone affiliated with such parties into my country just as I would not welcome terrorists.')
