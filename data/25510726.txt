Wired gigabit ethernet is far better than wifi; on a small wired network the packet loss is negligible and contention is non-existent, so the network is smooth and fast.  You get better than 80% of theoretical wire speed in file transfers.  Remote desktops have minimum latency.  Every couple months another wifi router zero-day pops up and some huge fraction of all such routers become vulnerable to remote attacks.  It&#x27;s nice not being involved in that mess.<p>My fellow remote colleagues with wifi sound terrible on their contended networks; dropping packets and getting cut off calls.  The people with wired connections like myself are always glitch free.<p>Wifi is for toys and casual use.  Ethernet is for work.')
