If you need to fill it up every so often then it is working. By working I mean it is converting water into vapor, and that&#x27;s all a humidifier can do. They can&#x27;t magically make a desert climate humid. Most build-up in humidifiers is due to crappy water. They can&#x27;t do a whole lot about that either. Yes, they should be easier to clean, but when they are that cheap, then yes, they are easier to just throw away. But you get what you pay for.')
