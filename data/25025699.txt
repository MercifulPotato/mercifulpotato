Or perhaps exclude only popular playlists, or public playlists in general?<p>I see what you&#x27;re saying in this scenario, but in general more listens resulting in more money doesn&#x27;t strike me as unfair.<p>I&#x27;m also not opposed to doing it the way others are proposing (dividing individual subscribers&#x27; money among their played artists instead of aggregating it and doing it by number of plays). I guess that would be one way of solving this issue, even if it&#x27;s not the underlying problem. In your scenario the underlying problem seems to be that someone plays generic garbage as background noise all day and thereby generates plays that a niche artist whose listeners really love their music wouldn&#x27;t generate. That&#x27;s a separate problem, though perhaps changing the revenue distribution model would indeed be the best way to solve this issue.')
