VW&#x27;s timing, I think, has actually been excellent.<p>The ID3 is a good car for a good price they can sell profitably. The program commenced in the fallout of dieselgate roughly around the same time as the Model 3.<p>If they went all in just a few years earlier, it would have been on something like the E-Golf, not fit to be a mainstream car, and it would have ruined the company.<p>Now, if they had the R&amp;D strength of Tesla, the E-Golf could have been as good as the ID.3. But Tesla is unique.<p>Car companies that achieve volume production over the next couple of years probably won&#x27;t suffer terribly for the delay - but it will be less ideal than VW. Car companies that haven&#x27;t ramped volume production by some cutoff (say 2025) will die without question. It&#x27;s too late today to start that program, so the fate is already sealed for anyone without an iron in the fire.<p>And it wouldn&#x27;t have made sense for any company to try to compete with the Model S&#x2F;X without amortizing the R&amp;D over mainstream cars, similar to Intel&#x27;s high margin Xeon chips which probably wouldn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. Tesla doesn&#x27;t break out the finances enough to clearly tell, but they very likely lost money on the Model S&#x2F;X program as a whole, although maybe they&#x27;ve turned it around in recent years. And that&#x27;s with Tesla&#x27;s unique R&amp;D advantage which may have reduced costs by as much as an order of magnitude.<p>Even if you build that car, you have to sell it to Tesla fans, at best splitting a small market, and at worse being ignored because of Tesla&#x27;s impressive mindshare.<p>(I&#x27;m not writing this as a direct argument to what you&#x27;re saying, I think we probably broadly agree)')
