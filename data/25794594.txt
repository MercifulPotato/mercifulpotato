They go into people&#x27;s houses. And usually, that involves direct contact with people, at least at the beginning and end of the process.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s different in the UK, but that&#x27;s how it was in the US when I had my water heater replaced a few months ago. They wore masks when talking with me, but did the chin-sling bit while working. I kept away (and my high-risk roommates further away), but I&#x27;d have been a lot more comfortable had they been vaccinated. I&#x27;d preferentially hire the company who could provide that.<p>So to me, residential plumbers fit in the same category as others who work with the public, like wait staff and grocery store clerks. I&#x27;d be all for getting judges, lawyers, and politicians vaccinated mandatorily just to show confidence, but their work can be done remotely or at least at a distance. That&#x27;s harder with somebody who comes into your house.')
