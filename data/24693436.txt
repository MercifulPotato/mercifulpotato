Or, do you say &#x27;masks limit transmission of ARIs&#x27; and risk leaving medical need of masks unfulfilled because mass panic has decimated the supplies?<p>Truth mixed with guilt would&#x27;ve probably been the best path:  &quot;Yes, masks might help reduce spread, but doctors and nurses on the front lines are the ones most in need.  Please consider donating your spare supplies.&quot;')
