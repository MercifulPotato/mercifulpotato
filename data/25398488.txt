Coming from a history of using Discord and Slack, where Discord was mostly &quot;less formal Slack without all the utilities, but with voice chat&quot;, I find Teams to fall into an uncanny valley.<p>The focus on video conferences might be the most annoying part. Most of the time, I just want to see the shared screen at best. There&#x27;s an option to stop incoming video, though this one isn&#x27;t on by default. There also flat-out isn&#x27;t a way to stop looking at your own face when sharing video.<p>Meetings with Teams links tend to inflate the history, dozens of chats that could&#x27;ve been one thing now cause dumb questions like &quot;should we stay here or go into the other call?&quot;. This was already solved by apps like Teamspeak more than a decade ago. It feels immensely clunky, but the culture also doesn&#x27;t provide an intuitive way to avoid this problem.<p>The last bit highlights my biggest problem. It&#x27;s mostly culture. It feels as restrictive as your average enterprise program, yet it also feels chaotic in all the wrong ways. Many problems have already been solved and plenty of cultures, like global social gaming, have already experienced ways to handle this. Had I not had any experience with other apps, I likely wouldn&#x27;t feel this way.<p>I also realize part of the problem is how Teams is configured, which I have no experience with. But then it once again boils down to &quot;here you have this tool that can do a lot, but it&#x27;s not intuitive and we don&#x27;t give you a lot of guidelines&quot; despite the fact most companies have zero experience with remote.')
