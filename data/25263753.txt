All of the locking down by computer vendors we’ve seen to date is pretty well explained by more boring but strong commercial benefits (e.g. app stores) and catering to users who couldn’t care less about whether their phones are “general purpose computers” and just don’t want to have to think too hard before they download an app or click a link. It’s also unclear to me how computers being able to run arbitrary code is the part these puppet masters would care about. As long as these devices have browsers (and they pretty much all do, even game consoles now) pretty much all the practical ability to be subversive is still there.<p>I’ll worry when they outlaw&#x2F;restrict at least one of: unrestricted browsers, wordpress, wordpress hosting. As long as those are around (and right now they’re highly commercially desired, so good luck to the puppet masters) you can get your thoughts out on the internet for chump change. If fixing the current state of discourse on Facebook is the last great hope for maintaining heterodox thought, we’re totally screwed even if we nationalize it or whatever.')
