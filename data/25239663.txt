The idea, as I understand it, is to teach the value of hard work as an end to itself, rather than as a means to achieve the impossible. This really resonates with me, as someone who felt like the lesson of my own childhood was to achieve quite arbitrary goals (grades on tests, correct answers to trivia questions, that sort of thing), which didn&#x27;t really require me to work very hard, to my detriment.<p>Properly interpreted, I like the &quot;hard work is what matters&quot; child rearing trend.')
