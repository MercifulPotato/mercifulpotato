Item(by='shubhamjain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604585461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998237, text='I have been doing web development for a while and have always found including icons a bit of PITA. To even include a single icon, you have search for the best source, download it, and then use it in your website&#x2F;app. Inline SVGs can save you some hassle, but they clutter the code, are hard to use in some cases (like backgrounds). Plus, they lack the straightforwardness of a &lt;img&gt; tag.<p>So, I built SVGBox - a simple API to use 1000+ icons. Directly copy the &lt;img&gt; tag and use it on your website. No need to download anything. You can customize the fill using the API, and after one request, it will be served through CDN. It allows you to use iconsets as a sprite too, giving you the option to opitimize multiple requests.')
