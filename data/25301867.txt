Very confusing when the two languages are completely unrelated.<p>&gt; Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients and servers, with JavaScript scripts used to modify the properties and behavior of Java objects, so the range of live online applications that dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise networks or the Internet is virtually unlimited.<p>Was this level of integration ever achieved? Did Java applets actually have a JS API? Or is this just corporate double speak.')
