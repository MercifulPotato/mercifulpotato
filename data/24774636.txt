I can&#x27;t find any equivalent tool on-line, but there are some animated GIFs here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t-neumann.github.io&#x2F;space&#x2F;OrbitalManeuvers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t-neumann.github.io&#x2F;space&#x2F;OrbitalManeuvers&#x2F;</a><p>Scroll down to &quot;Normal and anti-normal maneuvers&quot;. Basically, adding sideways velocity will change inclination a little bit, but also make it more eccentric - as you&#x27;re not cancelling your original velocity, so the speed along the new orbital direction is greater than it was for your current altitude.')
