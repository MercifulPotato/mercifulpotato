Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607903628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411536, text='&gt; only to discover the diff is literally null.<p>Note that you can save the trouble of running diff by watching for the message &quot;Buffer contents equals file contents.&quot; Only when they&#x27;re different, you&#x27;ll want to write the file to another place and diff it.<p>What bugs me a lot is that, even if the contents are equal, it doesn&#x27;t cleanup the swap file... is there maybe a command for that so I don&#x27;t have to go back to my terminal, manually remove .&lt;filename&gt;.swp, and open up vim again?')
