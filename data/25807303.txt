Personally, I think the answer is yes.<p>Is it because I’ve become familiar with those patterns? Or is it because those patterns appeal to my senses more easily (hence, more accessible) and therefore it’s easy to come to like them?<p>Were these more accessible compositions more popular because Beethoven was already an esteemed composer, or because they resonated better with audience members, or perhaps some of both?')
