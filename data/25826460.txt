The home page has no company name or logo anywhere which leads to a sparse looking navbar. At the bottom it&#x27;s also not clear what the impact percentages mean. At first I thought it meant using fastlyn increased productivity by 70% but I after a second reading I believe you mean just a good onboarding in general means a 70% increase? That&#x27;s all well and good but I&#x27;m not convinced that fastlyn will actually give my company that. Overall a good idea but the execution could use a little improvement.')
