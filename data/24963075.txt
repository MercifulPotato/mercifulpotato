Some places have even less policies than here, but it doesn&#x27;t make click trolling any better or useful as a behavior. If you need policy to curb trolling, the place is already getting unhealthy.<p>If they wanted better policy though, they could simply remove downvote button and leave the flag one for off-topic &#x2F; offensive posts. But that wasn&#x27;t my main point.')
