Cutting out a layer that&#x27;s not strictly necessary.<p>Test environments were in AWS. There is a load balancer outside of the cluster (highly available HAProxy as a service). I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s particularly difficult or easy. It&#x27;s pretty cost effective. After the initial setup, scripting and testing, is done, you spend at most a few hours per month with maintenance and the difference in cost of severs is huge. Also, unmetered bandwidth.<p>The pain points are mostly storage (nothing beats redundant network storage ala EBS) and having to plan at least a few months in advance because you&#x27;re renting larger chunks of HW.')
