But you can iterate, delete, recreate and download them as many times as you want.<p>I am not a featured post but in the marketplace on AppSumo. So it is much harder to get noticed by the audience. They have different outreach stages, depending  on the number of positive reviews. So in the beginning it is up to you to get five 4 star reviews. After that they will mention you in the fb group. Also the share between you and AppSumo is better I think. But not 100% sure.')
