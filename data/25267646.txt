Python turned out to be a good choice, because the syntax is beginner friendly, problems can be googled and there are a lot of good libraries included.<p>I think the biggest challenge in teaching someone programming is to teach them the way you have to &quot;speak&quot; to a computer and in what it differs to speaking e.g. to a waiter in a Cafe. Many people who teach programming sort of just assume this (they probably forgot how long it took themselves initially to get to the point where they could from this).')
