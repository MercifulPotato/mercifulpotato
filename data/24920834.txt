Self-driving cars could be widely adopted <i>right now</i> and the only thing that&#x27;s stopping this adoption is a bunch of regulation that demands of them to be at least as safe as human drivers and at least as reliable.<p>If this kind of regulation were to be removed, self-driving cars like Tesla&#x27;s or Cadillac&#x27;s would be free to go everywhere and the technology would quickly reach massive adoption.<p>Of course, there is the little detail that regulation that requires cars to be safe and reliable is sane and logical and makes sense. But, if it were to be removed, there&#x27;s nothing stopping self-driving cars from making a left turn into traffic at a busy intersection near you!')
