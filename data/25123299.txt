My only complaint, like many other people, is the wait for these new products to be released. I’ve been using the new UI since it was released, however it’s still in beta (I can’t even remember what the old UI looks like at this point). I’ve tested their calendar which seems great, however still beta (with no mobile apps which make it fairly useless in my use case). I’m keen to try Drive too however I don’t want to get sucked into another tool that will likely be in beta for a long time to come.<p>I realise part of this is myself (and many others) being a bit too eager for them to release these products, however I do wish they’d focus their efforts on a single product and give it a short beta phase before full release as opposed to teasing various products that take forever to be released and not marked as beta.')
