Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610435179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743346, text='As far as I understood from the schematic [0], the power line of the mic is directly connected to the LED.<p>Looks like when you press the mute button, you both light the led up and pull-up the transistor gate (It looks like PNP so, it turns off when you apply power to the gate). This effectively cuts off power from the mic itself.<p>So, the LED is not controlled by firmware but, by the behavior of the circuit.<p>AFAIK, OTA updates cannot re-wire PCBs or do we have nanobots now?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1.bp.blogspot.com&#x2F;-vVhoXpEtTXo&#x2F;X_0iLmz9gcI&#x2F;AAAAAAAABj8&#x2F;9DALUKd4IwkluhLphXtsK8g_sHitWxQzgCLcBGAsYHQ&#x2F;w400-h243&#x2F;DSCN3085.JPG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1.bp.blogspot.com&#x2F;-vVhoXpEtTXo&#x2F;X_0iLmz9gcI&#x2F;AAAAAAAAB...</a>')
