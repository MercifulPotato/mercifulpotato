I don&#x27;t understand how that sentence is apropos.<p>Sure, fact-checking has never been so &quot;fast or efficient&quot;... But it clearly is still not yet fast or efficient, or perhaps promoted, <i>enough</i>.<p>But even that aside, I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s the point I apparently missed. I can only think that the implication is that fact checking already is as good as it&#x27;ll <i>ever</i> be and, even assuming that that was true (it isn&#x27;t), then we should just give up on free speech and resign ourselves to censorship? Well, I didn&#x27;t &quot;miss&quot; that point, I just don&#x27;t agree.')
