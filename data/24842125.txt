If you came from a time machine and said &quot;This is an AI from the year 2020&quot;, they would try and converse with it and quickly realize it&#x27;s unable to converse. People from the 80&#x27;s would probably assume by the year 2020 they&#x27;d have sentient robots and be disappointed when all it can do is turn on the lights when asked a specific way.')
