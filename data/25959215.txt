I mean, maybe ... just maybe ... they&#x27;ll get an SEC fine of a few hundred million (while protecting many hedge funds from billions in losses). In a worst case scenario a sacrificial scapegoat or two goes to a minimum security country club or house arrest for 6 months&#x2F;1 year. But that will take a few months&#x2F;years to come to pass and public sentiment will be much less hot. So they&#x27;re probably gonna force the price down to unwind existing shorts.<p>So, since there is a potential that the price will be pushed down due to the above ... doesn&#x27;t it make sense to open a new short position?')
