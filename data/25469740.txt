And often the most inscrutable.<p>Another anecdote on DRY: I&#x27;m currently refactoring two interrelated systems that share a single function, and very horrible bad things happen if the systems disagree on the return value of that function. However <i>sharing the same code</i> is more complex than duplicating it and this has a nontrivial impact on how the systems are distributed. So today I&#x27;m undoing the original work I did to make it DRY - turns out that sometimes, you need to copy&#x2F;paste.')
