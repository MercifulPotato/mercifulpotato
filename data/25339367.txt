I&#x27;d get rid of my car too if I could afford to have Uber haul me everywhere.</i><p>With reference to my sibling comment, definitively yes. I personally spent less on a handful of Lyft rides per month in Houston than I did on insurance alone when I owned a car. Never mind the cost of the vehicle itself, gas, any repairs...<p>Even adding in the cost of my rail and bus rides, still doesn&#x27;t come close to the cost of a vehicle.')
