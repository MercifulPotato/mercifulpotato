Yet, I read some laws and learned some history b&#x2F;c I&#x27;ll be applying for citizenship soon.<p>It&#x27;s a story of gradual centralization since mid-19th-century at least. It had pretty much only common currency then, but now many more things are common: criminal code, military, national bank, elements of civil law, constitution, organization of highways, the last final judicary instances, personal taxes + VAT + import duties at the federal level, common national security agency, many federal laws, types of immigration permits, laws wrt naturalization (with some regional changes).<p>It goes only one way, pretty much every federal law leaves some space for cantons and for communes to specify details, but the trend is that this space left for cantons&#x2F;communes shrinks over time.<p>E.g. the naturalization law which I&#x27;m interested in says on the federal level that applicants should be able to communicate at least at B1 (speaking&#x2F;listening) &#x2F; A2 (reading&#x2F;writing) level of the cantonal official language. Most cantons leave it as is, but some (e.g. canton Thurgau) increased it to B2&#x2F;B1. My canton (Zurich) leaves only little space for communes to influence the naturalization process (pretty much they can only check whether somebody is integrated, as in if they have Swiss acqauintances and visit local events and know something about the commune). Other cantons can leave communes more flexibility, e.g. to set higher level of language requirements or time someone lived in them.')
