Item(by='Mister_Snuggles', descendants=None, kids=[24671960, 24677890, 24672393], score=None, time=1601730835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670978, text='As someone who occasionally hires technical people, I&#x27;m torn on this one.<p>The process at my employer is that resumes are submitted via the web site, they get stored in a shared folder (each application gets a folder with all of their attachments plus whatever they entered into the form on the web site), and once the competition closes the people doing the hiring (usually a manager and a team lead) review them.<p>When I review resumes, I spend about 30s per resume on my first pass through.  This is where I just visually scan the document for keywords.  For example, if I was hiring a Django developer (I&#x27;m not, this is contrived), I&#x27;d look for Django (obviously), but also for other Python web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Pylons, web2py), other big Python frameworks (e.g., SQLAlchemy), and other related technologies that we might use in conjunction with Django (e.g., PostgreSQL, Celery, etc).<p>Once I&#x27;ve completed the first pass, I take a deeper dive into the shortlisted resumes, decide who I want to interview, etc.<p>As a technical person, I&#x27;m intrigued by this resume.  It&#x27;s presented in an interesting way, and the presentation itself can even serve as a living showcase of this person&#x27;s skills.<p>As someone doing hiring, I&#x27;m wondering how this will show up in that shared folder.  Will it be a PDF with a link that leads me to this resume?  Will there be no files attached and a link placed in the comment box?  Will I pass on a potentially great hire because I didn&#x27;t actually see a resume during my first pass?<p>I do think this resume would work really well as supplemental material to a traditional one.  One of the best people we hired submitted a traditional cover letter&#x2F;resume as a PDF, but had hyperlinks within the PDF to online supplemental material.  This worked really well for my process because they passed the initial scan, and the hyperlinks let the applicant provide a lot of detail that would have overwhelmed a traditional resume format.')
