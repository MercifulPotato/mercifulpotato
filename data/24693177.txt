Excel is tuned to autoconvert things that look like dates to dates. Best would be to be able to disable this, but Microsoft research shows that more users need it.<p>Meanwhile scientists use Excel for lots of stuff.. since it works. It has a not nice &quot;feature&quot; of those conversions.<p>So option 1) throw away the tool you use every day 2) change the gene name<p>Option 2 makes sense, although everyone would be more happy if Microsoft gave an option to toggle that auto-conversion off [there is option to properly load CSV files but people dont use it, since it takes more time...]')
