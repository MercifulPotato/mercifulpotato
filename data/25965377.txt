They got a away with a lot of shit because USA&#x2F;Trump&#x2F;India was a bigger and more obvious bogeyman&#x2F;disaster. Multiple times there were stories that were just factually untrue that were parroted by leaders in Europe about covid or the vaccine effort. The same bogeyman stories came out about masks being hijacked, Drugs being boarded by Indians or respirators being seized and the USA  “buying” all the vaccines and drugs and leaving Europeans to die. Meanwhile the USA and European covid rates pulled equal and Europe now has the dubious honor of leading total cases by 4 million.<p>What is now true is that Europe has staked itself to a inadequate short term supply, and is now hell bent on limiting vaccine to the UK to make up  for its distribution woes.<p>In the United States it’s looking like a half of project warp speed failed. The GSK vaccine is dead on arrival (2.1 billion) and novavax hasn’t even fully recruited their US study. 4 out of eight billion for vaccines unlikely to make a difference in the USA but the other 4 looks like enough to vaccinate the whole population by late summer.<p>Hopefully it looks like Europe is going to get Novavax. Despite the USA spending $2 billion prepping that vaccine, it probably  won’t be available until early fall in the states at best - so the US company will instead supply Europe. Astra Zenca made mistakes on their studies, and we still don’t know what the over 65 response rate is. It’s being approved because people are hoping that it’s effective. It’s a crappy place to be. But between those two vaccines, there might be enough. The<p>The entire vaccine mass is a reflection of lack of cooperation between Europe and USA right now.')
