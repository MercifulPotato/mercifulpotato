This paper instead studies differences between people who actually use multiple languages, against people who don&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s still corellation here, like professions where the lingua franca isn&#x27;t the local language (programming, medicine, music (to some degree), sciences, etc). The paper claims the effect appears equally strong in all occupations though.')
