They are enforcing a Kafkaesque set of rules they apparently do not comprehend themselves, and they are interpreting and enforcing them selectively. For example, Steve Bannon was not banned from Facebook after he suggested &quot;jokingly&quot; that  Dr. Anthony Fauci and Christopher Wray should be beheaded. However, when someone made a clearly satirical Facebook page &quot;Behead Zuckerberg&quot; it was quickly eliminated, even though it was meticulously screened for policy violations.<p>This is just one example that made headlines, there are thousands of similar examples. Facebook also influences the distribution of posts based on political indicators. For example, there is evidence that the dissemination of posts about Assange&#x27;s extradition trials were blocked. There is also plenty of evidence of algorithmic discrimination, and examples of ads functionality and targeting that shouldn&#x27;t even exist. For example, you could target ads to 13 year old girls in a specific town that have specific interests. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a bit creepy. Last but not least, Facebook provides a fake customer service that seems to be intentionally designed to waste time, and there have been recent discussions of claims of fraudulent payment transactions - people were apparently charged for non-existent services on their ads accounts.')
