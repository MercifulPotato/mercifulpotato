I found it very informative, and I commend your patience. While I remain convinced that election fraud has not been a meaningful influence on the outcome of this election, I fundamentally agree with you that <i>perception</i> of this issue is just as important, and that the applebaum link is reasonably interpreted as fraud occurring. To that extent, I think that your comments are downvoted unfairly.<p>Where I disagree with your argument is that this is fundamentally the cause of what has transcended in DC.<p>You say that Trump lawsuits have been dismissed instead of evidence being entertained, but if <i>according to his own lawyers</i> there is no allegation of fraud, what exactly do you expect? Why would anyone then believe that his other lawsuits are actually trying to resolve anomalies instead of being political smoke and mirrors to point his base to?<p>Similarly, it is simply inconceivable that there was sufficient fraud for a &quot;landslide&quot; Trump victory. It has absolutely no basis in fact. Yet this is exactly what Trump is preaching to whomever is willing to listen.<p>The reason people are storming the capitol is not because there are too few investigations, or because fraud has occurred. The exact same rhetoric and lies that Trump is employing right now would have just the same effect if there had been precisely zero cases and zero entertainable evidence of fraud.')
