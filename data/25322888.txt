Old and mature may sometimes mean that you will work with the efficiency of developers from 20 years ago. \nI personally prefer an approach with controlled risks, doing as much experimentation as possible on a solid foundation. Scala won’t fit here as it pretends to be a platform, but this allows to avoid J2EE quagmire with smaller or better designed frameworks and libraries.')
