For example, for reasons of availability and durability, we might wish to maintain more than one copy of the data contained by a PV. The nexus supports this by dispatching multiple copies of any writes which are received for the volume, to replicas hosted on other Mayastor Storage Nodes within the cluster (the actual replica count is defined by the Volumeâ€™s Storage Class). Only when all replicas have acknowledged their writes will the nexus signal completion of the transaction back to the consumer. That is to say, policy-based workload protection in Mayastor is based on synchronous replication.<p>Presumably life can go on so long as a replica survives.')
