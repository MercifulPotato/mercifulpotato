Item(by='krastanov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602077727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707755, text='The paradox exists because when you ask a person &quot;why it flips horizontally but not vertically&quot; most people can not respond. Usually they can not even begin discussing the premise of the question. Notice how even in your comment you did not really attack the premise, just gave a parallel explanation that skips talking about the premise. This does not really help, because as with most paradoxes, the issue is exactly with the premise. The linked video by Physics Girl does a great job at explaining the paradox away.')
