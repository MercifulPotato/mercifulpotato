So if you phase shift one side of a stereo signal and not the other, then yes, that is very audible.<p>But nodes and mixing products are independent of overall phase across the power spectrum, in a linear system. So if you apply the same phase change to both left and right, the distribution of nodes in the room won&#x27;t change. The only time these inter-frequency phase relationships start to matter is when you introduce nonlinearities, like distortion.')
