It was a weird environment where every trusted institution in society lined-up in support of both wars, and then actively worked to sideline any debate and discussion. The Dixie Chicks got infamously cancelled for saying something completely milquetoast against the Bush and the war.<p>And just as we thought we were turning a corner on the War on Terror the financial crash of 2008 hit. Here, it was another highly regarded institution: finance. Young people might not remember this, but finance used to be <i>the</i> industry you would track into if you were a high achieving member of the intelligentsia. The industry was viewed as being staffed to the gills with the best-and-brightest and was afforded anodyne coverage from the establishment media. So naturally, when they imploded the country and then went on TV and blamed it on losers with mortgages[1], and proceeded to face zero real consequences because the justice system never bothered putting laws in place to protect regular people and felt such actions would &quot;punish people for taking risks&quot; (which as an aside: if you are just externalizing risk to 3rd parties you aren&#x27;t actually &quot;encouraging people to take risks&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s a trope, but social trust has been eroded because people feel like there&#x27;s basically &quot;meritocratic&quot; caste system in this country: if you go to the right school, get into the right industry, and make enough money you are granted a measure of impunity when you externalize harm that you quite frankly shouldn&#x27;t have.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k</a>')
