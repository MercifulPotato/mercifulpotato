You can get it from foam stores that custom cut foam for reupholstery or custom upholstery.  If you get it in 4&quot; or less layers you can even roll it up or fold it if you need to transport it (although the layers do move independently and can be a bit of a pain, although two layers lets you get a harder bottom layer and softer top layer).  It is expensive but less than the really expensive mattresses (e.g. 8&quot; of king size via 2 twin XL size would be under $900 from where I purchased mine a couple of years ago, I&#x27;m not sure if they could do king or queen size as a single piece).<p>As someone who has trouble sleeping I&#x27;ve found what I sleep on seems to make surprisingly little difference as long as it isn&#x27;t causing pain.  Also, the breathable thing is likely a difference between cold sleepers and warm sleepers; as a cold sleeper I use a waterproofing layer and prefer that to a breathable mattress.')
