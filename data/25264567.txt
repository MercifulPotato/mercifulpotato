They built an especially attractive service\n    (judging by user numbers)\n</code></pre>\nThat is why they initially rose to dominance. They provided a faster and more focused version of what Myspace had become. More attractive, indeed.<p>They maintain dominance primarily through the power of network effect. You are free to switch away from Facebook, but doing so is useless unless a significant portion of your network switches as well.<p>FB&#x27;s end user experience is still good (I&#x27;m talking strictly about their engineering and UX here, not their business practices and other board-level decisions) and they have expanded it by adding things like their marketplace. If that experience ever got bad enough I&#x27;m sure people would start itching to switch.<p>But as things are, a competitor would not merely need to be as good or even 50% or 100% better. More like 500% or 1000% better if they wanted to overcome the momentum of FB&#x27;s network effect.')
