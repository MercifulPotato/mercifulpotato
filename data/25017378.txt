They&#x27;ve been that way since the 360&#x27;s release as I recall which was in 2006. With 14 years of inflation alone that would give us &gt; $77 as the price.<p>Some reasons I&#x27;ve heard:\n- The number of gamers and thus the size of the market has increased which means companies don&#x27;t need to raise prices\n- There&#x27;s a gross over-saturation of the market such that the collective value of each game is brought down<p>None of these really satisfy me personally but I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s some data or thinking on this.')
