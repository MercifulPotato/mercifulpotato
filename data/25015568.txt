Many MIT advocates regard shipping parts of MIT licensed code inside a proprietary product as &quot;using&quot; it. And yes, in some ways they are right, but it&#x27;s definitely not the only meaning of the term.<p>The GPL has a different usage definition: run and execute. E.g. think of an image manipulation program under the GPL. If you design a game, you run the program to create assets, but none of the created assets contain a trace of the original program any more. The game you ship doesn&#x27;t either. The GPL doesn&#x27;t affect you. However, if you tried copying one of the algorithms implemented in the program into your own proprietary competitor, you infringe on the copyright now.')
