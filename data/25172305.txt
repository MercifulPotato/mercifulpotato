Item(by='nickmqb', descendants=None, kids=[25172725], score=None, time=1605988431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172197, text='The FPGA that I&#x27;m using for this (the Lattice iCE40 UP5K) is really limited when it comes to RAM, which is the main constraint when it comes to world size. As per the title, there&#x27;s only 143kb, which is insanely low for doing any kind of 3D stuff :). 48kb is used by the frame buffer, 19kb for textures, which leaves 76kb. 48kb of that is used for the map, which currently limits it to 32x32x32 blocks. However, I do have some plans to improve on that in the future!<p>The FPS (30Hz) is rock steady though! One of my pet peeves when doing DirectX&#x2F;OpenGL development is that it&#x27;s really hard to completely avoid frame drops, e.g. if the OS decides to schedule some other thread, or because the GPU driver decided to do something else than render your app. With hardware development, you can side step all of those problems. As a result, the Minecraft clone is guaranteed to not drop frames :).')
