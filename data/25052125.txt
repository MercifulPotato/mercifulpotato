Blacks and Hispanics are voting less and less for Democrats, and that is true more for this last election than 2016<p>Clinton won greater than 90% of the black vote in 2016, as did House Democrats in 2018; there&#x27;s indications that Biden did a little worse this year. specifically among black men.<p>&gt; the Dems are becoming the party of rich white people.<p>Good verified voter data for 2020 will take a while, but in 2016 Trump won 55-39 among whites with over $150K income; the Republicans (while they have support elsewhere, as well) are very much the party of rich white people. Meanwhile, even if they&#x27;ve lost some ground with some of these groups compared to some point in the past, Democrats remain heavily favored, nationally, by blacks, asians, and hispanics.')
