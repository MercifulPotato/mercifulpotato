You can see a comparison of the two techniques here [3] (look at &quot;Figure 1&quot; and you will easily see the difference).\nYou are correct that ground effect is quite visible in that clip.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OtnL4KYVtDE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OtnL4KYVtDE</a><p>[2] actually in the clip this happens twice, crab, de-crab, then crab again then de-crab once more on touchdown. The Kai Tak checkerboard approach, even without crosswind, was an incredibly difficult approach and in this case the pilot had to perform a couple of corrections.<p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flaps2approach.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2014&#x2F;6&#x2F;17&#x2F;crosswind-landing-techniques-part-one-crab-and-sideslip.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flaps2approach.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2014&#x2F;6&#x2F;17&#x2F;crosswind-la...</a>')
