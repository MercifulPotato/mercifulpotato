In order to support a cloud-save feature, they must first decrypt those streams in order to re-encode them into a unified multimedia file. Even if they were to store encrypted versions of all of these individual audio&#x2F;video streams, how would they ultimately present that back to the user on request? There is no practical or easy way to do this.')
