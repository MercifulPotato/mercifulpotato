After an incubation time of 30 s, bead fluorescence is measured using a high-speed camera under spatially multiplexed two-colour laser illumination.<p>&gt; Incoming beads are first illuminated by a red laser, which interrogates the Cy5 fluorescence intensity indicating the glucose concentration. This is followed by illumination with a green laser that interrogates the R-PE fluorescence intensity, which measures the insulin concentration. We used an exposure time of 50 ms and acquired images every 100 ms.<p>&gt; To allow for real-time analysis, RT-ELISA requires a continuous supply of reagents, which corresponds to approximately US$10.50 worth of reagents consumed for a 1-h run.<p>&gt; The detection scheme will also need to be miniaturized to reduce its complexity, most notably with regard to the camera and other optical components. However, we believe that such miniaturization would be possible with integrated photonics and that further advances in these technologies could make RT-ELISA suitable for bedside patient monitoring.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41551-020-00661-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41551-020-00661-1</a>')
