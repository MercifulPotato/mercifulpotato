A lot of my exams were open book - because exactly like you said - it&#x27;s mostly about do you know how to think about something, do you know how to unfold something, do you know what to search for, and how it&#x27;s useful.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve had to help nieces and nephews with calculus homework, and it&#x27;s been interesting to see this at play in the &quot;real&quot; world. I approach math a little differently now than a high schooler would, and usually my mind starts to wander around thinking, &quot;you know, I&#x27;m pretty sure I remember xyz theorem that we can use here, let me look it up.&quot; Most of the time it works every time. From there it&#x27;s easy to put it into the context of their current lesson and go over it in a way that makes sense with how and what they are studying in class.<p>When looking at job applicants, if someone has a degree, at the very least it means they had an opportunity to put a lot of effort into it and HOPEFULLY it means they got a lot out of it.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s possible, maybe even most common, for it to just be a piece of paper - and that&#x27;s OK. That&#x27;s why we interview and a degree isn&#x27;t the be all end all.')
