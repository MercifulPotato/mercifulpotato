The number one feature of Go is simplicity. In service to that simplicity it deliberately left out a lot of features such as destructors and generics. And the thing is, the language works for its purposes. However, if you subvert that simplicity, it doesn&#x27;t have the tools and abstractions to make using manual memory safer (destructors, generics, etc). My guess is you follow this path, you will be accumulating technical debt at a very high interest rate.')
