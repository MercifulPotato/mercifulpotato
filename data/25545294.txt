For a new architecture like this it&#x27;s normal to start with deeply embedded (and relatively low power) cores, and then move up the food chain. It takes time to build an ecosystem.<p>Currently the ISA is minimalist but I assume that at the high end some extensions still in development will eventually become expected, like bit operations or the vector extension.')
