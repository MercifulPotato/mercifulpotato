At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala.<p>These days, I work for a &quot;new media&quot; company you probably heard of and, over the past year, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle &gt;10,000 API payload extractions daily.<p>My area of expertise includes data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. That I&#x27;m a top-tier developer goes without saying. I&#x27;m interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring.<p>Would love to connect even if it&#x27;s just for networking!<p>Blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dvt.name&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dvt.name&#x2F;</a><p>GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvx</a><p>Resume&#x2F;contact: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dvt.name&#x2F;resume&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dvt.name&#x2F;resume&#x2F;</a>')
