I&#x27;m sad at the proliferation of zero-sum thinking. It&#x27;s like a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. The equilibrium state is competition, but collaboration gets us all ahead in a non-zero-sum way. Or, if you really do see it all as zero sum, there&#x27;s still an analytical way out. Just take the long view. Collaboration will get our group ahead of the group who competes for the smallest things. Hyperbolically, we&#x27;d all rather be a low level IC at early my-shares-will-be-worth-infinity Google than be a VP at an imploding firm.<p>The pro-social way out of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&#x27;s shitty equilibrium requires deliberate effort to foster the sort of personal trust and collaboration-by-default attitude that makes the 8+ work hours of every weekday of most of our lives not suck.<p>And it makes people feel good, which is personally enough for me (while recognizing the privilege that lets me say I have enough).')
