It&#x27;s based on probabilistic finality, meaning that the probability that a transaction won&#x27;t be reversed increases as more blocks are added on top. One major advantage of PoS is that it has &quot;Absolute Finality&quot; - after a certain amount of blocks, it&#x27;s absolutely impossible to do a 51% attack.
