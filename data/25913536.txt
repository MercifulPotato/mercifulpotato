The article briefly touches on Cousin Jan, but didn&#x27;t link it to the word that&#x27;s still in use today (means someone born near the sea, or someone from Plymouth).<p>I&#x27;m just thinking &quot;Cousin Jack&quot; is a very easy transformation from &quot;Cousin Jan&quot; if you&#x27;re trying to &#x27;decornishify&#x27; the word and pick a generic English sounding name. Could be why it became the common fib name people told their bosses when introducing other cornish people for employment? Maybe a stretch though, I&#x27;m just spitballing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Janner" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Janner</a>')
