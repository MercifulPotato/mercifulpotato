Almost everybody games at some point in their lives. Everybody know people who play video games for significant percent of their free time. If the link was significant we would&#x27;ve noticed by now.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to argue video games and crime are linked when the curves are:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;hSHDyoH.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;hSHDyoH.png</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.statcdn.com&#x2F;Statistic&#x2F;190000&#x2F;191219-blank-355.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.statcdn.com&#x2F;Statistic&#x2F;190000&#x2F;191219-blank-355.pn...</a><p>Of course it&#x27;s possible that the link is small and other factors overpower it.

Or, said in other words: &quot;ordinary claims require very little evidence&quot;.')
