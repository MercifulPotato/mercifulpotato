So we should fix that, rather than tossing the idea of a hypertext architecture.  (That&#x27;s exactly what I tried to do with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org</a>, which just went 1.0 btw)<p>There are tons of hacks and problems with layout and all the rest, but that has nothing to do with using javascript over the original hypertext model for the web.  That&#x27;s just how real world systems end up when they are the most successful network architecture ever devised.')
