If your city is out of money, you can choose to collect an enormous amount of fines and fees using the police to fund your city. The tooltip for that slider said this will increase citizen dissatisfaction with the police and lead to unrest, although I haven&#x27;t really tested it to the max yet.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s more intended to be a dystopian rather than a utopian city builder, from the brutalist art style to the little game mechanics which imply about city design.')
