A few years ago over the course of ~18 months, I lost 100 lbs.  I ate pasta almost every day when I did this.<p>One problem, particularly in the US, is that portion sizes are so large.  This affects much more than just pasta.  But in the American mind, a serving of pasta is often easily 3x what it should be.  A small plate of pasta, maybe pancetta, some cheese and an egg?  Filling, but also can be light.')
