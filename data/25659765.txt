I would be surprised if FB had a billion real users at this point. It should literally be close to impossible to find folks without them in western countries, statistically, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s becoming easier and more common... or folks just lie about not having facebook for some reason (which is plausible though very weird).')
