What I mean is: a balanced (differential) shielded cable is a reasonable way to transmit an analog audio signal — common mode noise can be rejected pretty well, as can currents that might be induced in the shield due to a ground loop.<p>With RCA, you have none of these benefits. Heck, with RCA stereo, unless one end is isolated or you cut one of the shields, you cannot avoid a ground loop — the stereo connection by itself contains a ground loop.')
