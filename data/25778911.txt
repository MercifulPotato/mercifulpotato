Particularly if you have a strategist who thinks his job is just to dream up profitable models, he ends up carving that role out in a way that&#x27;s detrimental to the rest of the team. You get people who just don&#x27;t appreciate that there&#x27;s other work to do than finding models, and that models depend on that other work to function.<p>You also get a huge prestige gap, because inevitably management will think that there&#x27;s a magician and a blacksmith. One guy needs to be paid a lot, and the other guy needs to be paid enough.<p>These effects feed each other. Magician will say &quot;where&#x27;s my data&quot; and expect blacksmith to make it, promptly. He won&#x27;t do it himself, because spending time on mundane stuff makes the magic disappear. And not doing it yourself, or taking the time to understand it, will eventually lead to problems with the magic.')
