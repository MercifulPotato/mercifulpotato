(For an actual example, see the stubborn refusal to follow XDG spec.) This is not an example of that. Defaulting prefix to &quot;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&quot; is what every well-behaved Linux package does.<p>It seems odd to install so many packages at the &quot;global&quot; (but not owned by root!) level, that using the &quot;--prefix=~&quot; flag would be a hardship. I just checked; I have three. You can&#x27;t fault npm for this.')
