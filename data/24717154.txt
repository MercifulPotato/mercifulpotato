That&#x27;s $400,000 you didn&#x27;t have before. Hell yeah, $400k! That&#x27;s loads. The fact we&#x27;re both going away happy doesn&#x27;t make it right though. There&#x27;s a big disparity there. If you found out that I&#x27;d kept 4* what you got you&#x27;d have every reason to be pissed about it.<p>Do you honestly believe that every penny a company makes ought to be given to its employees?<p>If not, then why should employees expect to make more than the market rate for the labor they provide?')
