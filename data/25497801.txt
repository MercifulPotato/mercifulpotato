If you graduated with a degree in CS, and landed a six figure tech job it&#x27;d still make sense financially to go through bankruptcy and save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans, even though you could easily pay it off over several years. This let&#x27;s the student exploit the lender.<p>The status quo of making student loans not cancellable through bankruptcy makes it so that lenders can act in a predatory manner and issue loans to go to ineffective institutions that don&#x27;t improve earning potential. They know students won&#x27;t be able to pay for decades, but they don&#x27;t care because the student is stuck with the debt and has no way of getting rid of it. This lets the lender exploit the student.<p>Allowing student loans to be resolved through bankruptcy after 10-15 years is enough time so that most graduates have assets, and are probably looking for a mortgage on a home in the near future. Going through bankruptcy at 30 or 35 is a much bigger deal than doing so at 21. In this situation, the student can&#x27;t easily exploit the lender. But at the same time the lender still has the potential for loss if they try to loan to a student studying basket weaving at a university with a 98% acceptance rate.<p>The easier it is to eliminate a student loan the easier it is for a student to exploit the lender, and take the loan intending to go through bankruptcy. The harder it is to eliminate a student loan, the easier it is for banks to write loans they know students can&#x27;t pay off. The optimal spot is somewhere in the middle, where the student has an escape valve - but one that is only feasible to take if you have no significant assets by the time you&#x27;re 30 or 35. If the lender is worried that a student debtor won&#x27;t have enough assets by 30-35 to make bankruptcy a bad option, then they will think twice about issuing the loan.')
