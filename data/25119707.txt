Given the time I&#x27;d guess that the mathematicians at Moderna worked all weekend crunching numbers and writing a paper (which is what I&#x27;d do if I was a statistician there).<p>Pfizer is big enough to have&#x2F;let a PR department do a press release during business hours. Of course given that Pfizer did a press release first Moderna for PR reasons needed to release more data to make a bigger splash.<p>No matter how you look at it, there is important data that will be in the FDA (and equivalent in other countries) submission that we don&#x27;t have. There could be a &quot;thats funny&quot; thing burred, though odds are against it.')
