Kotlin releases you from the OOP-only straightjacket of Java. I recently wrote an API with Kotilin&#x2F;Ktor using only functions and it was a piece of cake. Not a single AbstractProxyServiceBuilderFactory in the whole codebase. Kotlin&#x27;s multi-paradigm approach makes it an ideal candidate for projects begun in Ruby or Python which need to scale as all these languages are OO-based but with the option of going procedural or functional when required. PHP is weird. After PHP5 was released it&#x27;s as if a spell was cast on the whole community compelling them to write their code as if the language suffered from the constraints of Java. Talk about culture envy. Procedural PHP seemed to just vanish as if it had been deprecated. So Java culture has infected other languages, notably PHP and C#.')
