The number of stocks floating around stay the same, however, the number of iou&#x27;s increases. Likewise, a person can buy the one share, return it, then buy it again, and return it again to settle the second of the iou&#x27;s.<p>Interesting that nobody is really explain the mechanics of how this works. Makes me wonder if a lot of retail investors are about to get hurt.')
