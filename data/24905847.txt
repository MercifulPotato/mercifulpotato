At all times. If I&#x27;ve got battery power, I should have my notes. Even Evernote screws this up sometimes if you&#x27;re on a slow (not down) network<p>I&#x27;ve switched to Joplin myself because it just syncs every so often. My notes aren&#x27;t hidden behind some bloated app that struggles with high latency and as a bonus my central storage is my NAS over WebDAV (and Tailscale to access it everywhere I have internet access)')
