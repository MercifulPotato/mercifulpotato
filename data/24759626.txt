AWS SAM has tackled some of the IaC modeling problem (on top of CloudFormation which is a mature choice) and they&#x27;ve had a crack at the local iteration (invoke Lambda function or API Gateway locally with connectivity to cloud services).<p>It&#x27;s a little incomplete, missing some of the AWS IAM automation that makes local development smooth, environment management for testing and promoting changes, and some sort of visualization to make architecture easier to design as a team.<p>I work for a platform company called Stackery which aims to provide an end-to-end workflow and DX for serverless &amp; CloudFormation. Thanks for comments like these that help identify pain points that need attention.')
