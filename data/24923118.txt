Of course in humans that can be due to drunkeness or distraction or confusion, nobody is claiming human drivers are perfect, but if it is the &#x27;weird&#x27; situations that tend to result in accidents and deep learning tends to make mistakes in &#x27;weird&#x27; circumstances, that doesn&#x27;t fill me with confidence.<p>Also it is not at all obvious that self driving cars will do better than humans. Perhaps they will, but  it isn&#x27;t just about numbers. As I alluded to in another comment, imagine if they had 50% of the human death rate but it was all small children and occurred seemingly randomly. Do you think that would be acceptable and a better outcome? These things are less black and white than they might seem.<p>Another factor is that with deep learning it is fully a black box. It is very difficult to understand WHY a particular course of action was taken, whereas in human cases you can usually determine this. The why might also be limited, e.g. &#x27;human child was mislabelled as stop sign&#x27; or similar, which just causes further questions.<p>The fact that you have scenarios the car will definitely not know how to handle combined with a deep level of inscrutability makes it difficult to have confidence in issues being resolved or the technology improving on a safety basis.')
