You can search, you can fetch emails by thread. You can get text snippets of emails for preview. JMAP can also automatically convert any email into directly renderable HTML.<p>I’m convinced if nothing else the jmap json format is what everyone should be using for passing around email objects since it’s so well designed and feature rich. Almost all hand rolled email json formats throw away data you really want when rendering or processing email messages.<p>IMAP api does look lovely though.')
