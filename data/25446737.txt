It enables the status quo to return quickly and minimizes the change to the social fabric. Those are things I would have imagined conservatives would want: stability.<p>It&#x27;s very strange that we couldn&#x27;t move money around and hadn&#x27;t been saving money &quot;for a rainy day&quot; exactly like this one.')
