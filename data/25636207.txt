Bridgegate was real and only involved New Jersey politics. Pizzagate of course is a grab bag of everything.<p>Of course we can make a Bridgegate conspiracy theory by simply pointing out the fact that Chris Christie’s name translates as “Christ Christ”, and he was opposed by Mark Sokolich. And what’s another word for “opposed” or “opposite”? That’s right “anti”, as in the antichrist.<p>Now you might be suspicious, but we know from analyzing transcendentalist literature that the pronunciation of names is a symbol. “Chris Christie”, in addition to meaning Christ, leaves your mouth with a smile, while “Mark Sokolich” leaves your mouth harsh and jagged, like evil.<p>Furthermore, governor of New Jersey ordered the closures of the upper deck of the George Washington Bridge. Which isn’t surprising because George Washington was famously a Freemason, a group that’s connected to Hermeticism, which has the famous saying, “As above, so below.” Close the upper deck, close the ground.<p>“Ground” is just another word for “Earth”, and so what is above the Earth? That’s right the heavens. And what lives in the Heaven? That’s right God. But not just any god, the false gods, those from the heavens, the ancient travelers from the stars.<p>So you see, by closing two-thirds of the toll booths dedicated to the town, the governor of New Jersey performed a magickal working to ensare and imprison an alien battle fleet, commanded by the the reptilian demon that had replaced the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey.<p>This is just facts. It’s just that the whole is considerably less than the parts.')
