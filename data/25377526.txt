They&#x27;re not &quot;marketing&quot; their pricing, nor the fact that you are &quot;forced to design systems that use less resources&quot;.<p>I think they are referring to this statement:<p>&gt; &gt; AWS pricing is a part of your design. With some exceptions (that you aren&#x27;t talking about), they charge you more for using more resources. You are forced to design systems that use less resources if you want to optimize your bill.<p>It is a defense that I&#x27;ve heard in many AWS talks in the past.<p>Where it turns into a &#x27;marketing&#x27; blurb to me is my real world experience in these AWS talks in the places I work. As a real world example, we had a product that required -some- architectural work, but otherwise was solid, and could run on 3 live EC2 instances (2 web LB, 1 live backend) and 1 spare (spare backend)<p>The Consultant that AWS partnered us with? Suggested a very overdone architectural revamp, moving everything possible into AWS Specific technologies.<p>It&#x27;s marketing in that in many of our experiences, we know there is often at least one person on a team who does -not- have the discipline and&#x2F;or experience to -keep- a system using less resources as the field goes from green to brown.')
