I hacked on this and other iPhone support on Linux back in the day, including on getting music sync support working, back when I myself used an iPhone.<p>At the time I wrote usbmuxd, which implements the sync (not tethering) part of the protocol. I can now say that I had a bit of behind the scenes help from an Apple engineer; his tips helped work out some corner cases that would&#x27;ve been quite hard to track down otherwise. This friend sadly passed away a few years ago.<p>Unfortunately, Apple has always been (publicly) hostile to third party support for their devices. For example, they insist on &quot;signing&quot; music databases with algorithms based on their FairPlay DRM implementation, to stop non-iTunes software from syncing music to them. I reverse engineered one variant of this (which was based on a white-box AES implementation and a lot of obfuscated junk) but they kept changing the algorithm. This went into libgpod and libimobiledevice.')
