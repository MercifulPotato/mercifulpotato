That&#x27;s how a market functions.<p>If they&#x27;re unaware of the negative effects of lead or a business is being dishonest about what&#x27;s in the fuel, that definitely falls under unfair&#x2F;dishonest practices and the government should prosecute that.<p>But how on earth is that relevant to Facebook or Apple antitrust? Facebook operates a bunch of websites that millions of people voluntarily sign up for and can leave at any time. The government isn&#x27;t suing Facebook for safety issues or anything, they&#x27;re suing them for antitrust which means they believe Facebook has somehow unfairly coerced consumers into using their product over their competitors.')
