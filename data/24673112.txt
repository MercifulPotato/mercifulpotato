It does not need to be operated like a bureaucratic profit seeking corporation. The problem is that the corporate world leaks their madness into our private lives. Just do whatever you want and have fun. Remember that you can choose any type of societal model to structure your project. And most importantly you are free to walk away at any time. But there exist two things here the real project and the social avatar of the project and how the people on the project interact with each other. What belongs to whom? and does it matter? Sub specie aeternitatis this whole thing feels like an effing Herzog movie. Please don&#x27;t let yourselves get carried away by this nonsense. Like whats the effing point here Fitzcarraldo? I mean seriously people, as a humanity, where are we going so fast that we can&#x27;t wait to get there and why don&#x27;t get there with joy?')
