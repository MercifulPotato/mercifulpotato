They have been making toys for 100 years and have been consistent pioneers in consumer electronics.  They are no stranger to proprietary connectors.  They opted to not develop one this time because it was seen as an unnecessary cost.  Instead they took the parts of a well developed standard they liked and cut the corners they wanted to cut.  They would have had a harder time finding an OTS non-compliant solution than an OTS compliant one.  Playing by the standard cost too much.  The only narrative here is “Nintendo sees no one is watching the cookie jar and takes from it.  They prefer to be the only one with cookies anyway and don’t see the benefit of a communal jar.”, not “Nintendo don’t know what they’re doing”.')
