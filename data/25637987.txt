Occasionally I&#x27;ll talk with somebody from back then and ask them how they think things turned out. The general answer is, &quot;Well this isn&#x27;t what we intended, so I&#x27;ve moved on to other things.&quot; Which is basically my answer too.<p>My best guess as to how the shark-jumping happened: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agilefocus.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;agiles-second-chasm-and-how-we-fell-in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agilefocus.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;agiles-second-chasm-and-how...</a><p>The TL;DR version is that once it went mainstream, Agile was defined by the mainstream, which was not looking for excellence. Aided vigorously, of course, by the certification scam that is Scrum, where meaningless credentials were profitably bestowed by people who had little incentive to tighten things up. And one thing I&#x27;ve realize in ensuing years is that a key element was the culture of managerialism, which is inimical to anything that might make a manager look bad or diminish his empire.')
