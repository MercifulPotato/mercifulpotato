The way that a single genome is processed by myriad cells throughout the body is a miracle of decentralization. Each node is free to deviate and improvise and yet for the most part they work together for the greater good of the overall network. Cancer is what happens when a small group of cells deviates from the protocol and starts consuming resources to the exclusion of their neighbor.  What is a tumor if not a centralized drive towards growth at any cost?  Sounds like many modern tech companies to me.<p>You also seem to think that decentralization would lead to less emphasis on local happenings. Why? If we moved away from a handful of services for the whole planet, wouldn&#x27;t the logical next phase be a service or two per city?  A decentralized web means knowing the guy who runs the server you&#x27;re connecting to. A decentralizalized internet means configuring your router to peer with routers in the houses that you can see from your house.   Relocalization seems like an obvious consequence of decentralizalization to me.')
