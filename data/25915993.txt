Well in my opinion we don&#x27;t have communities like we used to have with deep trust, even the families are not the same anymore.<p>On the other hand I am not afraid to go to neighboring city (or when I was a kid it could be even other part of the city) so someone would come up with &quot;hey you are not from around here, what are you looking for a trouble here son?&quot;.<p>We traded deep trust for broad trust. This way price of transactions on bigger scale went down a lot, even if they went up on personal or local level.<p>In the end broad trust is more useful for people because it enables mobility. One can move to a big city and won&#x27;t be instantly scammed. If we would value deep trust only, there would be no way for people to move out from &quot;dead end&quot; places.<p>One could live his whole life in one place and have his deep trust network but that is less and less possible in the current world. That is why we need broad societal trust.<p>&quot;Bowling alone&quot; - bowling leagues and PTAs, if someone lives 2 years in one place on average he is not going to be there long enough to be accepted in his local group.')
