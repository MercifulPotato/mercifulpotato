Instead, as you observe, the divisions are being driven deeper. Dissenters are being labeled terrorists. Those who wear there tolerance on their shirt sleeves can&#x27;t tolerate disagreement. They claim that only intolerant people disagree.<p>If 50k+ people march on the Capitol Building, at what point are the politicians within responsible for failing to represent their interests? Isn&#x27;t that a basic premise of democracy, that violence will be averted by proportional representation?<p>If half the country finds no credibility in media reportage, at what point are reporters responsible?<p>Was there nothing else that the media or the political establishment could have done to address the public&#x27;s concerns and add legitimacy to the process? Or is it simply enough to dismiss them all as terrorists?<p>Obviously this strategy hasn&#x27;t worked thus far, yet the establishment seems keen on doubling down.<p>According to the narrative I&#x27;ve seen, the above non sequiturs should be ignored.
