Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610555273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761683, text='I don’t think the anticompetitive thing really holds water: Parler is in no way a competitor to Alphabet’s companies, or Amazon, and not really a competitor to Facebook (whereas I could say it was a serious competitor to Twitter). So it’s hard to see what the <i>economic</i> or <i>market</i> benefits of the horizontal conduct would be. Amazon, Facebook, and Google have defensible reasons to block Parler that has nothing to do with their bottom line. For example, Parler’s irresponsible refusal to moderate violence if it’s ‘political’ poses a serious threat to these companies’ workers and leadership [1].<p>I also find the whole idea that there was collusion to be a claim without evidence or plausibility: Parler was correctly associated with the Capitol Hill riot and had been deliberately stoking far-right aggression for years - it was Parler’s business model. It makes far more sense to me that Big Tech leadership all decided to ban Parler independently because they read the news last week.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;MaxKennerly&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349172320594767872" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;MaxKennerly&#x2F;status&#x2F;13491723205947...</a>')
