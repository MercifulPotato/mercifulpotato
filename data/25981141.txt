It was not uncommon for someone to sell physical media with otherwise-free software, and so it was desirable to make end-users aware that the software was available for free. The GPL&#x27;s &quot;accompany it with a written offer... of the corresponding source code&quot; is also an interesting holdover from this era (nowadays everyone just distributes source over the Internet, instead of sending checks and CDs through the mail).<p>Copyright notices were also typically visible when you first started a program in the 80s and 90s. These were relegated to &quot;about&quot; menus when it became the norm to &quot;design a launch screen thatâ€™s nearly identical to the first screen of your app&quot; to make apps feel faster.')
