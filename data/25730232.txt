To me, it seems that this is where government or industry regulation would be helpful and provide most value with minimal impact on innovation and market disruption.<p>On the other hand, I am uneasy with regulators mandating specific designs (e.g. all phones must have replaceable batteries), or specific standards (e.g. all phones need to use USB-C) or doing things like forcing Apple to include a charge cable or headphones with their devices.<p>[1] I&#x27;m thinking of Jessa Jones and Louis Rossmann specifically.')
