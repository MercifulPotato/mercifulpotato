Ie. it&#x27;s not really a discussion, it&#x27;s &quot;these are my values and you either agree with them or you&#x27;re a terrible person&quot;.<p>For example, I saw a comment thread on this board about Black Lives Matter. It had devolved to the point where one commenter said something like, &quot;BLM means that you either believe that black lives literally matter or you do not.&quot;, which, obviously, is not true.')
