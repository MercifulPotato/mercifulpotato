They have positive and negative outcomes and there is very little evidence that the two sides have been weighed against each other. The scale of the damage done by our response is too great to accept best effort attempts to control the disease. The standard of the response needs to be excellence, not competence.<p>We also can&#x27;t discount the possibility that there were easier, less invasive measures than lockdowns that captured a lot of the benefit without the costs.
