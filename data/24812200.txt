Some percentage of people are going to do as they wish without regard to law or the interests of anyone else.<p>Not even in brutal military occupations can anything approaching this level of control be achieved, and even if it <i>were</i> possible, the totalitarian infrastructure required would have far worse consequences than a disease.<p>The best bet seems to be unified messaging and economic safety net programs that allow everyone who <i>might</i> be willing to comply under the right circumstances to do so. The US response has been a spectacular failure in both of these areas.')
