Among them is specific rural constituency (&quot;Heung Yee Kuk&quot;) and one for agriculture and fisheries, but also various more-urban constituencies like tourism, IT, and healthcare.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good sense of how well this works in practice, and of course it is confounded by Hong Kong being a very unusual jurisdiction to start with. But yeah, I think it would be a more principled approach than having this one feature in our government to nominally give extra voting rights to rural populations in particular. It&#x27;s difficult to figure out what those importances really are and it&#x27;s unlikely everyone will agree, but I think everyone <i>can</i> agree that the answer is not that rural voters are the only special constituency.<p>Alternatively, there&#x27;s a simpler argument - those things that are important in society are important because everyone cares about it, and therefore an urban legislator is unlikely to say &quot;We don&#x27;t need farms,&quot; because the urban legislator needs to eat. If the agricultural constituency says they need some measure, they <i>already</i> have the ability to convince the general voting public in proportion to their importance in society.<p>(Also, it&#x27;s not like our current system effectively gives rural voters an additional voice. California is our top agricultural exporter, but it tends to vote in the opposite way from the smaller-population states. And even if you <i>did</i> give a specific voice to California&#x27;s agricultural interests, it&#x27;s highly likely that they&#x27;d disagree with the policies advocated by smaller-population states to reduce immigration and increase deportations, for instance.)')
