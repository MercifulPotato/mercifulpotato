In general I find the way many unit tests are written to be very brittle. There is a balance here. If the 80 lines are clear and easy to understand they will likely be easy to test also. It’s very situational though. An 80 line function isn’t that bad. Check out the SQLite code base, which is extremely well tested, or the linux kernel. C code tends to push out the line count. Whereas 80 in Python is probably a bit much. Some libraries, especially GUI code tend to take a lot of lines, mostly just handling events and laying things out and there you often see big functions as well.')
