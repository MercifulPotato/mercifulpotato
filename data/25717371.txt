Thus it is PR spin to phrase it in that manner because people associate &quot;frying&quot; with extreme high temps well over boiling point (212 degrees F &#x2F; 100 deg C)<p>The coffee at McD&#x27;s at the time was around 180 degrees F (82 deg C),  their justification for that (right or wrong) was customers wanted to hotter coffee so it would still be hot when they arrived at the homes or offices after visiting the drive through.<p>Anecdotally, I know many people today that complaining about drinks from Drive through not being HOT enough,  or cooling down too quickly<p>&gt;&gt;Also, at the time, McDonald&#x27;s had reports of over 700 people who had been injured to various degrees by their coffee.<p>Over a 10 year span, over thousands of locations, and probably millions of cups of coffee sold, from a statistical standpoint that is very small rate')
