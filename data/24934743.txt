You can add to that all the other countries&#x27; budgets <i>and</i> all private investments, it&#x27;s still <i>nothing</i>.<p>More money is spent on recreating the same consumer products every year, creating brain numbing entertainment, creating military equipment that will be retired before it&#x27;s used, disseminating misinformation around the globe, keeping people in prisons.<p>The space exploration budgets are <i>tiny</i>, all around the world. Same goes for money allocated for climate change.')
