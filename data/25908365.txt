Don&#x27;t care. Means stuffs free right?&quot;, or &quot;I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong, I don&#x27;t care&quot;.<p>&gt;  That is like trying to identify a suspect using a smiley face. If they track you it isn&#x27;t anonymous<p>By that I mean regulations around what they track, identifiable data, not being able to explicitly say User2021 === Josefx on the system. I think this is why Google is going with the &#x27;cohorts&#x27; in their FloC approach.<p>&gt; Why do we need targeted ads?<p>Good question. &quot;Need&quot;, probably not. But if I am on facebook, and ads are going to happen, do I want highest bidder ads like &quot;Find Hot Milks in your Area Now&quot; interspersed between my feed&#x27;s family baby photos or an add for &quot;World&#x27;s best Uncle&quot; T-Shirts? There&#x27;s a happy medium somewhere.')
