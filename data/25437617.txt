However, if I have a video in PiP mode and I click pause, randomly about 5-10 seconds later it unpauses and keeps playing.  This happens on both Hulu and Netflix.. on multiple computers and has been going on for quite some time.<p>Seems like such a common thing I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been fixed.')
