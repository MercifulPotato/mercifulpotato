I&#x27;m not recommending that someone escalate a verbal altercation into a physical one. I&#x27;m saying that zero tolerance policies prevent people who are bullied from fighting back in a physical altercation.<p>On a side note, depending on the state and the specific circumstances, if a bully utters fighting words, one could be justified to get physical if there was an imminent threat to violence. Of course, law and school policy are different.')
