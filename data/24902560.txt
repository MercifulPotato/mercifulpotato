I just wanted to make the logic explicit that if we were to disable the flagging system, we&#x27;d have to do it across the board, and that would turn HN into a political site.<p>It&#x27;s true that I&#x27;m using somewhat generic terms to describe these situations but there&#x27;s a simple reason for that: there are hundreds of users asking (and sometimes outright demanding) answers and only one of me to answer them. If there&#x27;s something specific that I said that you feel is unclear I can try to clarify it.<p>I don&#x27;t find words like &quot;suppression&quot; super helpful because they mostly just add negative emotional valence to something that&#x27;s not secret and is rather benign. If we have more political opinion pieces and&#x2F;or inflammatory political stories on the front page, then we have less room for discussion of the topics that HN primarily exists for. You can call that suppression if you want. Is a florist suppressing chocolate by only offering a small selection of the latter in their flower shop?')
