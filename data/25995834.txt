Googleâ€™s biggest ad clients achieve pretty incredible ROI (called ROAS) on each dollar they spend.<p>It&#x27;s their job to figure out how to best advertise, not mine to hand it to them on a silver platter at my own expense. This is my data, information about <i>me</i>, which they are stealing without my knowledge and profiting from. If someone asked me if they could snoop around in my personal affairs for money, the price would be a hell of a lot higher than the big fat zero I get in return here.<p>Whatever Google or Facebooks&#x27; advertising ROI is, does not make it ethical or interesting to me.<p>Credit cards get the benefit of knowing where I shop, but at least I know when and how they are getting that information. Likewise, cellular service. It&#x27;s a price we pay for ubiquitous access to information. But I would cut them bot off as well if there were some way I could.<p>It&#x27;s parasitic and it&#x27;s zero benefit to me.')
