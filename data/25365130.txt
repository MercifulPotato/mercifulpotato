But even if md5 was pretty poor compared to modern hash functions, AFAIK there is still no working preimage on md5 (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, maybe there&#x27;s been recent development I&#x27;m not aware of), which means bitcoin would still be fine if it was launched in 1995 with md5 as its hash function! (assuming it had transitioned to a better scheme later to avoid collisions attacks).<p>In fact bitcoin is a pretty good counter-example to your point. It was launched too early, with a poor hash function[1], and yet is still a success.<p>[1] because bitcoin didn&#x27;t used a brute-force resistant hash function, Satoshi&#x27;s dream of “everyone is a miner” quickly disappeared a was replaced by a monopolistic cartel of professional miners.')
