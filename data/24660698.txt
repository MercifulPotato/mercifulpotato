We have WebAssembly threads which allows high-performance multi-threaded CPU code and WebGPU for general purpose GPU code.<p>Please correct me if I&#x27;m mistaken (not a ML expert): On top of these <i>existing</i> APIs, we can build efficient neural networks. Of course, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to use specialized hardware such as Google&#x27;s TPU or Graphcore&#x27;s IPU, but I doubt there&#x27;s a use-case for those in web.<p>Is there any non-GPU&#x2F;CPU based consumer hardware aimed at fast neural networks that I&#x27;m missing?<p>EDIT: Seems &quot;NPU&quot;s have been slowly arriving for the past 2 years to iOS&#x2F;Android-based devices... Maybe there&#x27;s a raison d&#x27;Ãªtre for the WebNN API after all.')
