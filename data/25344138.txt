My assumption is that testing PCR positive while remaining asymptomatic the entire time is by far the most common experience.<p>Of course, whether you go on to develop symptoms or not, its still highly pertinent information if asymptomatic spread is not a major driver of infection. As long as you self isolate upon symptom onset that should be enough. It does call into question whether isolating the apparently healthy is an evidence-based public health policy intervention though.')
