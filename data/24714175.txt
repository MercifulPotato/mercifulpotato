I also can&#x27;t get my webcam working, just a black screen and my webcam doesn&#x27;t activate. It activated the first time I joined but now seems to have chosen a different camera.<p>I think camera&#x2F;mic selection options need to be added for systems with multiple devices.<p>Really hope this gets refined!')
