Item(by='jaspax', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607927407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412847, text='Most anagrams of English words don&#x27;t themselves look like English words, so anagrams are not really a very fruitful way to find words that this algorithm will accept.<p>The real trick is to use common letter and vowel combinations, combined in ways which by happenstance don&#x27;t correspond to actual words. Off the top of my head, I just generated BRECK, LUND, and ALOUGHT, all of which the AI accepted.<p>EDIT: Another fruitful strategy is words with common Greek or Latinate suffixes, mashed together at random. I just got ANACHROSIS and PERILATION. This seems to be particularly fruitful for generating long words for people looking to make those 50 point plays.')
