It was only in March 2020 after covid19 was mainstream news it got edited in Wikipedia to show 2% (not sure if that&#x27;s changed by now), you can check the edit history.  But in short, in 1918, there were coffin shortages, compared to the toilet paper shortages with covid19.<p>covid19 and the Spanish flu are not even in the same weight class, not even a little bit, whereas yes, like it or not, covid19 is most likely in the same weight class as the flu depending on your thresholds with the flu at .1% and CV19 around .5 to 1% (likely closer to .5%).<p>yes, there are some people with long term effects of cv19.  that&#x27;s also true of the flu.  Many scientists think age related dementia is caused by repeated exposures to the flu&#x2F;cold.  flu&#x2F;cold have also caused heart and organ damage to many, it just doesn&#x27;t get reported on. &#x27;oh, this person died of organ failure, wonder why&#x27;.  It&#x27;s already a proven fact that the flu has caused the onset of type 1 diabetes for example.  There are also many reported cases of heart disease caused by the flu.  the flu sucks.<p>people loose their sh*t when you talk about this.  it doesn&#x27;t minimize the effect of covid19, it just highlights the flu is something serious.  for some reason, people are too immature to handle that. or maybe it goes against their worldview we should burn the world to the ground in order to stop covid19.')
