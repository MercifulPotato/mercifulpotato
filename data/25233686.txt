Parallel lines intersect either nowhere or everywhere.<p>The same is true of planes: they must be non-parallel to intersect in a line, otherwise it’s a nowhere-or-everywhere situation.<p>But how do we define this?<p>We look at the intersection of spans defining each object — which overlap in one of three ways, nowhere or everywhere (parallel), or at a one-dimension smaller object.<p>In this model, every pair of lines or planes meeting is a linear transform of a few basic situations:<p>Two lines are the same as the origin defined by x-axis and y-axis meeting.<p>Two planes are the same as the xy-plane meeting the xz-plane on the x-axis.<p>Two spaces are the same as the xyz-space and the xyt-space meeting in the xy-plane (at t,z=0).<p>In general, two n-spaces meeting in n+1 space intersect at a n-1 space, or are “parallel”.<p>An intuition is that since each object is missing one dimension from the parent space, either they’re missing the same dimension (parallel) or their intersection will be missing <i>two</i> dimensions.<p>A further intuition is that we have some space, and define each smaller space with a constraint, eg t=0. Then the intersection of subspaces has three cases:<p>1. The have the same constraint.<p>2. They have incompatible constraints, eg t=0 and t=1.<p>3. The intersection satisfies both constraints.<p>The first two are cases of “parallel”.')
