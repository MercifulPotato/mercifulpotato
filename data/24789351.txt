When you try it with room temperatures, switching energy will go up by 2 orders of magnitude (due to higher thermal noise) and this makes the JJ computer efficiency only somewhat better than CMOS. I agree this would still be interesting as refrigeration can be much simpler then and researching JJ-based computers would be easier.<p>But if we talk about best power&#x2F;watt, the 4.2K systems or 77K systems are likely to be better than room temp superconducting computers.')
