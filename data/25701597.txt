Here&#x27;s a hint, 1967 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 365.<p>You literally didn&#x27;t contradict anything I said linguistically or culturally (i.e. that China is _not_ some singular linguistical&#x2F;cultural area), which was my point. So no I _do_ have a point and you yourself agreed with it.<p>You made another point that the fact that China was unified more recently as an empire than Rome means they are somehow more legitimate. If that&#x27;s your point, okay I understand your thinking. I don&#x27;t agree with it (by that reasoning the British have a claim on a lot of the world&#x27;s territory), but okay then that is your thinking.')
