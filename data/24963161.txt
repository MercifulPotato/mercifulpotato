For me, I no longer want to work on what others want me to work on. I want to use my skills to do things that interest me and provides something back to society. Find something that engages you and checks all of your boxes.<p>I&#x27;ve seen most people fall into one of two categories:\n1. Live to work\n2. Work to live<p>A lot of my friends who are in the &quot;work to live&quot; category find joy in their hobbies. I fall along the first, so without hobbies, I put everything into work.
