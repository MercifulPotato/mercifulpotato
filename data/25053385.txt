Every shot fired in anger is a political act. Not the politics of the person firing it, but those directing the fire.<p>It is possible to try to be non-partisan, but an apolitical military is an oxymoron.<p>The US military is the guarantor of a host of political lines across the world; supporting South Korea or Taiwan or Israel or Germany or Bosnia is a political act.<p>You can&#x27;t sign up and then disclaim responsibility for the political results of following orders &quot;apolitically&quot;.
