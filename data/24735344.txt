Deciding that a new table is a worthwhile use of resources (vs reuse, for example)<p>2. Deciding who to sell it to (if it&#x27;s not for your own use)<p>3. Deciding what to make it out of (resource cost, ethical implications of the supply chain, concern about wood glue toxicity, ...)<p>And so on, and so forth. You might not consciously think about these as political, but.. that&#x27;s also a political opinion.<p>&gt; then &quot;it&#x27;s political&quot; has no useful meaning.<p>Exactly.')
