We can sidestep the 1A issue altogether since these companies would do anything to avoid being held responsible for the libelous, harassing, defamatory, threatening and sometimes terroristic content that their users post every day. That is nothing short of a gift given by the government, and it can be modified or restricted.<p>Moderation doesn&#x27;t scale, so I think this is a case of either do what 230 requires or cease existing as a going concern - either of these would be good outcomes, so this is a powerful lever.<p>Some ideas in no particular order; a platform owner is only shielded from liability inasmuch as they (choose as many as applicable):<p>1. Provide a forthright accounting of any negative actions taken against an account (no shadowbans, no silent editing or hiding of content from discovery) at the time the action is taken with a forthright explanation of how the conduct broke the stated rules.<p>2. Provide an appeals process for bans&#x2F;negative actions run by a neutral third party, with any ambiguity resolved in favor of the appellant.<p>3. Do not make or enforce ex-post-facto rule changes<p>4. Demonstrate no pattern of unfair or unequal application of the stated rules<p>5. If a ban is issued, a &quot;wind-down&quot; period must be granted to allow the banned user time to move what they can of their social network somewhere else.<p>6. Upon request, your own account&#x27;s data must be provided in full.<p>OR<p>7. Remain completely hands-off from a content removal standpoint. Content is removed if it is either literally illegal or breaks the service and under no other circumstance.<p>This last one would still allow for spam filtering and content categorization, which would allow the user experience to change little from today, and puts the most control in the hands of individual users.')
