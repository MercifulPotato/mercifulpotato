At mismatched resolutions or fractional scaling (and mismatched resolutions are effectively fractional scaling) macOS renders the entire display to a virtual canvas first. This effectively requires the dGPU.<p>Your best bet is to run external displays at the MBPs resolutions and because that is not possible&#x2F;ideal you are left with choices of running at 1080p&#x2F;4k&#x2F;5k. macOS no longer renders crisp on 1080p so 3840x2160 is the last remaining widely available and affordable choice while 5K is still very expensive.')
