Item(by='edjrage', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605388022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095054, text='&gt; any such scheme nowadays would be a lucrative target (to say the least) for bots and mechanical Turks<p>But that&#x27;s assuming the service would use your upvotes to change results for other users, right? Would there be any harm in limiting this personalization to the user that made it?<p>Now what I think would be really cool would be the ability to share your “recipes” with others, in a completely transparent way, kinda like uBlock filter lists. Google&#x27;s custom search is almost that, but still too black-and-white (and, of course, still comes with all the caveats of being Google).<p>Outright blocking entire sites or terms is too much. I want a search engine where I can calibrate results in a much more granular way. For instance, if I&#x27;m searching for something programming-related (which I could explicitly tell the engine vs. letting it infer for me), I&#x27;d like it to do things like not ignore special characters, and official reference documentation to appear first, then maybe Stack Overflow, etc. and leave content farms at the bottom, grouped in a compact space (but not necessarily make them disappear as some of them may actually be useful). Stuff like that.')
