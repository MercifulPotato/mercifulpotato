So, a 32-bit kernel, typically forked from 2.6 or 3.x and with unsigned 32-bit time_t, is a viable alternative for rescuing legacy embedded uses.<p>Probably by 2106 the machines will be responsible for coding, and it will then be their problem; or, civilization might collapse, so any people remaining will have bigger worries. Or (best case) both.')
