Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606692775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248639, text='This is a good response for people who believe &quot;[PGP has an extensible record format] because a long term standard must be extensible&quot;. I think you would have trouble finding cryptography engineers who think this is a strong statement; the last 20-odd years of practical cryptography research have instead made a very strong case that the most &quot;extensibility&quot; you want in a cryptosystem is a version number.<p>I think the rest follows from there. It&#x27;s easy to mount of a defense of PGP if you just ignore cryptography engineering and focus on how important it is for tools to follow the same proven Unix-flavored design as Awk. Which, of course, is what PGP is: the Awk of cryptography.')
