This was certainly the <i>intention</i> but it&#x27;s very plain that the market of public discourse doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as scientific peer review, which is itself somewhat flawed.<p>It&#x27;s an old truism that &#x27;a lie can get halfway round the world before the truth has got its shoes on.&#x27; It has also been rigorously documented: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;359&#x2F;6380&#x2F;1146" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;359&#x2F;6380&#x2F;1146</a> For that matter, phrases like &#x27;the big lie&#x27; reflect a wide social awareness that lying has historically been an effective political strategy.<p>Besides the fact that the marketplace of ideas demonstrably doesn&#x27;t privilege truth in the short term, why would you expect it to? A marketplace is easily dominated by whoever can invest heavily in promotional tools. Furthermore, many people in the market demand entertainment or validation rather than truth, so there&#x27;s abundant money to be made out of selling pleasant-sounding bullshit.')
