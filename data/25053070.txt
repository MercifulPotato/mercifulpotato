Times change.<p>Nobody cares about weed anymore for the most part.<p>Crack is mostly a non issue as that epidemic has already ran its course.<p>Perceptions of coke are relegated to jokes about white collar professionals and crazy parties.<p>Heroin and meth are the two drugs people really look down on these days and they&#x27;re stereotypical white people drugs.<p>Attempts to cast everyone who wants some sort of stricter drug enforcement as closet racists is naive at best.
