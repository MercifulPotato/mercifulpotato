I don&#x27;t see the connection you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely confused on what your position is. Why do you have an association with freedom and the alt-right? Implicit in that position is that the Democratic left is somehow anti-rights. How can you simultaneously believe that:<p>1) the alt right champions rights &#x2F; freedoms.  \n2) this makes the alt right fascist &#x2F; authoritarian.  \n3) your party &#x2F; alignment &#x2F; position opposes the alt right, and therefore opposes the freedoms they advocate for.  \n4) by opposing freedom and human rights, your party is anti fascist.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely confused. And why the connection with free speech in particular? The alt right also stages protests alot, do you think protesting is bad?')
