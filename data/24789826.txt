They&#x27;re quite the fringe topic. Misinformation, yes, but classifying misinformation (in its not-so-obvious forms) is a hard problem. So while I agree there needs to be a line, I also think that in enforcing a ban on misinformation we will necessarily end up limiting debate. The line should stay at something like inciting violence.')
