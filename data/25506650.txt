They lead with the DiAngelo&#x2F;Kendi line &quot;you&#x27;re racist and any defense is evidence you&#x27;re racist&quot;.<p>And people are suprised about &quot;performativeness&quot;?<p>Nevermind the white liberals with the same affect of fundamentalist Christians going to penance. It&#x27;s all fake.<p>The vocabulary of “allies” is insufferable too.<p>What is this the Yalta Conference?')
