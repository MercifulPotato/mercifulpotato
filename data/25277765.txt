I recently started a newsletter that sends out well-researched startup ideas that people should pursue.<p>For context, I work in the startup industry and am constantly hearing about the latest “great ideas” - whether from coworkers or friends. What I end up doing is researching those ideas and finding out which ones could have legs and which ones don’t look promising.<p>I don’t have the time or passion to pursue even a fraction of the ideas I hear about, so rather than keep all the info to myself, I figured I’d share it in a weekly newsletter!<p>www.brainstorms.io<p>Let me know what you think.')
