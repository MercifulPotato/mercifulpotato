If I&#x27;m in a channel, it&#x27;s hard to know how to get back out or to the previous menus without hitting the back button.<p>* I tried to upload a gif and it just hung without responding.  Not sure if the gif ever went through but I eventually got bored of waiting.  If it was working - maybe a progress bar on uploading?<p>* Obviously spam is already a problem.  The popular communities list, and the new communities list, are just people mashing their keyboards to create test communities.<p>* Channel title length needs to be limited. (See the channels with huge names that are ruining the &quot;New Channels&quot; page)<p>* How does &quot;No censorship&quot; work in terms of malicious content, spam, pornography, etc?  If it works like it sounds, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d like to browse it. Do I really want to see gifs of animals being tortured, shocksite images, etc.  People self-promoting and trying to sell things - if people used it wouldn&#x27;t this be a huge part of the content?<p>* How would you fall on the subreddits that reddit banned - e.g. jailbail, fatpeoplehate, racist groups?  Communities that are not quite illegal, but clearly toxic.  Doesn&#x27;t it seem like by enabling such people to get together and coordinate you are helping to promote toxic behavior?<p>* The website became non-responsive for me at least once and I had to kill the tab.  Looks like it was waiting on firebasestorage googleapis.  A better failure mode let me know something had gone wrong, or load as much as possible, without just crashing the tab.')
