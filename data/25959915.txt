RH asserted their right under their TOS to margin call without notice. This might be legal, but it looks like mining the retail investors for gold. I think it should NEVER happen. A firm like RH should instead gather its fortitude and fund itself to ride such events out, and ALWAYS give accounts five days to respond to a margin call. To do otherwise is to &quot;undermine market confidence&quot; in the words of the SEC.')
