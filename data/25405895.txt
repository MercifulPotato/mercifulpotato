Also, Compiled Linux kernel can weigh 6.7MB or even less.<p>What i am thinking is that we can compile linux kernel , drivers needed for the particular device, compile runtime and application and deploy on bare machine. It will be monolithic approach too.<p>Further i think that unikernel applications are more helpful if application take features of underlying kernel and vice versa . I also think that unikernel approach is not much helpful if that unikernel acts like shim layer to run other applications. Briefly,i am saying that unikernel applications must be built from bottom unikernel to application all integrated.<p>So,how is this unikernel better than Linux based monolithic deployment that i mentioned above? what about security updates in this unikernel ?')
