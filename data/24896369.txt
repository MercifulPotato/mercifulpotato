Our most favored model of the universes physics, General Relativity makes certain predictions that mostly match up with reality up until you get to galaxy scales at which point they start to diverge. In order for our measurements to work under General Relativity our galaxies need to be more massive than they appear to be based on all the stuff we can actually see in them. This needed excess mass is called dark matter, but even with dark matter the universe appears to be expanding faster than it should. The theory proposed in the paper is that the universe as whole isn&#x27;t actually expanding faster, but due to a quirk of where we are in the universe it only looks like it is when we look at nearby galaxies. Unfortunately for that to be true we would need to be in a void in the structure of the universe which General Relativity predicts shouldn&#x27;t be possible.<p>An alternative theory of universal physics exists called MOND. MOND is similar to General Relativity, but rather than solving the problem at the galaxy scale through theoretical dark matter, it instead just assumes that gravity works differently once you reach a certain cutoff point. This aligns with observations of actual galaxies (not entirely unsurprisingly because the cutoff point was chosen in order to align with those observations) without needing dark matter to exist. From the perspective of the paper there&#x27;s another nice property of MOND which is that simulations based on it allow for the kind of void to form that the paper predicts would be necessary to explain the locally observed expansion.<p>Basically, General Relativity can&#x27;t explain how fast galaxies spin without Dark Matter, nor how fast the universe appears to be expanding. MOND combined with our galaxy being in the middle of a big void can explain both. Both theories, General Relativity and MOND require a certain amount of hand waving in order to align with reality. MOND requires a bit less but is highly suspect because it&#x27;s solution is basically &quot;gravity just acts different sometimes&quot; which is suspiciously close to &quot;it&#x27;s that way because it is&quot;.<p>As for the actual math involved in all of this, beats me, we&#x27;ll need to wait for someone who&#x27;s actually in this field to look it over and explain what if anything is wrong with it all.')
