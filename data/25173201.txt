But most of the crust is not diamond and beryl, so this study is looking at the average structure of much larger conglomerates of stone and ice and mud -- not as much long-range symmetry there!<p>Quoting the paper to give an idea of the formation being modeled:<p>These patterns have been reproduced in experiments of mud and corn-starch cracks, model 2D fragmentation systems, where the following have been observed: Fast drying produces strong tension that drives the formation of primary (global) cracks that criss-cross the sample and make “X” junctions; slow drying allows the formation of secondary cracks that terminate at “T” junctions; and “T” junctions rearrange into “Y” junctions to either maximize energy release as cracks penetrate the bulk or during reopening–healing cycles from wetting&#x2F;drying')
