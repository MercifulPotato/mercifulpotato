Are there multiple stop kinds that are somewhat difficult to distinguish against and keep track of? How you handle a child dying while stopped, or is this not possible? I don&#x27;t think NetBSD has the same &quot;tasks&quot; model that Linux does, how do you distinguish between requests targeting threads and requests targeting the whole process? How do the rest of the OS APIs interact with a ptrace stopped process?')
