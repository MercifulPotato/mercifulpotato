They had all famous authors and then one or two really shitty books from some unknown never-published writer. This self-promotion technique seems to work somewhat, because one Swede eventually published and thanks to native English editors the book was not so bad anymore.<p>This comment sounds like an insinuation that someone or I have deceptively added my own website to this list. I apologize if that is not the case. However, let me clarify the criteria I used to select the websites. I initially took the list of websites already available from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1mb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1mb.club&#x2F;</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;512kb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;512kb.club&#x2F;</a>, and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;250kb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;250kb.club&#x2F;</a>, and then fed them to a script to select the websites that consume less than 10 KB compressed transfer size and that have received at least 100 upvotes on Hacker News.<p>Later I relaxed the rules to include upvotes on Reddit and Lobsters in the eligibility criteria. There is no self-promotion going on here. Doing so and especially insinuating that others are doing so would be taking this tiny project too seriously. Indeed there are many who rightfully argue that keeping a website under N KB (for arbitrarily chosen N) is not an interesting goal by itself. This is just a hobby project made for fun over a weekend because <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176794" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176794</a>.<p>Disclosure: My own website is on this list.')
