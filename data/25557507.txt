They had all famous authors and then one or two really shitty books from some unknown never-published writer. This self-promotion technique seems to work somewhat, because one Swede eventually published and thanks to native English editors the book was not so bad anymore.<p>This comment sounds like an insinuation that someone or I have deceptively added my own website to this list, so let me clarify the criteria I used to add the websites. What I did initially was take the list of websites already available from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1mb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1mb.club&#x2F;</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;512kb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;512kb.club&#x2F;</a>, and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;250kb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;250kb.club&#x2F;</a>, fed them to a script to select the websites that consume less than 10 KB compressed transfer size and that have received at least 100 upvotes on Hacker News, and added them to this list. Later I relaxed the rules a little bit to include upvotes on Reddit and Lobsters as well.<p>There is no self-promotion going on here. It is merely a tiny hobby project made for fun because someone asked for it.[1]<p>Disclosure: My own website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;susam.in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;susam.in&#x2F;</a> is on this list.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176794" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176794</a>')
