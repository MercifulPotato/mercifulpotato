I just tested and you can export this FUSE filesystem through SFTP, and VLC on Android can open remote folders through SFTP... so you can have your entire library compressed on-the-fly on both Android and iOS, and there is no lag between input and playback. If you want to keep a song on your phone for offline use, like the OP link usecase, just copy the file locally: it works today, without installing anything or running stuff on your computer.<p>Filesystems all the way down and it works transparently (even though to be even cleaner SFTP should be mountable and available as a standard folder in Android). Somewhere in there Plan9 says &quot;I told you so&quot;.<p>(Note if you&#x27;re doing that: there is an issue with entering credentials on Android with SFTP, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.videolan.org&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;vlc-android&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1508" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.videolan.org&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;vlc-android&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1508</a>)')
