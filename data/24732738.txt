In the past, I was toying with the idea of building Julia IDE. In the end, I decided to build something else.<p>So the pain point is still there. Looking at this thread, it could be a good idea to build Julia IDE. Then you can apply for funding in the next YC batch. 6 months should be enough to build an MVP.<p>Bonus point if you could build Julia IDE with Rust. In Show HN, surely you would get a lot of karma points. But we need to be realistic. Rust does not have a solid GUI library. If I chose to build Julia IDE, I would use either C++ with Qt or C++ with wxWidgets.')
