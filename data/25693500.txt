These days, we are all a lot more normie. Sure, some people still go to Burning Man, but when was the last true co-op member you knew in a tech company? It seems so less frequent these days. We should be the ones writing stuff like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jofreeman.com&#x2F;joreen&#x2F;tyranny.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jofreeman.com&#x2F;joreen&#x2F;tyranny.htm</a><p>In the US, a corporation, after four years of deliberation, finally got the &quot;courage&quot; (at least that&#x27;s how I imagine it going internal to Twitter), to ban the account of the government&#x27;s prime executive. This would never happen in a place like China, because President Xi holds ultimate power.<p>But why does anybody even <i>care</i> if Twitter bans President Trump? It&#x27;s because we have all given Twitter power over us in our consumption of information.<p>We need a hell of a lot more humanities in the tech world to help us understand all this more, a ton more study of power relations, more study of actual history of how power flows. More history of, say, the reconstruction after the US Civil War  and before the Civil Rights Movement, of how small towns exerted power over Black residents both through soft economic power and through political power, and how those two interplayed with each other.<p>There&#x27;s so much to learn from history as we try to navigate power on social networks. But the dynamic you saw on LinkedIn has played out every week of every year in every city in the US. It&#x27;s not <i>unique</i> to social media in any way, it&#x27;s the same brain structures and personal relationships going on, just on slightly different scales. And we need to understand those if we are to make good technology, and good policy to program society.')
