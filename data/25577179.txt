The cost and the software aren&#x27;t there yet, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time.<p>Hitting the nail on the head here. I&#x27;ve been following Boston Dynamics for the past 10 years and it&#x27;s just amazing the progress they&#x27;ve made and it&#x27;s going to get augmented massively with better battery technology and ML&#x2F;AI. No doubt in my mind these types of robots will be everywhere in 20 years as you say.')
