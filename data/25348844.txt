Thanks for pushing on me to do my research better, haha.<p>I looked into the details to clarify:<p>The USPS has to have the cash on hand to pay earned benefits 50 years out. That is unique to the postal service.<p>The same act also mandated that price hikes at the USPS never move faster than inflation. Very few businesses would want to operate in an environment where you&#x27;re biggest liability is future healthcare costs of employees, and your revenue is tied to inflation adjusted 2006 prices....<p>The Pension Protection act does make pension funding more regulated, but the requirements are nowhere near requiring cash on hand to fund 50 years of obligations. Other pensions are also allowed to have assets that aren&#x27;t cash, meaning they can grow.<p>The larger point I was making, which I think is supported either way, is that the USPS is actually a viable business. The consistent profit loss is based on legislative mandates that their competitors, or anyone else, don&#x27;t have to abide by.')
