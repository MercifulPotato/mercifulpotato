This wouldn’t be murder or forced sterilization or a coup d’etat. But it could be a legal (or even legally murky) military action, and certainly the arrest of someone like President Trump, who is subject to many good-faith allegations of serious violent crimes, and should be arrested to face trial for them.<p>It is worth noting that “state-sanctioned” violence does not always mean legally-sanctioned violence, since state actions can easily be criminal, or at least lawless.<p>- The Capitol Hill mob was illegal violence, albeit state-sanctioned (by endorsement of the president)<p>- Arresting the president (either under Congressional authority or the 25th amendment) would be <i>legal</i> state-sanctioned violence<p>- Although nominal Chinese law is somewhat authoritarian with regard to ethnic minorities and Muslims, the reason the Xi regime is so desperate to cover up and propagandize the concentration camps is that they are illegal under Chinese and international law')
