It&#x27;s not nearly as excruciating as most of the other posts but it has rendered me unable to work at all. Am not able to sit for more than an hour before the pain is too much. Lying down is only slightly better. It&#x27;s been quite some time since I have been able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep without having to wake up with the pain buliding up slowly.<p>More than the pain, it&#x27;s the fact that I&#x27;m prevented from being able to work on my computer that frustrates me so much. After a point the boredom becomes worse than the pain.<p>While am not seeking medical advice from someone on the internet, I&#x27;d love to know what you did to get &quot;healthy again&quot;.')
