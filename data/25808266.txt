People from right wing nationalists, libertarians, center leftists all with diverse opinions were all simply called neoliberal. Neoliberalism has never been an actual movement or philosophy or anything coherent but rather is everything the far left doesn&#x27;t like since the late 70s.<p>What both the left and the right complain about in their &#x27;anti-globalist&#x27; is &#x27;we are unhappy with the situation here&#x27; and we blame the rest of the globe. The left believes that all changes to the economy they don&#x27;t like could just not effect them if you didn&#x27;t have free trade. And the right, by now is basically the party of the white working class has the same issue.<p>This is also why the left is now the pro globalism party, they are now the party of the urban people rather then the (white) working class and cities have much fewer of the problems from change in industrial structure.')
