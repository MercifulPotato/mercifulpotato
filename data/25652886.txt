It will not take more than an a day or two - it’s simpler than python.<p>Download SWI prolog, and get an editor that allows interactive programming with it. Emacs is of course the best for any obscure hacker language, but there may be plug-ins for other editors.<p>Predicates are like functions but instead of returning you simply leave some parameter as a variable, and the “return value” is prolog finding what the value of that parameter can be.<p>Making web apps with the built in libraries and library(persistence) is a lot of fun - you can make a real webapp with a relational database with zero dependencies but prolog. Programs are small. Highly recommend for anyone who loves programming.<p>Only thing I wish for is no effects but instead it being pure like Elm, and a type system rather than runtime type errors.')
