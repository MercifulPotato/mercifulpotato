Item(by='potiuper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611558566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25899967, text='&quot;Each day, 2 million gallons of industrial wastewater are piped from Intel plants in Chandler, Arizona, to a facility a mile away where it’s treated, then returned to an underground aquifer. Intel, the city’s largest employer, recycles about 60 percent of its water&quot; So, 40% is not recycled, which seems high? given that &quot;the leftover effluent[s] or concentrated dissolved salts that result from making chips&quot; are claimed to be filtered with reverse osmosis before being returned to the aquifer. It is also disappointing that it seems to be more cost effective to have the RO instead of an evaporation + optional vapor collection setup to get 100% recycled or at least to collect the salt waste given the hot dry ambient desert location would seem like the most cost effective place to do so.')
