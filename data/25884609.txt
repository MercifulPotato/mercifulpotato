I often find myself in situations where I can solve a problem in &lt;1 min if I can ask someone a question.  I also know I can solve it without their help, but it will take me many tens of minutes (as I reverse-engineer their code or something like that).  In a situation like that it makes sense for me to inquire if they can answer my question now, but an asynchronous inquiry will probably be a waste of their time because by the time they get around to answering it I will have figured it out on my own already.')
