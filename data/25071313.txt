I’m white so I HAVE to admit to my racism.<p>No, but you should admit your privilege, which is a result of collective racism and sexism. This doesn&#x27;t mean you yourself are racist or sexist. It does mean you benefited from those things. This doesn&#x27;t mean it is your fault. It does mean you should at least try to empathize with people who are angry about it.<p>The fact of the matter is this: regardless of what kind of life you have lived as a white man, things would have been <i>worse</i> if you had lived that life as a minority and&#x2F;or a woman.<p>&gt;&gt; Why need to strive to a point where none that maters. We treat each other with respect.<p>There can be no respect without reconciliation. You cannot simply pretend that white people, white men in particular, didn&#x27;t achieve their economic and social advantages and statuses (which include highly paid tech jobs!) due to immense collective privilege. Pointing this out does not make one a bigot. Complaining about it does not mean the complainer is full of hatred.<p>You should not apologize for being a man or a white person, but you should at least try to empathize with people who did not manage to get where you are simply because of their race or gender.')
