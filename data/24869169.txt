I upvoted the submission for the interesting HN comments that are likely to appear based on it but also so, so, soooo didn&#x27;t want to upvote a Krebs article and give him the Ads revenue from the page views.<p>In that case, you&#x27;ll be glad to know that I use ad&#x2F;tracking blockers, so even when I read the article, he won&#x27;t get any ad revenue from me.<p>And I imagine that many folks around here do the same.<p>In my case, it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t because I have a problem with Brian Krebs, rather it&#x27;s because I despise advertising and go to great lengths (sometimes at my own expense) to avoid it.')
