It would make little sense to argue that a local water company should be broken up into several competing companies, each with its own separate set of pipes and water supplies. Installing four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water company, so that each household could choose its own water provider, would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to the idea of having many competing companies for delivering electricity to homes, each with its own set of wires. Before the advent of wireless phones, the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone companies, each with its own set of phone wires running through the neighborhood.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentextbc.ca&#x2F;principlesofeconomics&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;11-3-regulating-natural-monopolies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentextbc.ca&#x2F;principlesofeconomics&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;11-3-reg...</a><p>This same is harder to say for AWS.
