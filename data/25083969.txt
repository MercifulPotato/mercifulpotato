The question is, whether the way Apple implemented this is the right way. Except for launching a program the very first time on a computer, the security check shouldn&#x27;t block program execution. The check should run asynchronously. Especially, as it seems to be fine to start any program, when your computer is off the network. \nAlso, the system could be reacting better detecting that the Apple server is unresponsive. If a certain number of requests didn&#x27;t answer in a timeout of a few seconds, it should not lock up but treat the server as not reachable.')
