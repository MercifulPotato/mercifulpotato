I don&#x27;t think so. The most downloaded app figures by App Annie shows exactly what it says, which app was downloaded the most during that period. So as long as WhatsApp stays in the phone and if it receives a single message from hundreds of contacts a user has; WhatsApp didn&#x27;t loose that user.<p>So the correct title IMO is &#x27;Signal, Telegram gained millions of users&#x27;.')
