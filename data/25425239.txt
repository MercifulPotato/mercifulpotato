Doubly so because I&#x27;m white.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone should pay any more than they benefitted from slavery.<p>The average person has no ancestors who owned slaves, and the only benefits they got were things like cheaper goods and services.  Added up over a lifetime, it&#x27;s probably not a lot.<p>But some people come from ancestors who made a LOT of money off slavery, and the benefits of that have been passed down to them one way or another.<p>So I think different people should be in different brackets based off how much they benefitted from slavery, and those brackets should be proportion of wealth tax over 20-30 years.  Not so much to bankrupt anyone, but enough to pay the off the debt.<p>Also, I think it should be treated as the alpha version of UBI.  Basically, the ancestors of slaves should be the first to get on the list for UBI because they&#x27;re kind of opposites of each-other.')
