It was February 4.<p>This was in Thailand, which was the first country outside of China to have a confirmed case (on 13 Jan). By and large people here were taking it quite seriously at the time (and continue to do so); nobody waited for the government or health authorities to tell them to wear masks, they just did it. It was clear to me back then it was going to spread to the west pretty quickly and be a massive problem if countries didn&#x27;t lock down and lock down fast.<p>According to the Johns Hopkins dashboard, Thailand has had 3,691 cases and 59 deaths out of a population of ~70 million. At one point we reached 100 days with zero local transmission. Watching how it&#x27;s been handled in the US just completely blows my mind.')
