That relying on three vendors increases your risk of being impacted by one? That&#x27;s just statistics. You can disagree with it, but that doesn&#x27;t make it incorrect.<p>Or do you disagree that planning for a total failure of one and running redundant workloads on other vendors increases your costs 99.99999% of the time? Because that&#x27;s a fairly standard SLA from each of the major vendors. Let&#x27;s even reduce it to EC2&#x27;s SLA, 99.99%. So 99.99% of the time you&#x27;re paying 3x as much as you need to be paying just to maintain your services an extra four hours <i>per year</i>. Again, you can disagree with that but that doesn&#x27;t make it incorrect.<p>Some businesses might need that extra four hours, the cost of the extra services might be cheaper than the cost of four hours of downtime <i>per year</i>. But you&#x27;re not going to find many businesses like that. Either you&#x27;re running completely redundant workloads, paying 3x as much for an extra 4 hours per year, or you&#x27;re going to be taken offline when any one of the three go down independently of each other.<p>Single providers go down, yes. And three providers go down three times as often as one. Either you&#x27;re massively overspending or you&#x27;re tripling your risk of downtime. If multi-cloud worked, you&#x27;d be hearing people talking about it and their success stories would fill the front page of Hacker News. They don&#x27;t, because it doesn&#x27;t.')
