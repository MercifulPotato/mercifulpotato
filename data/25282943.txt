It seems like they&#x27;ve decided to ignore anything later than the 1700&#x27;s technology.  Are there other groups with different technology cut-off dates?  If not, any theories as to why not?  Do you need a religious component to keep you cohesive over the generations?  I think I might be OK with regressing to a 1980&#x27;s level of technology.  I wonder how large of a group of people would you need to be mostly self-sufficient at various technology levels.  It seems like you might need a lot of people, if you wanted to have even very old-school integrated circuits.  Probably quite a bit fewer if you only had discrete transistors. It seems like sustaining at a previous level should be easier than inventing it in the first place, since the knowledge is already available.  And you could siphon off  a bit from the more advanced society (e.g. you can potentially use scrap materials left over from the advanced society, instead of maintaining your own mining technology, etc.).  And you could still have some (lopsided) trade between the societies (anyone want a bespoke Walkman produced by a skilled 1980&#x27;s artisan?).  Any thoughts on the estimates below?<p><pre><code>  - 1700&#x27;s, 100&#x27;s of people in your community (crude metalworking)\n  - 1800&#x27;s, 1000&#x27;s of people in your community (machines needing more metalworking and machining skills)\n  - 1900-1940, 100,000 people (radio)\n  - 1940-1980, 1,000,000 people (TV, automobiles)\n  - 1980-2000, 10,000,000 people (personal computer, mass air travel)</code></pre>')
