They’re actually not competitors (Compound integrates with Carta). The difference? Compound sells to shareholders (Carta sells to companies). Compound provides holistic financial management services (in helping me manage my entire financial stack), including startup equity. The biggest benefit is they personalize everything to my situation (it’s a holistic experience). Would recommend trying it out!')
