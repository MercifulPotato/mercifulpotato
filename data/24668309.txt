I mean short life store objects, populated by props, that are recreated every mount.  Might as well just use React state and save the overhead. You might say, because I have several components using the same business logic and fields and such, I can inject the same store into multiple components. I would say that logic can go in functions which take React state as their argument. You don&#x27;t need a global state management tool to separate business logic from the view.')
