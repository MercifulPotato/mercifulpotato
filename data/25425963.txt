Item(by='zepto', descendants=None, kids=[25431228], score=None, time=1607996014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25423907, text='&gt; So: any research on race is fine, but using the words &#x27;whiteness&#x27;, &#x27;racialized&#x27; <i>or</i> now &#x27;intersectionality&#x27; (this word appears newly to me) makes it bogus...<p>Again, a puzzling interpretation.<p>A couple of points, it’s fairly obvious that PG doesn’t expect people to go through every single search result past the first few.<p>Search results with the <i>conjunction</i> of those words are listed first.  You have mistakenly used the word ‘or’, but search engines place ‘and’ results first.<p>PG doesn’t use the term ‘white’ anywhere.  That has been introduced by you.  He uses the term ‘whiteness’.<p>I am a little surprised you conflate these two terms, since in both the academic discourse, and in activism about race, these words do not mean the same thing.<p>&gt; How do you talk in any useful way about race relations without ever using those words?<p>It’s not clear what this question has to do with what PG wrote, and the rest of your post seems to hinge on its relevance.<p>PG didn’t say anything about people <i>not using words</i>.  He posted a link to a search he expected would prioritize examples of the kind of research he thinks is bogus.<p>Generally when we do a Google search, we assume that the first few results will be the most relevant, not that <i>every</i> result is equally relevant.<p>See my earlier point - search prioritizes results that contain <i>as many</i> of these terms as possible.<p>To summarize: Your comment seems to be based on two misunderstandings. One about how Google search works, and the other about how the meaning of the word ‘whiteness’ differs from the word ‘white’ in contemporary discourse on race.<p>Also, I note that you conflate search results with <i>research</i>.  These aren’t the same thing.')
