On the other hand, run-of-the-mill elected officials don&#x27;t have as much money so they are not trustworthy since they don&#x27;t have much to lose if things go bad.<p>Why would Mark Zuckerberg want to harm a country that his business depends on? Why would someone destroy their own house? It makes no sense. On the other hand, politicians have plenty of incentives to harm the country; since they can just sell out to foreign powers in order to gain favors and make a quick buck after they leave office.<p>Politicians cannot be trusted because they have nothing to lose from making things worse. Corporations on the other hand can be trusted because they have a lot to lose if the country goes down the drain.<p>In times like these, it&#x27;s important that we all come together and support our corporations in order to protect our democracy.')
