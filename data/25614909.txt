How they go about it can change.  Facebook has always gone hard and fast.  They treat you more like a raw piece of meat.  They will run ab tests on you and treat you like a variable in a ongoing experiment.  Google has such reach that they can make minor changes and capture vast amounts of data.<p>Other companies are doing the same way but instead of using it to determine what to show  you they use it to determine what ads look like so you can buy their product.')
