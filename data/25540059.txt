While many of those predictions turn out to be comically wrong, I still find value in identifying some high level patterns in people&#x27;s thinking.<p>Can you think of any interesting new trends, or did you come across anyone else&#x27;s that are worth sharing here? To somewhat narrow the scope, I would suggest that we focus on the tech industry (although that&#x27;s very very broad these days).')
