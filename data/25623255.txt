Maybe I&#x27;ve missed it or you forgot to mention it. Your active and large user-base means you&#x27;re doing some things right and providing value. It&#x27;s also an extremely valuable resource for you to get feedback from. Figuring out product (and pricing) direction at scale is a lot less guesswork than when you only have a handful of users.')
