Unlike say, downloading a torrent, people have legal access to youtube ordinarily, and pay for it. If you pay for offline access to music, why can&#x27;t you use youtube-dl? Any infringement will only begin when your license to the content ends.<p>Additionally, the software just makes HTTP(s) requests and can work with any site. I actually have never used it to download anything on youtube.')
