Item(by='giantrobot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608517477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486191, text='&gt; When it comes to office applications, Linux is clearly better than its commercial alternatives. For a lack of experience, I cannot tell you if that holds for other software as well.<p>Well I am completely convinced. Linux office applications are <i>clearly</i> (<i></i>clearly<i></i>!) better than commercial suites. &#x2F;s<p>To the point of the article, despite the last point saying the practice of using old laptops is a hack, they spend most of the article brow beating anyone that doesn&#x27;t follow suit or agree with them.<p><i>Some</i> laptops are awesome and can last for many years. These are often (not always) laptops aimed at enterprise&#x2F;institutional buyers...like many ThinkPads. They are <i>designed</i> to be serviced and have readily available parts lists and service manuals. Internally they&#x27;re fairly prosaic which makes servicing more practical. Others are just generally well built and don&#x27;t have a lot of moving parts to even fail.<p>Everything else is just shit that can&#x27;t be easily serviced and is always falling apart. It&#x27;s expensive and frustrating to keep such laptops longer than a few years. If you can&#x27;t avoid buying one you&#x27;re better off properly disposing of them than fighting with them. If you <i>do</i> have a laptop with good&#x2F;serviceable hardware it&#x27;ll easily keep working well for years.<p>I think the point of <i>software</i> is the author&#x27;s strongest point. <i>If</i> Linux&#x2F;FOSS is a feasible platform for your work <i>and</i> you have a productive workflow you&#x27;re going to have a much easier time with Linux on an old machine versus Windows. Even the fastest moving rolling release Linux distros change far less than just Windows 10&#x27;s semi-annual releases. The requirements also aren&#x27;t going to change much if at all.')
