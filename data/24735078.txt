Item(by='deathanatos', descendants=None, kids=[24735202, 24735570], score=None, time=1602282472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24734690, text='That graph is not very well laid out; in order to see the effect it purports to show, you&#x27;d want to scale the SWE salary to all salaries to compare them; otherwise, you&#x27;re just looking at &quot;SWE is paid more than most occupations&quot; → &quot;SWE is still paid more than most occupations&quot;. Both clearly experienced growth, but did SWE experience <i>more</i> growth, or did it grow proportionally?<p>The SWE line in that graph grows by ~74%, and all other occupations by ~57%. So, the title seems probably correct, plus or minus the accuracy of my eyeball in reading those. But that&#x27;s not how to present that…<p>(And also, the sin of not putting the Y axis min at 0, to exaggerate the effect.)<p>As a SWE myself, looking at the potential cost of housing if I ever decide to start a family, I&#x27;d mostly say SWE&#x27;s wage growth hasn&#x27;t kept pace. All other occupations are just getting hosed even harder. (My opinion here is that it&#x27;s somewhat housing cost&#x2F;supply: too little supply is driving the cost up, and wage increases are likely to just push that further. What is needed there is increases in the supply, moreso than wages, <i>for housing</i> specifically. For wages, I do think the minimum wage is too low, and has not kept pace.
