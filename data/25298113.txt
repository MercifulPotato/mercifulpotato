Harm to a healthily competitive environment can result from a few big players existing rather than a single dominant one. It may not even require certain &quot;behavior&quot; as much as a large entity with lots of capital simply existing. There are also big barriers to entry in any business that is built on network effects - even there, we need a mechanism to enable competition.')
