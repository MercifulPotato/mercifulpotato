Debatable (I&#x27;d argue overdelivering on a SaaS product also helps bring in new customers). From a moral standpoint, I find it incredibly difficult to justify penny pinching and filling hours with malpractices and bureaucracy.<p>And for what it is worth: personal experience tells, a <i>lot</i> of customers are quite accepting of faulty software, as long as the damage can be reverted and minimized. Even those in finance. Wouldn&#x27;t be the first time I see people casually solve a bug that caused millions worth of damage.')
