It&#x27;s really slick. My Macbook Air was having trouble running all of the development tools I wanted use. Moving everything to the cloud - including Postgres, Redis, backend dev server, linting, and frontend Nuxt server - means my battery life has improved and I could even be developing on a $200 chromebook.<p>I know I&#x27;m missing out on the ability to develop code while offline - e.g., on an airplane. But, in my experience - modern code increasingly relies on webhooks and APIs for basic functions. So, I think most web app code can&#x27;t be expected to be run in an &quot;offline&quot; mode once it reaches sufficient maturity.')
