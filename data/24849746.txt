I really enjoyed alternating between playing the role of teacher vs learning from someone much better at the (insert programming language, database, business domain).<p>I think during that time I also had some of the most stimulating and deep conversations about software development. When pairing, pairs have a deep shared context that&#x27;s hard to replicate in other scenarios.<p>There are some drawbacks though, the main one being it&#x27;s extremely full on and emotionally tiring. I&#x27;d class myself as a high functioning introvert and after a day of pairing I needed some serious regenerative quiet time!<p>My advice to someone considering this suggestion would be to try some pairing now with friends or colleagues and get a feel for it and see if it works for your personality and working style.')
