The full PDF is available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samueljscott.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;19&#x2F;hubspot-fbi-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samueljscott.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;19&#x2F;hubspot-fbi-report&#x2F;</a><p>HubSpot has always stated that the company believes in transparency. But HubSpot has never directly and specifically addressed the serious, material allegations in Lyons&#x27; book and has never disclosed exactly what the mentioned executives — among others — may have done regarding his book.<p>So, I ask you:<p>Will HubSpot grant me, for my column for The Drum, a one-hour interview with you, Brian Halligan, and the chair of your board of directors? Completely recorded and on the record and with nothing off-limits.')
