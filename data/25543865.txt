And even then, that&#x27;s only an &quot;additive workflow&quot; if you insist on ignoring the system the author is describing.<p>Whether you know all the work to be done or not, there is a quantity of work to be done after which there will be no more work to do. Some of that work might be learning what all the work is. Some of the work might be defining how to do some of the other work. Other work is just picking work off of the pile and doing it. All of these are subtracting from the total quantity of work that will have been done by completing the project.<p>Not knowing the quantity or boundaries does not change this nature.')
