And it will stay that way because, as you know, HN is a corporation. Not a public forum.<p>Maintaining these rules allow dang@co to maintain the position of control over what happen in HN. The corollary is that changing them will dilute their control. They found a local maximum of discourse level and they keep it that way.<p>The justification that the discourse on HN is maintained at a high level by not talking about the rules is at least condescending to the participants.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter to them if they lose you on these grounds since talking about the rules appears only on extremes which are shallow in a normal distribution. They will lose the few participants that care enough about that while maintaining those in the middle. (Of course, cutting of the extremes will grow newer ones in the empty space but I digress...).<p>What happens with time is that people adjust their discourse to the middle ground making it void of any new or interesting information. Thus, HN becomes an echo chamber of mainstream ideas and people will leave when they got bored enough of the same thing. We&#x27;re already there and @dang is more vocal now because he knows it.')
