What topic doesn&#x27;t have a destination website? I would figure out a niche that needs search and is an industry that is highly fragmented and likely to stay that way. Unfortunately, i am not sure if there are any :), at this point it might make more sense to build a destination site to claim that niche. I.e. you go to amazon for books&#x2F;shopping, you go to facebook groups or reddit for info from people, travel stays at booking&#x2F;airbnb... etc etc. what niche really needs external search? &#x2F;phone ramble')
