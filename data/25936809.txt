You can&#x27;t fly without one. You can&#x27;t drive without one. You can&#x27;t go to a bar without one. You can&#x27;t book a hotel in most cases without one. It just seems like people are arguing that edge cases exist and therefore we cant require ID. There is no conspiracy against people getting an ID in 2020. Everybody very much wants you to have one.')
