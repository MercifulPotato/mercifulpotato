Audio calls were comprehensible but sounded tinny, and people I was calling complained of an echo. Text messages worked, although I would have preferred Signal, and voicemail notifications came through as semi-cryptic text messages. As a portable terminal and web client though, it was perfectly acceptable albeit a bit pokey.')
