If the entire industry saves $280 billion, they don’t declare a giant dividend. The industry is extremely competitive, and the price of gas is very sensitive to changes in the cost of extracting the gas. If you forced operators to say pay the costs of capping wells up front, those costs would almost entirely be passed onto the consumer.<p>Since almost everyone uses gas, people are just going to be paying money they saved earlier through cheaper gas. More generally, the “but profits!” view of the world isn’t very useful when applied to highly competitive industries. Yeah, Purdue makes a lot of money in absolute terms, but it makes cents on each chicken. Consumers are the ones that mainly benefit from factory farming in the form of lower prices. Focusing on “profits” overlooks the real economic issue: people like cheap gas, chicken, and other commodities.<p>Down voters: There is nothing here to “disagree” with. The fact that gas prices closely track costs of extracting oil is not only Econ 101, its well established empirically.')
