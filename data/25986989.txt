In my limited understanding of the F# ecosystem, I don&#x27;t believe there are a lot of voices calling towards a multiplatform future beyond the NET world. Fable is cool, but native is a must-have for a lot of people, myself included.<p>The docs are bad but not inexcusably so, it&#x27;s a nice project within MS, I get it. The underlying machinery leaks a little into the language, things like &quot;discard&quot; are irritating but not unforgivable. And it&#x27;s not just running native, I know NET nerds will want to tell me about corert or native or whatever it&#x27;s called, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the issue. F# has a weak core, it&#x27;s not like Clojure where I have this wide array to choose from regardless of the platform. I can choose NET or Fable and the development experience varies wildly between those two environments, in my limited experience.<p>All in all, I think F# will live a medium-length life. Without solving the native problem and moving beyond NET, I don&#x27;t see it flourishing in many important niches.<p>If I was going to adopt a new language, it&#x27;d probably be Nim over F#, etc.')
