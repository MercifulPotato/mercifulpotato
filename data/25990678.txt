The US will not be able to go unopposed in the seas, and it will have to supply with non-naval means.<p>Also, it&#x27;s worth remembering that in the case you&#x27;re talking about, the US against the Axis in Europe, the US was not a major or deciding force, which is a major part of why it was able to afford such extended supply lines. In an alternative scenario where the rest of the Allies were so weak as that the US was the dominant power in the conflict, maintaining those supply lines would have been incredibly difficult.')
