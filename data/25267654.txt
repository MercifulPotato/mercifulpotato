The idea that the cost of actual goods are being driven down is always good for the people buying. I feel like we&#x27;re reaching the point where retail has to start charging directly for the value they bring to the table instead of trying to put it in the cost of the goods. Because you can&#x27;t compete with huge companies that operate on super thin margins and scale.<p>If your value as a bookstore is as a 3rd space or a co-working space then charge for that. Don&#x27;t try to hide it in the price of books or food. We have coffee shops that charge a cover if you want to work there. If the value of your bike shop is the show-rooming then charge for that. I would absolutely pay to try out different bikes and if you charge the same as everyone else for the actual bike I have no reason not to buy from you.')
