After all, vaccines don&#x27;t tend to work perfectly. You are correct that absent a perfect vaccine we will not be able to perfectly prevent covid without any effort, but you don&#x27;t explain why that invariably means we can only change distribution of disease outcomes.<p>What you&#x27;re saying is like saying &quot;the only way to have no technical debt is to have no code. You have code. I have code. Therefore there is nothing meaningful we can do besides pray for a world in which we don&#x27;t need code, because stuff like refactoring only moves tech debt around&quot;.<p>Consider two universes in which we both get a vaccine in two years. In one, people get infected at a rate of x. In another, they get infected at a rate of 2x. In neither universe does the x or 2x exceed the number of infectable people. Doesn&#x27;t one universe have half as many people infected?')
