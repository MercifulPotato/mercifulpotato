Hopefully it will come back some day. I migrated to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wallmine.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wallmine.com&#x2F;</a> when Google Finance announced it was neutering itself. However, I&#x27;ve noticed Wallmine&#x27;s listings are not always complete. As a couple examples: the insurance company Root isn&#x27;t listed, the label for JAMF isn&#x27;t correct.<p>Haven&#x27;t looked at what is out there in a while, any other alternatives people are using?')
