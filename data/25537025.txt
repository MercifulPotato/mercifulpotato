The TB port on the laptop can do 60 but you need a TB dock and not a USBC dock otherwise that would be the bottleneck. However if you just need video and not extra USB ports &#x2F; Ethernet &#x2F; etc., then a USB-C to DP adapter can do 60fps since it doesn&#x27;t need to reserve bandwidth for the other stuff.')
