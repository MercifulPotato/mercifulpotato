It was on several topical Webrings and got noticed enough to get several of those silly thinly-veiled advertising &quot;&lt;company&#x27;s&gt; choice on the web&quot; award badges.<p>If I brought that site up today as it was then I doubt it would show up on the first 3 pages of a Google search for the topic. But hay, at least you could view it with noscript turned on.')
