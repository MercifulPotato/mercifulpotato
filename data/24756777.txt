Got it.<p>&gt; <i>How do you know other planets do not have elements that have anti-matter properties?</i><p>Well, we haven&#x27;t observed anything that gives even a hint that something like that exists.<p>The matter &#x2F; antimatter disparity is still quite a mystery.  But we don&#x27;t see any evidence of antimatter out there in any significant quantities.  So if aliens want to use it, they have to make it the hard way, just like we do.<p>Beyond current state-of-the-art technology would make manufacturing and containment of antimatter easier, but even then it is a long way from practical.')
