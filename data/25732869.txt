I know the tech crowd is still angry about the safety debate, and that may even be justified. But it just doesn&#x27;t matter any more.<p>Solar + battery is now cheaper than <i>coal</i>, of all things, for new construction, in fairly typical situations.<p>Solar panels are also fairly productive in winter, more than people realise. That&#x27;s because we tend to believe their output is proportional to temperatures, which it is not. Solar irradiation varies far less throughout the year  than temperatures. Length of daylight in higher latitudes is an issue, but correlates surprisingly well with stronger winds, at least in Europe.')
