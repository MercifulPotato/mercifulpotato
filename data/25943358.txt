But utilizing my experience and intuition, very rarely have I seen such meticulous and relentless pursuit for efficiency and a compiler that will kill most of your bugs after it successfully compiles your program like Rust. Maybe Haskell and OCaml are it as well but they have plethora of problems that Rust doesn&#x27;t have. Maybe Nim and Zig? Only heard good things about those but never tried them.<p>&gt; <i>Haskell or Scala or F# come to my mind. I&#x27;m listing statically typed languages, because I assume you like those (otherwise, why Rust and not sticking to Elixir).</i><p>Personal &#x2F; professional development. I started with C&#x2F;C++ and Java 19 years ago and moved to dynamic languages at least 12 years ago and I felt that I want to have such a powerful language like Rust in my toolbelt again.')
