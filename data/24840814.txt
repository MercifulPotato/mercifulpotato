People called &quot;Google&quot; were allowed to name the result of building it &quot;Chrome&quot;. If you weren&#x27;t Google you had to call it Chromium, and could of course apply patches or change the build flags. The functional differences I saw then were all a result of patches that were applied by my distribution.')
