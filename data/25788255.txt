It works pretty well, with a REPL, (overly aggressive) autocomplete, and good integration with  the DOM, but it&#x27;s also limited.<p>Saving and loading .js files uses a very non-standard flow.  The editor is OK but I think basic operations like &quot;find across files&quot; are missing.  It&#x27;s very &quot;canned&quot; and not customizable.<p>In other words, it feels more like a debugging environment than a programming environment, which I think is basically what they were going for.')
