Item(by='gostsamo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609025810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25547023, text='+1 more for Home Assistant. I&#x27;m working in a b2b iot company and the amount of handcrafting integrations is enormous. You can&#x27;t do it with a simple product, so don&#x27;t even waste your time in trying. There are already communities about this, consumer iot is shit, and you will be adding one more shit to the pile. Plus, the big three MS, Google and Amazon might be converging on a common standard, and they will squeeze you out.<p>Best that I can offer as an advice is to look at what the big cloud players are doing and build on that. Link your console to the IOT hubs and make nocode solutions for managing devices.')
