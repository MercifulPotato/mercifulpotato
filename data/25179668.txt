Item(by='grzm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606069653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179501, text='&gt; Sometimes I see comments being downvoted literally within seconds of posting<p>I think the velocity that comments are read on HN would be surprising to a lot of people. I don’t have any particular inside knowledge but it stands to reason there are more readers than commenters. People viewing the Comments link will see comments, most recent first. I’ve noticed similar behavior with how quickly people can respond. If you’ve noticed quick downvotes on others’ comments, that means you’ve also viewed very recent comments, whether or not you’ve chosen to vote or respond.')
