It still seems pretty stable, although the slides on the Ivar keyboard tray sticks before the tray is fully extended (not a problem, the exposed area gives full access to the keyboard).<p>Looking at the wood, I suspect it&#x27;s spruce or pine, with visible joins in the shelving uprights, as well as in the shelves themselves.')
