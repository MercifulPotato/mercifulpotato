We&#x27;ve had to ask you this before, and we ban accounts that won&#x27;t stop doing it. The rules apply regardless of how wrong someone is or you feel they are.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>Edit: it looks like you&#x27;ve been breaking the site guidelines badly for quite a while now, by using HN primarily for political battle and posting lots of flamewar comments. That&#x27;s seriously not ok. It&#x27;s contributing to destroying this community, which is extremely vulnerable to such pressures.<p>I&#x27;ve been giving accounts a pass or letting them off with a warning when they&#x27;ve only been doing this during the collective fever of the last few daysâ€”but your account has been doing it for months, and that&#x27;s very different. I&#x27;ve banned this account. If you don&#x27;t want to be banned, you&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com and give us reason to believe that you&#x27;ll follow the rules in the future.')
