Just as you can store 7 in a programs source code you could store BB(7).<p>The issue is the halting problem  is for a given program and an arbitrary input.  If you want to store all BB(n)’s for an arbitrary input in a lookup table you would need an infinite program size.  Even if that’s acceptable, reading an infinitely large program + some input into itself takes infinite time.')
