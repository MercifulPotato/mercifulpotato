ReactOS was started as a “clone” of Windows NT to alleviate this situation. To demonstrate the concept of o&#x2F;s cloning, GNU&#x2F;Linux is the best for comparison here: Linux was started as a “clone” of Minix and Unix, eventually going on to be a Unix replacement.<p>...<p>&gt; Linux+Wine is never going to be a complete replacement for a full Windows system. It&#x27;s not only because of Linux (despite some user-friendly Linux distributions out there) and not only because many users might find a transition to Linux&#x2F;BSD difficult but it is largely due to design and implementation decisions of Linux and Wine architectures which prevent 100% compatibility.<p>You aren&#x27;t the audience, in other words.')
