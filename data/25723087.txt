Iâ€™m tempted to charge the entirety of the post-summer urban bloodbath to the BLM movement. This represents an increase of 3-4000 deaths over the prior year.<p>&gt; BLM is not about overthrowing the government, and has never posed a credible threat to it. Even if BLM overthrew the government, no one has been talking about mass executions.<p>This is sidestepping your point somewhat, but Antifa (who figured prominently in the protests) do explicitly avow both these things.')
