They&#x27;ll prevent serious disease but epithelial cells in the nose, mouth, and so on can still be infected and shed virus. It&#x27;s the same for flu vaccines. There are nasal vaccines which do provide mucosal immunity like flumist but during heavy flu seasons only the old and young have access.<p>So, even if you&#x27;re the required 2 months post vaccinated you probably shouldn&#x27;t stop wearing a mask or social distancing until 100% of the population around you has either also been vaccinated or been infected and recovered.<p>When will the entire population be vaccinated or already infected? At current rates it may be a year or two.')
