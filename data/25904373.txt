One conclusion you could draw is that there are simply way fewer roles at that level, but another you could draw is that people become less likely to share their info as they gain seniority&#x2F;compensation. Or it could be that culturally people born in the late 90’s share “private” information more readily than those born earlier.<p>I’m not sure what the truth is, since I do not have data on the distribution of levels for the whole industry, but I suspect there’s a combination of things going on, one of which _is_ that the industry is growing rapidly. However, I don’t believe it has grown so fast that you can say 70% of employees have less than 5 years tenure in the industry. This doesn’t pass the sniff test (just look around you right now).')
