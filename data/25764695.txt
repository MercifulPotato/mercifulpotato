Marlinspike, like the sailor&#x27;s tool.<p>That being said, at least this article is addressing issues with the network and not claiming that the code in question is not free.<p>I do think there&#x27;s a false equivalence here though.

I set up a free jabber server for my friends, since we were hitting some limitations of group MMS.  Exactly one person has logged into their account to use it. I set up the server, created the accounts, and told them which client to use.  None of the typical federation downsides should apply.
