From what I know, the COVID-19 vaccine is only effective in reducing symptoms for those who get inoculated. Is it accurate to say this vaccine does <i>not</i> prevent infection or help develop an immunity?  I just do not understand how vaccines work. Would love a (peer-reviewed) source or sources I could read to brush up.<p>This is not a political or bait post I really am looking for some signal in all the noise.')
