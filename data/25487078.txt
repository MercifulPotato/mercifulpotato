I would say more amazing than ever (thanks to new trailblazers like Alexandra Elbakyan).<p>I was just a kid growing up far removed from the information and happenings of the rest of the world and the web was this magical new thing that connected me to it. It was a bit of a firehose at first (well, I guess still is), but I loved it.<p>The only difference between now and then is that now I know how it all works. Back then the technology was completely magic. It&#x27;s still just as magical in the human sense, and I am so grateful to TBL and CERN for making it happen and giving it the public! It has been so game changing for me and I grew up in the USA, I have to imagine it would be even more game changing to people curious about the world who grew up in more remote places.')
