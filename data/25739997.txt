Trump used those grievances to get elected in the first place.  They aren&#x27;t going away because Trump goes away.<p>I wish I had some good words of wisdom at this point but the only thing I&#x27;m sure of is that if Congress goes ahead and attempts to impeach Trump things will get worse not better, it will make him a figurative martyr.<p>The best thing that could happen would be for Biden and Trump to somehow suck it up and come out and jointly make a speech urging everyone to take a deep-f*ing breath and perhaps add a joint to go along with everyone&#x27;s stimulus check.')
