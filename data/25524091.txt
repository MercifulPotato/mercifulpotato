If an app is not available outside the app store, email them and ask them to make it available. Remind them that they are being fools to add value to the app store as it reduces their options and makes them more dependent on Apple. This will allow Apple to gauge even more money from them in the future.<p>App stores also kill otherwise free open-source projects as it adds an unnecessary financial burden on them.<p>Remind them we have been doing fine without it on the desktop for decades now. Ask them why PAYING Apple for the privilege of adding VALUE to the macOS platform - by developing and distributing their wares on that platform - doesn&#x27;t make them feel like a jackass!? Apple should be the one paying them for creating value for the macOS platform!')
