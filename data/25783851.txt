Aquafaba is not the soaking water, it&#x27;s the cooking water.<p>My usual process for cooking chickpeas is:<p>- Soak overnight in a bowl. Throw this water out.<p>- Boil for several hours in new water. Save this water, and boil it down further to make aquafaba.<p>Not all chickpea recipes allow for this; for example, falafel is usually made with chickpeas that have been soaked but not boiled.')
