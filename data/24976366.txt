Since then, Silver has changed what the probabilities in his prediction model mean. This change was (briefly) discussed previously on HN [1].<p>For the record, I think Taleb was an asshole, but an asshole with an entirely valid point in this debate. And I think Silver reluctantly and quietly took it on board, and then went on to use bolt-on fudge factors so that the time-dependent predictions of his model <i>roughly look</i> like the time-dependent predictions generated by the rigorously defined approach (option price theory) that Taleb was calling for.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24164814" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24164814</a>')
