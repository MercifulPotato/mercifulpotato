What made this article and others like so amusing is the tremendous irony of demanding regulation, irony that the author seems completely oblivious to.<p>Do I regret missing out on all of the crypto gains I could have had?  Honestly I don&#x27;t really think about it that often and when I do it&#x27;s largely because I work in tech and I&#x27;m often forced to work with people who won&#x27;t shut up about it.  But I lived through similar periods with the first dotcom bubble, and the housing market in the run up to the financial crisis.  I don&#x27;t like &#x27;greater fool&#x27; investing as a strategy (but certainly some people have gotten very rich with it) so no I guess I don&#x27;t regret it.<p>(One sidelong observation there are a lot more paper gains than realized gains.  I&#x27;ve worked with a number of bitcoin millionaires.  But if I filter the count to those who have &gt; $1mm in USD, in a US domiciled bank, the number drops top zero.  Who knows? Maybe it&#x27;s adverse selection.  Maybe the real winners aren&#x27;t working anymore.)')
