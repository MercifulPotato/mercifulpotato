I work on platforms teams internally for companies (and have for a number of years). In smaller scale, this concept largely makes sense because developers at a single company come from a single culture which those developers largely have already bought into or are actively being shoveled into by corporate work. This is the role a lot of developer advocates play at companies who don&#x27;t have external developer customers.<p>In large scale, what you&#x27;re asking is more dubious. If you concede that the United States alone has 11 major cultures, then you have to begin a process of &quot;on-boarding&quot; everyone onto your new, structured culture that your platform is designed around. That&#x27;s why these debates about who is represented in the building of the platform come about, because under that model those concerns take center stage and they should.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is the whole problem never needed to exist. There&#x27;s better ways to share information than being on one platform.')
