Item(by='HideousKojima', descendants=None, kids=[25633980], score=None, time=1609776483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631517, text='&gt;Both major parties exploit these so I canâ€™t blame a single party here either.<p>Republicans in Wisconsin abolished public unions back in 2011 (though admittedly they had exemptions for police and firefighters) and there was nationwide outrage from the left about it. There have been recent calls from the left to abolish police unions but those seem almost exclusively about police unions&#x27; ability to protect corrupt&#x2F;brutal&#x2F;racist cops and not about their ability to bilk taxpayers.<p>So while it&#x27;s not completely clearcut, the right has a much better record for opposing public unions than the left.')
