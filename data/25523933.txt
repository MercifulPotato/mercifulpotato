They were then able to cross compile it for Mac and Windows. When first using the software, it was only ever used on Windows. Once I started using it in more advanced ways, I wanted to try out the Mac and&#x2F;or Linux versions since they had a CLI client. Both of these systems ran circles around the Windows version in how much faster they were to do the exact same processing. Turns out, they were using the same C-style calls to access files. That C-style code is very slow on windows, yet using a Windows native call brought their software to the same speed.<p>TL;DR Windows definitely has its own way of doing file system access')
