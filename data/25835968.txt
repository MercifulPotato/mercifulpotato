Stepper systems can be open loop as long as you&#x27;re aware of what the torque threshold is and make sure you don&#x27;t exceed that. Obviously a crash would exceed that, but there&#x27;s ways to detect that (e.g., stallguard on Trinamics stuff) without adding an encoder. The whole point of open-loop stepper systems is that you make sure you stay under the torque limit by a margin (say, 30% or so) and you are fine.  A properly designed system should never lose steps ever, besides in a crash event. Or if you load it up with too much side force, but you can get that on any machine.')
