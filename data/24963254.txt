I had an account but didn&#x27;t login for years at a time. My use has gone up significantly by:<p>1. Only following industry people and chefs. Basically just work and hobby. Anyone that strays into politics or social issues is hard cut. Not because they&#x27;re wrong for doing so, but because with an anxiety disorder I&#x27;m not equipped to handle the constant bombardment of that. \n2. I got a plugin that blocks the trending topics. \n3. I have a keyword blocker for anything politically or socially related.<p>With that my experience has improved dramatically, but I really only was able to curate that experience because I work in the social media marketing industry. Regular users aren&#x27;t as well equipped in the slightest. It&#x27;s great because now I can use it for networking and my interests in a way thats much better than Facebook groups (which is what I formerly used to make industry connections).')
