Item(by='saiya-jin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603179672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829381, text='We have a double bed from chipwood that costed +-1000USD with mattress and bed slats. Slats and mattress are fine (which is expected after roughly only 4 years), but bed frame... overpriced for what it is. Will go for solid massive wood which can be found cheaper where we live. At that time there wasn&#x27;t basically anything in IKEA from solid wood.<p>So some IKEA stuff is well priced, some isn&#x27;t. Some is great value for the money, some definitely isn&#x27;t. Some styles are plain ugly as f<i></i>k to us, some they nail pretty well for the price. I think its called hit-and-miss situation.<p>Their kitchens are great value generally - not top notch by any means, but at given price even professionals tend to agree they are the best. If you want something better, prepare 2-3x the price. And since you never move kitchen, most complains mentioned before don&#x27;t apply.')
