Item(by='tabob', descendants=None, kids=[24895575, 24895542], score=None, time=1603713431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24895055, text='Unemployment varies greatly state by state and rarely keeps up with the reality of the cost of living.<p>On top of this, it only applies if you lose your job due to &quot;lay-offs&quot;. I&#x27;ve been laid off four times in my life, all 3 times the companies claimed they were not lay-offs and fought my claim. 2 times I was denied.<p>The third time I received unemployment benefits for 5 months. I received $4,000 in benefits then my former employer won an appeal, and my claim was deemed &quot;fraud&quot;. I had to pay $8,500 back ($4,000 + $4,500 in &quot;fraud fees&quot;).<p>If you are fired for &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;screw you, have a nice day&quot;.<p>8 months ago 10% of my company&#x27;s engineering department (screw you, cloud passage) was fired &quot;for cause&quot; and replaced with cheap Belarusian contractors. This time I didn&#x27;t even bother for unemployment, I didn&#x27;t want to risk having to pay it back + 100% fines. I also do not get covid stimulus, and have had to sell my 401k to keep from being homeless.<p>America has no social net whatsoever. I do not qualify for unemployment, food stamps, or anything else even though I have been working my ass off and paying taxes for 25 years.')
