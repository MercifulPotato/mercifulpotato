For data analysis, it&#x27;s much more important to be accurate than fast, and this article is unclear how many attempts each example query took. GPT-3 does not always output coherent output (even with good prompts), and since not 100% of the output is valid SQL the QA and risk tolerance of bad output affects the economics.<p>OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-3 API is expensive enough (especially with heavy prompt engineering) that the time saved may not outweigh the cost, particularly if the output is not 100% accurate.')
