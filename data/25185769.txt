But I think cutting out almost all news media is a good choice to make.<p>My reasoning is this: most of the stuff in the general news is something you can do absolutely nothing about, at most it may influence your choices at election time or best case inform you about a scandal involving some company, letting you avoid doing business with them in the future.<p>Everything else is just noise that creates anxiety.')
