I ask this genuinely, because I have a tendency to feel these tools only negatively impact people who use them in stress-creating ways.</i><p>They use highly optimized and self-optimizing techniques and psychological tricks (including A&#x2F;B testing, consulting experts in cognition, using dark patterns, and everything) to get you hooked on dopamine hits, make you jealoush of your timeline peers, anger you, milk your engagement etc.<p>The idea that &quot;I&#x27;m different, these ads don&#x27;t work on me&quot; is basically the 21st century version of &quot;I&#x27;m not addicted can&#x27;t quit anytime&quot; of the drug addict (not to mention that it&#x27;s not just ads, but the feed that&#x27;s problematic, from reasons that range from echo-bubbling to comparing yourself to 1000s of people you don&#x27;t know but are your &quot;friends&quot; -- and even with actual friends, people used to have less visibility to their spending habbits, vacation photos, etc, not share everything including pics of their branch).')
