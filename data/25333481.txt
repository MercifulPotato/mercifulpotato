All they are using the blockchain for is to store meter readings, the blockchain is significantly more expensive than the standard method: a regular-ass database.<p>It&#x27;s yet another example of the misconception that blockchain somehow guarantees data validity. In reality it does the opposite: it reduces tampering, sure, but there are other ways to reduce tampering that don&#x27;t also forbid validation. A broken meter will put bad data on the blockchain just the same as it will any other database, but because you&#x27;re using blockchain you now can&#x27;t go back and fix it when you find the error.')
