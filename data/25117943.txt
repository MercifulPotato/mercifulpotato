Do you, does a prosecutor, a judge, the police?&quot;<p>Some sort of formal process with reasonable oversight the necessity of multiple points of compromise and&#x2F;or collusion in order for the data to be abused for non-governmental use. Bottom line, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve &quot;solved&quot; the problem and have the perfect answer to your question. But I&#x27;m sure we, collectively as a society filled with smart people that want to move us forward, could put down some (fundamental?) tools&#x2F;rules&#x2F;processes that would negate the potential for abuse up until a certain point. Maybe we can&#x27;t do 100%, but we could do 95 or 98%?<p>&gt;&quot;Is it a valid to decrypt your data just see if you were at a specific location at a specific time? What about so the police can check a theory? How about to see if you joined an unsanctioned protest, smoked a joint, speed while driving, downloaded a movie?&quot;<p>Yes, very much so Yes! Especially the location based stuff as it&#x27;s perfect for investigations without revealing details. &quot;List all people that were within 50m of this crime location during this timespan.&quot; &lt;-- that is so unbelievably powerful as a crime-solving tool, that I am baffled that we&#x27;re avoiding it out of privacy concerns. As for the speeding example: That&#x27;s probably another example of us <i>already</i> giving the data (car&#x27;s black-box) to government (and private insurance companies) in order to facilitate an investigation.<p>But to your point about drug-use, speeding and copyright infringement. If we don&#x27;t want something prosecuted then we shouldn&#x27;t have it as a crime. But as it stands now, a bunch of what you mentioned <i>is a crime</i>. That represents an implicit agreement by all of us in society that says we deem those things punishable. We can&#x27;t hide behind lack of capability to police said crimes, but still label them as such. <i>That</i> is ripe for offical-power abuse. For all we know, if we lived in a society where we had such strict enforcement of laws as I suggest, we&#x27;d potentially have greater churn and change in our laws to match the opinions of society as it changed and evolved.<p>&gt; &quot;Privacy is a fundamental tool for allowing society to progress and change, and for avoiding totalitarianism.&quot;<p>I disagree. I&#x27;m not seeing it. There is just way too much going wrong today in 1-st world countries whilst we have really good privacy for it to be the case. We&#x27;re downright descending into totalitarianism and thought&#x2F;opinion control territory, all whilst our &quot;privacy&quot; is mostly maintained and respected. Are you saying we need <i>more</i> of it? What would that look like to you?')
