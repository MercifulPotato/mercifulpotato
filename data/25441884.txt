You can cover most of these techniques in a single paper. Once you realize that any light&#x2F;sound&#x2F;RF channel can be abused, you either accept you are vulnerable to this attack, or you make your airgap involve a Faraday cage, thick walls, and generator power or extreme power filtering (e.g. through batteries to strictly reduce the bandwidth of the power usage channel).<p>There isn&#x27;t much more to it. His techniques are not something you block individually. You block entire classes. Block light, there goes all the LEDs. Block sound&#x2F;vibration, there goes the fan&#x2F;coil whine stuff. Insulate thermally, that takes care of that. Faraday cage, bye bye RF. Etc.<p>Either you care about this entire class of channels, and you do all of those things, or you don&#x27;t, and your air gap just means no Ethernet cable between two adjacent computers. The specific details of each of his attacks are not useful. They do not contribute to the state of the art in any way. It&#x27;s just pumping out papers.<p>Indeed, if advanced modulation and processing were used, <i>that</i> would be useful research. That would be science, measuring the true information-carrying capacity of these approaches. But he&#x27;s not doing that. At all. Not even trying.')
