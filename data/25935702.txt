I guess that is how they could negotiate $2000 for an MRI with insurance and the other place (that I went to) was only able to negotiate $500.<p>Honestly, the price for health care in the US is all funny money. I&#x27;ve gotten a single shot, of a very common drug, that was billed at $20k, knocked down to $10k with the &quot;insurance discount&quot;, so my 10% co-pay ended up $1000, with insurance!<p>I had a surgery that was billied at $250k where the &quot;discount&quot; was over $150k. That $250k price is clearly not real.')
