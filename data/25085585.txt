Item(by='vharuck', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605291778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083480, text='&gt;(11) The insurance industry transforms from “recovery after risk” to “prevention of risk:”... health insurance (which is really sick insurance) pays only after you get sick.<p>In the US, health insurance plans will almost always have prevention measures.  They give discounts for annual wellness screenings, they arrange transportation to checkups, they pay for cancer screening.<p>But health insurance is an oddity among insurance types.  I don&#x27;t use my fire insurance to pay for routine things.  The fire insurance company can do pretty well playing the odds of disasters.  But my health insurer also has to pay for the boring stuff like lifelong medications and annual checkups.  So they need to drive down the risk of an emergency enough to still be profitable.<p>Also, the government really pushes prevention.  Hard to say no to the entity with the biggest sticks and tastiest carrots.')
