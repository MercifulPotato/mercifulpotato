When you can tie up courts for years to play financial triage and get the best reputation money can buy, you aren&#x27;t likely to be held accountable.<p>I know a person who drove their car into a wall while drunk and high in college. Their parents paid $5000 to an attorney and their DUI charge was eventually dropped. Another friend&#x27;s life took a different course when they got their DUI under similar circumstances but without an attorney, and despite their earnest efforts it&#x27;s been hard to overcome within the job market.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that the defacto disparity of legal budgets is quite damaging to the fabric that holds our society together, which is equal treatment under blind justice. It means an equal distribution of dishonesty is punished disproportionately according to familial wealth.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find this definition of privilege quite in line with OP&#x27;s meaning: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;Priviledge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;Priviledge</a>\n&gt;A particular benefit, advantage, or Immunity enjoyed by a person or class of people that is not shared with others. A power of exemption against or beyond the law. It is not a right but, rather, exempts one from the performance of a duty, obligation, or liability.')
