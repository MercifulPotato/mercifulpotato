If you want to pack an additional leisure traveller onto your 1-stop, make it $10, maybe $20, cheaper and &quot;mission accomplished&quot;.<p>If you want to pull an additional business traveller onto your flight, discounting by a tiny amount doesn&#x27;t help you much (if at all), but giving them something that they can personally use later does. Business travelers also have more chances per year where you can influence their decision. Getting 10 or 20 chances to land an additional short-notice and&#x2F;or higher-cabin fare seems like where the money is.<p>My company does recommend one particular carrier&#x2F;group, but I have freedom to book other carriers without any fuss or extra effort on my part if the itinerary makes more sense for my trip. I do try to fly our preferred carrier, mostly because of the frequent upgrades I get and much less because of frequent flier miles. (Spouse and I use airlines once, maybe twice, per year for personal travel, so just accumulate miles which will be devalued to nearly worthless by the time we retire and travel more for leisure on airlines.)')
