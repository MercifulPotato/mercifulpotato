Multiple generations in USA (which is a dominantly exported culture globally) have adopted the &quot;drugs&quot;-are-bad idea as a core belief (it&#x27;s also worth noting that core beliefs tend not to be very nuanced or discerning, as in this case there&#x27;s very little ability to discern between different types of &quot;drug&quot; substances).<p>Culture evolution slows further when large institutions (primarily &quot;the state&quot; here) adopt the same beliefs and make them concrete (by being codified in many laws in this case). This particular effect worsens when the core belief is that some <i>thing</i> is bad and can be outlawed&#x2F;fought because you get droves of self-righteous politicians who want to make a name for themselves piling on against this Bad Thing.<p>Those processes need to be reversed and unwound to move past the erroneous core belief.<p>Bad ideas <i>do</i> die, but they almost always survive much longer than they &quot;should&quot; because of a litany of flaws in human nature&#x2F;culture&#x2F;information-flow.')
