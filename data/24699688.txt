It took 50 years for Higgs to get his.<p>Nobel prizes reward experimentally verified discoveries and I suspect the direct observation of a black hole is what finally got Penrose his Nobel. But discoveries like Hawking radiation didn&#x27;t result in a Nobel prize because even though it is a well accepted idea among physicists, it hasn&#x27;t been observed yet.<p>As theories predict things that require more and more extreme conditions and precise instruments, the time between theory and experimental validation gets longer and longer.')
