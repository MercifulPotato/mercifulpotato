I was so upset when bunny-hoping was mostly removed when CS:GO was released. I played the HNS (hide-n-seek) mode in CS 1.6 more than the normal game-mode. Most of the HNS mechanics were based on game bugs: bunny-hopping, long-jump (sync mouse movement with player movement), edge-bug (not dying if you fall from any distance on a 90degree edge at a specific distance), jump-bug (not dying if you fall from any distance if you jump exactly before you hit the ground), surfing (gaining almost infinite speed when sliding horizontally across a tilted surface).<p>I actually stopped playing CS entirely because this mode could not be accurately reproduced with the new CS:GO physics engine.')
