Let&#x27;s confine ourselves to statements supported by facts.<p>The injuries sustained by dozens of Capitol Police officers, including one who remains on life support, suggest that if a pro-Trump conspiracy existed then it didn&#x27;t extend past the Chief. There is zero evidence (so far) for such a conspiracy. On the other hand, the footage of officers fighting huge crowds, dispersing rioters with teargas and pepperballs, and even shooting one Capitol invader dead at close range all suggest they did not &quot;side with the President.&quot; [0][1][2][3]<p>Officers were overmatched and overwhelmed as the result of poor planning by leadership. The AP suggests complacency was to blame, not collusion or conspiracy [4]:<p>&gt;Both Acevedo and Ed Davis, a former Boston police commissioner who led the department during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, said they did not fault the responses of clearly overmatched front-line officers, but the planning and leadership before the riot.<p>&gt;“Was there a structural feeling that well, these are a bunch of conservatives, they’re not going to do anything like this? Quite possibly,” Davis said. “That’s where the racial component to this comes into play in my mind. Was there a lack of urgency or a sense that this could never happen with this crowd? Is that possible? Absolutely.”<p>And this is just to focus on the US Capitol Police. If we look at the DC Metro Police, &quot;local&quot; cops in the truest sense of the word, they&#x27;re not at all aligned with President Trump. Mayor Bowser and Acting Chief Contee are not Republicans. See my comment above for a recap of MPD&#x27;s conduct yesterday.<p>I am sick of the ACAB mentality which leads to assumptions like &quot;capitol police sided with the President.&quot; It is generally untrue, predicated on lies, and counter-productive. I hope my analysis demonstrates that in this case.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mattdizwhitlock&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347018199653560320" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mattdizwhitlock&#x2F;status&#x2F;13470181996535603...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;KySportsRadio&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347031398176223233" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;KySportsRadio&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347031398176223233</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zhalaschak&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346940634557521929" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zhalaschak&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346940634557521929</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mattrodierphot1&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346943249680883713" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mattrodierphot1&#x2F;status&#x2F;13469432496808837...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;donald-trump-riots-police-coronavirus-pandemic-9c39a4ddef0ab60a48828a07e4d03380" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;donald-trump-riots-police-coronav...</a>')
