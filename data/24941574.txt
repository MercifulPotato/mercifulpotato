Any fact on its own is easily taken out of context and can be spun one way or the other. Context helps. And in the context of an election, dirt on one candidate provided by a close ally of the other candidate, comes with a ton of context. And even if the dirt is true, the context is still: how does that compare to the corruption of the other candidate.<p>It seems like there&#x27;s a lot of attention for possible but uncertain corruption by Biden, exactly because it&#x27;s uncertain; it&#x27;s a question people want to know the answer to. Meanwhile, there&#x27;s tons of evidence for corruption by Trump that nobody pays attention to because it&#x27;s obvious, it&#x27;s already known, there&#x27;s no interesting question to speculate about.<p>But the end result is that the cleanest candidate gets associated with corruption while the dirty candidate doesn&#x27;t.<p>Context would mean whenever there&#x27;s a story on corruption by one candidate, you also report on the comparable cases of corruption by the other candidate. Then readers will always see what the balance of corruption between the two is.')
