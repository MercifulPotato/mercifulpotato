Where I work, we have a million and one different kinds of reports that pass through the chain of command (admittedly not all of these are derived from Jira, but they exist for the same reasons). We then end up with arbitrary, company-wide reporting requirements that for a lot of teams are like fitting a square peg in a round hole. Then, when you show up as non-compliant on the report that doesn&#x27;t actually say anything valuable about your team or project, you have to drop everything and shoehorn some solution to make the report happy even though there&#x27;s precisely zero value added (I would argue a net loss because time and effort is wasted while adding zero value). All because inconsistencies in the reporting aren&#x27;t tolerated since upper management can&#x27;t be bothered to understand even the smallest amount of nuance.<p>I know most of the people in these positions aren&#x27;t _actually_ stupid, and would agree if you were able to explain to them why some specific thing is completely irrelevant, or even detrimental, to your team. At the end of the day, though, at big orgs no one cares. They&#x27;ll waste as much time and effort as necessary in order to look good on metrics. Even if the metrics are worthless.')
