Before someone posts the seemingly mandatory link to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enforcementtracker.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enforcementtracker.com</a>, let me preempt your arguments:<p>* Google has so far been fined peanuts compared to the revenue they make breaching the GDPR<p>* Facebook has been fined pennies based on a technicality rather than their actual privacy violations<p>* Facebook does not respect the GDPR with regards to providing data subjects a full copy of their data, and does so in total impunity by the looks of it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruben.verborgh.org&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruben.verborgh.org&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;</a><p>* Currently neither Facebook nor Google have been fined regarding the omnipresence of their analytics&#x2F;advertising SDKs on the web and in mobile apps despite them not only collecting more data than necessary but not asking for user consent')
