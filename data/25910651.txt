If you take its contents at face value, there were <i>multiple</i> cases decided on merits.<p>If anything, I can see the potential for an argument to be made that that that site&#x27;s definition of &quot;decided on merits&quot; is too narrow. For example, depositions were submitted in <i>Law v. Whitmer</i>, significant parts of the decision were dedicated <i>specifically</i> to discussing the merits of the case, and the conclusion specifically says that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof, but that case is listed as &quot;Decided on Merits: NO&quot;.')
