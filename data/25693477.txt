Twitter and Facebook acted as enablers of those protests (which were, of course, legitimate) which got them permanently censored in Iran.<p>But now with an election legitimacy challenge in their home country, from a group considered as &quot;fringe&quot; by the dominant political and media establishment, they would not only NOT enable the protests, but they would act as the censors and suppressor of that protests.<p>So if inciting &quot;anarchy and riots&quot; is bad here, why it is good  elsewhere? And if supporting &quot;right of the people to protest&quot; against the whole system and its legitimacy is good elsewhere, why is it bad here???')
