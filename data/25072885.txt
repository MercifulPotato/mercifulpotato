Without trying to appeal to authority, I work in the industry and except in very specific cases where it is clear how much AUM a particular fund runs, people will quote percentage returns because it tells you immediately what is the severity.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but nobody can keep all the different AUMs in their head. There are thousands (tens of thousands?) of funds in the world, I really can&#x27;t be bothered to memorize all their assets. The headline was clearly written to elicit an emotional response, at the expense of information content.<p>&gt; Losing $3.7bn trading stocks in a tech bull-market the likes of which we&#x27;ve never seen is...not good, regardless of the fund size.<p>It&#x27;s not good, but again the dollar figure is completely meaningless: if the fund has an AUM of $100bln, this is a largely inconsequential -4%, which may compare unfavorably to their peer group and may elicit management changes down the line. For a $10 bln fund this is pretty much game over and they would be gearing for a fire sale of office equipment.')
