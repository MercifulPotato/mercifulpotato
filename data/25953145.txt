Plus average square footage has gone up, so you&#x27;re getting more.<p>* Land depends on location, and urban prices have gone up because it&#x27;s more cool to live in the city now than in the 1970s and 1980s. I live in Toronto, so I know <i>all about</i> land&#x2F;housing prices over the last 10-15 years.<p>* Modern cars have more power, while burning less fuel, and being safer, and on average lasting longer, for the same money. I own a 2003 Golf that I paid $30K for (in 2003). What&#x27;s available for $30K is a lot better, and the equivalent dollars today is closer to $40Kâ€”which gets you some sweet things.<p>* I was invested in 2008: I&#x27;ve seen stocks go up <i>and</i> down.<p>* Crypto is a Ponzi scheme.')
