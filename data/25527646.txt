A few years ago, they added a new requirement that you don&#x27;t apply directly to the &quot;prefecture&quot; but you have to go through an additional step which takes about a year.<p>My gf is applying for citizenship at the moment, I&#x27;ve described the timeline for her situation. It&#x27;s been now more than 3 years since she started her application, including 14 months waiting for their decision. And she&#x27;d been living in France for more than 10 years before that and graduated from a French university.<p>It probably would have been easier to just get married...<p>BTW, congratulations for your citizenship. I&#x27;m glad it was efficient for you.')
