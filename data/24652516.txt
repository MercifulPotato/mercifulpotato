I have 6+ years experience developing prototypes. I am proficient at building gritty alphas and concept ideas. Ideally I would like a job where I improve my ability to deploy reliable and enduring software to a reasonably sized audience. I have produced a variety of unique projects:<p>- IVR Phone Systems [ In production ]\n- Statistics Dashboards [ In production ]\n- Google Home&#x2F;Assistant appointment scheduler [ Cancelled ]\n- Americans with Disabilities Act Compliance website crawlers (Detecting and preventing issues relating to ADA) [ In Development ]\n- And a whole lot more...<p>I&#x27;m open to freelance and full time opportunities.<p>Thanks! :D')
