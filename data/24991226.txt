Made people more paranoid and less believing of what they see. Is that a positive change though?<p>Meanwhile, you still have to manually load dishes in the dishwasher, and robot vacuum cleaners stumble and block on the easiest of obstacles.<p>Call me a cynic but AI work needs to get out of its comfy well-funded bro-club corner and start to seriously try and solve real-actual-physical-world problems. It&#x27;s all well and good that scientist X can model a text paragraph with this or that NN but when will he solve a car driving itself?<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong. I know science can take a <i>long</i> time to make a breakthrough. It&#x27;s not adhering to the same laws as everyday work -- I am aware and I am clamouring for science. But I don&#x27;t feel the AI area is even heading in any direction at all. Could be wrong though.')
