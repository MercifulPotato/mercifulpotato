The US has had very large GDP growth over the past 45+ years. But that&#x27;s how much money has gone to capital vs labor since the 70s.<p>The clearest way to think of software engineer salaries is: median software engineer salary as a multiple of median country salary. US is 1.38, France is 1.21, Germany 1.33. [1] Overall our software salaries are proportionally no more or no less than expected based on median labor rate &#x2F; salary in major European countries.<p>However, because all of the gains in wealth have gone to capital, overall salaries are actually suppressed. Salaries across the board in the US would be higher, if gains of the past ~45 years hadn&#x27;t been siphoned off. Essentially if we had the same income distribution as we exited the 60s with, <i>everyone today with a salary of &lt; 200,000 would be making more money</i>. So that covers the vast majority of software engineers. Even more so if you remove the 20% Cost of Living bump due to being in Bay Area. So even most FANG employees would be making more if the US still had a normal income distribution. [2]<p>I think that&#x27;s the largest thing people don&#x27;t understand. Devaluing labor, devalues labor for everyone. Software engineering salaries are <i>vastly</i> underpaid, vs the revenue they bring in - it&#x27;s incredibly skewed and goes to ownership &#x2F; capital. It&#x27;s half the mantra behind all of push for doing your own startups: working as labor in software you&#x27;re being vastly undervalued. Might as well do the same thing and have a chance at ownership &#x2F; capital. It&#x27;s all the same issue.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swexperts.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;software-engineer-salaries-by-country&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;swexperts.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;software-engineer-salaries-by-coun...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;a-25-trillion-question-what-if-incomes-grew-like-gdp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;a-25-trillion-question-wha...</a>')
