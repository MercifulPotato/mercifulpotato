I guess I might be angry...<p>The culture change in our industry, towards warm fuzzies and away from tech screens, results in calculable waste. Time, money, electricity, customers. We lose good engineers and tell ourselves they were a bad fit. We push crap on users just to sell ads. Then we write engineering posts to brag about fixing our own mistakes. It&#x27;s a terrible shame and I speak up about it to remind everyone there was a time when RTFM would be the only response to this.<p>Edit: rate limited but one last thing: are we this forgiving of Equifax when they oopsie our data?  Seeing this would immediately make me wonder if anything I have shared with Pinterest is safe. That&#x27;s why they owe us a postmortem and not a thirst trap.')
