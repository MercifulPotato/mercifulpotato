I am wondering what people on HN think of pandoc, a Haskell project by someone outside the software industry for converting to&#x2F;from .docx and other formats.  I like it because it can be used as a single binary.  Is there some other preferred way amongst so-called &quot;software engineers&quot; to do the sort of conversions pandoc does.  Python libraries, maybe?')
