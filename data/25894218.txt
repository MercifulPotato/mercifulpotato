The little code I have written outside of work falls into 2 categories, minor tweaks to existing code bases or experimental bits of code to try something out. Neither of those are really useful to this situation. If I was looking for code that I fully wrote myself that would work for this I’d have to look at projects from a number of years ago which means my ability to answer questions would be significantly diminished as I don’t remember why&#x2F;how I made the choices I made.')
