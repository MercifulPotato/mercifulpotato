The more complex your image is, the more problems&#x2F;artifacts you will &quot;create&quot; on it. Your render time can be x100 faster, if you need to spend two days to fix a problem for each shot, the quality VS speed ratio completely fall over.<p>Everything get easier, slowly, so maybe one day we will have a 100% GPU farm on big budget projects, but for now, CPU is the most predictable way to manage large scale rendering for both sides (sysadmin&#x2F;artists).')
