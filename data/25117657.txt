Broke my heart because I&#x27;d been a longtime ThinkPad user, but going from a solid X220 to a P1 that failed in two years, to a crapware-laden Yoga that had multiple failures in the first 6 months just killed any love I had for the brand.<p>Acer&#x27;s hardware is inferior in every measurable spec but hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, and that&#x27;s frankly all I want from it. It works and it stays out of my way.')
