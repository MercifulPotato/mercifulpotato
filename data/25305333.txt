It is soul-sucking at times, but nowhere near as soul-sucking as the life I came from and I will never stop being grateful for that. If I want more excitement from working, I can always pick up the exact work of my personal interest on the side (but I don&#x27;t, because there are so many other interesting things to do outside of software). I&#x27;d rather have great security and quality of life from the work that puts a roof over my head.')
