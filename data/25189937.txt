Item(by='alasdair_', descendants=None, kids=[25190026], score=None, time=1606156417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184763, text='Yesterday, we lost the password to our bed.<p>Of all of out IoT mishaps, this one was possibly the most ridiculous. We have a SleepNumber bed that adjusts up and down. I&#x27;d just cracked a rib and <i>really</i> wanted to sit upright in bed.<p>The problem was, I&#x27;d gotten a new phone. The bed has an app (because of course it does) and the only way to adjust it is via the app. So I try to use the app and realize I first need to log in. The problem is, we have no idea what the email address that was used was, nor the password. Password reset isn&#x27;t working. Eventually after half an hour we gave up and used a bunch of pillows instead.<p>Even when the app works, it&#x27;s terrible. It&#x27;s super laggy (it sometimes takes a full minute to adjust the bed) and is a privacy nightmare - it wants to log every bedroom &quot;activity&quot; and send all the data back to sleep number and there is no way to permanently disable the feature - all you can do is pause data collection temporarily, which means it will ask you again next time you open the app.<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good way to pre-set &quot;only adjust MY side of the bed&quot; so usually any adjustments I try to make end up moving my wife as well. All in all, the app is terrible.<p>I fully intent to get around to reverse engineering the protocol and writing a home assistant plugin for it, just as soon as I get a spare few days (i.e. never).<p>I still can&#x27;t believe I need a password to use my bed...')
