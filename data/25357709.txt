Item(by='littlestymaar', descendants=None, kids=[25361496, 25357757, 25357884, 25357930, 25359017], score=None, time=1607515237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25355580, text='Fun at first, but between level 7 or something and at least level 15, it&#x27;s the same problem over and over (sure, positions change a little bit, but the method is exactly same). I wonder if it changes a bit later, but even if it does, it would be cool if some of these redundant levels were removed so people don&#x27;t get bored.<p>Edit: level 17 is a little bit more interesting (albeit being the same thing) but level 18 and 19 aren&#x27;t… Level 20 is the first one with 3 moves, so it starts becoming interesting again. Level 10 to 19 should really be summarized in just two or 3 levels.<p>Edit2: level 51 still has three moves. Three moves are more interesting than two, and most of those aren&#x27;t too straightforward and repetitive (many aren&#x27;t too hard, but some are a little bit tricky, which is cool), yet it causes a little sense of stagnation… I&#x27;m done.')
