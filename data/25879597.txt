Could you simplify it a bit?<p>I&#x27;m not a great writer:) Political parties are private organizations; we shouldn&#x27;t draw districts with the intention of either assigning half of the districts to each of them or assigning half of each district to each of them.<p>As for race, the way you fix historical wrongs is by fixing them, not through trying to tweak the system until everyone who has equal resources will get a fair shot regardless of race. Groups historically discriminated against by law don&#x27;t have equal resources.<p>I&#x27;m also black, from the south side of Chicago, and don&#x27;t care about &quot;representation&quot; in and of itself. I&#x27;m not insulting me.')
