If you have the ability to traverse the Galaxy or Universe then surely you can also stay undetected by our comparatively pathetic technology. At the same time their mere existence would imply the Universe is probably full of intelligent life and why would they be particularly interested in naked apes who can&#x27;t even agree about simple scientific facts? We&#x27;re made of meat after all. The only explanation is that they would be conducting a psychological experiment on humanity and we&#x27;d better hope they don&#x27;t decide to end it early.')
