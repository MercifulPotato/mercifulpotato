It made me self-reflect and I feel like I&#x27;ve become, well, boring. Not that I need to be as playful as a toddler, but as I&#x27;ve aged (mid-thirties now), I feel like my sense of humor, my willingness to explore, make random jokes, etc have all decayed away (even compared to late twenties &#x2F; early thirties).<p>Has anyone else felt this way?')
