Clarity trumps all other concerns.<p>Agreed, with exceptions... the problem domain matters.  HFT code definitely demands code that is clever, but isn&#x27;t clear such as bit twiddling, template tricks, and very architecture specific solutions.  Gaming - Carmack&#x27;s fast inverse square root.  Compilers - Duff&#x27;s device.  I&#x27;m sure there are others.<p>I&#x27;d add one:  Someone else did it first and better.  Pretty much everything you&#x27;ll encounter that&#x27;s non-trivial, is likely an algorithm and done by someone else better, correctly, and faster.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with knowing the algorithms, but Knuth, Hoare, et al. probably did it first, and correctly.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to find the best algorithm implementation in your language.')
