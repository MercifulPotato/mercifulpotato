Item(by='nolok', descendants=None, kids=[25646691], score=None, time=1609860043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646290, text='Two kind of sanctions:<p>- sanction the leaders responsible and their buddies, the most common (that&#x27;s what we do with russia, turkey, ...), hurt their wallet but ultimately is a soft sanction, and also your populace sees it as ineffective &#x2F; nothing is done<p>- sanction the country directly, embargo, complete block, kick out of swift, that sort of stuff is what was done to Iran. Can only be done if you&#x27;re part of the bigger&#x2F;more powerful group.  \nMassive effect, causes lots of poverty and pain for the populace but that&#x27;s on purpose, so they are forcing their leaders to change some stuff. Doesn&#x27;t always work, but both outcome are victories in a way: either the country is forced to change and stop the original abuse, or it doesn&#x27;t change but is so crippled that it&#x27;s not longer a problem.<p>This is bound to something very, very, important: if the country does change and does what you asked, you start lifting.<p>Part of the message that&#x27;s more of an european rant: that&#x27;s why Trump action on the Iran deal was a disaster, because, now the population doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s their own leaders fault, and even if they did their leaders don&#x27;t believe it would ease if they did what was asked. That&#x27;s how you end up with a north korea.<p>According to every report I&#x27;ve seen, Iran was fully respecting their part of the deal, and allowing all the inspection necessary, when the USA did a &quot;AHAH ! it&#x27;s a trap !&quot; trick on them and screwed them. You&#x27;re not convincing countries to behave, you&#x27;re telling them that if they don&#x27;t behave, they better go all the way to the other side.')
