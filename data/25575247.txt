If the government wants to control the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, it can do well by addressing the root causes of health problems rather than structuring creative contracts with healthcare providers and pharmaceuticals.

Obese Americans create billions of dollars of financial opportunity.  Think about the financial losses that people would experience if the mind and habits of every American were to change today.  Healthcare, pharmaceutical, insurance, finance, food, academia, government agencies and administration -- all have a stake in keeping America the way it is.<p>Just as America is focusing resources on a Green New Deal, so too does it need to focus on a Lean New Deal.
