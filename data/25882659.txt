There is no way to turn off an API like this without guaranteeing not to introduce breakage. Even for a well behaved client that has enough foresight to anticipates API deprecation.<p>You only get the specified headers AFTER calling the API endpoint.<p>So for example if a device sits in a drawer for a year, then calls the API your response is undefined if the API has been turned off. No chance to get the date beforehand.<p>The way I handled situations like this is to explicitly make &#x27;turned off&#x27; part of every single API response.<p>Something like APIResponse = SpecificResponseForEndpoint | TurnedOff<p>That way API interactions are always well defined, clients can implement a global handler that does the appropriate thing, locking the client in a &#x27;please update&#x27; state if it is an in house developed app for example.<p>For HTTP I usually reserve the 410 status code for that since it usually does not collide with the more common 404.')
