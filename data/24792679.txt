The OP provided what looks like google service notification on his mobile, but could be on desktop (thanks to reply for noticing this). Second, after escalating the issue internally, decided to email (internally) people saying this is an attack on his family. He is also publicly looking for a job. This seems like a severe overreaction for a google account ban... I think there is reasonable doubt here to suspect something is wrong here more than &quot;Google decided to arbitrarily ban a specific account among billions in order to target one of their employees.&quot;')
