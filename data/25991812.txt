Solution manuals and test banks have freely existed on the internet for <i>years</i>. Every semester when they start their new classes, they know whether or not their students can cheat on the problem sets and tests that they plan to assign, but they throw up their hands and claim that if cheating is to occur, the students are to blame for lacking integrity.<p>Professors should look at the incentives for students and the stakes involved (GPA -&gt; internship, GPA -&gt; grad school, GPA -&gt; future earnings) and realize that if there&#x27;s an opportunity to cheat, some percentage of students are going to take it. And in fact, it&#x27;s probably a wise decision. Professors like to say, &quot;If you&#x27;re cheating, you&#x27;re only hurting yourself,&quot; but that&#x27;s total bullshit. If you&#x27;re cheating, you&#x27;re hurting other people. In a world where classes are curved, it&#x27;s a zero sum game, and from a game-theory perspective it might make sense to cheat even if you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. Once 20%-30% of the class is cheating, you&#x27;re really just hurting yourself if you&#x27;re <i>not</i> cheating.<p>I never cheated in school, and that&#x27;s a nice little feather in my cap, but if I could do it again, I probably would have.')
