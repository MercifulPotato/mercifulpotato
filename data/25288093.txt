Some species of fungus have been observed extracting energy from gamma radiation.  While incredible, it&#x27;s roughly similar in principle to the way plants extract energy from visible light.  The fungus isn&#x27;t breaking those radioactive isotopes down into stable isotopes, it&#x27;s just basking in the glow.  Maybe this could have some positive benefits for others, if perhaps layers of fungus grew around radioactive particles, thus somewhat shielding them, but this is a far cry from what the popsci headlines seem to suggest.')
