Natural gas is most certainly flammable once it&#x27;s vaporized (it would be a very poor fuel if it wasn&#x27;t), but there&#x27;s a big difference between something being flammable and something being explosive. If you have a big leaking tank, it is very likely that it will catch fire, and no one really wants a big raging fire in a residential area, but that fire will only burn at the leak where fuel and air are mixing. It&#x27;s very difficult out in the open to form cloud of natural gas and air with a uniform mixture such that it can all burn at the same time, and even then the flame front is too slow to cause a damaging explosion.<p>I would also note that the engineer&#x27;s use of informal language here is clearly alarmist.')
