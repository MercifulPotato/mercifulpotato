Thanks for clarifying and correcting me.<p>I possibly have some sympathy with the anti-NAT view taken at the time, even if it ended up being the wrong thing to do it hindsight. Adding more mandatory complexity to implementors would have harmed adoption rates, and I&#x27;ve seen some weird edge cases with NAT64 - it&#x27;s not necessarily a trivial thing to implement correctly.')
