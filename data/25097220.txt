This rears its head when I read something about a women in tech having a technical problem and assume it&#x27;s because of their skill level before knowing anything about them, and it&#x27;s done in a way that is beyond what I would assume about a man.  It&#x27;s ingrained, but I have noticed it, and try to specifically correct for it now.  I would like to think it&#x27;s made little or no difference in my interactions with women in tech because a) they have been extremely infrequent, and b) I try to not let my assessment of someone&#x27;s skill affect how I treat them.  That&#x27;s probably optimistic of me though.  I don&#x27;t exactly feel shame about this, it&#x27;s a natural part of being human.  We have biases, we can either try to find them and acknowledge and&#x2F;or try to work on them, or just live with them.<p>So what you have here is a very specific counter-example, of someone on the other side saying concretely it has happened at least for once.  I doubt I&#x27;m unique in this.  Most people have biases about all sorts of groups, that come out in large and small ways.  Maybe you don&#x27;t, or your biases are so small it&#x27;s hard to note them.  Forgive me if I think that&#x27;s unlikely, and you have many biases for many different types of people, as everyone does, and as I do for in many other ways I&#x27;m not aware of, I&#x27;m sure.<p>I imagine the other side of this probably feels like people judging you for being underdressed ata  group function at all times, no matter how much effort you put into it.  People are going to make assumptions if you&#x27;re the only person in jeans and a t-shirt at a group function of people in suits, and you&#x27;ll have to prove yourself all the time to overcome people&#x27;s initial assumptions.  My guess is that for women in tech, life is like a bunch of that happening over and over again, unless they get a reputation that proceeds them.  That doesn&#x27;t seem overhyped to me at all, it seems pretty likely to me and a shitty thing to go through life dealing with.')
