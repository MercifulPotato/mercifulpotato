However, there isn&#x27;t a word said about this on CNN, MSNBC or any other heavily left-leaning media sources. The only sources that I hear talking about this are on YouTube. I don&#x27;t give a shit if I get downvoted for saying this, but when the damn Atlanta news channel says there are uncounted votes how the hell does the left not take an issue with this? My goodness, this is the beginnings of a banana republic.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ajc.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;recount-finds-thousands-of-georgia-votes-missing-from-initial-counts&#x2F;ERDRNXPH3REQTM4SOINPSEP72M&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ajc.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;recount-finds-thousands-of-geor...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsbtv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;another-georgia-county-has-uncovered-2700-missing-votes-secretary-states-office-says&#x2F;5W734FA755CK3NCR4P7A27DXVM&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsbtv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;another-georgia-county-h...</a>')
