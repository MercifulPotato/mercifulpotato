But if they filed a claim under the CFAA without ever sending a cease and desist letter to the alleged intruder, I think the claim would be dismissed.<p>Is simply changing TOS enough for a CFAA claim to have a reasonable chance of success.  I could be wrong, but I believe for every CFAA claim we have seen so far based on &quot;scraping&quot;, there was some notice to stop directed <i>specifically at the respondent</i>.  If someone thinks just changing TOS (public notice) is enough for a CFAA claim to survive a Motion to Dismiss and there is no need to also contact the alleged offender asking them to stop, then let&#x27;s hear about the precedent that supports that idea.  I do not think there is any such precedent, but I could be wrong.')
