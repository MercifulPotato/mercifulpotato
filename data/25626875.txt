Dispatch looks like:<p><pre><code>  goto *(void const *) *virtual_pc_in_register;\n</code></pre>\nThat gets translated to an indirect jump. There&#x27;s no lookup in a dispatch table but that&#x27;s still an indirect branch.<p>This is actually marginally better than LuaJIT which does jump * (dispatch_table + *virtual_pc_in_register) but LuaJIT does this so it can swap the dispatch tables to switch to trace recording.')
