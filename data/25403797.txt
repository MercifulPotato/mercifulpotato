Take the logging example above and say you&#x27;re using the Elastic Stack. Things are going pretty well and usage is increasing. Over time your system grows and logging is now present in all of your applications. You&#x27;ve seen your logging rate go from 100 logs&#x2F;s, to 1,000 logs&#x2F;s, to 10,000 logs&#x2F;s and now are encroaching the 100,000 logs&#x2F;s rate. Over time the amount it cost to host your ES cluster has surely gone up. You probably went from a single node cluster when developing the solution, to a multi-node cluster, to now a hot-warm-cold cluster with several more nodes than you originally had. You also have a dedicated team making sure your in-house logging solution is working and stable. The cost of ownership and maintenance of this system is real. Not only do you need to pay for the huge clusters you&#x27;ll likely have a dedicated team supporting it. Most people I&#x27;ve talked to in the industry don&#x27;t like maintaining their in-house logging solutions and would gladly pay for one if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that it was too expensive to switch then. Because you need specialized people that know this logging solution it&#x27;s also hard to hire for this role when the person currently maintaining this system eventually leaves (because he doesn&#x27;t want to do this anymore). At the end of the day it&#x27;s cheaper to pay for a logging solution even if it&#x27;s in the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year than it is to build your own.')
