I worked at one for five years, and the recruiters often refused to look at candidates who didn&#x27;t come from top schools (whatever the fuck those are).<p>I also remember trying to hire a really brilliant candidate and when our director heard about her, the only thing he cared about was what school she had gone to. Fortunately for her, she&#x27;d gone to Oxford.<p>A few years later my boss had a big fight with recruiting and hired candidates on the basis of experience and ability. They were some of the most successful candidates we had ever brought in, and would never have been looked at by the standard recruiting loop.<p>So, ime the same status games play out in tech companies.')
