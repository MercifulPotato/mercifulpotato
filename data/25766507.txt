Another way is to see them as a modularization tool since they abstract most of the machine away while being much lighter weight than a VM.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been looking into containerizing my personal server. I use the cheapest VM on AWS (I work on Azure now, but vendor lock in is real). Adding another VM would double my costs, but with containers I would more isolation and can upgrade sites I run on this server independently.<p>I usually use sqlite, but I can see why containers would be nice for similar reasons. Even if you aren&#x27;t resource constrained with VMs, running a DB via containers might be nice to ensure a consistent dev setup even if you don&#x27;t use containers in prod.')
