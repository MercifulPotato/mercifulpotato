Item(by='haburka', descendants=None, kids=[25492427], score=None, time=1608490940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25488443, text='TS seems like a great choice syntactically for WASM because it’s familiar to developers who are writing WASM, ie frontend programmers. Compared to rust WASM, this seems to be much better for on boarding.<p>However, because it’s not actually compiling to JavaScript like typescript is normally, this means there must be quirks and differences that must be understood to solve harder problems. Depending on how friendly the compiler is, this can be very painful or intuitive.<p>I’m guessing it’s infeasible to compile TS to WASM since they’re targeting very different outputs - a ahead of time, dynamic weakly typed scripting language can’t possibly be compatible with an ahead of time, strongly typed, binary output.<p>And if someone tells you it is, I suspect they’re doing a lot of magic that’s hiding problems that only become obvious after writing nontrivial programs.')
