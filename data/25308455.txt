CoD (Modern Warfare), Halo (Reach), CS&#x2F;CS:S&#x2F;CS:GO mainly, and lately Valorant. Of all the games to do it, I think Counter Strike gets it <i>the most</i> correct. Cheating aside, the amount of play modes and available in CS has always been perfect for dropping yourself exactly where you want to play for these reasons:<p>1) 2v2, 5v5, 10v10 Casual, Battle Royale, Deathmatch all available natively in the game, on Valve servers.<p>5v5 Competitive is CS&#x27;S only &quot;Ranked&quot; mode. Wingman (2v2) and Danger Zone (Battle Royale) have ranks but I find they&#x27;re pretty elastic in their MM.<p>2) The ability to run Community Servers with custom code... e.g. Surf maps, KZ (Platforming) maps, Retakes (now native in the new Operation), Executes, regular DM, FFA DM, XvX casual games.)<p>These servers are player-owned, player-maintained, and strictly &quot;unranked&quot;.<p>3) ESEA&#x2F;Faceit&#x2F;et al. Pick up games for players who want to pay for better anti-cheat, tighter SBMM, and generally a lower skill floor. Also, &quot;pug&quot;s tend to -- more or less -- follow the rules in place for the pro circuit.<p>The fact that CS gives players the ability to &quot;graduate&quot; out of their SBMM and move into a pro&#x2F;am competitive environment <i>OR</i> join a community server and play Zombie Mode <i>OR</i> relax for an hour surfing <i>OR</i> play a baseline ranked match is something that has allowed the game to endure so well. If I could suggest one thing to CoD, Valorant, Halo, and any other &quot;competitive&quot; game it would be support community and 3rd-party servers!<p>EDIT: By the way, SBMM leads to one annoying issue not touched upon in the article. Smurfing. Often, due to SBMM, a high skilled player can&#x27;t play with their lower skilled friends. That sucks. Or, if I just want to ruin SBMM for 9 other people, I can simply make a new account, throw a couple games, get ranked low on purpose and then frag out. Smurfs are actually the glaring problem with SBMM, IMO.')
