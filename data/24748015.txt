And instead of using &quot;privacy&quot; as a proxy for those concerns, we should rather address the actual issue and concerns we have with the power we give to individuals without accountability and oversight.<p>Like why isn&#x27;t the debate here revolving around the suggestion that we need to have processes, and super-secure, open and cryptographically secure audit of all government actions so that government &quot;privacy&quot; violations are immediately caught and addressed? Instead, we&#x27;re asking <i>government</i> to solve some arbitrary problem called &quot;privacy&quot; because we think it&#x27;ll prevent potential <i>government</i> abuse in the future?')
