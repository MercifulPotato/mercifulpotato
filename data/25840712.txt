Famously people moved out of r&#x2F;marijuana to r&#x2F;trees because they had issues with the mod.<p>This was subreddit splitting&#x2F;budding. Which has stopped because of automation.<p>Thats the tradeoff. Automation allows you to moderate and stop the hate speech.<p>It also means you can stop people from using the name of the new sub, so discovery is stalled.<p>So even your solution won&#x27;t stop it, because we can&#x27;t survive without automod.<p>Enjoy!')
