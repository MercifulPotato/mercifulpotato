This takes extra glass and can degrade image quality.<p>If you could have a sensor with the correct curvature for the focal length of the lens, you don&#x27;t need to correct field curvature anymore, which means that you need less glass and have higher quality.<p>If you have the wrong curvature for the focal length, some field correction will still be required, which defeats the advantage.<p>In the real world, it&#x27;s even more than just focal length that changes the required curvature.')
