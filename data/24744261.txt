Sales people don&#x27;t like to talk about it, it clashes badly with the &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;, &quot;always be closing&quot; and &quot;I want to get my commission&quot; ethos that drives sales people and teams. But it is very real and very important.<p>If you get the wrong customers unnaturally far up your filter you will burn your budget trying to do conversions that can never, ever really happen.<p>Everyone is happy - you have interested new big customers. They may even buy a taste.<p>They want what you have sold them.<p>They think you understand their needs - and you do.<p>But your product won&#x27;t meet them.<p>Eventually they realise this, they are then gone and they won&#x27;t come back because now not only do they know your stuff doesn&#x27;t really help, but they don&#x27;t trust a word that comes out of your mouths.<p>As far as sales are concerned this is somewhere between a natural disaster and the engineering teams fault. There may even be some truth in the later but - perhaps the product could have been pivoted and focused on what the customer really wanted - but while ppt decks can be changed and honed every 3 hours software products have a hellva more inertia, and it&#x27;s all too late now.<p>Meanwhile the clock is ticking.<p>Your sales <i>must</i> cleave true to the reality of what you can deliver, you must feed information back into engineering and delivery, but if the customers aren&#x27;t buying what you can deliver find new customers.<p>The exception is obviously if you are looking to convince investors that you are for real and getting some interest will open you for more funding - but that&#x27;s also fraught with problems too as every ful kno.')
