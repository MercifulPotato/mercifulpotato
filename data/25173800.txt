So that&#x27;s any Windows PC in the last 11 years can still get an OS with security updates. And of course, you can always install Linux on a Windows PC.<p>The Apple side doesn&#x27;t go quite as far back, but still most 2012 macs can install Catalina which will be supported until 2022. And Linux is pretty well supported on the non-T2 macs (pre-2015) as well.')
