The emphasis is generally not so much on the new construction rate but rather on the level of investment in public goods. While some of them cling to a so called authenticity of the neighborhood, and seems to like when garbage is not collected and cars everywhere prevent to enjoy public space a its fullest, there is still a good point to be made that when there&#x27;s public investment in public goods, rents rise and people move away. (Lucky me I leave in a weird house nobody wants to live in, so I get to stay on my cheap island in a now unaffordable neighbourhood and get to enjoy the beautiful new square garden). Another good point to be made is that a lot of cities are actively campaigning for gentrification and it is not always the result of the so called free hand of the market.')
