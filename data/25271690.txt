I really like this. You really have to either care about others, or to be willing to invest sustained energy over time to thoroughly counterfeit that social signal, but  either way, it&#x27;s probably a delight to get that kind of thoughtful gift.<p>On the other hand, the gifts I treasure the most are totally useless.<p>One of my dance partners got me this god-awful pink apron, and it is, and by a wide margin, the single ugliest thing I own.<p>It is also thin enough to act, less as a barrier to staining liquids, and more as a sort of a specialized grease-distribution device, ensuring that an oil splash will cover more of whatever I happen to be wearing than would be possible via direct impingement.<p>But the thought behind that apron demonstrated a very deep friendship, and I have yet to find something suitably hideous to give in return.')
