It lets me do direct deposit and automatic withrdrawals from a single account, while earning savings account interest. The interest isn&#x27;t significant at the moment, but it was nice for a few months, before COVID. I use Mint and Personal Capital for monitoring my budget, rather than earmarking funds.')
