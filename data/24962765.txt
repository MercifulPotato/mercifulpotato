Still predominantly two address, RMW instructions for instance.  Very similar to the original 8086&#x27;s microcode structure rather than some reaction to the RISC movement, despite the common trope to state the contrary.<p>Can&#x27;t wait to see more information about the goldmont microcode work to see if that holds for intel as well as it does for AMD.')
