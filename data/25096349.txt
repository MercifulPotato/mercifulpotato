Making a good product (in the sense that it&#x27;s successful in the market) is what you want a company to do, but that&#x27;s the thing mostly aligned with the profit incentive.<p>If profits are taxed heavily then spending resources on making a better product so that more people buy it doesn&#x27;t make you a lot more money, but spending resources on office politics brings non-monetary personal benefits like status and control, so managers would have a greater relative incentive to do those things. See e.g. Soviet Union.<p>One of the biggest problems today is actually that the tax code provides incentives for corporations to retain profits within the organization rather than paying them out to shareholders to invest in something else, which results in inefficient corporate bloating.')
