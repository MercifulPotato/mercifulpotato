This, however, relies on private APIs. We haven&#x27;t made them public yet, because not many folks are building hello world apps, but in the future we&#x27;ll be exploring how to reduce the footprints of the framework even further for smaller apps.<p>This answer doesn&#x27;t quite cut it. Every project starts out as an &quot;hello world&quot; type application. How do you audit the cost of each additional package if you didn&#x27;t even start out with a &quot;small bundle size&quot; from the beginning?<p>I believe you guys have made great strides and I appreciate your efforts immensely. I wish you the best of luck, I hope you&#x27;re able to actually address the large size of deployment in a meaningful fashion.')
