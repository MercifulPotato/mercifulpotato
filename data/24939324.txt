The easiest way to find authentic Chinese food and Asian food in the Bay Area is to look around a 99 Ranch market.  There&#x27;s one in Fremont, which I imagine is where you went, but there&#x27;s also one in Daly City, and one in Milpitas.<p>There are TONS of authentic Asian restaurants around each of those locations.  Like more than you can believe.  Unless you think that all the grandmas eating there are on a Saturday night or Sunday morning are all confused about what they&#x27;re eating.<p>(You can&#x27;t make a good Asian restaurant with ingredients from Costco or Safeway, so you have to follow the supplier ...)<p>What I will say is that if you are a &quot;tech person&quot; who lives in SF, it&#x27;s pretty hard to find an authentic Asian restaurant.  If you live in SOMA or the Mission, there is almost exclusively the over-sauced Americanized stuff that people here are mentioning.<p>You have to &quot;try&quot; -- the &quot;default&quot; is to eat bad Asian food.  It&#x27;s hard to get over to Geary St. on a weekday.  There&#x27;s stuff in Chinatown that is good, but honestly I&#x27;ve found it hard to sort through.<p>Another easy way is to tell is to see if there&#x27;s a whole fish on the menu... Americanized places won&#x27;t have that.<p>One surprising&#x2F;nice thing about the rise of the delivery apps is that it&#x27;s made some of the food from the western part of the city more accessible.  It opens up some different flavors&#x2F;cooking.')
