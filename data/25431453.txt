Aircraft pavement, specifically for aircraft hangars. One single comment was mentioned to me 8 hours prior... Involving aircraft hangar gravel or something, I never googled it, I never have even thought about such a product in my entire life. Yet there was the ad from a completely once in a lifetime conversation I had with someone. It&#x27;s too damn niche to be coincidence.<p>I was in shock when I saw it on Instagram on my brand new iPhone (switched from Android) which has all mic permissions off by default. So some &#x27;smart&#x27; device in their home must of heard us. Some advertiser somewhere must have my voice profile hooked up to my Instagram account by now and they somehow share it in an &quot;unidentified&quot; way.<p>Edit: We need further research into these &#x27;impossible&#x27; ads to see if devices from different software OS&#x27; and companies are listening and grabbing detail and showing ads based on what are supposed to be 100% private conversations.')
