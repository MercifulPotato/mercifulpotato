Outside of about the last seventy years (maybe less), prostitution and sex work were extremely common, and, compared with the modern era, basically not criminalized. I&#x27;m not aware of a body of research that demonstrates a causal relationship between the consumption of porn and any social ill. I&#x27;m also not sure if I feel like I&#x27;m in a position to decide if OnlyFans customers would be better off without that outlet.')
