They were similar to my dentist too, who had his office attached to his house.  They all lived miles apart.<p>They were a 60&#x27;s prefab house called a &quot;deck&quot; house.  My dad ended up buying one later with a large addition once my parents split.  They were pretty good, except the roofs which weren&#x27;t great for snow (pitch) and lacked insulation.  I helped replace one of those roofs and the lack of pitch made it easier to work on. (friends father was a civil engineer).<p>Pretty well made, considering, and the open layouts were pretty great.<p>prefab is around, just a niche.<p>A check of google, &quot;deck&quot; company still exist as a branch of a larger prefab house company:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deckhouse.com&#x2F;brand&#x2F;deck-house&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deckhouse.com&#x2F;brand&#x2F;deck-house&#x2F;</a><p>photos of one:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernmass.com&#x2F;concord-deck-house&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernmass.com&#x2F;concord-deck-house&#x2F;</a>')
