Item(by='taxicab', descendants=None, kids=[24947689], score=None, time=1604094803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946776, text='I looked up your statistics and the reason there is nobody calling it out is because, first, that&#x27;s not the claim being made (the argument is that they earn far less than equivalently trained professions which is objectively true no matter how you dice it) and, second, teachers really are paid less on a per hour basis than the OECD average which makes your statistic super misleading.  In fact, the gap in lifetime earnings compared with other countries gets even bigger when you account for their lower starting salaries as well as lower total compensation (including benefits).  Ironically, this is a great example of the system working and not propagating partisan &quot;alternative facts&quot; like what you want.<p>It&#x27;s all projection.  You just can&#x27;t imagine people adding reasonable context to contentious information because you know that if you were in that position that you would abuse it like with your misleading teacher claim.  Nobody is out to get you and no you are not a victim of some sort of liberal conspiracy.  It won&#x27;t hurt you if you get an occasional dose of reality injected back into your brain if you decide to browse the Wayback Machine during the next Fox News commercial break.')
