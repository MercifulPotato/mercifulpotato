In the interest of “proving” Germany wasn’t the bad guys after all, these people won’t stop sowing doubt that it occurred, and that’s exactly how you would allow it to happen again.<p>The German democracy is designed to defend itself, and this is one of its tools.<p>Interestingly, the American sort of overzealous defense of freedom of speech no matter what misunderstands how freedoms need to work. Every freedom has its limits (you don’t have the freedom to kill someone for example), but they need to be well defined. That’s all.<p>&gt; The simple expression of an idea w&#x2F;o the intent to cause harm to another party, and the sole intention of discourse should be protected no matter what.<p>Right, but the thing is that simply voicing this supposed opinion does harm by invalidating the crime against millions of people. That’s the whole point.')
