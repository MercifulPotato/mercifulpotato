Every few years I&#x27;ll take some time to try and &quot;learn Linux&quot; by installing a distro and try to use it as part of my regular workflow. It&#x27;s always been a never ending train of very specific and obscure, time consuming issues. My personal motto for Linux is &quot;It Just Doesn&#x27;t Work&quot; (at least for desktop). Even basic stuff like Wi-Fi and the login screen often doesn&#x27;t work correctly and requires more tweaking. Using MacOS, it&#x27;s different and you have to get used to things. But it&#x27;s not an bottomless pit of time sunk into fixing configurations. Windows isn&#x27;t perfect, but at least I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting my time.<p>To be fair I don&#x27;t think Linux is bad (obviously or it wouldn&#x27;t be widely used), just that those who like it, either enjoy solving these issues or started with it during a time when they could spare the effort, and so they built up enough experience for it to no longer be a chore.<p>&gt;I did get one of those telemetry killer apps<p>Which one do you use?')
