In actual feudalism, if you disagreed with the king he could <i>arbitrarily kill you or jail you.</i><p>Sure, corporations are lame and if you work for one you&#x27;re a cog in a machine, I agree it can suck. But it&#x27;s crazy to suggest that this somehow invalidates democracy.<p>The first job of a functioning government is to establish a monopoly on violence and prevent it from being used against the people. Sure there are times when modern democratic governments fail at this but they do a pretty good job of making sure that Jeff Bezos can&#x27;t literally murder his lowly serfs when they get out of line. He can take their jobs but he can&#x27;t take their lives and that&#x27;s a far cry from how things worked in the Inquisition.<p>When you make spurious claims like implying that we don&#x27;t live in a democracy, you&#x27;re dishonouring the millions of people throughout history who wrested power away from the kings and warlords of the past, bit by bit, and built a system which at least places a few limits on its most powerful members.')
