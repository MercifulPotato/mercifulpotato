If you tell me you identify &quot;Latinx&quot;, that&#x27;s the term I&#x27;ll use for you. I understand that it&#x27;s a serious and important term, for instance, for LGBT people. But that just makes Warren&#x27;s use of it all the goofier. When she talks about helping Latinx people, are we meant to infer that she&#x27;s specifically talking about LGBT people of Latin descent?')
