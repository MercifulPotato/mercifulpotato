One of my customers owns a small chain of pizza restaurants. One of the delivery apps kept hounding them to sign up, but they already offer delivery, so they repeatedly declined. Eventually the app listed them on the app without their permission, using their logo and everything, and set the prices lower than what it was sold for. Every time an order came in, someone from the app would call the store and place an order for pickup and then one of the drivers would pick it up.<p>Disgusting business practice.')
