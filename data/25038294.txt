It&#x27;s the right, as according to current American politics because that&#x27;s the context.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;points out that a political party or idea is not actual far left in the grand scheme of things&quot;</i><p>There is no &quot;grand scheme&quot; of things, you just picked a different context. Things would be different still if we went back to the Civil War or Ancient Greece.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;productive conversations with those people, that&#x27;s your choice. But say that, don&#x27;t claim they&#x27;re being disingenuous.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m asking simple questions that go unanswered. The only reasoning I received was that you want people to recognize a shift. But since you claimed that the shift was being &quot;ignored&quot; as marketing and propaganda, isn&#x27;t highlighting that shift effectively the same? I find it more so actually since politics changed naturally so it&#x27;s the activist position to claim what the parties &quot;really&quot; are based on a selection from the past.<p>And immigration refers to people, not trade. Clinton made this speech [1] in 1995, but if any Democrat made the same speech today they would be vilified. That shows the left hasn&#x27;t shifted to the right at all, they shifted even more to the left.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c-span.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;?c4804493&#x2F;user-clip-president-clinton-illegal-immigration-1995-sotu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c-span.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;?c4804493&#x2F;user-clip-president-c...</a>')
