OAuth is designed to broker token exchange between two services in a standards-compliant web browser. Apps have increasingly been getting around it by embedding browser shells in their own interface, making the process less transparent for the end user. This opens users to all kinds of phishing attacks (e.g. an app might show you a Google sign-in page which is actually hosted on their own server, or steal your credentials even if you are actually on google.com, or automatically click &quot;approve&quot; without any user feedback etc.)<p>Enforcing that OAuth is handled in a browser controlled directly by the OS is the right thing to do.')
