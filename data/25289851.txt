Look what&#x27;s doing Huawei lately: kicked out of Google Services, it&#x27;s a well established Phone maker, but it&#x27;s losing quotas really fast, because their alternative OS (still a fork of Android) doesn&#x27;t offer important applications to date (e.g. WhatsApp, Banking Apps, Payment Apps and so on), so I believe Microsoft was just crushed because developers weren&#x27;t attracted by the platform a the buyers weren&#x27;t interested.<p>The phones actually were pretty good.
