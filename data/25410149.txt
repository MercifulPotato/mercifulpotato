I&#x27;ve only ever known &quot;nation state&quot; to mean &quot;country&quot;, and suspect I&#x27;m in the majority. I don&#x27;t think most people use that term intentionally, because few countries would qualify. That list gets even shorter when you limit it to countries that might be antagonistic to the US, and even shorter when you get to those that are threats. In addition to your two examples, China certainly doesn&#x27;t qualify either, which basically just leaves North Korea.')
