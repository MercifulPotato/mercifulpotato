Standard Linux distributions still fail to boot on mainstream hardware several years after it was discovered that userspace requiring super random numbers from kernel to boot is a dumb idea.<p>Torvalds seems to understand this, but now there is only so much he can do.\nPoettering&#x27;s stance seems so oblivious (get a better hardware or fix from manufacturer), one wonders whether he should leave maintaining&#x2F;programming to people who actually care about users. It has been accepted standard for decades that software should work around bugs in hardware and it makes sense - it is much easier to change software than to fix hardware.<p>So glad my CPU does not have RDRAND and operating systems I use do not require super random numbers to boot.')
