We have enough people to click buttons in RDS. We don&#x27;t have enough to mess around with replication, backups, etc. The cost isn&#x27;t just for the hardware, but the services that we&#x27;d otherwise have to hire someone to do.<p>I used to work at a place that would borrow hardware from one client in order to handle the load on another. It was for seasonal stuff, a few days a year when we knew someone would melt down if they didn&#x27;t have double or triple the capacity, but they didn&#x27;t need it the rest of the year.<p>Now I deal in auto scale groups and don&#x27;t care how many servers we use or need as long as it isn&#x27;t wasteful. &quot;Hardware&quot; that isn&#x27;t ours is so easy to swap out, try a different size or scale that is hate to go back to metal.')
