Not only do even cheap smartphone cameras perform better than the best webcams in typical indoor lighting conditions, but for example the &quot;good&quot; webcam everyone uses - the Logitech C920 - has a dodgy autoexposure algorithm that overexposes shots if people do use enough lighting, and the manual controls are apparently really buggy. Professional streamers mostly just seem to have gotten used to working around this. (Then there&#x27;s the colour accuracy and autofocus issues, which everyone just puts up with.)')
