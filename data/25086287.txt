You can find a decent one for ~$400 USD, and a 1080p or WQHD screen for another $100.<p>As for screen availability, I think it&#x27;s more to do with the fact that these are business computers. Lenovo only recently started blurring the line between their premium and business class devices.<p>I think every post-Haswell ThinkPad comes with a 720p screen  in it&#x27;s default configuration. At least up until Tx90&#x2F;5 series.')
