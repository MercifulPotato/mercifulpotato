As an interviewer, the difference is between junior and senior developers. It&#x27;s an indication that they they understand the currency and some metrics for an area&#x2F;business, but more than that, it sets out their position.<p>That position is something I should be challenging in the interview with questions to probe deeper:<p>* Can you tell more about the GraphQL API? Was this new or replacing an API? Tell me about the constraints and goals you were working towards?<p>* What issues did you have getting to that level of performance? What trade-offs did you make when you hit issues?<p>* What are the challenges with running your API in production?<p>* Can the API you implemented scale higher? If so, what would need to be changed with it as you scale to 400 and 1200 queries per second?<p>If this person has done the work this should be a good discussion and you can start to bring in some of your business or technical problems. It will be very evident whether someone has just invented metrics, or the statement is describing the work of others.<p>I feel it&#x27;s important for technical interviewers to have some experience with STAR&#x2F;behavioral interviewing. This assists with screening&#x2F;selecting resumes and exploring these areas in interviews.')
