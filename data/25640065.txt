The &quot;contract&quot; between the employee and the employer is that the employee does what the employer asks of them, and in return gets paid for his work. If these employees do not desire to work on projects that Google is getting, then they should terminate the contract and find work elsewhere.<p>So, Actually. That&#x27;s exactly what they signed up for.<p>It is bonkers to me that a employee does not work on what the employee wants to work on, within a company, and yet also expects the employer to keep paying them.<p>This honestly sounds like so much privilege. These workers are top 1% of the world, it sounds like &quot;whining&quot; when you are not in their position.')
