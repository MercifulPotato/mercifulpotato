Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25103318], score=None, time=1605458417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102310, text='&gt; I find it interesting you choose this as an example, and not rather say that &quot;Fred the Farmboy&quot; might actually see those &quot;librul coastal elites&quot; or &quot;ivory tower intellectuals&quot; as people like himself.<p>I wonder, if he had instead chosen your example, would you no longer have found it interesting, but <i>other</i> people would then have found his new comment interesting (who did not find the one he made here interesting).<p>Abstractly, it is quite interesting what humans find to be interesting, and how that interest level can be so easily inverted by simply injecting of new values into various seemingly innocuous variables.<p>Well, I find it interesting anyways.  But most other people I&#x27;ve encountered seem to kind of consider such topics to be....~&quot;not appropriate for discussion in polite company&quot;, in that they often have strong negative reactions to the very idea, if not outright demanding that you cease engaging in discussion of such topics (&quot;starting flame wars&quot; is the formal terminology used during Overton Window enforcement) - and if you do not, they themselves will disengage from discussing the topic (while maintaining  an air of <i>extreme</i> confidence and certainty in their alternative ideas).  &quot;Gaslighting&quot;, &quot;whataboutism&quot;, &quot;gish galloping&quot;, etc are some of the most common rhetorical accusations that I have experienced in my journeys (if any are  given at all that is).')
