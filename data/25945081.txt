Plain and simple.<p>Yes I do know that this is your viewpoint - thank you for repeating it. But, as I also repeatedly said, I have a hard time seeing it because, well, the resolution does in fact not explicitly ban (E2E) encryption.<p>So can you please help convince me and fellow ignorami by providing a link or two? Is there maybe a statement by a council member? A proposal for the type of backdoor&#x2F;encryption type the council would like to see implemented?<p>I think something like that would really move the discussion forward.')
