Item(by='smarx007', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607394642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334246, text='Great news! How do I make it work? I just tried in our room <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;OSLC&#x2F;chat#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;OSLC&#x2F;chat#</a> and I still see the matrixbot. The post talks about how to connect another chat system to Matrix but there are no instructions for Gitter itself.<p>Edit: Okay, this is what should have been in the post: go to Explore rooms, and instead of choosing Gitter, select Add new server and type &#x27;gitter.im&#x27;. Now you can find a room through a native integration.')
