Segmentation of ECC support was an Intel decision which other chip manufactures have copied to a greater or lesser extent. For what it&#x27;s worth, ECC support is spotty in Chinese-designed chips as well.<p>Intel&#x27;s decision could just as well have been made by a socialist government&#x27;s regulatory body (in the form of &quot;minimum requirements for consumer chip&quot; legislation), or by a committee of decision makers in an employee-owned company. We may never know, because we only have 2-4 data points and they&#x27;re all basically capitalist.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure it was intended to be a serious comment. It could just as easily have been &quot;...failure of human cognition and Obama.&quot;')
