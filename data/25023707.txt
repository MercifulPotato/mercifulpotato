Climate change is one of those areas. The climate has been changing since the Creation of the world.  God has promised that He will give us seasons and the ability to plant and reap for as long as the earth remains. (Genesis 8:22). That doesn&#x27;t mean the climate won&#x27;t change, maybe it will be bad for some parts of the world and good for others.  But I do know we have God&#x27;s promise for seasons and He has kept that promise every year for over 4300 years.  He&#x27;s not going to break His promise.  I&#x27;m also not saying we shouldn&#x27;t be good stewards of earth.  We need to  rule over it and take care of it.  But we don&#x27;t need to be worried about this planet becoming uninhabitable because of climate change, man made or natural.<p>Humananity is not defined by the ability to think. Even before the first thought the human embryo is not just a collection of cells.  It&#x27;s a distinct organism.  It is dependent on the mother but those cells are independent in the sense that it directs itself on how to form. If you could remove an embryo from the womb and give it a good environment and nutrients it would form just the same. The unborn baby isn&#x27;t slowly assembled out of parts to make a whole, the embryo is already functioning, it&#x27;s a distinct human life.  It is already human.  If you define humanity by thought would you say a 3 year old is less human than a 10 year because their thoughts are less complex?  What about when you&#x27;re sleeping, are you less human when you&#x27;re unconscious?  Humanity is also not defined by it&#x27;s viability.  Is a wounded soldier who will die without life support all of a sudden less human or less valuable because his life depends on an outside source?<p>The embryo is a distinct human being that can direct it&#x27;s own formation.  It is separate from the mother&#x27;s cells.  And that is why it is a human life.')
