People don&#x27;t like it when some guy in suspenders makes a lot of money on his computer in a downtown office, but they really hate it when some schmuck down the street makes some money in a pretty much identical fashion. It&#x27;s a class thing. It also goes against some kind of superficial common knowledge about the markets. If your cab driver (or local reddit goon) starts getting into the markets, you&#x27;re supposed to get out and let the bubble boil over.
