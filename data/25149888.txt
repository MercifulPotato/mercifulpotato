But this is it.<p>They&#x27;re not fun, they&#x27;re a targeted level up system designed to be just hard enough to keep you from breezing through (until you die two or three times and can watch an ad to get a bigger gun), with level progression just slow enough to make you want to pay for experience.<p>They&#x27;re not fun. Commander Keen and Leisure Suit Larry and Doom and Deathtrack and Hexen and The Lost Vikings and System Shock 2 and those kind of games were fun. I thought it might just be because I&#x27;m 35-45 years old and am being very &#x27;get off my lawn&#x27; about it.<p>But that&#x27;s not it. Those games were designed to sell because they were fun. New games, especially mobile games, are designed to be free and addicting enough to get you to spend real money.')
