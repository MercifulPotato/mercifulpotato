This isn’t shocking, and there were bound to be hiccups on the fringes of the rules like this.<p>If you want a phone for just getting the normal stuff done in a curated world, then pick iOS as that’s what they are trying to do.  If you want a phone&#x2F;device that is wide open to play with, extend, and hack on in a basically open manner, then pick Android as that’s what they are trying to do.<p>What seems like a waste of time is to pick one side and then complain about it not being enough like the other side.  Pick your flavor, the world offers both.  And then quit whining if the other side is more successful by some metric... Make your chosen side better or switch.')
