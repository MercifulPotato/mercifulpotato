Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24849499, 24849593], score=None, time=1603298094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849225, text='I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s actually the root of the disagreement though, because the behavior of large tech companies cause both types of harm. If Google makes life difficult for competing app stores by preventing them from installing app updates on non-rooted phones while reserving that privilege to itself, that obviously harms competing app stores, but it also harms the app developers who are the customers of the app stores (and then have to pay 30% to Google for lack of any other viable alternative), and the app users who suffer when apps they&#x27;d have wanted cease to exist or have to raise prices against a monopolist extracting a 30% tax.<p>The major disagreement, instead, seems to be from the people taking the position that a corporation can&#x27;t monopolize a market by intentionally isolating it. They want to claim that Google Play doesn&#x27;t have an effective monopoly for Android apps, even though it has something like 90+% of the Android app market, because the iOS app store exists, even though you can&#x27;t actually use it to distribute apps to Android devices.<p>Whether that&#x27;s the case under the law is something the courts will have to decide, but the harm to consumers is transparent. It creates an insurmountable barrier to creating a major app store competitor, because a challenger would have to establish a major <i>phone platform</i> in order to do it, and the resulting suppression of competition gives the incumbents market power and leads to higher prices. And also prevents the two incumbent app stores from having to even compete with each other.')
