I&#x27;m not Indian but rather Bangladeshi (the low-caste Indians who converted to Islam to get out of the caste system, lol). And I&#x27;ve met the occasional proud Brahmin, but in decades of living here I&#x27;ve never heard of caste discrimination being some sort of systemic thing. And yet I&#x27;ve seen like dozens of articles on this all of the sudden.<p>I&#x27;m not endorsing the idea of &quot;isolated incidents&quot; in general! But you can look at data to show that disparities in how certain groups are treated--e.g. employers being less willing to call back candidates with &quot;Black&quot; names on their resume. But extrapolating from the Cisco lawsuit to a narrative about a larger problem in Silicon Valley can have ugly consequences. It can be flipped around to broadly paint Indians who are in leadership positions in Silicon Valley in a bad light.')
