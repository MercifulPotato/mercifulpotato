I believe all of the MVP features have been sufficiently implemented and tested and a modest website and admin tool has been built up to support it.<p>So, I believe it&#x27;s ready for a wider audience to check out and provide feedback. Check it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;r4nkt.com<p>I&#x27;d love to hear any kind of constructive criticism on the website and the service itself. For those who are interested in trying it out for some time for free, let me know. We can get you set up and then I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences...good and bad.<p>Pricing is yet to be determined, but I&#x27;d love to hear peoples&#x27; thoughts on it, too.<p>So...I&#x27;m ready for more feedback...! Please be gentle. ;-)<p>Thanks...!  :-)<p>P.S. I&#x27;m still a newbie here...and it looks like I messed up my first post.  I hope this one&#x27;s better. ;-)')
