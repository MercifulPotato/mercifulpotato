They argument is that “the other side does it.”<p>There’s no doubt that there is motivated reasoning and bad arguments in the normal news.<p>But Fox uses that as an excuse to give up altogether and just double down.<p>America is where it is because Fox News paved the way. You couldn’t give them enough credit for what they achieved.')
