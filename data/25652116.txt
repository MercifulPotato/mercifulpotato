However there’s a question of what to do about this. You can’t sell a wireless device to someone in Ohio and expect it not to be used in New York City. And certain emergency frequencies might be rarely utilized but very important when used.<p>That said, I’d like to see more allocation of spectrum for consumer use. It’s very frustrating that cellular companies get more and more spectrum but we can’t feasibly deploy public LTE for example.<p>Perhaps if the wireless device has GPS and network connectivity we could give the government permission to enable and disable extra frequencies depending on location. Though of course this scheme invites suppression of dissent.')
