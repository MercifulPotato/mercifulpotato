The problem is that societies and cultures are heavily influenced and changed by communication, media, and art.<p>By replacing big portions of these components with artificial content, generated from previously created content, you run the risk of creating feedback cycles (e.g. train future systems from output of their predecessors) and forming standards (beauty, aesthetics,  morality, etc.) controlled by the entities that build, train, and filter the output of the AIs.<p>You&#x27;ll basically run the risk of killing individuality and diversity in culture and expression; consequences on society as a whole and individual behaviour are difficult to predict, but seeing how much power social media (an unprecedented phenomenon in human culture) have, there&#x27;s reason to at the very least be cautious about this.')
