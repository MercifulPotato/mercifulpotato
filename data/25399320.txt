In reality, you have a wide spectrum of people having varying degrees of suspicion about the current election. The goal isn&#x27;t to convince all of them, but for enough of them to have reasonable confidence in the election to be willing to accept it and reject the positions of those who want to escalate things with the belief it was fraudulent. Polling implies there is a wide gulf to bridge, with moderates having extreme doubt in the result. This is unsustainable.<p>I would imagine to actually get to that point there are really only a few simple steps needed: full forensic audits of the disputed states, as well as a day in court in SCOTUS. I believe so far those have been largely denied or blocked (the merits of doing so are irrelevant) - if those were acquiesced by the winning side and accelerated at the outset it seems highly likely to me we would be nowhere near the precipice it seems we are now.')
