The &quot;from what I understand&quot; refers to the time Melvin Capital closed their position, not the overall fact that their short interest is closed.<p>The full quote from Sorkin&#x27;s segment, ~40 seconds into the video: &quot;Melvin Capital is now out of the stock. They got out of the stock, from what I understand, yesterday afternoon.&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cnbc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354406938319216640" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cnbc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354406938319216640</a>). It could not be more clear -- &quot;from what I understand&quot; refers to the precise timing and not the overall fact.<p>&gt; The claim that Melvin closed their position is something of a game of &quot;telephone&quot; in that it was a CNBC anchor that claimed that &quot;from what I understand&quot; Melvin Capital is out of the stock, after he talked to the CEO (off camera).<p>That&#x27;s not a game of telephone, that&#x27;s quoting a direct source. Sorkin talked to the CEO of Melvin Capital right before he went on air and then immediately reported it.<p>&gt; just a journalist claiming a source said something<p>And it&#x27;s not &quot;some CNBC anchor,&quot; it&#x27;s a well known journalist (Andrew Ross Sorkin) with a reputation at stake.<p>&gt; All of the other stories about the claim simply state &quot;according to CNBC&quot;.<p>Because CNBC got the scoop. It&#x27;s journalistic etiquette!<p>&gt; no recording of the conversation, just a journalist claiming a source said something<p>Every single article published in any newspaper ever is a journalist claiming a source said something.<p>&gt; Melvin themselves have not (as far as I can see) issued any kind of statement, written or otherwise, that clearly states they have zero position on GME any more.<p>The CEO of Melvin Capital calling a prominent CNBC journalist counts as a statement, if you&#x27;re willing to put aside your rabid paranoia for a few minutes and think critically instead of conspiratorially.')
