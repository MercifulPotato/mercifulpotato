So your code will look weird:<p><pre><code>    p.x = p.getY() + p.z;\n    p.setY(p.x + p.z);\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s better to use more universal approach, so your code will look unified.<p>Another thing why getters&#x2F;setters are preferable is because when you need to replace field with computed value, you would need to replace all your code.<p>Proper approach would be to use properties which are available for every language but Java. They invented records, which somewhat fill that niche.')
