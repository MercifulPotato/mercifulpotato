The short squeeze had nothing to do with it. When I joined in I didn&#x27;t know what a short squeeze was, I read the thesis and it made sense to me, so much so, that I found additional paths based on observation that further increased GME&#x27;s odds of rebound.<p>The squeezing was not orchestrated by any single entity. WSB is not a collective, it is not a &#x27;group&#x27;, there are no hierarchies, nor master minds.<p>Here is how WSB operates:<p>A user does some due diligence (DD), and decides that X is a great investment opportunity because there is value (this is what DFV did). Any user is allowed to comment or refute said DD. In the end, none of it is financial advice, it is nothing more than, hey this is interesting take a look. All of this is based on public information that anyone and everyone is allowed to access. We don&#x27;t do insider trading like the politicians or HFs.<p>Then during the summer somebody realized that it was actually possible to achieve a short squeeze simply because certain companies overshorted the stock [2]. The user presented the thesis and again, anyone was allowed to refute or argue about it. Again, none is financial advice.<p>Over the next weeks people read more about it and decided that it was a good idea to join in, simply because Ryan Cohen went on board and there were some other catalysts as well.<p>While all of this was happening. WSB was vilified, ridiculed, attacked, and subject to FUD [3].<p>If you read anything about WSB from anyone. Assume you have been duped, and that includes my comment as well, see for yourselves [4,5]. All we do is literally bet on stocks based on publicly available information. The fact that the media has attacked and vilified the proletariat with nothing to lose instead of those with billions and everything to lose suggests there is more to the story than a bunch of fiscally irresponsible and self proclaimed retards and autists tanking the market [6,7,8,9].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gmedd.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gmedd.com</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;isthesqueezesquoze.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;isthesqueezesquoze.com&#x2F;</a> (includes numbers, read up)<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9auf5&#x2F;important_gme_short_attack_tactics_predicted_in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9auf5&#x2F;impo...</a><p>[4] reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets<p>Some examples of due diligence<p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;search&#x2F;?sort=top&amp;q=flair%3ADD&amp;restrict_sr=on" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;search&#x2F;?sort=top&amp;q=f...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;melvin-capital-lost-53-in-january-hurt-by-gamestop-and-other-bets-11612103117" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;melvin-capital-lost-53-in-janua...</a><p>Tin foil hat for this one:<p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l97ykd&#x2F;the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l97ykd&#x2F;the_...</a><p>A recap of the story by one of the og mods of WSB<p>[8] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzsprout.com&#x2F;1657678&#x2F;7585834" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzsprout.com&#x2F;1657678&#x2F;7585834</a><p>Bad day eh. \n[9] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9czx4&#x2F;this_is_what_covering_their_ass_looks_like&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9czx4&#x2F;this...</a><p>Some interesting reads, to see for yourselves:<p>WSB in a nutshell:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9c1ca&#x2F;wsb_in_a_nutshell&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9c1ca&#x2F;wsb_...</a><p>FOR EVERYONE THAT JUST JOINED BECAUSE OF $GME AND DONT KNOW WTF IS GOING ON:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9cz1k&#x2F;for_everyone_that_just_joined_because_of_gme_and&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9cz1k&#x2F;for_...</a><p>The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l97ykd&#x2F;the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l97ykd&#x2F;the_...</a><p>$GME price has nothing to do with fundamentals and everything to do with financial economics<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l6u96y&#x2F;gme_price_has_nothing_to_do_with_fundamentals_and&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l6u96y&#x2F;gme_...</a>')
