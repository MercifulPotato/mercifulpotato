The big split is between packaging formats (DEB and RPM [0]) and then there are package managers for that for that (apt* for DEBs and yum, dnf, zypper etc. for RPMs [1]). You could run a foreign package manager on any distro, there even exist ones for that purpose [2], but it&#x27;s ostensibly considered a defining feature for a distro.<p>[0] There are more of course, but those are the big two.<p>[1] I&#x27;m really only familiar with the Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu space (Deb)<p>[2] See flatpak, snap, and nix&#x2F;guix.
