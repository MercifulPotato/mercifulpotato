If you monitor the ping on the site you&#x27;ll likely see occasional jumps to 100-200ms every once in a while. These can cause irregularities in the rhythms but for the most part you can still make out the phrase even when there&#x27;s jitter. (I think this is kind of like how we can read those scrambled word sentences because we read not letter-by-letter, but word-by-word.)<p>For a jitterlesss demo you can also check out piano.jminjie.com (central server, not p2p), where I&#x27;ve introduced an artificial delay so that the notes can be snet with timing info, and scheduled ahead of time to avoid jitter.<p>Latency can also impede a smooth jamming experience, but seems to be manageable in general when it&#x27;s under 20ms one-way delay (I have been able to achieve this on a wired connection at 50 miles distance in the middle of the day). There&#x27;s also relationship between bpm of the song and acceptable latency similar to the concept behind sampling frequencies (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sampling_(signal_processing)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sampling_(signal_processing)</a>). The faster you&#x27;re playing, the more latency matters.')
