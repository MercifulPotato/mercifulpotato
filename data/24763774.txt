This is a myth. The most successful capitalist countries (in terms of average quality of life for all citizens) are those in which people have an altruistic mindset.<p>We also need to account for the evolutionary consequences of selecting for psychopathy. If everyone ends up becoming a psychopath and is entirely focused on capturing value for themselves, who is going to be left to actually create value?<p>Society would collapse into a lawless, violent, cannibalistic mess.<p>Society is held together by altruism. It can function with a small number of wolves at the top and many sheeps at the bottom. But in a world with only wolves, the wolves start eating each other.<p>Wolves are only useful for population control, not value creation.<p>That said, society doesn&#x27;t need to be made up of sheep and wolves (as is the current trend). We could select for balanced free-thinking individuals.')
