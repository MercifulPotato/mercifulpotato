I have Nikon Action Extreme 10x50 binoculars, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. You will have no trouble seeing the Messier objects with them. A good place to start would be with the ones that are visible to the naked eye, such as the Orion nebula (M41), the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), or the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules (M13). The Orion nebula is prominent in the eastern sky early in the evenings right now.')
