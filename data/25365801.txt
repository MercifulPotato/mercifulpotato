Item(by='SoSoRoCoCo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607550952, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362551, text='Prop 13 doesn&#x27;t allow taxes to grow at a rate commensurate with infrastructure, which is why so many counties in California are teaching out of &quot;temporary classrooms&quot; installed in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, except for the wealthy counties. For example: Folsom has a multi-million dollar highschool, but south sac has Luther Burbank, with aforementioned trailers.<p>Another problem is that many California counties subsidized suburban sprawl by not charging for utility hookups (like sewers). This put them in debt which caused them to encourage sprawl to balance the books, and some day someone will get left holding the bag, as is happening now.<p>California catered to the wealthy for decades and now they are having to pay the piper, so to speak.<p>This is what happens when you bend over backward for the super rich. I say good riddance, maybe California&#x27;s taxation policies will recover to something more equitable without the 0.1%ers fucking it all up.... Like lowering income tax and repealing prop 13.')
