The most boring job I had was also the one I was most happy with. The domain was simple business logic with very low complexity (simple functions, mostly if-else logic - some challenges in testing, though).<p>I&#x27;ve had two highly technical engineering&#x2F;math jobs, and while I loved the topic, I hated the job. Poor management, dysfunctional teams, rigid coworkers, etc. The last time I did a job hunt I explicitly did not make the problem domain a factor in the decision process.<p>It does make answering the &quot;Why are you excited about working on this project?&quot; a bit tougher, though.<p>Of course, let&#x27;s not get into false dichotomies. Because a job doesn&#x27;t sound interesting doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll enjoy it!')
