After seeing various listed preferences, matches, relationships, and so on, I began to do my own (amateur, although I did take rather a lot of statistics for my major) probes of trends.<p>First, you can take away the &quot;online&quot; component.  None of the trends OKCupid had blogged about (and were since deleted) were new to my experience.  Online magnifies trends through sheer numbers but that&#x27;s about it.<p>The men tended to make a lot of requests; the women tended not to.  Most of the men were rejected; most of the women were not.  Women tended to have more &quot;must haves&quot; than men.  And so on and so forth.<p>It was all very disheartening.<p>I wonder if I could still pry the data out of dBase III.')
