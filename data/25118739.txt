The fact that they choose not to act against crime in certain cases in certain areas (and are extremely likely to act brutally against suspects <i>from</i> those areas in other cases) is, actually, quite parallel to the problems that <i>underly</i> the defund&#x2F;abolish movements in the US.<p>But neither the defund nor even the abolish movements want there to be no law enforcement, they just want (in the defund cases) resources and peripheral responsibilities stripped from law enforcement agencies and given to more appropriate alternative agencies, or (in the abolish case) local community services, especially law enforcement, to be redesigned and radically restructured, with no 1:1 replacement for the existing main law enforcement agency (but, in virtually all cases, with the law enforcement <i>function</i> retained in new entities.)')
