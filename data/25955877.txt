The government doesn&#x27;t directly control or monitor most of the surveillance tools (google, telecoms, geoloc, &amp;c.), or at least not in most advanced countries. But it&#x27;s getting easier and easier for them to access these data and there will probably be less and less safeguards.<p>For example in France we&#x27;re in a permanent &quot;state of emergency&quot; since the attacks in 2015 (and now with covid), which grants more rights to the government&#x2F;police and let them bypass some legal safeguards for &quot;the greater good&quot; but of course it&#x27;s already being abused, not against terrorists, but against protesters, people squatting land to protest against projects that would have a negative impact on the environment (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zone_to_Defend" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zone_to_Defend</a>), &amp;c.')
