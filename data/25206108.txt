The room was about 3m by 2m.<p>When we found it, it was empty and had hooks on the ceiling with two power outlets.<p>We didn&#x27;t tell his parents and thought it was a &quot;cool&quot; after school hangout spot.<p>A few months later, we went back and a new shelf with weed plant cuttings was in the room. My buddy asked his dad and it turns out he had been growing a few weed plants hydroponically for the prior few years.')
