I have worked from home for decades in sw dev and pub, so I had the choice to smoke pot and I found it insulated me from what I didn&#x27;t like about how society is organised.  Like you, I found pot helped me to concentrate on work, and liberated me with creative endeavours, although managing it isn&#x27;t so simple as flicking a switch by any means.<p>I don&#x27;t have a family history of alcohol use - the opposite.  But I ran into endless legal problems 6 years ago when a major customer stiffed us for a lot of money, then 3 lawyers in a row exploited us while I was off caring full time for a relative.  All the money we were owed went to lawyers fees.  I ended up drinking just to get away from this awful feeling of being subjugated to injustice by the legal system.<p>Then 2 years ago, we sorted out the legal problems and I no longer had to dwell on it.  I stopped drinking for a while, but so much of my old life had disappeared, I was left with a void.  I was happier, but I started drinking again, happily.<p>After another year I just wanted to stop, but that was difficult.  It is hard to change habits, but not impossible.  I read about this subject, and learned some techniques, but my experiences taught me about the role that underlying stressors can play in the need for habits, which is why I asked you the question which you kindly responded to.<p>I actually quit everything 7 months ago, and soon noticed how much I love the clarity.  The sobriety is like a new drug.  I really dig it.<p>I do wonder how much the ayahuasca I imbibed in South America a few years ago has contributed to my newfound ability to appreciate sobriety, and to move on from my bad feelings about exploitative lawyers and my economic losses.  I don&#x27;t have any bitterness left.  It&#x27;s all reframed, by looking from outside myself.  My empathic abilities can be applied to the lawyers who cheated us in a way that enabled me to move on.  I can just see them as actors who did what they did in a way that isn&#x27;t personal to me, and let it go.')
