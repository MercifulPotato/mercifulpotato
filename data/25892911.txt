Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25893401], score=None, time=1611503046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892639, text='&gt; Wasn&#x27;t it the free market that led to situation that only few companies produce and research vaccines because of the low profit?<p>The free market seems to have done well into investing in mRNA vaccines which can be developed faster, safer, and more effectively than standard vaccines.<p>It took over a year for H1N1 vaccines to ramp up production back in 2009: and that was when we already had the infrastructure in place for flu shots. Today&#x27;s vaccines were developed faster and safer than just 10 years ago: especially since we&#x27;re looking at 90%+ efficacy rates.<p>Its not like mRNA was developed by Operation Warp Speed, that body of research was heavily invested thanks to free market principles. Operation Warp Speed decreased the time to mass production (by funding the last leg and also putting the vaccines on the top of the priority list for regulation). But the actual mRNA formula was developed very early in 2020. Most of 2020 was just testing for safety.<p>In fact: it was because of the years of investment into the SARS virus that these companies were able to quickly translate their SARS research into COVID19. Clearly, that&#x27;s a risky move as well as a very forward looking investment.<p>----------<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t expect most people to be &quot;correct&quot;. My first expectation is self-consistency. People are allowed to change their viewpoints over years, but the more someone sticks with a particular philosophy (both the goods and the bads of that philosophy), the more reasonable they seem.<p>Bill Gates has been preaching philanthro-capitalism for over a decade... at least, I&#x27;ve been following his discussions over it for at least that long. So there&#x27;s a reasonable level of consistency here.')
