The students were generally there for a decade plus, for violent crimes.<p>I would sit next to any of them for any length of time. They pose zero threat to anyone.<p>This is for two reasons:\n1. Generally, violent crimes are done by very young and poor people. By the time they get out of prison, they aren&#x27;t very young any more. If they have a good job, they aren&#x27;t poor either.\n2. If a prison lets someone in an educational program, you know the system considers them safe. The system buckets inmates; behavioral offenses are harshly penalized; everyone in a classroom is an angel, and they won&#x27;t stop being an angel on the outside.')
