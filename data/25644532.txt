It would be easier to write 500 word blurbs than a meaningful 50 words. I despise recipe sites for this reason. So much &quot;content&quot; gets in the way of the actual content. The recipes in my favorite cookbook are around 100 words on average, yet if they were published online, I doubt they would rank.')
