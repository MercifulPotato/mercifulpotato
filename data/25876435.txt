For the iPhone, the complaints were about cost, about lack of hardware keyboard, about fingerprints on the screen. People complained that it was less usable than existing phones for email, etc.<p>The M1 brings much better performance at much less power.<p>I think that&#x27;s a big deal and is a massive lift for what applications can do. I also think x86 cannot compete now and things will only get a lot worse as Apple&#x27;s chips get even better.')
