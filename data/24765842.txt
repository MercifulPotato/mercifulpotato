I wish LXDE (the Raspberry Pi default), LXQt and XFCE didn&#x27;t insist the Windows95 way of having separate buttons to launch and to minimize&#x2F;activate a running app (which feels untidy to me) is the only correct way. C&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s been a long since Windows 7 and Ubuntu Unity appeared, why keep emulating Windows 95?')
