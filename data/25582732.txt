I enjoy the &quot;hacker&quot; topics but I also like that a large number of the posts have to do with technology and social issues, an evenly divided number of well stated political views, and a host of IT and science and math related subjects that are way over my head but gives me an opportunity to learn something everyday.  Most of all it gives me hope by sharing constructive things that are happening in society and a different perspective than the doom and gloom that gets reported by mainstream news outlets. Thanks all for brightening up my day on a regular basis.')
