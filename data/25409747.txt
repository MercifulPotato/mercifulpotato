XCode relies on all of these things. Just because Apple doesn&#x27;t make a general-purpose IDE for their platform doesn&#x27;t mean anything as long as you can install VSCode or vim or Jetbrains or whatever your preferred IDE is.<p>Again, this is repeated here at least once a week for the how many years I&#x27;ve been visiting this site and it&#x27;s no closer to being true now than it was back then. If it was even remotely true Apple would have left the Macs on Intel and just phased them out in favor of the iPad Pro, but instead they spent billions making their iPad chips run MacOS and desktop applications and code compiled for Intel processors and real talk here, what about that gives anyone any indication that they&#x27;re planning on throwing all of that away?<p>They&#x27;re actively doing the <i>opposite</i> of what you&#x27;re claiming and spending billions of dollars to do it, and one blog post that says &quot;this isn&#x27;t even a big deal&quot; is all it takes to convince you otherwise?')
