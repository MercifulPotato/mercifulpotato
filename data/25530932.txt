You can&#x27;t just pull your punches, phishing and ransomware crime is currently skyrocketing. This is exactly the type of scenario that will entice many people to infect themselves with malware. This is also a scenario I&#x27;ve seen multiple _real_ e-mails of in recent weeks. It&#x27;s not like your employees are not likely to receive something just as nasty as this over the course of their employ.<p>That said, I do agree with you that money is better spent elsewhere. A company with &gt; 1000 employees should just assume there&#x27;s an infected machine in their network 24&#x2F;7. Defense in depth stipulates that this should not matter for their security.')
