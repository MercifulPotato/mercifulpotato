If you played a Doom game you know that even the silliest pretense for shooting and blowing things up is good enough. It’s not a movie script. Yes, you might hold an RPG to a slightly higher standard than an action game in this regard, but I still think the premise of CP2077 (Or GTA) is more than enough to fill an interesting game. I don’t need to “buy” the story if the mechanics are good enough and gameplay is enjoyable. If they could spend another 1000 hours on improving the writing or expanding the game with the poor writing, I’d take the latter every day.')
