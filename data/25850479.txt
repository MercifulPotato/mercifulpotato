That&#x27;s a narrative that is stated, but it&#x27;s not representative.  Molecular simulation codes are either too inaccurate, or undersample the space (we can&#x27;t tell because of how much CPU is required to answer).  I think most people have come to realize that modelling like this is mainly useful as a visualization technique to obtain intuition for how proteins behave, not a quantitative way of probing a system computationally.')
