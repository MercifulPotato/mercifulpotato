It’s been fun and I’ve enjoyed the game. I purposely avoided all reviews and hype. I only knew it was the game to buy this year.<p>I think if the game was more like Alan Wake it would have been better  as far story telling goes. Alan Wake is awesome by the way.<p>Without any expectations, when playing I thought the narrative choices were a bit shallow. Maybe they get better as the game progresses.<p>Hatred, negativity, and piling on is easy to do. If we enjoy something then we just enjoy it. Stopping and making a point to share that enjoyment doesn’t probably happen as often.<p>Also, remember there were many articles about a year or so ago about the toxic world game developers have to live in. Tons of  expectations and tons of viscous attacks. Why would anyone expect anything different in this situation.')
