E.g. people usually retire, young people usually don&#x27;t work, people usually work fewer hours, etc. That doesn&#x27;t mean we can just cut most of what is left and still have everything we want.<p>I mean, do you think that most people are not really productive most of the time? As in not doing anything that will be missed? Can you point out those things? Again, we still need teachers, we still need fairly large amounts of people to continue producing forms of entertainment, we still need fairly large numbers of people to keep the internet working, etc. Where are there huge swathes of jobs that you are OK with just not having anymore?')
