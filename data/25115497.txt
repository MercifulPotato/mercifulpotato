It&#x27;s to make an impression that everybody drinks it and not doing it makes you weird. OTOH, drinking it makes you in sync with what cool people do. &quot;Liking&quot; it is largely a formed habit - I used to drink a lot of Cola, until I realized what it&#x27;s doing to my body. Now I don&#x27;t touch the stuff, hasn&#x27;t been drinking it for years, and I find it absolutely disgusting if I taste it (I did a few of times over the years just to see if I&#x27;d find it tasty or not after not drinking it for so long). So it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s some &quot;innate&quot; liking, it&#x27;s a formed habit, and the ads help you to maintain the habit (or make it hard to quit it).')
