What I&#x27;m saying is these are incredible technologies and even though I have less experience of it it seems that India has a lot of really good social technologies as well like some amount of religious diversity and organizing social narratives and religious stories that let people feel meaning within a larger framework. I&#x27;m not saying everything is perfect at all but all I&#x27;m wondering is this society created many incredible things technologies that far advanced beyond our present understanding of our so-called civilized and so-called you know &quot;most developed&quot;  societies in the west. So what I&#x27;m wondering is like why isn&#x27;t India &quot;ruling the world&quot; or possessing an apparent you know highest quality of life?')
