In between those times, the USSR went from being an agrarian, feudal nation to an industrialized world power.  Who did that?  That&#x27;s literally the content of my first comment, and all you need to read into it, because that&#x27;s all there is.  You&#x27;re just so determined not to acknowledge that someone who did a lot of very, very bad things, and is arguably one of the most evil men to live in the 20th century, actually did a good thing.  That&#x27;s it.  You&#x27;ve proved my point.')
