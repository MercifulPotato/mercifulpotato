You could say TicToc creators are not normal people or Pinterest submitters, but I think the only time we see a cross section that does not represent the general population is when there is a high barrier to entry.<p>There is a phrase in Icelandic, &quot;ad ganga med bok I maganum&quot;, everyone gives birth to a book. Literally, everyone &quot;has a book in their stomach&quot;. One in 10 Icelanders will publish one, so in that society it&#x27;s stastically normal to publish a book. But in any society it&#x27;s normal to create and publishing is just one out of thousands of ways to do something everyone does.')
