Reusing HID is kind of clever, but the protocol is extremely bloated and hard to parse.<p>Ignoring that, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s an improvement. Most of the power savings is having the keyboard initiate an interruptible event to wake the computer. Interpreting HID like in USB means the keyboard can&#x27;t wake the computer, the computer needs to remain on to service USB interrupt endpoints.')
