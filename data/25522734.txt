They used both matte paintings and real locations (of Prague) to depicts never-built nazi city of Germania.<p>This use of real-life locations leads to some (for locals) hilarious moments like scene where gestapo tries to catch some man who is running away from them by train. The chase goes from station A to B where the man is killed. But funny thing is that they used just one real station to shoot both locations of A and B and they are actually just some 100m away.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0109779&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0109779&#x2F;</a>')
