This comparison basically then just benchmarks the different compiler outputs for the given test cases. Benchmarking is always difficult and often controversial, especially when drawn from the benchmarking game. Consequently, C not only wins in the speed but also the energy category.<p>But that is only testing the run time of a program. What this paper does not cover, is for example the energy needed to compile the program and of course, the energy needed to write and debug the program. The whole reason not to write &quot;everything&quot; in C is, that there is a real-life tradeoff between having the fastest possible program which also would be the most efficient, and the effort to create it. Higher level and dynamic languages have been created to create correct programs with less effort. Mostly of expensive programmers, but development time obviously goes along with energy usage for the development machine, compiler runs, debugging effort.')
