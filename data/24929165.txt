Item(by='02020202', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603969303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927700, text='i was working on something similar to dlive&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;twitch. live video stream+chat+donations. nothing complicated really...until you have to handle video transcoding with ffmepg and then you realize you have to pay for proper hardware(with hw codec support) and suddenly the live video lag&#x2F;delay grows because you have to encode on the fly for different qualities and codecs and so on so in the end i shelved the idea. anyway, ppv is nothing new but i doubt it will take off. the donation based model is simply the norm these days, especially with &quot;superchats&quot; and people make good money this way so i doubt audiences will want to move to ppv platforms. good luck though.')
