Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602135085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715089, text='&gt; The point is dismissing anybody&#x2F;somebody&#x2F;everybodies&#x27; view out of hand or minimizing it down to complaints means you are missing when valid points are being made.<p>I&#x27;m not &quot;dismissing anybody&#x2F;somebody&#x2F;everybodies&#x27; view out of hand,&quot; but observing that you can&#x27;t make everyone happy all the time.  Bosses will be unhappy with unions, because oftentimes unions go against their interests and reduce the power differential when they deal with individual employees.  However, there&#x27;s more than just the bosses&#x27; interest at play, so it&#x27;s a mistake to focus on that.<p>This may not be a win-win situation, and it may be just for shareholders and business owners to lose a little.<p>&gt; You are not showing a desire to discuss specific, measurable, realistic and timely issues. You and most unionists here have a view of a utopian union that is above criticism and does not need examination.<p>No, that&#x27;s not true.  I don&#x27;t have a utopian view of unions, but rather an objection to their out-of-hand rejection based on a couple of cliched complaints about specific instances of the type.  That&#x27;s also a double standard, since if we&#x27;d applied a similar standard to corporations, that concept would have been rejected long ago.  I think innovation in the area of unionization is possible and welcome, but I don&#x27;t have all the answers.<p>At this point, were at the step of merely trying to get the idea of unions put back onto the table.  It is not reasonable to insist that an idea (in this case tech worker unions) be fully worked out before the first step toward it is made.<p>&gt; What problem of unorganized workers?<p>To be blunt about it: capital is organized.  When a worker deals with it, they&#x27;re almost always dealing with some kind of institution, not an individual, which means they&#x27;re almost always in a greatly weaker position, with all that implies.  Why is it such a problem for workers to have institutions of their own to create some balance?<p>&gt; No none of that will work because it does not give totalitarian control of workers to unions. Nor will it allay feelings of jealousy.<p>Attributing desires for worker organization to &quot;jealousy&quot; is a far worse dismissal than anything I did in my comments.')
