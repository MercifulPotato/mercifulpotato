The alternative is employees who treat their employees like cattle and the employees treat the employer as a slaughterhouse.<p>The first path is much preferable for everyone. The ideal situation (think marriage) is where either partner willingly goes above and beyond for the other.<p>I am not sure the impact of this particular action, but it&#x27;s movement in the direction of employees asserting they don&#x27;t want to participate in such a relationship, instead resorting to the more common power struggle rather than a partnership.<p>That&#x27;s OK but taken to the extreme, there&#x27;s no reason for them to expect the extraordinary treatment google has given them to continue, either.')
