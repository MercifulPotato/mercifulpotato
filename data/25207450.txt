There is a lot of competition in denmark.<p>There are 3 separate 4G networks with very high coverage selling mobile broadband rather cheaply (you can fx get 1 TB a month for approx 36 USD a month).<p>TDC was also forced to give competitors access to their PSTN, coax and fiber network so resellers can compete on selling on their physical network.<p>The power companies have also been aggressive in recent years rolling out fiber, so several places people can choose either infrastructure from TDC, their power company or one of the mobile providers.')
