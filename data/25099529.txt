I have yet to see any actual argument from the vim&#x2F;emacs crowd. I&#x27;m genuinely curious about what makes them defend their editor choice that heavily but whenever I ask them for their reasons all I get is a &quot;modal editing is great because modal editing is great&quot;.<p>I can somewhat understand &quot;don&#x27;t have to touch the mouse&quot; as that&#x27;s a personal preference for them (even though IDEs have key binds too, I think they blow up that argument way too much) but on anything else they are suspiciously silent. Maybe I have just not met the right people to ask but that&#x27;s my personal experience. Anyone I know using vim only does it because they either have been using it for 40 years or have been told to use it by someone from the first group and don&#x27;t know anything else.')
