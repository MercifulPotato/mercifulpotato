So there is no reason not to buy several color combinations you like and wear whichever you think looks nice today. I would call I think half of mine &quot;white&quot; but in more detail they have different stripes and styles.<p>Dress shoes the same, they last forever and I have them in more or less formal looking as well as colors that match different suits&#x2F;belts combinations.')
