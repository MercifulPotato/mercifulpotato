Don&#x27;t ignore your sewer pipes either; they can burst too.  Instead if you really want to winterize, pour RV antifreeze down all your sinks, toilets, tubs, showers, etc.<p>RV Antifreeze is also great to pour down all your drains if you aren&#x27;t going to be in your house for an extended period of time even when it&#x27;s not freezing cold outside - it evaporates a LOT more slowly than water and thus your home will be far less likely to smell like a sewer when you return.')
