If you are overly excited or nervous you can slow down your breathing and do the exercises to relax. He claimed that the same can be done in reverse, if you are tired or wanting to improve your awareness you can do quick breaths.<p>I tried it, but didn&#x27;t really see the benefit with quick breaths but maybe I didn&#x27;t do it long enough.')
