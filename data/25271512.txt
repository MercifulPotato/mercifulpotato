Once Element is mature enough (and I&#x27;m sorry, but looking at the incoming issues on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-web&#x2F;issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-web&#x2F;issues?q=sort%3Aupd...</a>, it doesn&#x27;t look like it yet), then hopefully more companies will start considering it.<p>Also, some companies (at least some people in the one I work for, so I&#x27;m extrapolating) want to be able to text chat with other companies&#x2F;people, and they currently do this with Teams (which requires both parties to have a Teams account).  Slack allows this too if I understand.  Federated chat would also give them this, so it is something they need, even if they don&#x27;t realise that.')
