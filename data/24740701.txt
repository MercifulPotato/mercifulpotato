But I would really like to hear your opinion on the meat of the article.<p>Its main point is that Islam&#x27;s rules apply to public and personal life so universities and government budgets get controlled by religion.  Fundamentalism retards scientific discovery.  (I was taught fundamentalism as a child and I confirm this is true.)  So when fundamentalism spread through the Islamic world, they stopped discovering new science.<p>A second point is that Arab culture doesn&#x27;t value science.  The Abbasid empire was controlled by Arabs.  The empire translated scientific literature into Arabic for political reasons, not for the pursuit of knowledge.  The existence of the large body of accessible scientific literature enabled highly intelligent folks to make scientific progress.  The translation was not done in enduring institutions like universities.  So the Golden Age of Arabic Science happened by accident, not because Arab culture or the empire valued scientific progress.')
