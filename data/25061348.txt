Nice of them to announce so far in advance and let existing content stay free for now, and that should help them avoid an abrupt exodus.<p>This seems like a big win for Apple though, especially with their new focus on services.  As with other apps like maps, they’ve by now basically caught up with Google who had started off with a huge lead. When Google photos first launched with facial and object recognition and ability to search photos without ever tagging them, it was pretty incredible but now that’s basically table stakes.<p>For any iPhone and Mac users who haven’t been paying specifically for cloud photo storage and will now need to, I don’t really see much reason to stick with google photos over the native solution using iCloud or Apple One. I’m sure that’s what I’ll do eventually.')
