That is one of the absolutely insane things I just cannot wrap my mind around with people these days. No form of government is inherently &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;bereft of evil&quot;. Saying as much is like saying a token ring network is inferior to a mesh network when the use case of said token ring network may not have anything to gain from the properties of a mesh network between all the nodes. It all depends on the people involved. Governments are much like computing systems in that Garbage In, Garbage Out applies.<p>A constitutional republic was deemed at the time of the founding to strike the best balance of all systems of governance at the time. That&#x27;s it. It scaled, it resisted demagoguery, and most importantly, it virtually guaranteed that the pace of legislation and change was slow at the time. No man can do much damage in 4 years.<p>Fast forward to now, and you have D.C. pulling strings and reacting on weekly timescales. The status quo can change on the timescale of hours, not even days. Issues increasingly get pushed to be resolved at the National level instead of being delegated up only to the locality or States effected, which contributes to increased inter-state animosity. The key optimization that the Founders were going for is something that let everywhere &quot;do as thou wilt&quot; with a mechanism for collective action organized from the bottom up. It was certainly not the intent to drive the entire country at once from the top-down except in regards to matters of National Defence and International Diplomacy, and resolution of interstate matters. The role of the Federal Government has greatly expanded over the years, now including land management&#x2F;conservation, operating regulatory edifi, law enforcement, etc...<p>The Founders understood a government was only as inherently good as the people running it, and admitted from the start it would only be fit for a nation of well-educated citizens with a vested interest in maintaining their own liberties. No formal guarantee was given that somehow the system would work sevoid of everyone putting their best foot forward, which in part means not getting what you want all the time, and actually accepting that just because you could do something, it doesn&#x27;t mean it should be done forever, or even permanantly.')
