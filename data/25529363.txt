There&#x27;s even a tribunal (ie a court) specifically to resolve any situations where a leaseholder believes they&#x27;ve been asked to pay an unreasonable amount for such a renewal, although of course going to court isn&#x27;t free.<p>Second the leaseholders together can demand to just buy the freehold (ownership of the actual land) in most cases, under a specific formula. This is not cheap, but if your freeholder becomes a problem for all the leaseholders the freeholder cannot stop them just buying the building.<p>Some years ago a government tried to institute a more modern structure, Commonhold. Commonhold takes the mechanism often used to &quot;defeat&quot; leasehold by groups opposed to it, and turns it into a built-in feature of English law. With Commonhold the people who own individual dwellings have a lease still, but they also each own a share of a legal entity which exists only to own the freehold and they can&#x27;t sell the one separate from the other. The legal entity plays the role of freeholder, but since it is owned entirely by these leaseholders it has no reason to try to charge them ground rent or mess them about in any way - it <i>is</i> them, jointly.<p>Unfortunately to the average person Commonhold just seems like you&#x27;re buying the same thing for slightly more money, because Leasehold &quot;purchases&quot; look cheaper. So Commonhold did not take off and few exist today.<p>One of my pet projects (on hold because I decided not to look for a job during the pandemic so although I have plenty to survive I can&#x27;t go around funding speculative legal work) is to buy the building where I live and convert it into Commonhold, partly to prove it can be done.')
