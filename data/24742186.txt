You are promoting your beliefs and views on this thread, and attempting to argue about the credibility of a writer you don&#x27;t agree with or believe. This is what the broader thread is about, you&#x27;re proving my point again.<p>And some people think ancient aliens and UFOs are serious areas of study, but most reasonable people think it&#x27;s nonsense.  That disagreement on this kind of thing is possible doesn&#x27;t make every perspective equally credible or vital.<p>I actually agree with your point:<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To presume to know anything about what goes on in the rarified power struggles at an intercontinental&#x2F;global levels requires free speech and giving serious researchers&#x2F;writers a viewable voice.<p>Where I disagree is that people like Whitney Webb can shed any more light on those power struggles than Bob Lazar.  If the article of hers that I read is a good representation of her oeuvre, she offers tendentious and misleading interpretations of already public information.  I think the best that can do is offer a <i>false</i> sense of deeper understanding.<p>A <i>real</i> deeper understanding needs someone to take serious risk, like Edward Snowden did, to bring secret things into the light.')
