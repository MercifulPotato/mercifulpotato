The instruction is probably even older than that.<p>The ARM did change the instruction, arguably improving it. The IBM instruction loaded&#x2F;stored multiple registers, but the registers were required to be consecutive. The ARM instruction has a register mask.<p>See IBM System&#x2F;360 Principles of Operation, page 26: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitsavers.trailing-edge.com&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;ibm&#x2F;360&#x2F;princOps&#x2F;A22-6821-0_360PrincOps.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitsavers.trailing-edge.com&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;ibm&#x2F;360&#x2F;princOps&#x2F;A22-...</a>')
