Microwave ovens have modes depending on what you want to cook. I use the popcorn mode on mine <i>a lot</i>. Anyone who&#x27;ve ever used a VCR knows what modes are.<p>So having an editor with modes shouldn&#x27;t be a foreign concept.<p>But it&#x27;s not just about having modes; it&#x27;s how well thought out Vim is. Even though I&#x27;ve been using Vim for about 10 years (after trying many other editors and getting frustrated for one reason or another), I keep learning more useful things.<p>I recently needed to edit lots of messy Markdown files for a friend. I knew macros existed but I never bothered to use them. Before I knew it, I was using a couple of macros that really cut down on the tedious work I had to do.<p>Same thing with regular expressions—I knew about them but I had never gotten around to learning them. Combined with Vim’s composability, regular expressions gives you super powers.<p>The other thing about Vim I&#x27;ve always appreciated—it&#x27;s been around so long, articles and videos from 10 years ago are still relevant today.<p>For example, back in the day, I used to watch Derek Wyatt’s Vim tutorials.<p>Rewatching some of them today encouraged me to learn macros and regular expressions. When I recently watched this one (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;15443936" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;15443936</a>), where he extracts plain text out of a messy looking XML file using regular expressions, I was like <i>I want some of that.</i><p>Any software made for people who take their tasks seriously—GUI or command line—is going to have a learning curve—I think it&#x27;s exaggerated for Vim. But the payoff is well worth it.<p>I just installed Big Sur on my Mac. Everything went smoothly for me, but not everyone was so lucky. Even if I had other compatibility issues, Vim just works. As long as I have a terminal, Vim and web browser, I can be productive.')
