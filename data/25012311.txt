But I disagree that the unusual library example is more abstract.<p>As a point of contrast, I gave an abstract account of technical debt for the purpose of comparison to the more concrete library metaphor (to show that the abstract account would be more difficult for many):<p>&gt; technical debt is about the up front time-cost of introducing new systems of organization to replace ad-hoc, unsystematic methods whose cost-effectiveness decreases as project complexity (to put it loosely) increases.<p>A library with 25 books is not more abstract, though it is a <i>hypothetical</i> concrete thing [1]. If someone has difficulty with hypothetical concrete things, that could certainly make using metaphors with them more difficultâ€”and I can see why you would add additional constraints onto what makes a good metaphor. In my personal experience, saying, &quot;imagine a library, but with only 25 books, which is run by a single person,&quot; would be not asking too much of an audience. But I see your point that some may struggle with it.<p>[1] There is a handy way of considering this distinction: becoming more abstract involves making some &#x27;parameter,&#x27; which was fixed, free instead: so for instance a more abstract notion than any particular library is: a manager of a collection of objects which are loaned out to people for limited durations of time. In that example, we free the parameter &#x27;book&#x27; so that it isn&#x27;t set to anything specific. If we instead say, &quot;a library but for CDs instead of books,&quot; it&#x27;s equally concrete since we haven&#x27;t freed any parameters, we just replaced one concrete value for another. That&#x27;s what happened in the &quot;library with 25 books&quot; example, which is why I say it is not more abstract.')
