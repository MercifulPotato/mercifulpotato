EteSync is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted, and privacy respecting sync for your contacts, calendars, tasks and notes. You can think of it as sort of an end-to-end encrypted NextCloud, that also keeps a fully history of your changes.<p>EteSync launched in March 2017, but we just released version 2.0[1] and so much has changed since then! Some of the things that changed: we now support notes and tasks, we now have clients for Android, iOS, the desktop (a DAV bridge) and the web, and more than 400k downloads on Docker hub.<p>We have also released our backend as a separate open-source project (and SaaS) called Etebase[2]. Etebase makes it easy to build end-to-end encrypted applications by taking care of the encryption and its related challenges. Our hope is to enable a new generation of end-to-end encrypted applications. I don&#x27;t want to use any non-encrypted applications anymore. :)<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m just super excited about this release and what the future holds, so I wanted to share it. It&#x27;s great to look back and see how far we&#x27;ve gone. :)<p>Would love to hear your thoughts, and if you have any feedback. Especially regarding Etebase.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.etesync.com&#x2F;etesync-2-0-is-now-released&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.etesync.com&#x2F;etesync-2-0-is-now-released&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etebase.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etebase.com</a>')
