In this case, human accidents are incredibly rare. You need on the order of millions of miles to verify that a particular system is statistically safer under similar conditions. A safety conscious company would have done the testing to be sure of this prior public release to non-experts (i.e. licensed drivers making test rides like every other SDC employs). Tesla recording only 12.2 miles means they either haven&#x27;t done the requisite testing to be sure non-experts are safe, or are failing to report the results of that testing to the government.<p>Either one should be an immense red flag, regardless of what agreements they&#x27;ve gotten beta testers to sign.')
