What kind of &quot;destruction&quot; will befall the country, and when? It sounds like they want to protect something. What is that something? Why is it important to them?<p>&gt; A significant portion of these people get their news from Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, and Glen Beck. They might be a little wrong once in a while, but for the most part, these are &quot;smart men&quot; who &quot;know what&#x27;s going on behind the curtain&quot;.<p>So? Why do they want these people to be right? What part of their value structure make these comfortable conclusions for them?<p>&gt; [Stuff about cults]<p>Cults are a terrible thing, no argument here.<p>&gt; There are no underlying facts.<p>Of course there are, you&#x27;ve stated some of them here. I don&#x27;t means the &quot;facts&quot; of rhetoric, I mean the facts about their lives.<p>Several people have responded to me and explained how &quot;ridiculous&quot; the things the things these people believe are. Which misses my point entirely.<p>&gt; Conservatism has become a deep-rooted part of their personal ideology.<p>Why? This is a question whose answer can, and will vary subtly from individual to individual. People aren&#x27;t robots, and beliefs don&#x27;t have an off switch. A dozen people can believe the same thing for different reasons and to different degrees. Others will say they believe something, while actually only believing that they should say they do for some other, unsaid reason. Yet others still will think they believe something, but certain experiences might unmask the cognitive dissonance within.<p>People are complicated bundles of personal history, not mannequins with an R or D sticker on them.')
