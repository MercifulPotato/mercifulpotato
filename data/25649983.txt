In my case, it&#x27;s because I want to protect against SIM swapping attacks on my real phone number, but it also works for people who don&#x27;t want to give out their real number.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work for services that send SMS 2FA codes and the like from a shortcode (as Twilio does not support receiving those), but Google appears to send from a longcode, so it works there.')
