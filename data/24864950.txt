Item(by='oscargrouch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603413595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864113, text='&gt; We can decentralize the internet and serve Gemini over our new, decentralized space. We can work on more than just one of THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMSâ„¢ at a time, you know.<p>People are creating &quot;killer apps&quot; because the web evolved to its current state. Theres a lot of bloat of course, preventing new browsers to emerge and this is a real issue.<p>But the serious effort would be to scrap most of this bloat and create a leaner web standard that would be easier to implement and yet offer advantages for people developing in it. Seriously i dont know WHY Tim Berners Lee think the solution is something like Solid, but not to create a leaner version of his own creation.<p>Which developer will be ok to trade what he&#x2F;she have today for http0.9+markdown? None, because is too little. Maybe the Linux manuals will find they are more popular there..<p>The creators will not want to add the solutions to problems that will appear, but this will just make it a small niche.<p>Im trying hard to launch a solution to decentralization that at the same time looks good for the developer and the user, and its really hard, because the status quo is very sophisticated. Its David vs. Goliath and there&#x27;s no way to get there except by facing Goliath.<p>If the guys behind this at least optimize it to be &quot;a protocol for terminal&#x2F;console browsers&quot; i&#x27;m pretty sure that they would find a niche to live and start, but not as something that when looking over the shoulders of the current web presents no advantages to developers or users.<p>They say they are not competing with the web, and that&#x27;s ok, but they should at least do it in a way were the thing they created manage to exist. Otherwise it just looks like noise.<p>Sorry if i take this too serious, but its because we are all facing real danger now, the world we are heading to doesnt look pretty if we keep in this direction.<p>And more noise right now, just takes peoples attention from where we are really needing anyone help, and i think its a disservice, at least right now. Because we get more divided, and we are already just David, it will be even harder by being half-of-David.<p>Its cool if people dont care, or are in another phase in life, but at least how about to play in another playground, why waste peoples time  in a arena and a time we need all the effort we can get?')
