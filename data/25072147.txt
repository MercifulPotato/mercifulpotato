In fact, Jeff was the one who first invited me to apply for a role at Google after our collaboration on the Angular mobile toolkit and it was great working with him :)<p>It&#x27;s not easy to share such a personal story publicly. I&#x27;m sorry he had such experience and I&#x27;m not saying he does not have the right to be upset. He knows the best what he went through and how he feels.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s not correct to generalize and gave myself as an example for someone who can&#x27;t relate to his experience.')
