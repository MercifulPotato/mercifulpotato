Item(by='lopmotr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604081502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940648, text='I assume you&#x27;re using that 85 deaths &#x2F; 100000 annually which is for the worst case scenario of RCP8.5. With the more reasonable RCP4.5, it&#x27;s only 14&#x2F;100000, less than road deaths today. Road death rates have already plummeted by a factor of several over the past few decades. So we&#x27;ve already suffered far worse than the effects of 2100 climate change just from the direct danger of cars.<p>Since we&#x27;ll probably continue to have improvements in safety, diseases, etc. between now and 2100, the world should be a safer place for humans by then. So it doesn&#x27;t make sense for people to worry their kids will suffer a bad world due to climate change. They&#x27;ll most likely enjoy a better world than us despite climate change.<p>Did you mention preshistoric occupation to suggest that continuous occupation is necessary for a city? That surely helps but if an area has to be vacated, people will obviously go somewhere else, probably another place that was already occupied. Cities renew themselves anyway within the climate change kind of time frame. Buildings usually aren&#x27;t designed to last more than 50 or 100 years. People obviously don&#x27;t last longer than that either. So cities of 2100 will likely contain mostly new buildings and people that don&#x27;t exist today, while today&#x27;s ones will be gone. They&#x27;ll effectively be whole new cities. I don&#x27;t see why that renewal can&#x27;t coexist with a gradual move inland. Not starting from scratch, just putting new development slightly more on the landward side of the city than before.')
