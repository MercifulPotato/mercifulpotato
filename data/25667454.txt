Here&#x27;s my conclusion.  No religion that I&#x27;m aware of can be proven or disproved based on scientific fact or observation.  Yet that does not mean they are all false or true.  One could very well be true.  Or they could be false.  But simply because we can&#x27;t prove it doesn&#x27;t mean it must be false.  You cannot claim &quot;misinformation&quot; without proving its false.  I cannot (and am not) claiming it &quot;information&quot; without proven it true.  Its neither.<p>There is a different question to ask, which is how and why people choose to believe in religion provided that they cannot be proven.  I have my reasons, my personal evidences, that have led me to believe my religion is true.  I also believe that you can learn for yourself whether or not my religion is true. If you wish to learn more about my experience and what has led me to believe, I&#x27;ll share it in a venue that encourages respect and understanding.  Unfortunately online forums rarely provide that.')
