You unionize whenever there&#x27;s a major disparity between cooperate profits and worker benefits.  You unionize when work conditions are bad and management doesn&#x27;t care.  You unionize when you feel you are being treated unfairly.<p>For example, construction companies are often places where there&#x27;s both lots of work available and union outfits doing a lot of good.')
