It gives a huge leverage to the Indian government: If they say they will block WhatsApp if they go through with the planned policy change, FB won&#x27;t risk losing hundreds of millions of WhatsApp users.<p>Or they can go passive-aggressive: Mandate the exclusive use of privacy-friendly IM platforms for government and public services. If WhatsApp isn&#x27;t compliant with the privacy requirements they set, tough luck. This will bring everyone onboard to another platform, and they can then individually decide if they&#x27;ll also continue to use WhatsApp.')
