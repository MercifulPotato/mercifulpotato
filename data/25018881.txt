The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government, four years after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.<p>Can someone explain that last sentence to a non-American? Doesn&#x27;t it simply reduce the whole paragraph to &#x27;first female VP&#x27;? Or does it mean &#x27;first female senator to go on to government, but not the first including non-senators&#x27;, in which case.. uh-ok, is that significant?<p>Just seems like it&#x27;s slicing her up into as many &#x27;firsts&#x27; as possible.')
