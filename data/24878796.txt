To the point it does feel like a super power.<p>If you are going to use Anki, it&#x27;s important to switch the knobs to adapt to what you are learning.<p>I will share some of the things that have worked for me, for Finnish vocab:<p>- Intervals for new cards (until they are considered &#x27;learned&#x27;): 1 10 15 50 240.   \n  The 240 is critical for me: if I forgot it after 4 hours,  it goes back to 1 again... if I got it after 4 hours, then it will have better chances in a couple of days. \n Of course this is personal, I have been tweaking those until something makes sense to me.<p>- Lapese (when a known card is forgotten, and how to re-learn): 10 30 240.  Again the 240 check.<p>- Set an ammount of new cards and max reviews per day that does not make you feel misserable... there needs to be some joy on learning...<p>If I may ask, are you just learning the vocab ? have you taken courses? Where are you getting the vocab from ?')
