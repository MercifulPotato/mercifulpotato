They&#x27;re either too generic to be informative, or tend to become inaccurate as requirements change. Additionally, by some kind of regression to the mean they all start to look alike.<p>If there&#x27;s not a logical short name that applies, then just think of some random name that you think sounds funny, or fits some category that you use for all your products (a coworker of mine suggested French cheeses). Still give as little information about what they are as the &quot;generic&quot; names, but at least they&#x27;re easily distinguishable and easy to pronounce.<p>(This, too, is not a hill I&#x27;ll die on, but I&#x27;d love to wave a magic wand that would convince everyone of this.)')
