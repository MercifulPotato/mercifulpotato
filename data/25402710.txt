NLnet is extremely good at ensuring that money is used effectively, by requiring that they come up with a project plan involving milestones.  they <i>do not</i> just &quot;dump money at the developer&quot;, which has a known high historically-backed probability of causing more harm than good: they require the milestones to be completed, 100%, before the money is paid.<p>note, here: they do not use algorithms to assess a project: they use people.  they also assess the proposal against the usefulness of achieving key objectives.')
