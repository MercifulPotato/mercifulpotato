Did these journalists actually commit a crime?</i><p>The article contains this info at a high level and links to more in-depth info about it. Some jurisdictions make arrests public, btw. And all you need to make an arrest is &quot;probable cause&quot;, so you might not always get a satisfying answer about <i>why</i> a journalist was arrested. Since you&#x27;re asking <i>honestly</i>, I&#x27;m going to be honest with you. We&#x27;re talking about well over 100 arrests here. It&#x27;s dishonest to lump all these situations together and the HN community is not equipped to give you the info you seek anyway. Arrest records are, court records are, first hand reports are, and it is relatively easy to find this stuff, if you&#x27;re honestly curious. Since this happened so recently, you can also reach out to the people directly involved. Some reports may contradict each other. Some common threads may appear.<p><i>Do you actually have to commit a crime or can you be arrested as part of crowd control technique and released later?</i><p>You can be arrested without committing a crime.<p><i>Will they be charged with something in court?</i><p>As some of these are fairly recent matters and court systems are moving slowly due to the pandemic, the answer to your last question might not be clear at this time. This will be public record if they are.')
