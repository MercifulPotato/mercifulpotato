Just lost a few hundred Tabs from last session. Not the first time this has happened to me on Safari. ( Firefox used to have this problem as well, they implemented multiple LastSession.json to combat the problem and it is basically a thing of the past. )<p>&gt;&gt;<p>With Safari&#x27;s switch to WebExtensions, I hope that the developer of OneTab (1) makes their extension available on Safari as well. I started using this extension on Firefox to get an additional layer of protection from an unexpected crash that corrupted tabs data. This was before the multiple backups approach that Firefox has adopted, which has all but eliminated tab data corruption. I continue using it because I like to see tabs in a list.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;onetab&#x2F;?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;onetab&#x2F;?utm_s...</a>')
