I have been toying around with this concept and there are no good solutions right now.<p>There are few providers doing something similar (Vruzend off the top of my head), but they all have huge downsides.<p>What I would love is:\n1.) Integrated high quality BMS.\n2.) Modular design so that I can add capacity or voltage simply without welding.\n3.) High amp discharge capability.\n4.) SAFETY! Can be used in electric mountain bikes, eFoils, electric paramotors, whatever. Vibration, drops, etc. do not disturb the cells or the pack.<p>If you could accomplish this then you would unlock so many cool features.\n1.) Construct your own packs regardless of voltage or size requirements.\n2.) Travel on airplanes with your batteries! Deconstruct the pack simply and store in &lt;100Wh battery blocks or as 18650 cells and you can take theoretically an unlimited amount of lithium across oceans (likely limited somehow).\n3.) No vendor lock in.\n4.) When your BMS tells you that a certain subpack has failed just pop the cells out easily and replace the one that is busted.\n5.) Because of #4 far better for the environment and cheaper.<p>Does anybody have any thoughts about how to bring this to fruition?<p>The Vruzend thing works but is clunky, has low amperage capacity because of the bus bars, and the BMS is not integrated.<p>If anybody has thoughts I would VERY much appreciate it.')
