Heavily cherry-picked statistics (like &quot;household&quot; here) even though on the ground facts is so obviously different (house prices, student debt, health care costs, child care costs etc).<p>&quot;If you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, that&#x27;s not progress. If you pull it all the way out, that&#x27;s not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made.
