I know tables shouldn&#x27;t be used for things that are not actually tabular data, but I have to say that just looking at them in the raw HTML document, they make it obvious how the page is going to be presented in the end. With Flexbox, you have an undefined maze of divs which are then magically styled by an external stylesheet. I recently tried using this approach for something that would probably have been solved with an image map 20 years ago, and it was awkward to work with. I see Flexbox can have an advantage when using the same markup for e.g. mobile and desktop layout, but just looking at the raw HTML always leaves me a bit confused how elements on the page will relate to each other.')
