In fact they&#x27;ve been practically unlocked since June.<p>&quot;Japan doesn&#x27;t test as much&quot; That wouldn&#x27;t hide a raise in the death rate overall.<p>&quot;Japanese people wear masks&quot; Restaurants, coffeeshops, and bars are full (yes, they are) and those people are not wearing masks. They do wear them elsewhere (trains, busses, stores, outside...)<p>In any case, that Asians are of &quot;Greater Risk of severe COVID-19&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the facts at least in Japan.')
