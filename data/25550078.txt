I, instead, see very well constructed points on why one should consider contributing to open-source.<p>Mozilla, famously, open sources all of its code but more importantly dedicates all its <i>trivial</i> code to the public domain. If most competent developers &#x2F; organization at the very least followed such a line of policy, think of the learning that could entail, technological advances that could be turbo-charged, all the duplicated work that could be avoided.<p>This isn&#x27;t a hot-take by any measure. Examples of enormous impact of FOSS are right in front of us: More developers doing so only adds to this amazing ecosystem.')
