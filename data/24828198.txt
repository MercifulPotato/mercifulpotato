I spent a bit of time on nih.gov and many other sites to learn about specifics and also learn a lot more about the human physiology.  I never imagined in my youth that I would have spent so much time learning molecular biology and the human metabolism.<p>What I learned at a high level?  So it turns out that if they only people you talk to are doctors, then your options will be limited.  Doctors don&#x27;t have time to research everything and most of them are not scientists.  There are also some cases where doctors may subconsciously ignore options that may conflict with their business model. In many cases doctors will only suggest what their industry knows they won&#x27;t get sued for and what insurance companies won&#x27;t fight them on.   In my case, I was told I would be on BP meds forever and it would only get worse with time and I could expect to not last more than a few years.  Well, that was a load of BS and that came from multiple doctors at multiple hospitals.  It turns out, you can de-calcisfy and de-plaque arteries and reverse damage to them.  It&#x27;s actually not at all difficult.  I have lowered by over BP 20 points and I am still making progress.<p>TL;DR Read up on your issues until you know more about it than the scientists that have researched it.  Take the time to learn some biology and what aspects surrounding your condition that you can control.  Your body is the most important thing you own.')
