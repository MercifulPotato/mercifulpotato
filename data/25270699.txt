A small piece of artwork that comes with a note saying &quot;This made me think of you&quot; carries sentimental value<p>It is incredibly hard to do this without giving someone a burden. The recipient often feels an obligation to keep obviously sentimental gifts, even if they hate them (that piece of art your dear aunt gave you).<p>Or maybe worse when the receiver loves dust collectors, and has a horde of clutter that you have just added to.<p>Certainly you are inviting them to reciprocate with something sentimental, which now you canâ€™t throw away even though you have no place to put it.<p>It can be done, but you have to be really in tune with their tastes or listened carefully to what they like (e.g. I love some artists, but can really hate some of an artists oeuvre or I might not have a suitable place for it, so it is hard to pick something for me).<p>&gt; and will make the receiver think of giver every time they look at it<p>Sometimes that could be selfish (depends on relationship etcetera).')
