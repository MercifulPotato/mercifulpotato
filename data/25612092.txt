I sort of rolled my eyes, but accepted his rare behavior.<p>For those in the comments who are like myself (and parent&#x27;s friend) and have hundreds or even thousands of tabs open, I highly recommend the Panorama Tab Groups extension for Firefox:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;panorama-tab-groups&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;panorama-tab-...</a><p>This extension adds back in the functionality that was removed from Firefox half a decade ago. It gives you a visual, 2D-map of arbitrary groups of tabs in a tile layout you can view with &quot;Ctrl-Shift-F&quot;. Combined with the backup feature (just in case it crashes or gets corrupted, although this has yet to happen to me) and Firefox&#x27;s built-in tab session saving option, so long as you have enough memory (I bought 40 gigs of RAM for this laptop after terrible memories of running Firefox on a Chromebook with 4GB of soldered RAM), you can basically browse as though you&#x27;ll never have to close a tab again, AND also be able to stay organized.')
