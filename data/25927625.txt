Item(by='wolrah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611752125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924338, text='&gt; Americans not knowing (or not caring) and being unwilling to spend money to make it less fragile.<p>And of course the fact that for the most part those most impacted by these outages aren&#x27;t the ones making the decisions about what money to spend in the first place.<p>I have no meaningful influence on my ISP&#x27;s network backbone.  I don&#x27;t even have a real choice in ISP so it&#x27;s not like I can go to someone else, and they know it.<p>I currently have 500mbit&#x2F;sec service from my cable company and the only other options are ~50mbit&#x2F;sec 4G or Frontier DSL that claims 24mbit&#x2F;sec while rarely syncing beyond 8.  Those aren&#x27;t actual alternatives.  If I want to have a connection that can properly support a household full of gamers and streamers, I&#x27;m stuck with this unless I want to add another zero or two to my monthly bill for a dedicated fiber line.<p>This is the best case scenario for the majority of the US.  One cable company that&#x27;s mostly decent, one shitty DSL provider, and a few wireless services that have very limited spectrum and data caps.  Almost no one in this country has true competition in wired broadband unless they have a municipal fiber service or are lucky enough to be in one of the few cities that Google dumped money in to.')
