There&#x27;s no reason to assume an experience like love can&#x27;t be replicated by reproducing the same events in the brain. Unless you believe in the supernatural like souls, in which case the conversation is no longer based on scientific analysis.<p>&gt; BTW, love&#x2F;affection&#x2F;contact is one of those aspects of life where you&#x27;re not a brain in a jar.<p>This is a non sequitur. The point of the brain in a jar idea is that you have no way to tell that you&#x27;re a brain in a jar if all the chemicals, electrical impulses, etc are properly manipulated.')
