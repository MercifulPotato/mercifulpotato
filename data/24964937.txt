I&#x27;m conservative in fiscal policy, foreign policy, and favoring action at a local and state level, but liberal regarding most social policies, criminal justice reform, and environmental regulation.  I think government enforced price transparency plus a German-style universal healthcare system via private insurance decoupled from employment is preferable to either a US model or a Canadian&#x2F;UK-style single payer system.  I&#x27;ve always registered as a Democrat.)')
