You can see the people in this video inferring multiple, sometimes totally unrelated meanings from the same set of symbols. That is not possible at all in western languages. You either understand a sequence of characters or you don&#x27;t. One can debate the contextual and abstract meaning of a sentence, but not it&#x27;s absolute meaning.')
