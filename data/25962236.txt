There are two people not talking to each other, not just me.<p>Dick participated, he could have blown the whistle, and he didn&#x27;t, so he deserves a share of the guilt. He is not innocent. But if you didn&#x27;t <i>build</i> the house of cards, then it&#x27;s not <i>your</i> fault, it&#x27;s the group&#x27;s fault. If you colluded to remove people who would have said something, then you get more of a share of the blame. Anyone could have blown the whistle, not just you. Even if it&#x27;s obvious that you are the most likely whistleblower, there could have been others. (And if you <i>were</i> the most obvious, you can&#x27;t anonymously tip someone off because everyone will know it&#x27;s you, so you&#x27;re doubly screwed.)<p>One of the things slimeballs have intuited for millenia is that if you really believe something crazy, nobody is going to pick up that you&#x27;re lying because you believe it. You&#x27;ve lied to yourself, and then fastidiously avoided looking at the lie so that you can maintain your innocence, and your profit stream. You&#x27;re guilty as sin, with extra sins piled on top.')
