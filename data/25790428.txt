Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610715615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25788904, text='&gt;Programmers tend to get very proud of the completely pointless knowledge they have to acquire to use the pointlessly complicated tools they do, and they confuse that with being clever.<p>You need that knowledge to build production level applications. The problem is not that these tools are useless, but rather that the audience you are thinking of doesn&#x27;t care about them. Instead of crapping on other&#x27;s people&#x27;s work just look for things that are actually suitable for your own needs instead of trying to one up the experts.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s really not. Nothing has to be this esoteric and annoying. We&#x27;ve just chosen to keep things like this because we think it makes us clever.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest. I don&#x27;t like people like you. You are making things harder for yourself. You have chosen to go down a difficult path and then you complain that the experts that need these difficult tools are stupid.<p>Why? There are lots of easy to learn programming languages. You can start off with a very limited and restricted environment. Just fire up a google spreadsheet and start writing javascript if that is all you want. Don&#x27;t complain that writing a production level web application is difficult because you need to know about complicated things like what a HTTP server is and why it has to run on port xyz and why everyone calls their own computer localhost.<p>&gt;Programming can and should be much, much more user friendly than it is now.<p>It is so user friendly even kids can pick it up if their game supports modding. You&#x27;re not looking hard enough. If someone were to hand you everything on a silver platter you would never learn on your own.')
