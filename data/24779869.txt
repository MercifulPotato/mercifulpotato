Great if you answer in 5min because you were just at the helm, but you shouldn&#x27;t set unreasonable expectations.<p>Live support is murkier - if you do have set it up and are offline, falling back to email that gets answered tomorrow does seem slow, just by the fact you&#x27;ve just anchored me to &quot;live&quot;. In my opinion, don&#x27;t do it (or hide the widget!) unless you can really provide near-realtime response (even if via outsourced 1st level support agents).')
