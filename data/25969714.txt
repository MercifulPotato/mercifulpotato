This has resulted in creating job positions that would otherwise be outsourced, in one company I worked in.<p>Not a bad thing I guess, but the percentage should really be adjusted downwards in 2021.<p>2) Veterans (a very large group) should be given preference when equally qualified. This does not affect the ordinary software engineers much, but does have implications in management. It is also impossible to fire a veteran. This was one of the factors that created extremely negative perceptions about veterans in the educated sectors of the society.<p>As for the US forms of affirmative action, I haven&#x27;t seen that yet in companies I worked in. \nBut we don&#x27;t have such a skewed gender representation in STEM as the US has, and in 2021 the minorities who work have equal or greater income than the national average.')
