No.<p>It is very convenient to have a standard API for accessing hardware over the internet. But marrying this API with browser will inevitably create security nightmare, as previous decades of web technologies taught us.<p>As a solution I would propose another API layer, between browsers and the host OS. When a browser requires access to a certain hardware capability it requests the access via this API from the OS. The OS is actually the one where this capability support is implemented and vetted, leaving browsers code much leaner than it is now.')
