Your actual gains = (Fee * winnings )  - opportunity cost.<p>The effective withdrawal fee is 1 - (actual gains &#x2F; ( winnings - opportunity cost)).<p>So if the actual fee is 10% your winnings are 2$ and your opportunity cost is 1$ them the effective fee is 20%.  In other words a 10% withdrawal fee dropped your actual gains from 1$ to 80 cents.<p>However if your winnings where 1,000$ then your effective withdrawal fee is 10.01% dropping your actual gains from 999$ to 899$.  In other words fees are more impactful on high probability bets than low probability bets.')
