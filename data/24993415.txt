The idea would be to generate some plausible-sounding audio, not garbage that a listener would obviously know isn&#x27;t real.<p>Really, though, in general there&#x27;s just no point to this altogether; just cutting power&#x2F;data to the mic is fine.  There&#x27;s no need to attempt to fool someone with fake audio, outside of some <i>very</i> edge-case scenarios that I&#x27;m sure Dell  (rightly) does not care about.')
