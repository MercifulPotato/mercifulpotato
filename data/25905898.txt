You could generate new addresses &quot;on the fly&quot; by picking a prefix and signing it. Then you can use this email and it can&#x27;t be modified in a way to generate a new valid email.<p>For example you could have walmart-oaiua83n@yourdomain.example and they couldn&#x27;t just change it to goodcompany@example.com.')
