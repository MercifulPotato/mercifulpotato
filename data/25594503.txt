Non competes are non enforceable in CA.<p>IP assignments (i.e. &quot;what you do belong to us&quot;) is very much enforceable and very common.<p>How it&#x27;s enforced depends on the company, but by default the employer can claim ownership if you do your work on their time or using their resources (e.g. on a company&#x27;s laptop).<p>And they can drag you through courts even if it&#x27;s all your time and your resources.<p>If you work for Apple, you better not do any non-Apple work. At Google you can do open source work but you have to get a permission.<p>So as far as IP assignment, CA is no different than TX.')
