Most of the peertube stuff I&#x27;ve found out there has been FramaTube, a couple fringe-interest instances, those ones hosted by the creator which only have the owner&#x27;s content (which is fine, I just need several instances like this to work), instances with super low bandwidth, instances in &lt;not-my-language&gt;, or some combination of the above.<p>With the exception of the first one that 404s, every one of these is going to get a lot of use in our house!<p>Do other peertube instances share the bandwidth or just share links to the original server? Would it make sense for me to setup a peertube instance purely to act as a caching proxy on my network?')
