I used to get once a week maybe, like for a new signup to a forum. Fine, understandable. Now I get them multiple times per day.<p>It used to be a minor annoyance and I understood the reason for them in those cases. Now they&#x27;ve moved way beyond the &#x27;pain threshold&#x27; and it&#x27;s moved on to a blind hatred of them for me.<p>A similar thing happened for ads.. At first they were OK and I was fine with some ads paying for a sites. Then they became more intrusive flash crap. I started getting annoyed. Then all the tracking came in and full-page motion and sound ads and they really started abusing their privileges. Now I hate them so much I will never turn off my adblocker again for any site. They&#x27;ve just overstayed their welcome too much.<p>The same thing is happening now with captchas. Started as a good cause, but totally took advantage of the users to solve a problem that&#x27;s just as well solved on the back end in most cases.')
