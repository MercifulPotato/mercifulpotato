Item(by='tgb', descendants=None, kids=[24708971, 24709729], score=None, time=1602078755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707928, text='Absolutely, this is a pretty solid explanation and HN (and similar places) always have the bizarre take on explaining of paradoxes to shout &quot;It&#x27;s not a paradox!&quot; Paradoxes are about appearing, at first thought, to be impossible, not it being literally impossible. In this case, it&#x27;s the two observations:<p>1) A mirror is rotationally symmetric so should treat left&#x2F;right the same as up&#x2F;down.<p>2) A piece of paper with writing held up to a mirror reads right-to-left instead of left-to-right. But it does not read bottom-to-top.<p>This asks for an explanation - one that the article gives. Why do so many here feel the need to say that since this has an explanation, it is not a paradox? Outside of fiction, every paradox has an explanation and, moreover, we&#x27;re discussing an article that <i>gives</i> that explanation.<p>But: a mirror <i>does</i> flip something, it flips in-and-out. Mirror images are not the same.')
