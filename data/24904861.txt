It goes further than &quot;wellness&quot; too.<p>My pet peeve is getting asked &quot;I [heard&#x2F;read] that people put chips in their arms there?!&quot; (presumably for payments..?) - both by Swedes about Japan and Japanese about Sweden.<p>One difference I absolutely do see is what it means to &quot;go camping&quot;. Growing up it usually meant bring your gear, hike out, picking some spot in the wilderness. In Japan that&#x27;s something that is quite rare, &quot;camping&quot; almost always involves campsites.')
