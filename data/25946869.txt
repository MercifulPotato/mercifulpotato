Firefox usually still preserves\nthe session despite crashes, and even if it doesn&#x27;t you can\nstill restore it again via &quot;recently closed windows&quot;. Although I\nonly had to do that once, after a certain bug-riddled Windows 10\nupdate. I have at least 300 tabs opened constantly in two\nFirefox windows, and I never lost a session.<p>And Firefox automatically searches all tabs in addition to\nbookmarks whenever you type in the address bar, and lets you\njump to that tab directly.')
