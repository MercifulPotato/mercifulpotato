Thank you for sharing.<p>I haven&#x27;t taken a Myer Briggs in a while, so I can&#x27;t remember what &quot;I am&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m curious how my Reddit persona compares to an actual test. I know for a fact that I have a different personality on Reddit than I do in other conversations. Over the years, I&#x27;ve &quot;figured out&quot; a Reddit (and Hacker News) communication style that trends towards populist (i.e. tending to receive upvotes). I&#x27;ll also jump straight to conclusions on Reddit - especially if I know they&#x27;re &quot;hivemind&quot; opinions.<p>In real life, I have a much different approach to most communication - which I&#x27;d expect to reflect differently in a personality test.')
