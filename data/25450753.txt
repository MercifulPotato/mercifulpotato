Do you think there are some people that would derive a differential benefit by going with one vs. the other?<p>Honestly no. It’s just a symptom of being a weak minded person who can’t commit to self improvement.<p>&gt; Do you think that working out entirely alone vs. with a group is the same thing? Do you think there are some people that would derive a differential benefit by going with one vs. the other?<p>If you say ask it twice it doesn’t change the response.<p>&gt; Do you think that emulating being with a group would have value for those that would otherwise value working with a group?<p>Of course it has value. But it’s the workout equivalent of hiring a prostitute. Find some real friends to work out with. Or just play some music and pedal.<p>&gt; Do you think that anyone who falls into the &quot;works out better with a group and a trainer, or an emulation thereof&quot; must be an idiot? Or do you think that category simply doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>A group, a trainer, and a spin class instructor that just yells at you on a preset rhythm are three different things.<p>&gt; From my experience in competitive powerlifting, working out by myself, working out with others, working out with a coach, working out with an app yelling at me, are all very different endeavors, with different outcomes. Maybe I&#x27;m just an idiot.<p>I didn’t insult having a trainer or anything to do with powerlifting with a group. Hell, a spotter is all but mandatory in that situation.<p>I’m specifically referring to idiots paying someone to yell at them to speed up or slow down while riding a bike. You could record one session and play it back on a speaker and it’d be the same thing.')
