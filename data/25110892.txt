A couple of years ago I went to upgrade OSX and it turned out I didn&#x27;t have enough disk space, even with minimal apps installed, so I wiped it, installed Ubuntu and ended up having 45G left over. It was a great way to extend the life of that hardware and I haven&#x27;t had many issues. The only apps I&#x27;m using are terminal and a browser, though.')
