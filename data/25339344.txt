The bulk went into... paying salaries for quite a lot of developers. Since then another dev reward was agreed on (for the next 4 years), but this is going directly to the company+foundation directly building Zcash with no &quot;founder share&quot;.<p>TLDR: the share of the Zcash supply of which &quot;6 people&quot; are receiving through in-protocol issuance is much smaller than 20%.<p>&gt; * the fact that it&#x27;s a &quot;privacy focused&quot; crypto-currency and the CEO said &quot;we can make it private, but not for criminals&quot; i.e. backdoored.

Zcash governance is definitely more centralized in that way (though there is a lot of community engagement, as we saw in the [dev fund extension](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electriccoin.co&#x2F;reaching-consensus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electriccoin.co&#x2F;reaching-consensus&#x2F;</a>)). We&#x27;ll see how it evolves.<p>&gt; * the fact that the ZK-SNARKs they use (however mathematically beautiful), requires a trusted setup, i.e. prover key(non I&#x2F;O)<p>Also a valid point, though this is a big part of why they have been working on Halo, a ZK scheme which does not require trusted setups and still has the benefits of succinct proofs etc.<p>&gt; * the fact the SNARKS are computationally expensive and no-one uses them. Thus opt in privacy and reduced anonymity set.<p>These days you only need a few seconds to make a SNARK, even on a phone! But the &quot;opt in privacy&quot; thing is definitely a fair point; I hope that they can escape their bitcoin roots somewhat and get rid of transparent addresses and Script and that whole mess entirely at some point, but we&#x27;ll see.')
