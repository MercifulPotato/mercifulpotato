Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609309467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577838, text='The problem with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25541900" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25541900</a> is that it reads like an ad. HN users hate that. They click on things looking for interesting content, so what you want to do is post the actual interesting content.<p>Newsletters aren&#x27;t a great fit for HN in general because it&#x27;s hard to link to them. When I look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markjgsmith.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;mark-smiths-newsletter-26-12-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markjgsmith.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;mark-smiths-newsletter-26...</a> I see a bunch of pointers to things, but HN itself is already a bunch of pointers to things, so that&#x27;s too much indirection to count as interesting. More explanations about that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=denominator%20list%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=denominator%20list%20by:dang&amp;d...</a><p>What you want to do is post something with a lot of meat on the bones, so people can get into it right away and have something specific to discuss. Blog posts are better for that, especially if they go deeply into a topic. Short few-paragraph blog posts can sometimes do ok on HN, if they make a clear point that strikes a nerve, but mostly they&#x27;re too shallow to resonate. Blog posts that go deep are more the sweet spot.')
