Social media companies are private entities, and as such can be as deliberately, or not, biased and full of censorship against other persons or groups as much as they want. More so, they can openly declare such bias against their best interests without risk of immediate consequences thanks to Section 230. They are legally protected by law.<p>I really wish the current administration would stop crying about the big bad world and how unfair it is. This only appeals to really insecure people. If they really wanted to “fix” the problem the appropriate regulatory body could provide new regulation against activity not already protected by legislation.')
