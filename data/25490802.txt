I bought one new laptop in my lifetime but realised that second-hand or refurbished offer better value for money. For the past eight years, I’ve been using a Core 2 Duo Dell Vostro from 2007. I’m conscious of the environmental cost to manufacturing brand new devices so I only ever buy second-hand mobile phones and I apply the same philosophy to other consumer goods – cars (20 years old), stereo equipment (25 years old), bicycle (15 years old), etc. I sometimes buy clothes from charity shops but the shops have so little range in male clothes that it takes too much time to find something I like in a size that fits.<p>My laptop is 13 years old and I’ve upgraded its RAM to the maximum (4GB) and replaced the hard drive with a SSD. It runs Ubuntu 18.04 with LXDE as a lightweight desktop environment. I could probably use a more minimal window manager but for my usage, it’s the web browser that tends to eat RAM – due to modern websites’ predilection for externalising a ridiculously huge amount of unnecessary computation on to the end user. I see the article writer mentions that they use Vivaldi and Midori. I tried Midori for a couple of months around 2015 but ended up coming back to Firefox.<p>What makes Firefox usable is that I disable a lot of (most) JavaScript with the <i>uMatrix</i> browser extension (I used to use NoScript before Quantum). Since I’m not very disciplined, I can have a couple of hundred tabs open at a time; what makes this feasible is the <i>Auto Tab Discard</i> extension which stops open (but unused) browser tabs from using RAM and CPU.')
