Item(by='tpetrina', descendants=None, kids=[25664337], score=None, time=1609969859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660765, text='&gt;  we know so little about the universe\nBut free will doesn&#x27;t fall in the realm of &quot;things to research&quot;. It&#x27;s an escape mechanism devised by religious people wanting a perfect mechanistic universe designed by God with an escape hatch from it in the form of &quot;free will&quot; that somehow enables us to sin. Nothing more, nothing less. It&#x27;s just a for of saying &quot;universe is mathematic, we are not&quot;.<p>If you are willing to claim &quot;but the universe isn&#x27;t even causal&quot; then you don&#x27;t even need free will anymore since the sole intent for it was to claim independence from causality. It&#x27;s a broken metaphor for explaining the world. So by implying causality is an illusion free will doesn&#x27;t give you anything that you wouldn&#x27;t get with such &quot;un-causal&quot; universe. It has exploratory power of zero.<p>&gt; And yet, you attribute an agency to this humanity\nAgency is an attribute of source - to differentiate whether this post was written by me or you. The idea that free will is a requirement for agency is not obvious nor true. It is just your requirement, one with which I will never agree.<p>&gt; they just come to predistined conclusions\nNo, technically they come to whatever they come. The opposite of free will is not determinism.\nOne thing that baffles me even more than proponents of free will is the insistence of determinism as the alternative. Let&#x27;s repeat, free will is not synonym for indeterminism.\nAt best we can say that things happen and there are bunch of correlations in the system. For all intents of purposes, what we call causality in this universe is a bunch of beliefs in the uniformity of the universe. If the stone fell yesterday, then it sure will tomorrow.<p>- Free will doesn&#x27;t explain anything.<p>- Nor can anyone claim that they &quot;feel&quot; free will - that is such a blatant non-truth.<p>- Nor you can &quot;prove&quot; free will by raising your hand. You can at most just point to the fact that you raised your hand. Through your existence, reasoning, internal and environmental pressures.')
