Reading the article (and being aware of the ongoing story) there&#x27;s no indication (to me) that there would be any hostility facing the officers. Thus it is easy to draw a conclusion of threat escalation from the police towards a citizen (if this is the wrong conclusion to draw then the police need to do a lot more work to justify their actions and explain why they thought there was a threat, because right now no one should buy that). This is unacceptable gun behavior in any environment and goes against conventional training (I&#x27;m sure there are gun users here or people who at least shot in the boy scouts or something). I mean officer #2 even appears to have his finger on the trigger (officer #1 doesn&#x27;t). There&#x27;s a rule &quot;never point a weapon at something you do not intend to destroy.&quot; Pointing a weapon at a person indicates they are willing to destroy (kill) that person. This is unacceptable in non-violent cases where there is not an equal force against them. I just can&#x27;t imagine the training they get. It makes me feel like Surviving Edged Weapons[0] is, at least in spirit, used. [1]<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people with bad trigger control and not knowing proper gun safety, but I&#x27;ve seen it far too often from police. The acceptable level of this for police is zero and it isn&#x27;t even close to that.<p>[0] This is a cult classic for &quot;Bad&quot; movies: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c4ZpyKSmgdE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c4ZpyKSmgdE</a><p>[1] From what I&#x27;ve seen, it does still seem like they do similar training that is highly fear based. As in &quot;you could die at any second. It is you or them&quot; and does not reflect the reality that being a cop is relatively safe. At least that narrative is not in the public domain. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-06-23&#x2F;how-dangerous-is-police-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-06-23&#x2F;how-da...</a>')
