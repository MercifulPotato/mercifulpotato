I really illuminates the difficulty in building any theory that fits all the data, and the incredible beauty that our current best theory of the universe truly is.<p>Gravitational wave events like these are just more data, making the challenge that much more difficult. And yet, the model still fits pretty well, barring a few pieces. But we don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater, because it&#x27;s still a really good model.<p>And the best part about that is that we can use the model we have to make predictions, and most of the time they&#x27;re <i>pretty good</i>. Predictions about things we can never see or experience or know. We can see into the past and future.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Cosmic-Revolutionarys-Handbook-Beat-Bang&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1108486703" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Cosmic-Revolutionarys-Handbook-Beat-B...</a>')
