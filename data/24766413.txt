I&#x27;ve read that the landlord is required to make a good faith effort to replace you, but if they can&#x27;t (or if they can&#x27;t recoup the costs), you are on the hook.<p>So if the cost is 32% lower and the landlord can only find a tenant willing to pay that much, it seems like you are responsible for the 32% for the remaining months of the lease - which is no better than if you just hadn&#x27;t moved. And that&#x27;s not even including the fact that the place might be on the market for months.')
