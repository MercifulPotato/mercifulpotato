Full stop.  Case rates dropped dramatically.<p>Some of those countries are &quot;not sitting pretty right now&quot; because they ended their lockdowns.<p>The answer is not &quot;lockdowns don&#x27;t really do any good.&quot;  The answer is &quot;don&#x27;t prematurely end your lockdowns.&quot;  Now that can be burdensome.  You can do a middle ground (limited re-opening).  That works too, but you have to be very careful and keep a close eye on case numbers and shut down totally as soon as cases ramp up.  California tried to do that in the latest surge, but was a little late in implementing the newly stringent measures and even further So. Cal. &quot;resisted&quot; the newly stringent measures and are now suffering mightily.')
