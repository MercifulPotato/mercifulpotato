This includes parts related to power management.<p>Nouveau has an uphill battle because Nvidia is actively hostile, and because they have to support dozens of chips. We are starting with one. I do not expect for us to end up in a Nouveau situation with poor performance&#x2F;PM over time. It will take time, of course, but I fully expect we will make it happen.')
