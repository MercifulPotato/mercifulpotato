Strongly typed means that invalid runtime types result in invalid programs...which can actually be true for both static typed languages (like Rust or OCaml) and dynamic typed languages (like Python, which throws errors on invalid types).<p>Typescript is statically typed but it is also weakly typed. Types are validated at compile time, but they do not prevent you from using invalid types at runtime.')
