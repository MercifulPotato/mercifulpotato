Definitely my fault though for trusting that the roll over process is as simple as issuing new paperwork as portrayed by a guy who is just looking to close the deal. I have not had such a problem with other companies in the same sector with such sales practices but maybe that&#x27;s just my experience. Makes no sense to me though coz who would want to sign a contract when you don&#x27;t know what policies they might decide on mid-way, the discount offered is tiny (unlike AWS reserved where it is super clear when they expire but you also get a huge discount so it&#x27;s not vague what the trade-offs are) and you are much better off on demand.')
