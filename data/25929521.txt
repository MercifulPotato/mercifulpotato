It makes it hard on companies looking to hire, because they have to invest so much in someone who can just leave. And hard for the job-seeker, as they are in a difficult position because they may not be able to offer a lot of value, so may not be able to get a job.<p>For people with top tier degrees, or who are very motivated self starters, none of this matters. But what about everyone else?')
