That could be pretty consequential if the private information turned over was very sensitive.<p>When I was working at EFF I filed some comments on an international law enforcement cooperation plan where one thing that bothered me a lot was that, if you formalize the idea that jurisdiction A has to directly enforce orders&#x2F;process&#x2F;formal law enforcement requests from jurisdiction B, people in jurisdiction A will have <i>even less idea</i> how to authenticate them, and there will be even less likelihood of a remedy in case of a deliberately fraudulent request. The domestic status quo (as you point out) is typically pretty low authentication, but at least there&#x27;s a likelihood of some significant punishment for people who commit fraud on a court (judges really dislike that). Now imagine if you could do this without even being in the country where you&#x27;re committing the fraud! :-(')
