And as you can see from the other comments here, it&#x27;s not a clear cut issue. For me _some_ math functionality would be welcome, and some would not. But equally, if a feature is present, I fully expect it to be abused and make things worse rather than better, as with any feature. So, e.g., I&#x27;d much rather have code like Γ(α, β) than Gamma(alpha, beta), and N(μ, σ²) over normpdf( mu, sigmasquared ), but I would not like it if people started choosing obscure single-letter names instead of self-documenting code that &quot;reads like English&quot;. But arguably that is a question of promoting good style and programming standards, not one of &quot;limiting the freedom of users by design because some may not follow good style&quot;.')
