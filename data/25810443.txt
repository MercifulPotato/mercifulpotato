Also the way this was printed also certainly looks like it was made by one of the tools already available to produce these (these became a thing since some years now in 3d-printing).<p>Essentially, the brightness of the picture is mapped to thickness.\nBright spots in the image correspond to thin areas in the plate.<p>The effect is that when back light hits the plate, more light will be able to pass through thin areas, restoring the original image.<p>The plate is also &quot;3d&quot; in nature because of this, so it looks like a bumpmap texture without light and I can share with the author that&#x27;s it&#x27;s extremely cool to see&#x2F;touch also without lighting.<p>The plate is commonly printed vertically (as it results in higher cross-section resolution in the FDM printing process), and using an arch layout is common as well as it makes it self-standing.')
