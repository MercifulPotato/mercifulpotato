Don&#x27;t know if that still applies.<p>I wrote quite a lot of HPC-like code lately. Can confirm.<p>The reasons include first-party support for hardware intrinsics on all platforms (SIMD is the most important, but also scalar stuff like popcnt, pdep&#x2F;pext, etc.), full control over RAM layout which allows to optimize data structures for cache friendliness, and the ecosystem of high-quality third party libraries.')
