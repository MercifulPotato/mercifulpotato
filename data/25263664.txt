There&#x27;s also costs (board space, part cost, motherboard layers, and layout complexity) for dimm slots.<p>Sure manufacturers might try to charge significantly more than market price for on the motherboard RAM, but it&#x27;s an opportunity to increase their profit margin and ASP.  Random 2x16GB dimms on newegg cost $150 per 32GB.  Apparently LPDDR are easier to route to, require less power, and cost less for the same amount of ram.  I&#x27;d happy pay $500 for a motherboard with 64GB of LPDDR4x-4266.  Seems like Asus, Gigabyte, Tyan, Supermicro and friends would MUCH rather sell a $500 motherboard with ram than a $150 motherboard without.')
