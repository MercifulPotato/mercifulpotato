I&#x27;ve had multiple teams struggle with N+1 and inadvertently caused queries with JPA in the past (although it was often related to their poor understanding of JPA itself). In any case I&#x27;m interested in any kind of tool which can help debug and prevent these kinds of issues.<p>So far I was investigating the use of Sniffy ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sniffy&#x2F;sniffy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sniffy&#x2F;sniffy</a> ) which provides assertion capabilities on the number of queries during the runtime of a JUnit integration test. I&#x27;m pairing this with the rest of my JUnit 5 integration test stack (Test Containers, DBUnit, Database Rider and Flyway) which looks promising.<p>Unfortunately your tool seems to be closely coupled with Spring, correct? Is there a possibility of extracting some of the functionality to work independently of it? I&#x27;m thinking of JEE&#x2F;MicroProfile&#x2F;CDI based environments, e.g. Quarkus.')
