All they will do is consolidate lock-in and leave people with less money and willingness to spend on other software.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at all. Look at the explosion of TV streaming services. Nevermind the fact that we&#x27;re winding up with a situation worse than cable, people are paying for those.<p>What people don&#x27;t pay for is apps that are more expensive than $1. They complain if apps cost more than a cup of coffee because <i>everything else</i> is free.<p>We have to push out the loss leaders and advertising subsidized garbage, because it puts expectations on the price of our software.<p>Compare our situation with Steam. People are happy to pay tons of money for games. Often times, they spend money for games they don&#x27;t even play!<p>It&#x27;s good for us if things start costing money and stop being free. Free is something only the giants can afford to offer.')
