Item(by='fouric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603853227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906698, text='&gt; when I say types, I mean the modern reference to the word that it has a static type system<p>Can you show me a significant body of literature or a whole community that uses &quot;types&quot; to mean &quot;a strong type system&quot;? Because I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> heard that aliasing done before.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know if Lisp, the language, influenced Java and Scala so much, it was more about its runtime, the garbage collector, etc.<p>Lisp pioneered lambdas and first-class functions, in addition to garbage collection, all of which were adopted by Scala and Java later.<p>&gt; I simply dislike Lisp, interesting language but not for me.<p>I understand! I have things that I like and dislike, too. However, it&#x27;s extremely frustrating when you ask for an analytical comparison between several languages, and some random person lacking knowledge on at least one of the languages (I suspect you don&#x27;t know Rust either) comes in and, instead of actually providing relevant information, gives fallacies and opinions.')
