You make one dollar more than a certain amount and you lose thousands in benefits.  It&#x27;s the virtual equivalent of a greater than 100% marginal income tax.<p>Also, countries with greater welfare programs don&#x27;t have greater entrepreneurship.  The opposite is somewhat true.  Probably due to higher taxes and it&#x27;s very hard to go out of business once you&#x27;re in business and to fire employees in other countries.')
