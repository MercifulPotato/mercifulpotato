Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604253205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961071, text='I wish people use &quot;real&quot; (pretty-printed) TLA+ syntax -- the syntax used when reading a spec -- when giving presentations rather than SANY&#x27;s LaTeX-like ASCII syntax used to type them. The read&#x2F;write ratio for maths, including TLA^+ specifications, is higher than for programs, and so there are two concrete syntaxes optimised for those two different modes. I think most people know that on the computer, maths is usually typed differently from how it&#x27;s read, and they expect to read the maths, not the LaTeX source used to typeset it. It isn&#x27;t any different for TLA^(+).')
