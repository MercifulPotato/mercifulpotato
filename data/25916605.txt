And most of that stuff that no one knows anything about anymore is like that. Same as with an old VM or PM.<p>I&#x27;d rather have that old crap as a physical machine. Why? Because the hardware lifetime &quot;naturally&quot; limits the lifetime of such applications. If the hardware dies, it forces a decision to spend some money to keep it running or throw it away, which, given that hardware is expensive, usually results in throwing it away.')
