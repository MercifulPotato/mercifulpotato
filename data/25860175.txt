Noether&#x27;s theorem says that &quot;energy is conserved&quot; is equivalent to &quot;the laws of physics are time invariant&quot;.  If you assert that &quot;energy is conserved&quot; <i>because</i> &quot;the laws are time invariant&quot; that risks begging the question.  At the very least you should be asking &quot;ok, then, why are the laws of physics time invariant?&quot;<p>We know that all of the laws of physics we observe at the local scale are time invariant, but that is not necessarily true for any law we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.  While on the local scale that <i>feels</i> so unlikely as for it to be basically considered &quot;inviolable without extraordinary evidence&quot;, that is not necessarily the case in the community for laws at the cosmic scale.')
