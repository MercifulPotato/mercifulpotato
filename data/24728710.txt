But really, it&#x27;s just applying sprints to waterfall. We do get some shorter feedback loops to improve features before going live. But the whole scope is still set at the start of the project, and that scope needs to be completed at the end of it.<p>And to be very honest. It doesn&#x27;t work if the people in the team don&#x27;t think Agile. Your team needs to be able to self-reflect and try to improve themselves just as they&#x27;ll do with client work in a sprint.')
