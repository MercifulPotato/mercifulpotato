The 1619 Project is an attempt to reframe the defining characteristic of the US and its founding as being uniquely fixated around slavery. Despite it existing in a world in which slavery had existed in virtually every civilization up to and beyond that point. And more importantly, despite it being one of, if not the purest embodiments of liberal governance explicitly outlined up until that point, since which its constitution has served as the foundational text for countless other nations to come, as well as the basis by which the abolition of slavery and the subsequent civil rights movements would come to follow...perhaps its least interesting feature, in slavery, is elevated to the forefront of the nation&#x27;s character. We are so far down this rabbit hole that during the George Floyd crisis, we had congresswomen making claims that the existence of POLICE in the US (again, a concept that exists virtually the world over), are simply downstream from government officials whose purpose was to catch runaway slaves.<p>2.) The various attempts to go after logic&#x2F;mathematics&#x2F;scientific method as being constructions of the western patriarchy, arbitrarily imposed upon other cultures. If you are unaware of this movement, it is an academic argument that suggests that &quot;western science&quot; and &quot;western medicine&quot; are equally valid as, say, shamanistic practices of other cultures, and that things like logic and mathematics are simply held to an arbitrary standard of correctness due to a western-centric view of the world. All the while failing to acknowledge that we use Arabic numerals, contributions of Islamic scholars in the invention of algebra, or that concepts like the Pythagorean theorem were very much un-arbitrarily and independently arrived at within multiple cultures. So without even getting into the non-arbitrary nature of the correctness of logic and mathematics, attempts at accusing western civilization of whitewashing and imposing their modes of thinking onto the world, there is a complete failure to understand the cultures that contributed to those modes of thinking in the first place. There is literally a whitewashing of how influenced western civilization is by other cultures, when accusing western civilization of actively erasing other cultures with its modalities.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a sophomoric point, maybe I&#x27;m not getting it across clearly. I&#x27;m just finding a pattern among the self-flagellation of the west, that there&#x27;s a certain beauty that seems to be lost in reducing the complicated way in which the west fits into the web of historical and contemporary civilizations to basically be one of oppression and whitewashing. For all of the whitewashing that may occur, I am simply making the point that there exists just as pernicious an issue in which the west is not framed as uniquely good and benevolent, but the precise opposite.')
