I&#x27;m hoping we&#x27;re at, or nearing, the peak as a lot of these accounts that are actively participating in harmony with what the sub is about will start hitting the karma threshold and no longer need manual approval for everything.<p>We&#x27;ve already onboarded another moderator to help today too, but thanks!')
