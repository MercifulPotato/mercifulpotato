It&#x27;s akin to old UNIX documentation, or the pre-10 offerings from Microsoft.<p>As an example, I wanted to set up kerberos. Red Hat had a guide on setting up IdM, covering every step in the process, often with two alternates depending on desired final state and having an intro paragraph to choose between them, full command line docs for every command ran, steps to test this was ran correctly, and troubleshooting steps for commonly-encountered errors. In contrast, the Ubuntu docs for setting up a IdM client were a wiki, half of which was for the old version, and a detailed stackoverflow response. Server and client setups took the same amount of time; the client should have been much faster.')
