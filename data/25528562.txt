In fact, I’ve read here on HN that you can expense factorio at Shopify :)<p>It’s almost a perfect game for a software developer. Unlike software which is difficult to visualize, factorio is all about the visualization. It makes it really easy to see your “hacks”, your “scaling”, and your “async”. It also makes it really easy to see your bugs as well. It’s like working on a program that is always running, in a debugger, but with the ability to dynamically add and change the running code in real time.<p>Another observation: it’s kind of like Excel. The sheet is always live and the sheet acts as a debugger (you see the data and not the code, you see the outputs not the transforms).<p>Can’t recommend it enough.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sriramk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339257751873064961?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sriramk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339257751873064961?s=21</a>')
