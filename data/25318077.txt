My comment is with respect to Islamic worldview. Islam is different from Christianity and other faiths in terms that it does not allow adding or removing anything into Quran so if Quran says Earth is flat, it needs to stay flat evidence be damned.<p>Christianity on the other-hand does not have this injunction against the progress. Rome and Pope were keeping the scientific thoughts suppressed by force but the scripture itself did not prohibit new interpretations and revisions.')
