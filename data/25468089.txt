Ive done the theoretical coursework and enjoy the problems, but the hour-a-day leetcode would not have been nearly as useful as learning a popular library and building connections.<p>And that said, I&#x27;d say git problems are <i>the norm</i> especially with newer devs. Having that one person on the team who is a git-master is invaluable when you&#x27;ve made a mess.')
