Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=[25618020], score=None, time=1609630329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615429, text='From my understanding of GNSS (I did some research on it in school, about a month full-time), that only works if you have a clock synchronized to a few nanoseconds and of course up to date satellite information. This is very plausible if you do it once a second, because in 1 second your quartz doesn&#x27;t drift that much or you can count cpu clock cycles perhaps, and the ephemerides don&#x27;t change that often.<p>But once you move indoors and lose signal regularly and have a much higher noise to signal ratio, I very much doubt this can still work. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t work in the garden, so most of the day that GNSS unit would still be listening and calculating (as I understand, the code division multiplexing means you kind of brute force the various codes until one produces a signal instead of noise) and might not even get a fix at all (my phone takes a few minutes next to a window when there is concrete on all sides except for that narrow view of the sky, and this 2018 phone is already orders of magnitude better than my previous Galaxy Note 2 was). I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, but I would highly doubt that it consistently gets a fix in 2ms, or even 200ms, in the place where you spend most of your time.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s mostly useless indoors anyway, but so you&#x27;d have to manually toggle it every time you go in- or outside, or somehow configure a home location where it turns off (would work great during COVID) if it has such a feature, though I wouldn&#x27;t know how it would figure out when you&#x27;ve left home in that case. (WiFi comes to mind as an obvious solution, but then how do you explain to the user that it won&#x27;t track your GPS while that WiFi is in range? It just seems like they&#x27;d drop the auto-off feature at this point.)')
