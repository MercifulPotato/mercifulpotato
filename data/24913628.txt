Mainly because all those apps contain links, which open in the browser. So it makes more sense to use them in the browser.<p>Twitter on android is a PWA (i think). When you try to add a twitter home screen shortcut, it creates a shortcut to the twitter PWA, which opens in its own fullscreen chrome wrapper, not in chrome like other web links . But that&#x27;s NOT what i want, e.g. i want the links i visit to stay in my history, and to be able to switch between different tabs. So i end up not using the PWA either.<p>That said, twitter&#x27;s web app is good because it doesnt try to do too much. Every app that pretends it can handle animations&#x2F;loading&#x2F;fancy ux on the browser just fails because of the choppiness. I think SPA web app makers do not test their apps beyond localhost so they dont see how bad it \ncan perform in real world conditions')
