In FPTP, the candidate with the most votes just wins, even if that is only 15%. A second round for the two most popular candidates is still better than that.<p>The issue in your example is of course that both parties send all their candidates to the election, instead of just their most popular one, and that dilutes the vote, but the same would happen if they did that in FPTP.<p>It&#x27;s only in systems like approval voting or instant run-off that parties can afford to send all their candidates.')
