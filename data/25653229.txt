Nominal home prices basically stayed constant for about 2 years, then resumed marching upwards.<p>Also note that the actual bloodbath happened from 2006-2012 (when the housing crash took prices down about 35%).  It does not correspond to any major increase in interest rates.  The primary driver seems to be foreclosures, which in turn was driven by ARMs and poor lending standards.  Conclusion might be that interest rates just don&#x27;t matter that much as long as a majority of people are on fixed-rate mortgages, while they can matter a lot if folks are on ARMs they can&#x27;t afford.  (Interestingly, we may get a similar crash of multi-family housing in the near future, since all the tenants not paying rent now is having a similar effect on mortgages.)')
