And consequently they&#x27;re not willing to seriously invest in tools and processes that would make WFH maximally productive.<p>Suppose for example that Google enacted this policy:<p>(1) They reimburse each employee up to $30k to upgrade their home office, including soundproofing. After Google trained local builders on effective soundproofing strategies and designs.<p>(2) Google provides (with installation) a Google Jamboard to facilitate virtual whiteboard sessions.<p>(3) Google updates their team rules and meeting rules s.t. if <i>anyone</i> in a team or meeting is remote, then the <i>entire</i> team or meeting is remote.<p>(4) Google invests in networking infrastructure (as needed) to ensure decent network connectivity from the employee&#x27;s home office to Google&#x27;s internal networks.<p>I imagine that all FAANG companies could afford this. The open question, to me at least, is whether or not that magnitude of investment would make WFH a net win for those companies. But if they see WFH as a short term measure, I assume the answer is no.')
