A lot of poor people in third world countries instead use and indeed share incredibly old cars from the 60s-70s, or motorcycles. It is often literally a matter of life and death - if you get stung by a scorpion in the Atlas mountains, unless your family or village have a car and fuel for it, you&#x27;re just not getting medical care, which is why you&#x27;ll see many such very old cars there. This is a real issue - the micro-village in the mountains where part of my family lives had one of my aunts die as a baby because a scorpion bit her and she couldn&#x27;t be brought to a hospital due to a lack of transportation. They bought a CitroÃ«n 2CV after, and it&#x27;s still used up to this day.<p>Now, of course, like all non-progressive subsidies, they benefit the wealthy disproportionately, because they make disproportionate amounts of money. But for the bottom 20%, those 7% of the subsidies are a lot, because they often make less than 7% of the income.<p>So a workable solution would be to make these subsidies progressive, tied to income and consumption, but unless you&#x27;ve lived there it&#x27;s difficult to understand just how bad removing them altogether would be. It could literally lead to revolts.<p>Also, that study is hugely problematic because it takes the entirety of the world together, instead of operating at national scales. I already agreed that for richer countries this should be phased out, and subsidies are likely to be much higher in richer, often non-producing countries, than in poor countries.<p>Also, before they got solar panels and batteries around 8 years ago, they were still reliant on kerosene for lighting.')
