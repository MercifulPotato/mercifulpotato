The target of the measure is not to prohibit being outside (although that is the first-order effect), but to prevent mixing households.<p>The real reason is that you&#x27;re not allowed to coop up with guests in your home, but the police is not allowed to enter private residences and enforce that. So the night-time curfew is now being floated as the one thing that they can enforce to discourage people spending their evening with friends. Of course, it does nothing to discourage day-time visits, and I suspect evenings-with-friends will now turn into adult sleepover parties, but I guess we&#x27;re still big on symbolism.<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;d be better if the government just declared the battle against Covid lost. They&#x27;ve tried for a year to appeal to the better nature of our citizens, and those citizens have democratically elected not to care about Covid. But at the same time, I know that openly tossing the towel will only lead to more people ignoring the measures.')
