For that, there aren&#x27;t any companies (that I&#x27;m aware of) offering services; that would also be really tough to do, because your database data model&#x2F;schema for that is always going to be application-dependent. So I think that Mapbox and co fill that particular role fairly well. But, I don&#x27;t believe they offer route planning (it looks like there are other companies that do, but for DDG, their SLAs would be important), and route planning needs access to the raw data as well. So really I think the biggest impact would be in improved tooling.<p>If I had the time, I&#x27;d personally focus on writing a loader replacement (ie, imposm&#x2F;osm2pgsql &quot;competitor&quot;) that:<p>1. supported arbitrary data transforms into postgres -- basically, can load data into any database schema, do on-load data transforms, enrichment, i18n, etc.<p>2. was distributable via some distributed message queue (I&#x27;d personally choose SQS, but you could do something like celery for less-opinionated solution)<p>3. was <i></i>not<i></i> opinionated about deployment compute environment (ie, neither requiring nor forbidding containerization)<p>Basically, the ability to have a proper, production-grade, not-just-meant-for-slippymaps ETL pipeline on OSM data would be a really big deal. I haven&#x27;t ever seen an open source solution for that.')
