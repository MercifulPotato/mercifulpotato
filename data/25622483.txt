And then I started an experimental project to &quot;disrupt&quot; our own company and decentralize the Web even further (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intercoin.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intercoin.org</a>). We still have a long way to go, but I think just like the Web unleashed trillions in value that could never be built on top of AOL, we will see the same with Web 2.0 (FAMGA) etc.<p>But it will take time. Open source collaboration is the tortoise, closed source competition is the hare.')
