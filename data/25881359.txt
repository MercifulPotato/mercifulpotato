I was tasked to start working on a project and was told I could use &quot;whatever [I] want.&quot; So me and the other frontend guy started working using Clojurescript with Reagent and Re-frame (highly recommend). Save for a few hiccups along the way the project was stable and fast.<p>It went swimmingly right up until QA was more or less told not to file any issues found, and then those issues were used as a reason we needed to use a TypeScript and Material-UI app he wrote over a weekend and said was &quot;almost done.&quot; The bugs in question turned out to be minor visual bugs, and like I said, none of them were filed or even mentioned until this replacement got dropped in our lap. In fact, no problems of any kind were reported until this moment.<p>Instead it took another 6-8 months to get to feature parity with the app we&#x27;d already developed and now thrown away (or feature &quot;parody&quot; as my boss put it), it was full of bugs, development is slow and pretty directionless, my boss gets bored and contributes code that runs in the O(n^12) range (yes, really) before languishing in a draft PR for months and then getting dumped on us to actually implement for real, and it&#x27;s been a year and a half with no end even remotely in sight.<p>I really want to find somewhere else but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a realistic goal right now. Not to mention my enjoyment of programming died years ago and I haven&#x27;t written code for fun in as long as I care to remember.')
