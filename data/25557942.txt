That worked.<p>I also tried adding the line to a new file &#x2F;etc&#x2F;binfmt.d&#x2F;APE.conf, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work (after a reboot); after renaming the file to zz_APE.conf, it did work after a reboot. systemd&#x27;s binfmt.d registers files in alphabetical filename order, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s important that &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;binfmt.d&#x2F;wine.conf is registered before the APE handler, meaning its filename must be alphabetically after &quot;wine.conf&quot;.')
