If you have a two income household, all that work still has to be done, so you go to work and then come home to a second job. Making the second job the full time job of the other person means each person now has an extra 20 hours a week. You could spend 10 hours a week at a social club and still be spending more time with your kids than you do now.<p>Meanwhile the money from the second job gets eaten up by commuting and childcare costs etc., and being thrust into a higher tax bracket, but also from having to outbid other two income households for artificially scarce housing in good school districts, which you can&#x27;t avoid by not doing it yourself and so it&#x27;s prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. The two income trap is a real thing.')
