And a public accommodation like a hotel or a restaurant or a grocery store cannot reject paying customers, with narrow exceptions.<p>Written in regards to SCOTUS precedent of instructions for private companies, it’s hard to see how the tech monopolies are not “common carrier” if not also a “public accommodation” depending on how you want to look at it.<p>&gt; The result is our present situation, in which some of the indispensable industries in the U.S. economy, social life, the media and politics are allowed to make their own rules, in the form of ever-changing “terms of service” that nobody reads;<p>Either way... it seems like this can (should) not continue  this way. Like everything hyper-partisan now; I expect we only see a reaction when the pendulum swings and for a brief moment “both sides” can agree something is wrong, until “the other side” switches there position and this is OK now.')
