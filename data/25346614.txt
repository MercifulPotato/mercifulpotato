I attempted for a few months to do that for my Pixel 3a (which in theory is officially supported). When I followed the official guide to compile android, I found that a LOT of things did not work that I expected it to, including: VoLTE, SMS over LTE, and wifi-calling. The phone was useless on LTE, I had to force it onto 3G for any phone functionality. I also had a weird issue where a new SIM would refuse to work in it, I had to activate a new SIM in a Google Stock android, then it would work in AOSP.<p>I had to manually search through the Google image to find what libraries existed, manually extract them, add them to my AOSP build, THEN compile. I was only able to do this because others had done much of the grunt work already (i.e. GrapheneOS), but when it was &quot;upgraded&quot; to Android 10, it all changed and all my work went out the window. Now I just use GrapheneOS and accept the comprimises I have to deal with.')
