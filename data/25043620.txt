The fact that some types behave this way does not mean moves are destructive. They&#x27;re still non-destructive. Indeed you&#x27;re still supposed to call the destructor after a move, and the destructor very well _could_ do something in general. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t happen to make any difference for typical implementations of some types like unique_ptr.<p>In fact there are people who <i>have</i> wanted destructive moves in C++, because they found the current non-destructive moves inadequate, but I don&#x27;t believe the feature has ever been added. Look up destructive moves to find discussions on the issue.')
