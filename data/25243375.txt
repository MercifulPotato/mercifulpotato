If you are lucky you might get 2% a year but that&#x27;s very little to live on anywhere in the U.S. Even if you could live on that inflation will eat up the buying power over time.<p>Think about investing money in real estate. With a million dollars you could buy an apartment building live in one of the units and manage the others. Over time you will have enough money to retire. The one plus in this type of investing is that you have a lot of control over how successful your investment will be.<p>You&#x27;ll need to educate yourself on the intricacies of apartment building rentals but the success is very likely. Also, Real Estate is a long term investment so once you get involved expect to have your money tied up for many years.<p>You did the hard part of saving the money now it&#x27;s time to move on to the next step. Good luck!')
