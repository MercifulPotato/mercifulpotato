On my Windows 10 work machine I constantly get pop-ups begging for credentials and attention for stuff that I simply don&#x27;t care about or that doesn&#x27;t need the credentials. Some of these are particularly aggressive and will always steal keyboard focus from any window, while daring to put up another pop up notification near the systray (which are so extremely important according to microsoft, that these notifications have even higher priority than the pop-up menu of the systray -- what&#x27;cha thinking Microsoft, do I wanna interact with the thing I just clicked on to open, or with the thing you pooped up over it under my cursor?!) when I dismiss them. I made a spreadsheet once and got about two dozen work-interruptions from Microsoft popups.<p>Not to mention the absurd aggressiveness of Microsoft Teams notifications. I avoid the app when I&#x27;m not actively participating in a call (it randomly uses too much CPU and is also <i>obviously</i> tracking everything you do on the PC), so I usually have Teams quarantined in a Firefox tab. Other software manages to have hit-me-once notifications, but not Teams. Somewhere someone writes a message? Let&#x27;s put multiple notifications on the screen and start bleeping away. What, you didn&#x27;t look at the message? Let&#x27;s send a reminder email!<p>Modern Microsoft software would make Kafka cringe, for we are morons allowing this.')
