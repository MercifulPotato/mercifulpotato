Another potential solution is a kind of service that will enable users to look for articles that meet some criteria, and the service could prioritize articles of higher quality. Then you wouldn&#x27;t need to browse Medium, you&#x27;d just look for what you want and the service would recommend quality articles.<p>Of course the question is always how to properly rank an article&#x27;s quality. I&#x27;d say the best approach is to crowdsource it - develop an algorithm that takes into account how many other highly ranked articles reference a given article, and give a higher rank to articles that have more references.<p>If you do this, make sure to give the algorithm a clever name. Ideally name it after yourself, unless your name is Smith. You&#x27;ll never do well with a business built around something called SmithRank.<p>Now if your last name happened to be something related the things you&#x27;re ranking, like, say...&quot;Article&quot;...wow, call it ArticleRank!<p>Just remember you heard it first here on HackerNews.')
