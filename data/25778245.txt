Obviously, the vast majority of people using the OS are going to have internet access so assuming actions based on internet access and then failing if you can&#x27;t connect is accounted for, regardless of the reason (weak connection, no connection, etc). I don&#x27;t see how anyone can call this behavior an oversight when it works exactly as intended.')
