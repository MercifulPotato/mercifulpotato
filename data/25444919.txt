IMHO the thing that needs sorting out is the relation between Mozilla the company and Mozilla the Foundation.<p>I just browsed the website of the Mozilla Foundation and to my surprise learned that Firefox development is not one of its responsibilities. I was assuming that that was in fact its primary mission. It&#x27;s not apparently. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and it&#x27;s just a vague website but it reads to me like they are spending their time doing activism and marketing and that they do not employ any developers.<p>The reason the foundation leading product development would make sense to me is that having no commercial conflicts of interests are kind of a per-requisite to do what most users (including me) value in Firefox, is to protect their privacy, commit to open standards (over any competitive advantages that proprietary&#x2F;exclusive features could bring), be as secure as they can be, etc.<p>Except it seems that Firefox development is currently not structured like that and Firefox is instead an OSS product developed by a commercial for profit business competing with other companies backing a different OSS product (i.e. chromium) where users have some concerns about the conflicts of interests of the companies backing that (e.g. Google and MS) with respect to exactly the things I value in Firefox.<p>So, given that, what&#x27;s the point of having the foundation and what&#x27;s the point of Firefox as a commercial product (other than guilt tripping Google into keeping the money coming)? I don&#x27;t mean pretty words and mission statements of a commercial entity. But what&#x27;s the point for users picking one company over another? They are both companies that ultimately are run by their share holders; not by their users. A foundation is different: it serves its members and its mission without a goal to enrich shareholders.')
