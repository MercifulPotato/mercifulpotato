I don&#x27;t know what holiday you are talking about, Thanksgiving is not really a thing, until today I never heard of constitutional day.<p>Not being in the new cycle is less to do with newsworthiness and more to do with mainstream being either biased or unable to talk too badly about the government. While Arnab Goswami&#x27;s high profile arrest recently is not good indicator, the news not really critical of the current government is pretty obvious<p>Characterizing Kerala as communist state is over simplifying. Kerala always ruled by coalition of small parties, Congress and CPI-M are just single largest parties in those coalitions, and many times communist parties are part of the Congress coalition and vice versa. The smaller parties are reflection of diverse backgrounds of people of Kerala- broadly top third of the state is largely Muslim, central Kerala has lot of Christians and south a lot of hindus etc. IUML(Muslim League) parties have strong presence in north part of the state for example.<p>&quot;Highest unemployment in Kerala&quot; is very mis-leading statistic, Kerala has much better reporting of such stats than many parts of the  country, and also given its huge dependence on remittances from middle east and their larger participation in foreign markets for jobs is nuanced to be captured here, you travel across karnataka(your state) and kerala you would not believe Kerala has lot more unemployment.<p>Yes the numbers and articles are misleading, but Indian media coverage of the strike and the protest has been very poor especially in the context of 24x7 breaking news cycle.')
