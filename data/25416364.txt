I mean this in the way that fish can be put in the loop for hydroponic, chickens to reduce pests, or pigs&#x2F;sheep used to rotivate fields. Not in the way that we devote vast amounts of land to pasture. (although there are questions to answer about how to manage rich grasslands that are carbon sinks.)')
