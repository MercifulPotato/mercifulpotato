RISC-V has in relative terms much stronger benefit used in co-processors than ARM. That will drive RISC-V adoption in this area.<p>However for general CPUs the RISC-V is not as obvious, although we have seen some early claims of some really efficient RISC-V implementation with much higher clock frequency than ARM at lower watt usage. So sure, when we no more, it may turn out that RISC-V is also the superior choice for main CPU. But at the moment, that is more of an unknown.<p>If we for the moment only assume a slight advantage to RISC-V over ARM, then ARM will stay ahead of the game, because it is already entrenched. People have lots of tooling and software for ARM. You don&#x27;t switch to a whole new CPU architecture without clear benefit.<p>But there is an interesting argument&#x2F;speculation to be made about what happens in the wider PC industry in response to M1. By the time PC makers start getting serious to meet the challenge from M1, it may have become apparent that higher performance RISC-V are possible. Thus it could possibly encourage Apple competitors to attempt to leapfrog Apple by going towards RISC-V instead as main CPU.<p>But nothing happens without Microsoft, so who knows. A lot of coordination needs to happen.')
