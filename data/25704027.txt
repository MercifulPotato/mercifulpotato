Over time, it&#x27;s grown to have full keyframe animation for all text and image&#x2F;video clip attributes, so it is actually pretty capable short of using a desktop video editing&#x2F;fx package.<p>That said, the UX is bad and I should feel bad :) . I made the deliberate choice up front to focus on the underlying data model and internal APIs rather than polishing the UI - as such, it is very much an engineer interface. It would be more usable with some demo videos or call-to-action helpers for new users, but really the UX just needs reworked. Especially around animation&#x2F;keyframing.<p>On the bright side, the clean data model and content addressable assets leave the path clear to add things like collaborative multi-user meme editing, git like meme-forking(and diffing?), and so forth.<p>Started it about 3 years ago when I had a period of mostly free time to play. It&#x27;s been idle for a long time due to starting a family and getting consulting momentum, but I&#x27;m intending to make the time this year to polish the UX to the point of general usability and experiment with promotion&#x2F;monetization. Failing that, I&#x27;ll probably just open source it and write a couple of blog posts about the internals.<p>It is more or less a static web app, with no server side function short of some optional stats collection. It&#x27;s written in Clojurescript&#x2F;Clojure and uses <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonsky&#x2F;rum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonsky&#x2F;rum</a> as a React wrapper and\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kagami&#x2F;ffmpeg.js&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kagami&#x2F;ffmpeg.js&#x2F;</a> to import most animation formats and export gifs&#x2F;webm fully in browser (I don&#x27;t want to pay real server costs to encode animation).')
