When learning try to not pick it up with you hands, use a welder clamp or some grips. Assume all metal is hot, but when learning you are inevitably going to pick one up, we all did it, we all do it. You learn quick to not trust that metal is not hot.<p>And another tip, for those of you that do look to get a machine if you are in the US don&#x27;t buy a 120v welder, they will do the job for really thin metal but about the time you get the hang of welding you will say to your self I should have bought a 240v machine. You pretty much outgrow a 120v machine the moment you grasp the process. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they have their place like fixing panels on cars but they are very limiting on the thickness of metal you can weld.')
