The rest were editorial articles or blog articles!<p>ONE! Talk about disinformation.<p>Too bad it&#x27;s a pointless study.  Everyone knows masks stop droplets.<p>But do masks stop Covid at a community level... given the fact that one is applying a plague vector directly to one&#x27;s respiratory tract for a virus that stays on surfaces for days?<p>Sweden and Norway had no mask mandate and they haven&#x27;t had significant number of coronavirus deaths in months. Maybe 20 since July. And they both have less per capita deaths than America.<p>Meanwhile 93% of Americans believe in mask usage and we&#x27;re entering a third wave of coronavirus in America.<p>I don&#x27;t know. You can tell me if masks work or not.<p>Good thing health experts are never wrong.  Oh wait except for that Thalidomide thing and the flipper children. Oh and little mistake called the Tuskagee study. Other than that though they have a great track record! Lets trust the health experts unquestioningly and demonize people who want their reccomendations to be held to a higher level of scientific accountability!')
