With that being said, I love the place. However, if not for my cabal of really close friends, I don&#x27;t think I would stay here -- and these are friends from my university days back in America.<p>I can contrast it with another city I have lived in (on and off for 2-3 years), and that&#x27;s Seoul. In my first year in Seoul, I probably met more close friends than in a decade of living in Tokyo. I&#x27;m an introvert through and through, so unless people open up to me first, there is going to be silence. Tokyo has a way of making you comfortable with the mundane.<p>Seoul is just this bustling amazing city with an energy of &quot;anything is possible&quot; in the air. Tokyo seems as though it has already had its heyday and is on a slow, silent, but peaceful decline. I love my little neighborhood, and have made a life for myself in Tokyo, but I can&#x27;t honestly recommend it as a place to move to, unless you have some deep interest in Japan or family connections.<p>If you are interested in the startup scene, it&#x27;s here but nothing on the scale that you would see in the US. I&#x27;d say Seoul is the place to be for startups now -- the Korean government is pretty much throwing money at people with ideas.<p>I&#x27;ll always call Japan home, but I definitely see myself leaving Tokyo in the near future, if not for another city, then back to Korea.<p>To give some context, I&#x27;m a male 30 something PoC.')
