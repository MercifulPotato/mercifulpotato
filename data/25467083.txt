Fines, sure, but attempting to break it up? No way. These companies are insanely valuable to the United States.<p>The tech sector is one of the most influential sectors, the incoming administration leans even more pro Silicon Valley than the previous (which didn&#x27;t do much to oppose the tech sector apart from a sternly worded five minute interview with Tucker).<p>The republicans also just pretend their opposition to make sure they keep their followers outraged over the &quot;elite liberals in California&quot;.\n Most likely they just want a bigger piece of the &quot;influence pie&quot; and when they float ideas like breaking them up, it&#x27;s just a negotiation tactic to get a bigger slice from that &quot;pie&quot;.<p>I also don&#x27;t see the EU seriously challenge the American tech sector, as the US would not tolerate such an attack on their companies. The US has thousand ways to fight back, increasing tariffs, <i>decreasing</i> military presence, persecuting shady characters from the EU and more (im sure they can get more creative than I just did).')
