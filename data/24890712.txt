And the second law of thermodynamics being what it is, that ability is relative to the space you have (assuming you&#x27;re using similar cooling technologies in both cases).<p>Laptops being power-conscious, they&#x27;re usually much closer to the point of maximum efficiency on the power curve. In that sense you get better performance per watt. But that&#x27;s negated by the increased front cost.')
