The best we can hope for is to keep conflict to a manageable level. We&#x27;ve had numerous assassinations in this country in the past, and it held together. The threat of a possible assassination of a right-wing figure absolutely does not rise to the level of &quot;existential threat&quot;. If you don&#x27;t want to call it &quot;adequately handled&quot;, fine, I&#x27;m not going to argue those semantic distinctions especially as it&#x27;s not necessary for us to have the same perspectives here. I&#x27;m just saying that society is still intact, and would still be intact even if Mike Pence had been attacked.<p>Other than the personal tragedy to Pence and his family, the worst outcome of an assassination would be people struggling to reconcile their ecstatic glee that Pence had keen killed with their furious rage that right-wingers attacked someone. If anything, division and conflict within the Republican Party only seems to strengthen their opposition. These events lead to less power held by the right, not more. Republicans shooting themselves in the foot is not an &quot;existential threat to civilization&quot;.')
