If a major superhighway had an accident blocking traffic, there would be personnel stationed at exchanges to help re-route the traffic, though that often occurs too late to prevent a bunch of backups. At any rate, people using Google Maps, Waze, etc. would see the accident and would likely be redirected to alternate routes that would normally be much slower - and would also be slowed down by the influx of higher than normal traffic.<p>The fact that the internet still <i>worked</i> albeit much slower than usual leads me to believe that something similar happened. While normally my internet traffic might go through a major hub in NYC and then onward to various carriers and hosts, etc. it had to be re-routed around that hub that is normally sub-optimal, and also ill-equipped to handle the spillover. (And in some cases, bandwidth was saturated, and failed altogether for some users for certain usage.)')
