I collect Scotch, rare beers, meads, and I used to help organize a liquor tasting&#x2F;sharing group. I can definitely understand wine tasting notes - I may not be able to tell a vintage by taste but I can tell different styles of reds apart. I just don&#x27;t think I like wine that much, which I&#x27;d assert is a preference.')
