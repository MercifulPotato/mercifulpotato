MobileEye seems to be ahead of Tesla with a lidar-less system without such data (but they have partnerships with car makers to collect mapping data). From what I hear, companies like Waymo don&#x27;t want more data, the bottlenecks are engineering.<p>In self-driving, you basically have 3 parts - perception, prediction and planning. Perception is the easy part (if you have lidars). Tesla and AFAIK others rely heavily on NNs for perception. The real challenge is prediction and planning. To what extent are NNs involved here in Tesla&#x27;s system is unknown, probably not that much. Overall, I don&#x27;t think that Tesla has a fundamentally different approach than others.')
