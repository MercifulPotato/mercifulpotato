What do people expect?<p>Let&#x27;s take the example of Jesus: I&#x27;ve been teleported to Judea, around the time of crucifixion. Who expects me to be able to just stroll up on Calvary and have a look at how it happened?<p>Who expects me to just visit the pyramids of Gizeh? And if someone asks me what I&#x27;m doing at the construction site for the pharaoh&#x27;s grave, I simply say &quot;just having a look, I thought it&#x27;s interesting&quot;?<p>Let&#x27;s change the question a bit: If someone from a thousand years from now could choose to visit our time, what would he see and experience?<p>Simple, approximate answer: what I&#x27;m seeing and experiencing.<p>And I have to say that I cannot give a definitive account of Bin Laden&#x27;s death. Or Trump&#x27;s shady deals. Or what exactly happened to Nawalny. Or how the German government party decided to just introduce gay marriage (virtually without any forewarning, just like that).<p>Living at the same time as some historic event (even if it&#x27;s not recognized at such until later) isn&#x27;t really the same as having access to it.<p>(I admit that I first overlooked the invisibility option, but even then, it&#x27;s still hard to enter the Oval Office, I suppose.)')
