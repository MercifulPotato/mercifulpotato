My point is that it pretty much sounds like you&#x27;re using BTC as an &quot;oracle&quot; (and of course, you&#x27;re using BTC as settlement, but that&#x27;s a given, and also doesn&#x27;t qualify as being &quot;on bitcoin&quot;). Stacks is a separate ledger that pegs itself to Bitcoin, not &quot;on&quot;. &quot;Smart contracts on Bitcoin&quot; would be something that&#x27;s entirely built on the Bitcoin ledger and every smart contract transaction is a Bitcoin transaction that settles.')
