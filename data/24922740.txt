We could build denser without worrying about that.  A fair amount of inner city traffic is people cruising around looking for parking too.  Also, outlying rail or subway stops should really have a lot of development around them but often in the US they&#x27;re surrounded by parking lots for people commuting in to work.  Reducing the need for parking really helps in this case.<p>Also, people currently have to buy a car big enough for their greatest needs.  You don&#x27;t need a large a car when commuting in to work as when you&#x27;re taking a road trip with your family but if you&#x27;re thinking of buying a car you need one to do both.  So hopefully we see the average car on the road being much smaller than they are now.')
