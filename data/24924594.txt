It is not an extension of a thought process (as pouring a cup of tea is not an extension of our digestive process), it&#x27;s simply something trivial that we do and immediately discard the memories of that as of having no importance for us. Humans are - I believe - goal-oriented, so whenever we want to discover something that&#x27;s our goal, not the process that led us there (unless something memorable happens along that process).<p>IMHO, what we remember is the task and its outcome, not the trivialities that brought us from one to another. Which makes me wonder why the last question puzzles people.<p>I don&#x27;t readily remember my search history, because I just discard the memories of reaching for something (unless there was something exceptional, which is rare). It&#x27;s like driving to the restaurant, when there are multiple ways to get to the place. I do remember the outcome (dinner) but unless something happened on the road I probably would need to think&#x2F;reconstruct if I&#x27;d be suddenly asked about the particular roads I took.<p>Same with the articles - I do remember what I was interested in today (as opposed to &quot;what I&#x27;ve searched for&quot;, a subtle difference), and what were the results - things I&#x27;ve read top-to-bottom. Although maybe not in true historical order, but typically the last one is still correct.<p>To summarize:<p>- &quot;How often&quot; - unimportant, as the count rarely has a value. Need to enumerate and count things, and that&#x27;s quite a tedious mental process.<p>- &quot;What was the last thing before the last&quot; - typically unimportant, as historical order of unrelated events rarely has a value. Needs some mental processing to sort things.<p>- &quot;What is the last thing you read&quot; - beats me, I do remember what I&#x27;ve read. May need some mental processing (going through my &quot;reading history&quot; and confirming that I&#x27;ve reached this by searching), but besides a possible surprise factor not really a puzzling question.')
