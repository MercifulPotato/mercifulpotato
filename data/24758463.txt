Little quality, poor ideas, and little personality. Mostly, they are of the nerdy type, like the vast majority of people working in tech, so by inclination and culture are not leaders, but followers or the aloof type, and they much prefer to work on their own than in teams. It pays off to go with the flow in corporate.<p>Source: I had managers (including Directors and VPs) at some of the tech companies everybody talks about that were they to take any decision in which life and livelihood of people are at stake, it would be one of those dreams after which you wake up drenched in sweat and you make the sign of the cross you are just working in a tech company.')
