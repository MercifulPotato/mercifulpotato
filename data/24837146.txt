Twitter is estimated at 326 million.  TikTok is the closest thing to a true Facebook competitor with 800M users, and a large share of them are probably concentrated in China -- and the Trump administration already tried to get them banned.  (I&#x27;m excluding messaging services and YouTube here since they&#x27;re a different niche).<p>Source is Statista: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;272014&#x2F;global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;272014&#x2F;global-social-net...</a>')
