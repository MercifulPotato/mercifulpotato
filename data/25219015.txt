It&#x27;s the truth. At this point in time, and since the rise of the internet, no computer system has been completely secure. Things will change for the better over time, but not if we placate the people &quot;running the show&quot;.<p>I assume from your comment that you to think that &quot;covering ass&quot; adds value to security, it does not. Because if you, like me, judge this product as being redundant, then what value is truly added? What if a competent team of pentesters is rejected and favor of this tool? Then you made the world less secure. An organization not competent enough to run a security scanner will certainly not see the benefit of this product.<p>The current status in cyber security is that of safety in engineering three centuries ago: &quot;This bridge is secure because we walked two oxen over it, and it did not collapse.&quot;.<p>&quot;Our bank is secure, because no hacker has stolen our funds yet.&quot;')
