I refuse  to concede that words on a screen will ever be something anyone “needs protection” from (short of actual doxxing, stalking and IRL harassment).<p>Have people forgotten “sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me?” A block&#x2F;ignore button should be sufficient. We don’t need platforms editorializing or censoring content.<p>People seek out content that makes them angry (ragebait) and then blame the platforms for disseminating it.<p>Walk away from the screen. Close your eyes.
