Maybe it could have been slightly more tactfully worded but I would not classify this a &#x27;haranguing&#x27; and  _vertigo makes a very salient point. There is no shortage of questionable material and businesses that are allowed to be monetized and advertise on Facebook. It seems that this particular company may have become too high profile and is being punished not for violating Facebook&#x27;s vague terms of service but for the risk of bringing light to it and unwanted scrutiny.')
