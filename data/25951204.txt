Tonight, when I want to watch a program on BBC Iplayer, I need to switch on the kindle fire stick, wait for it to load, find the iplayer app and wait for 30 seconds until it loads, search for a channel, with each character I type taking 0.5 seconds to show up on the screen (no kidding), select the channel and wait 10 seconds for it to buffer.<p>When I was a kid, I just used to press one button on the front of the tv and it was on in less than a second.<p>Not sure what my point is really but thereâ€™s something not quite right with this situation.
