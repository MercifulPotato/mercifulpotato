Opinions probably diverge.<p>If you think through it, the billionaires don&#x27;t have all that much real resource to be used - eg, J. Bezos owns an island in Hawaii. So say the government takes his island off him and redistributes it to low-wage earners in New York - they can&#x27;t actually use the island for anything. They&#x27;d sell their stake in it and go for real resources locally. The actual real resources they consume are going to be made up for by the upper-middle class having less.<p>If anything is done about income inequality, it is probably going to involve bringing the above-median types more into line with the below-median earners. There aren&#x27;t many ways around that - low earners need real resources, not paper money. Billionaires tend not to have the amount of real resources that are needed.')
