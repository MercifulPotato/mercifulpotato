I web searched and Google told me 10TB so I went with that.<p>I think we&#x27;re still within the information revolution and to put it into perspective let&#x27;s look at the textile revolution.<p>Clothes used to be expensive. Someone maybe owned 1 or 2 sets, often passed down from their parents.  You could easily illustrate your wealth by wearing many layers of fine material. Simply owning many clothes was sufficient to signify great power and prestige.<p>Then the textile revolution came and today durable well fitted clothes are cheap. Unless you&#x27;re a fashionista or have children, they are almost unmeasurable in ones budget (children used to wear dresses because it was a practical solution for one garment throughout growing childhood)<p>But this took generations AFTER the mechanical loom and all the technology existed. The society of clothes making also needed to be overhauled and that took arguably a century.<p>That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at with information. Our industrialism can create the material requirements for the storing and transmission of information readily, sustainably and cheaply. However our cultural and societal overhaul to accommodate it is still maybe only a 1&#x2F;3 done.<p>After the printed word became really cheap with the advertisement supported penny presses of the 1830s it still took about 100 years of public education advocacy before you could safely assume every adult knew how to read. These things take decades because it&#x27;s a function of generational churn. It&#x27;s at the pace of human lives<p>I have a partially written book on this interplay I&#x27;ll eventually finish one day... maybe people will be able to pick up used unread copies for $2 - I look forward to that day.')
