I have had doctors mock and scoff at my RSI related pains, and people who don&#x27;t understand computer usage-related injuries give me all sorts of well-meaning advice.<p>I&#x27;ve stopped going to docs and listening to such people, and instead focused on overall strengthening. This strategy is mostly based on what kind folks at HN have shared in various threads as having worked for their RSI, and suffice to say, it has helped (not cured) much more than any other advice.<p>As a former marathon runner, I tend to stick to the adage &quot;listen to your own body&quot; along with medical advice.')
