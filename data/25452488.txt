Seems equally plausible that the CEO stepped down as a condition of not being blamed for gross incompetence (ie help whitewashing this taint on his record) while staying silent so that everyone (including him) gets a nice payday and can move on to some other area?<p>Thereâ€™s lots of possible explanations. Why not urge a full public accounting so that everyone can review if any wrongdoing took place?')
