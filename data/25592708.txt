If author would know Java they would write that Java is better.<p>For example combining data with logic does not need to happen in Excel. Someone who does this might make the same bad practice in Python too.<p>Also there are no thoughts that there are many bad Excels, but there are also many bad programs (in Python and every other language). There is some sort of magic thinking that a rookie who switched from Excel to Python will somehow not produce spaghetti code. What is not true at all. Those Excels are much easier to debug by the business side. Any program is a black box.<p>Author makes empty claims that &quot;excel forumals are long&quot; or that models have many tabs. If the Python program gets as big it might also become a mess.<p>How many times have you heard that the new programmer looks on old code and says that it is spaghetti? Nearly every time. Nealry every time they want a rewrite too. And Excel just works.<p>I doubt author used Python programs made by others. There are no comments on that. Also eas authors code reviewed by a real programmer? Author is self thought so odds are that they create some really awful code and dont even know it.')
