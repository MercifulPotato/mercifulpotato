(Yet I know I am glossing over a lot of technical details, still cheaper than what we normally send up).<p>Robot is disposable and goes down with the debris. Falcon-9 returns to land for the next robot.<p>But in my super-fantastical dream, the robot would detach from the nearby falcon 9 stage, do the pushing on the debris, then return and reattach to the falcon-9 (Opening and closing fairing) and the falcon 9 brings the robot back.<p>Refuel and repeat.')
