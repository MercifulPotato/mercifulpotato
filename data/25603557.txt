Item(by='dsr_', descendants=None, kids=[25603679], score=None, time=1609512231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25603502, text='Corel Netwinder, single core Intel-made ARM, 2 ethernet ports (10 and 10&#x2F;100), VGA, serial, and a 2.5&quot; PATA disk; I think I splurged on the 64MB version and paid something like $800 for it.<p>My nostalgia for it is tempered by knowing that a Raspberry Pi 4B is better in basically every single way and ridiculously cheaper.')
