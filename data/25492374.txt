Item(by='ohazi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608528818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492030, text='I like the T480. I have one that I completely refurbished this way, and another one (for work) where I ended up buying and replacing a flaky display cable myself (~$20) even though it was still under warranty because Lenovo&#x27;s service department couldn&#x27;t reproduce an intermittent failure and I got tired of shipping it back to them.<p>Performance is fine, the 1440p display is great, it can idle at 5W, and working on it is easy. The dual-battery system is... weird. I like the concept, but it&#x27;s been mildly annoying in practice, which I think is why Lenovo ended up dropping it.<p>This is the last T-series model they made with a hot-swappable battery. There&#x27;s an internal Li-Po pack and you can choose between another flush-fitting Li-Po or slightly chunkier 6-cell&#x2F;9-cell cylindrical packs for the external battery.<p>The charge controller allows you to set charge start&#x2F;stop thresholds for each battery (e.g. stop charging at 80%, don&#x27;t top off the cell until it drops below 70%), but it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> let you control which battery is discharged first, or when the switchover happens. It always discharges the &quot;healthier&quot; cell first, based on measured capacity &#x2F; nominal capacity, and it always switches to the other cell at 5% remaining. I think their intent was to allow the two batteries to wear out evenly. But if you want to actually use the full capacity of your cells, you end up putting a lot of stress on the first battery by leaving it at 5% for hours or days. Leave it like this for slightly too long and you&#x27;ll damage it, and the battery system will start discharging the <i>other</i> battery first, until you damage that one, etc. Hot swapping doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should, because if the internal battery discharged first, but the switchover was yesterday, it&#x27;s probably self-discharged to below 5%, and may not be able to provide enough power to survive the hot-swap. It would be nice if you could change the switchover threshold (e.g. to 20%), and nicer still if you could tell it which battery you want it to discharge.<p>The T490 onwards only have an internal pack. It&#x27;s connectorized, so you can still buy a fresh one and replace it every few years, but you won&#x27;t be swapping it on an airplane.')
