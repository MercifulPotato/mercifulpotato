About $11 billion per quarter, on average.<p>They don&#x27;t neatly break this down in their report, as far as I can see, but some other internet sleuths have made educated guesses based on things that are directly reported.  As far as anyone can guess, Windows is no more than 10-15% of Microsoft revenue.<p>It seems fairly obvious to me that Windows is no longer the backbone of Microsoft.  10-15% still represents billions of dollars, but I think Microsoft would be perfectly content to replace all of that Windows revenue with O365 licenses or Azure billings.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;Investor&#x2F;earnings&#x2F;FY-2020-Q1&#x2F;segment-revenues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;Investor&#x2F;earnings&#x2F;FY-2020-Q1...</a>')
