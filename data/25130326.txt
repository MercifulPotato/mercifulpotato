The same effort could be put into more productive tasks.<p>&gt; Why did you go into software engineering?<p>Well, I&#x27;m not a software engineer - in the Data&#x2F;ML area so I am much more interested in the properties of data than the properties of code. But having said that I certainly like clean, efficient code and I care about languages (maybe just spoiled by python?!).<p>I can&#x27;t see myself as a software engineer so I think your instinct is right. My passion is data and ML.')
