As a happy XM3 owner, I think if these are feature by feature identical to the XM3 they will be quite overpriced. I also think that itself is very unlikely, and that they will have additional qualities justifying the price premium.<p>There&#x27;s lots of room to improve, for example, the quality of your voice as picked up by the mic, especially in windy environments. Speaking of that, walking outside on a windy day can be really intrusive with the XM3s because the ANC tries to &#x27;cancel&#x27; the wind and you get weird sounds in your ears. Those seem like cases where Apple is well suited to make dramatic improvements via DSP. Tech like the noise canceling the HoloLens 2 applies to its mic (to cut out noise from around the speaker) seems well within their capability. I don&#x27;t make much use of the XM3&#x27;s &quot;smart&quot; features because they&#x27;re pretty compromised. Their &#x27;transparency&#x27; mode&#x2F;partial noise canceling mode is really more intrusive than useful. It doesn&#x27;t sound like I am partly-canceling background noise, it sounds like microphones are selectively filtering some of what they pick up into my music while I walk outside.<p>So I think there&#x27;s definitely enough space for Apple to innovate on sound quality and other aspects of the wireless headset experience to justify the margin.<p>Edit: Also, multi-device pairing and handoff is super janky with the XM3s. Worth mentioning, I had the XM2s beforehand and the mic was literally unusable on conference calls no matter where I used it - people would complain and ask me what was wrong with my phone every time. Wireless headphones are not a solved problem.')
