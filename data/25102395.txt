Then some service I wanted to experiment released with only Facebook login support. Facebook won&#x27;t let me re-enable my account regardless of what I do or information I send. Creating a new account is also impossible since the number was assigned to that account. I&#x27;ve basically gave up because this is worse than a bank KYC and Facebook itself isn&#x27;t worth it.')
