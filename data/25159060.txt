On the one hand I feel it shouldn&#x27;t really matter and we can all judge an article by its contents, but on the other hand some of the articles that show up here are really just a religious wolf in a scientific sheep&#x27;s clothing, and I don&#x27;t think many here would give them more than 2 seconds of their day if they knew this upfront.')
