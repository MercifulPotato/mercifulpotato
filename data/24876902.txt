But he also predicts a &quot;best of all worlds&quot; scenario where such a headset would still be able to connect to powerful PCs for higher-end games. But an untethered experience offers many benefits, he said. &quot;It does make a big difference not having a wire dragging off your shoulder. It&#x27;s significant.&quot;</i>')
