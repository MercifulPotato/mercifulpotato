The whole point of efficiency gains in a company is to pay less for your resources (in this case labor) for a given amount of output. Ideally what we would see, however, is a reduction in prices as a result that more than compensates for the reduction in pay. Thus, across the economy, the general theme would be more output for a given amount of work. I have no idea how that metric tracks, though, but the cheeseburger and shake I guess is one way of asking that question.')
