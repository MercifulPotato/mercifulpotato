I thought the average frequency was always maintained at 50Hz over a 24 hour period. Having the frequency dip below 49.9Hz would normally be exceptionally rare.<p>I mean, if the alternative is a blackout, having heating turned off for a few minutes over a 24 period would be preferable to a nationwide blackout? It&#x27;s not as if people would suddenly freeze to death anyway.<p>Just curious if someone who understood this better had a good explanation for why this might be a bad idea.')
