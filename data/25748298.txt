I saw a stat that said that Google sought ~10K H1Bs. Given that these people are almost all in technical roles and that they don’t tend to come from the parts of the world where black people are prevalent it kinda acts as a cap on what percentage of technical employees can be black. A significant percentage of those that are American are first generation immigrants or green card holders — probably with similar demographics to the H1B employees.  If we assume that this describes  1&#x2F;2 - 2&#x2F;3 of employees, and everyone else is completely representative of the American average, you’d be looking at between 4.5 - 6 % of employees as black.')
