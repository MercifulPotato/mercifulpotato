The new content microservices endpoints are also a public (though undocumented) API as an extra bonus.<p>Basically it gave me the flexibility to work faster, and generating the code (e.g. the REST endpoint or the Svelte&#x2F;Sapper front-end) is also a lot faster, and I get to host them on Vercel for free<p>Oh and it also helps me to separate business logic code and other not-so-public data to somewhere else (Heroku instead of Vercel) and it just runs completely separately. That way I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally sharing data<p>As a solo designer&#x2F;engineer this Vercel + microservices &#x2F; tiny APIs + tiny frontends makes my life much easier')
