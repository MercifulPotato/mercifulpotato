Independent Yahoo on the other hand was unprofitable.<p>So I&#x27;m sure the AOL higher ups pitched the same dream for Yahoo to their Verizon bosses. Take another fallen former giant, shed the deadweight, double down on new&#x2F;profitable markets and also the idea that the overlap of Yahoo + AOL would cost less to run together than independently since with all the duplication there must surely be efficiencies to be made.<p>It&#x27;s not on the face of it an unreasonable bet to make, especially when investors were looking at AT&amp;T diversifying beyond their ISP business and imploring Verizon do _something_. Also given the older age of Verizon&#x27;s execs and how that fit with Yahoo&#x27;s target market, they likely had a higher opinion of the value of the yahoo brand than younger techies.<p>Meanwhile the shareholders of Yahoo were happy. they got their divested Alibaba holdings rather than thinking of them being used it prop up a company that was otherwise on a path to bankruptcy, and Verizon even paid them to take that off them.<p>As it turned out, that bet didn&#x27;t work, for a variety of reasons so now all the pre merger leadership of AOL and Yahoo are gone and even was likely a factor in Verizon getting a new CEO who didn&#x27;t play up this project so much and just wants it not to cost so much<p>At the same time you need to draw the distinction between valuable for the business vs valuable for the consumer. Tumblr had a porn culture that kept advertisers away, but changing that also drove the users away, so it didn&#x27;t bring in much money, and yahoo groups didn&#x27;t have the algorithmic content to allow discretion to the platform to push commercially viable content and so much of the consumption being via email and out of Yahoo&#x27;s control likely meant that again it wasn&#x27;t as valuable to advertisers and so worth less.<p>Disclaimer: I worked there through this, but not on any products mentioned here so my speculation is as much outsider based as yours.')
