What usually happens is that companies go all-in on the microservices idea, and force it upon all teams regardless of their size&#x2F;head count. It is far easier for a 10 person team to maintain a microservice than it is for a 3 person team. Microservices impart some fixed costs to every team managing a service and thus make very little sense for small teams.<p>On the other hand, a 3 person team can much more productively contribute to a monolith. From my experience in the industry so far, taking into account the current quality of tooling, I would say it starts to make sense for teams above the 10 person mark to own their own service.')
