I could conceive of that happening in the early days, but Jim has tens of billions of dollars now. I don&#x27;t know why he&#x27;d risk spending the rest of his life in prison for an extra 1-3b a year.<p>Also, you&#x27;ve misunderstood the charges on Bluecrest. Platt may also have been doing the scheme you described, but that is not what the SEC fined him for. He would be in prison had he been charged with what you allege.')
