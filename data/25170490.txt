They did that comparison like a few days before Amazon started offering Epyc Rome instances. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=epyc-vs-graviton2&amp;num=8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=epyc-vs-...</a> for a more like for like comparison, and the results are brutal for the N1:<p>&quot;When taking the geometric mean of all these benchmarks, the EPYC 7742 without SMT enabled was about 46% faster than the Graviton2 bare metal performance. The EPYC 7742 with SMT (128 threads) increased the lead to about 51%, due to not all of the benchmarks being multi-thread focused.&quot;')
