Item(by='tgflynn', descendants=None, kids=[25030059], score=None, time=1604870302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25028873, text='Maybe, but none of that has much to do with this article.<p>Right now &quot;ready access to quantum computation&quot; is more dependent on experimental physics than complexity theory and the kind of work that complexity theorists do that might be relevant to practical quantum computations (like improved error correction schemes) doesn&#x27;t appear to have much to do with oracle results.<p>One place oracle results have proven useful theoretically is in excluding many approaches to proving P != NP.  It&#x27;s possible that a result like this one might one day contribute to a proof separating BQP from P but we still seem to be very far away from that and I doubt this result will advance the arrival of practical quantum computers in any meaningful way.')
