There isn&#x27;t a magucal difference between B2B consumers and B2C consumers except that B2B&#x27;s have the luxury of pushing costs down to customers. You don&#x27;t get to hide behind that you enabled the transaction at all when you acquired everyone else who was also doing so, and colluded with your chief competitor. It&#x27;s the central trade-off between a Hamiltonian monolith, and a Jeffersonian bazaar. The Monolith can probably get you cheaper prices for a while, but at the cost of any new entrants to the market. The bill is paid in Liberty. In a Jeffersonian  bazaar, tge wide variety of competing models and lower barrier of entry keeps everyone honest even if you can&#x27;t exploit the same level of hyper-optimization the monolith brings to the table. You also avoid tge risk inherent to the Hamiltonian approach of the Monolith destructively influencing everything around it. Too big to fail is less of an issue because there are other fish, not just pods of whales.<p>Edit: May be confusing Hamilton and Jefferson with Hobbes and Locke again.')
