Item(by='dalke', descendants=None, kids=[24822427], score=None, time=1603055206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820898, text='The title is still wrong - Sweden has had a lockdown (light, certainly, but not &quot;no-lockdown&quot;), what appears to be a summary of new restrictions has actually been in place for months, and there&#x27;s nothing in the article which says there will be new legal enforcements behind the stronger recommendations. If the old policies wasn&#x27;t a lockdown then the new one isn&#x27;t either.<p>Those folks you mention seem to deliberately use &quot;no lockdown&quot; to describe Sweden, when clearly (I linked to a source, and gave personal observations) there are restrictions, and so is more accurately &quot;light lockdown&quot;. I can&#x27;t help but wonder how it came to be used in this title.<p>BTW, I looked for mention of upcoming substantial changes at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gp.se&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gp.se&#x2F;</a> and found <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gp.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;sverige&#x2F;platserna-i-g%C3%B6teborg-som-kan-begr%C3%A4nsas-mer-vid-ett-coronautbrott-1.35529022" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gp.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;sverige&#x2F;platserna-i-g%C3%B6teborg-...</a> .

For example, from &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t take public transport unless you can book a seat&quot; changes to &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t take public transport.&quot;<p>But it&#x27;s still as voluntary as it was a few weeks ago, so if we were &quot;no-lockdown&quot; then we&#x27;ll still be &quot;no-lockdown&quot; tomorrow.')
