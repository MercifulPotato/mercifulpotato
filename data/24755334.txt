It&#x27;s better to do it 5 years too late than never, I guess. But Facebook doesn&#x27;t get any pats on the back.<p>Facebook&#x27;s modus operandi is:<p>1.) Allow algorithms to grow and foster toxic ideas and communities, because these create the most user engagement<p>2.) Extract as much ad revenue as possible from the user engagement<p>3.) Say &#x27;Oooops, our bad. We&#x27;re doing something about this now&#x27; when Facebook&#x27;s role in proliferating toxic content gets politically untenable<p>4.)
