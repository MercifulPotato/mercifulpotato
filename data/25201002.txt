All constitutional scholars seem to agree on this.  The founding fathers were very concerned about the possibility of future tyranny from government they were crafting.  Ensuring that the citizens had guns, and limiting the power of the government were both ways to prevent such tyranny.  It&#x27;s a shame that more people do not understand the mindset of the founding fathers.  (Not to imply that they all had a common view on this.  There was much disagreement and negotiation.)')
