Try running some transforms on SVG with CSS or WAAPI and it’s laughably bad. \nThe dev tools are all but useless. Just simple things like adding a new prop&#x2F;value to a selector declaration is horrid and often inadvertently removed a different declaration. \nThe JS perf is great but the debugging stepper is virtually opaque with buttons with no labels and the like. \nLet’s not even get started on the raft of web platform features it either doesn’t have yet or has no intention of adding.<p>I too would like to use Safari but it’s so far behind evergreen browsers like FF and Chrome I just can’t rely on it.')
