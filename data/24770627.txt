Yes, the question of &quot;who gets to participate in the consensus protocol itself&quot; is itself solved through total consensus in VS (and a total consensus protocol older than Paxos).  But the way that is then used to bootstrap looser and more performant views of consensus as a first class concept I believe makes it still interesting to bring up in a discussion of consensus in general.')
