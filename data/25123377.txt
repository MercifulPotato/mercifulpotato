If you&#x27;re good at it and it&#x27;s valued, over a few months you&#x27;ll naturally be spending more time on that and slowly be assigned fewer and fewer IC tasks, after which you&#x27;ll have a conversation with your manager about which direction you&#x27;d like to take, and then you&#x27;re defacto glue even if that&#x27;s not your job title. (I&#x27;m sure you could get a job title change if you wanted, but SWE may be a slightly higher pay scale than TPM. ;)<p>N.B. this advice is really for &quot;normal&quot; times; if you&#x27;re remote it may be harder or easier to do the social part necessary, I have no idea.')
