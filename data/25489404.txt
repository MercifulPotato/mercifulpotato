Once we understand the principles behind intelligence, we can make very efficient AI optimized for our usage. But we&#x27;re still at the point where we don&#x27;t understand intelligence as well as we understood aerodynamics when building the first planes, so we still have a lot to learn from &quot;birds&quot; - animal brains.')
