People could visit their loved ones, say goodbye to the terminally ill, work, have outdoor dining, see drive in movies.  Scarce little impact on quality of life.<p>Instead vast swathes of the U.S. and other countries flout even the most basic precautions making it impossible for the rest of us to live normal lives.<p>The argument that being safe == poor quality of life presents a false dichotomy.  The truth is that we can be safe _and_ have the same quality of life.  Instead many have chosen the third option: they believe that their &quot;right&quot; to shop at Walmart without an extra piece of clothing is more important than people being able to say goodbye to loved ones; more important than their neighbor&#x27;s wellbeing; more important than the economy.<p>I would further argue that not only would quality of life not suffer if everyone took basic precautions, in many ways QoL would be _better_.  As the statistics are showing we&#x27;ve seen a massive dropoff in cold&#x2F;flu related deaths, even with poorly implemented COVID protections.  Less auto accidents and less pollution.  A rise in work from home.  The list goes on.<p>Contrary to the doom and gloom of this year, COVID was really a chance to build a better world.  We might just yet do it in small ways.  But much of the potential good is being squandered, as it always is, by selfish, ignorant, hateful people.')
