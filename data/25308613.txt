For example, in 2009, researchers were awarded $100k for the discovery of the Mersenne prime 2^43112609-1.<p>This number, while too large for RSA or ECC, could very well be useful for (R)LWE schemes (used to make post-quantum secure public-key cryptography and partial&#x2F;fully homomorphic encryption schemes). In particular, it is free to modularly reduce by this prime (take the bottom 43112609 bits), so schemes that rely on doing large matrix multiplication on a modular elements (or even elements in a polynomial ring) would benefit greatly.<p>Since 43112609 bits is only 5.3MB, this is not at all a ridiculous size - multiplying numbers of 2^26 bits is feasible in well under 1 second in modern hardware, and so making accumulation and modular reduction free is actually valuable.')
