For example, there are the &quot;opia&quot; and the &quot;omaly&quot; types. For r&#x2F;g and y&#x2F;b these seem to have different ramifications.<p>Mostly the &quot;omaly&quot; types can get by without too much fuss since colour differentiation is more muted and the &quot;opia&quot; types affect more of the spectrum and more difficulty differentiating if they can at all.<p>It&#x27;s more nuanced than that, but generally speaking it tends to work out that way.')
