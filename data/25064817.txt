I agree that utilizing a database&#x2F;S3 or rolling your own lightweight version is a big competitor to Configly. I&#x27;m not sure if you saw it, but I tried to highlight some of the reasons we think Config.ly is more effective over a DB for certain usage patterns in the intro note [1]<p>&gt; Databases can do this but often aren’t used that way for good reasons (they can be cumbersome to wire-up, there are scale concerns about adding extra load to your DB, it’s risky to touch a production database, etc).<p>I can think of other benefits; you generally don&#x27;t want really anyone touching your prod DB directly -- but _especially_ non engineers. So what if they want to update copy? You could build or leverage a web UI... but now you&#x27;re going down the path of building Config.ly. You also don&#x27;t get version history for free with most databases. And once a value is in the database, you also need to worry about the middle layer of getting that value to your clients and having your clients fetch it intelligently&#x2F;caching, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25059299" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25059299</a>')
