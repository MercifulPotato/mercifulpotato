We all need it, but so many of us have such drastically different experiences with it. Some people are early risers, others night owls. Some people have extremely vivid dreams, others have random jumbles, and some people nothing at all. Even the amount of sleep that a person needs can vary wildly. This whole thread is full of examples of people sharing their different experiences with sleep, almost as if no two people have the same exact patterns.')
