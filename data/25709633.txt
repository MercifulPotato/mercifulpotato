Instead, it is about one thing leading to another leading to another.<p>And I see a whole bunch of things leading to another and leading to another.  Every 2 hours goes by, and another escalation happens.<p>The only question next is when will the escalation stop?  Because clearly we have far far escalated past the point where we were a couple months ago, which was simply &quot;Well, a couple nazis got banned on twitter&quot;.<p>We have zoomed ahead on the escalation to the point where a service with 10 million users is booted off of borderline critical internet infrastructure, with less than 12 hours of warning to do anything about it.<p>The slope, quite clearly, <i>was</i> pretty slippery it seems!')
