Lin Zexu [1] carried out destruction of opium stock at Humen [2]. It was mostly successful in destroying the flow of opium from one its major import source. And disturbed the traders. Eventually results into the 1840&#x27;s Opium War which requires Britain intervene [3].<p>But fundamentally, the relation between opium trading and what we are discussing here is nonsensical.<p>Opium trading is illegal, and hurting the people. It was invented to compensate the trade deficit of Britain [4].<p>It reflects little of the people&#x27;s own judgement. Heck, one can reasonably state that Chinese people in 1840s are totally incapable of independent thinking, because of the long tradition of Chinese rulers&#x27; policy of &quot;dumb down the peasants&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Destruction_of_opium_at_Humen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Destruction_of_opium_at_Humen</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Humen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Humen</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Opium_Wars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Opium_Wars</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_Opium_War#Opium_trade" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_Opium_War#Opium_trade</a>')
