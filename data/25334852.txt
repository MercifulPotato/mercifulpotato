Item(by='pbuzbee', descendants=None, kids=[25335555, 25335004], score=None, time=1607364005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334576, text='The cost of homeownership is a huge factor for me.<p>When I started working in 2014, I figured I would need to save around $150k for a down payment because the median home price in Santa Clara county was around $800k. Now the median price is around $1.4M [1], so I&#x27;d need around $250k.<p>The growth in home prices has roughly matched my ability to save for a home, so almost seven years later I&#x27;m not any closer than I was in 2014.<p>I feel like my options are (A) live in an apartment forever, (B) hellish commute, or (C) leave. With starting a family on the horizon, Option C looks better every day.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bayareamarketreports.com&#x2F;trend&#x2F;santa-clara-home-prices-market-trends-news" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bayareamarketreports.com&#x2F;trend&#x2F;santa-clara-home-...</a>')
