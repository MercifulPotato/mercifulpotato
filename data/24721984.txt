We moved off to the acquirer datacenter, because that&#x27;s what you do.<p>Softlayer was a very nice place to get bare metal hosting. You get a whole machine to do whatever on, they provide a solid network, and replace components when they fail (and you open a ticket). We didn&#x27;t use any ancillary services for the most part, we had been using their included DNS, but switched off because update delays were getting too large and we didn&#x27;t like the support response on that; we used their loadbalancers for one service for a few months, but it had worse uptime than the hosts behind it. I have heard their other ancillerary services were (are?) bad too. From what I saw, support in general was getting worse, but that could have been because of IBM takeover or because we were going from a top ten customer to an average customer.<p>I would consider them an option in cases where you want to run all the services you consume, but you don&#x27;t want to run your own datacenters. They had a decent worldwide footprint, and post-IBM they got a lot more datacenters outside the US; that could be a big deal, because sometimes you just need a couple machines in another continent, and it&#x27;s easier if you already are on board. Also, at least when we were there, private network traffic was free, worldwide, which is nice to manage replication for disasters.<p>If you&#x27;re more cloudy though, and make use of integrated services, and small instance types with per minute billing, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it. Also, they had that global routing issue earlier this year, which would have been hard (impossible?) to mitigate as a single vendor customer.')
