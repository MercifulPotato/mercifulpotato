You can either get a link to share, or be paired with a random user through the queue.<p>It&#x27;s completely free (though you do need Spotify premium) and open source. Also, all you need to do is connect your Spotify account, there&#x27;s no log in to my site. This is the first real full stack website I&#x27;ve made, so you might come across bugs, and if so you can report them on the github:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micahcantor&#x2F;duotonic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micahcantor&#x2F;duotonic</a><p>If anyone has any questions or comments I&#x27;d love to hear them!')
