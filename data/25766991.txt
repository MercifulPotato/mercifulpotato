I&#x27;m maintaining a Rust client for SQL Server, and in recent OS X versions Apple decided with their secure framework to not support the measly TLS certificates of SQL Server (Azure, Docker). Now I have a ticket with no real help.<p>How I finally solved this is I got a Mac Mini from cloud, I could with a lots of trouble finally start docker in it (needed a desktop to click some icons) and test my code. This meant statically linking OpenSSL instead, which is not the greatest from a security point of view.<p>All of this took six months, and it was really hard to get Mac users to commit anything. It was ridiculously annoying to write and test without buying an Apple computer.<p>After this experience I just don&#x27;t want to support any of their products anymore. Too much time wasted.')
