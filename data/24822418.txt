Were it, instead, an attempt to provide a useful picture on which people could form an informed understanding, here are things it would provide information on that it does not:<p>* What proportion of the surveyed workforce does this over-$100k population represent,<p>* How does the pay of the highlighted population compare to that of private sector and&#x2F;or other-state employees doing similar work with similar qualifications.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even rise to the level of cherry picking facts to paint a biased narrative, since there isn&#x27;t even a narrative here. It&#x27;s cherry-picking decontextualized factoids to provoke a emotional reaction.<p>&gt; Now we are told it has all the stability plus super generous pensions and salary that would make the best workers in the private sector jealous.<p>$100k salary plus public sector benefits wouldn&#x27;t make the best workers in the private sector jealous.<p>A lot for this is public agency CEOs and other executives making quite a lot for generic “workers” but much less than private sector executives,and public sector workforces being management heavy because a lot of the operations are contracted out.<p>And the isolated unique individuals which are pointed to, there&#x27;s consistently no analysis or explanation of the specific circumstances producing the unusually high compensation. And that&#x27;s because if they did that, it would undercut the emotional response the entire piece is careful geared to provoke by avoiding context.')
