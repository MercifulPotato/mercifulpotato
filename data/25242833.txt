According to the patent, static cells require &quot;excessive space&quot;, refresh is inconvenient, and previous self-refreshing cells can accumulate erroneous charge. The patent claims all sorts of advantages of minimizing clock voltages, minimizing vias, using a single address line and single data line, etc.<p>My interpretation is that in the pre-CMOS days, a static cell used too much power due to the load resistor. (The Intel 4004 and 8008 used dynamic storage for registers.) They didn&#x27;t want to implement a counter for stepping through refresh addresses, so they developed this cell.<p>(How much did they not want to implement a counter? The program counter is actually a linear-feedback shift register, so it steps through addresses in a pseudo-random order. This saved a few transistors compared to a real counter. The trick is you permute the data in ROM according to the same pattern and everything works just like you had a normal program counter.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US3876993A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US3876993A</a>')
