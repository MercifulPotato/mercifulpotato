Samsung, Intel and GlobalFoundries are not suitable replacements for TSMC with regards to throughput or technology.<p>The world does need some meaningful fabs outside of Taiwan&#x2F;South Korea.  All of the &lt;10nm semiconductor and most of the &gt;10nm semiconductor fabrication takes place within a 750km&#x2F;460mile radius circle today.  That is risky.<p>Israel, Mexico, Germany, Canada, Japan (not that it would grow the circle much...) are all viable places to run a foundry.  The fact that Intel is one of the few outside that circle doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in the security of the global supply chain.')
