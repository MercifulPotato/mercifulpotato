Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609271347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573637, text='Same, and I&#x27;ve been working with some of the latest and greatest collaborative and industrial six-axis and SCARA robots. There&#x27;s definitely a back and forth between innovation and legacy in this industry. For example, FANUC famously refuses to deprecate or drop service for any of its equipment, you&#x27;ll pay through the nose for some of it but they&#x27;re willing to keep you supplied with parts, service, and bug fixes for 40-year-old equipment if you&#x27;ve got it. Also, a lot of it is clearly designed for &quot;what&#x27;s the most we can get an average maintenance tech to understand after a 40-hour certification class&quot;, not for programmers and engineers. But with a demo like this, it&#x27;s obvious that BD is working on a level that the industrial automation competition won&#x27;t reach for decades.')
