The fastest link demonstrated was around 5Gb&#x2F;s at ~160W.  This is about 3 orders of magnitude worse from an energy per bit perspective than fiber based systems.  From that point alone, itâ€™s hard to imagine these systems being cost competitive with existing fiber infrastructure.   From a system capacity perspective these systems are about 500x less capacity.<p>On page 26, it seems the primary application is being able to get more data down to Earth for remote sensing applications.<p><i>The most important application of lasercom from LEO is direct-to-ground downlinks since the main point is being able to download to Earth the increasing amount of data that remote-sensing missions require</i>')
