By that logic most everyone is a Christian. Most Hindus and Buddhists would be Christian too.<p>The problem is that changing the definition of a word does not change boundaries in reality. I can call my automobile a &quot;Leaf&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean my car does photosynthesis. Similarly, you can say that Christianity just means &quot;respect for human rights&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone accepts the divinity of Jesus Christ.')
