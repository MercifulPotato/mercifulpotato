Airliners are shipped -- and built --- in response to firm orders; if no one buys them, nothing is shipped.<p>But its quite possible that they could get something certified and theoretically sellable but not have something that the economics make any sense for airlines to actually purchase, much less such a clear case that international airlines are generally <i>compelled</i> to do so.')
