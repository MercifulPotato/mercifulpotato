Item(by='pessimizer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603917390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923624, text='&gt; One of my pet projects is to make an open source, self-hosting, modular tabletop gaming platform, so this way ANYONE can write a &#x27;module&#x27; and share it, and leave the hosting up to the individuals.<p>Me, too. I think the fact that game components are physical objects that are rested upon each other limits what can be expressed in a game enough that you could possibly boil them down to a markup language. Then have a single player &quot;host&quot; the game by running a server, and everyone else can connect  to that player securely, with access granted only to what the rules would allow them to &quot;view.&quot;<p>I have a fantasy about peer-to-peer boardgaming, with everybody&#x27;s hand and whatever is hidden behind their player screen on their phone, tablet or laptop. Something that would work as well with everybody in the room together (have a widescreen logged in as an observer of the board) as it does with players on opposite sides of the world.')
