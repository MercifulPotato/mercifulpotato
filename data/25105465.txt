It would be cool to have a quantified answer to &quot;just how slow is Python&quot;? I suspect the answer is many orders of magnitude slower.<p>However, if the experiment in question is, &quot;using python glue code, can a developer string together a service that replicates the functionality of redis&quot;, then that illustrates what would actually happen in the real world.<p>For example, for a very junior Python developer, writing something in C is basically like asking a C developer to write assembly- possible, but they&#x27;d have to learn a lot of different things to do it.<p>Similarly, when I write Java, I want to be calling Arrays.sort(myarray) instead of writing my own sort (if the focus is on developer convenience and development velocity).<p>So, it&#x27;s just a difference in what you&#x27;re desiring to measure.')
