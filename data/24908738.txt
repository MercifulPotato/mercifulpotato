Item(by='vladf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603814580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24908003, text='No, it&#x27;s not auto-completing function blocks, just simple expressions that are easy to validate. E.g.,<p><pre><code>    let lo = 0;\n    let hi = vec.len();\n    let mid = lo + (hi\n</code></pre>\nwill autocomplete to `(hi - lo) &#x2F; 2` as the second autocomplete option (so I&#x27;d hit tab twice). If you were to &quot;score&quot; it based on top-5 it&#x27;d probably be pretty bad at guessing my intent, but then again, I get to _opt-in_ to suggestions so it just needs to be right often enough, as it doesn&#x27;t bother me much to keep typing.')
