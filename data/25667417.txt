It&#x27;s not about the vim. Can you generalize it a bit more? \nLet me take a shot at it(!?)<p>You introduced a new tool to your workflow. The consequences of that was<p>- Lower productivity initially\n- You where forced to think about how you create&#x2F;edit your code<p>So, what made it work for you?<p>- Thinking about how you structure and edit your code. This gave you some clarity around how to think and solve a given problem. Longer you practiced this, better you became at it.<p>- Learning a new tool made you a better at certain things (Say how you manipulate large amount of text?). Better you became, more confidence you derived out of it. More confidence resulted in taking up more harder problems, and the cycle continues.<p>- You have started thinking about your tools. You spent time and energy in learning it. This has broadened how you think about software development. This in turn has widened your ability to look at the software problems.<p>I am not sure what I wrote resonates with you or not. But this is what I took away from you response &quot;Making that change has improved my thinking&quot;<p>I feel, it&#x27;s not the choice of the specific tool that made a difference, but the result of changing your regular habits that VIM bought about in your way of writing code. \nI am sure, a person who changed to emacs or Jetbrains also would have seen something change :-)')
