Blade speeds near the tip can be pretty high, so rain can damage some materials.  It&#x27;s apparently not much of an issue with alloy blades, more of a thing with composites.  I suspect it&#x27;s more of a price issue -- gyrocopters are trying to hit a different price point than most helicopters.<p>Also, plenty of gyrocopter pilots fly in the rain.')
