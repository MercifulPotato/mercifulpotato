The nyaa.si people commonly engaged in censorship of their issue tracker at github (even if all parties were polite and the issue was closed they ended up locking and deleting issues afterwards). In addition in their early days they engaged in a &quot;fake news&quot; campaign against the other nyaa clone (nyaa.si is a clone of the original nyaa). Finally they never provided their database to the public, so if it dies or if someone wants to make another clone they have to scrape the whole site. (there was a lot of drama when the original nyaa died because nobody had an updated database and they had to work with an outdated one. The other nyaa clone offered a copy of its database. When I asked one of the members of nyaa.si I was offered a pathetic excuse on how it would be too hard to write an sql query).<p>And to be honest the nyaa.si devs would not care about this whole thing at all. They admitted that they published the code to github because they were tired of the &quot;foss nerds&quot; whining.')
