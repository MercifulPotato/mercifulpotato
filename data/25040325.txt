I don&#x27;t think it actually was deliberately designed that way, just that it looks that way in hindsight.<p>Yes. I think the original idea was just to present the hippy free software idea in a more business-friendly form, and thus cause more FOSS to be written.<p>&gt; &gt;  idea of causing social change by coding free software<p>&gt; FWIW, that also seems to me to be a later gloss. If anything, computers and software are new enough that it&#x27;s not so much a matter of social change as it is of founding new social norms around these (physical&#x2F;virtual) machines.<p>Fair enough. Though I don&#x27;t think free software was so much about forging norms per se, more like an adaptation of old ideas like &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot; to the digital age. As opposed to just letting the modern day robber barons have it their way, which to an extent is what&#x27;s happening with open source.<p>&gt; RMS just wanted to edit the software in his printer.<p>Sure, but it spiraled away from that pretty fast.<p>&gt; Look at the restrictive B.S. that tractor makers are foisting on farmers to see the relevance. Is the idea of being able to fix your own tractor a &quot;social change&quot;? :)<p>No, more like defending &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot; rather than letting the robber barons get away with whatever they can. That being said, AFAICS free software has had about zero impact on this topic; the successes in this are seem to be due to grassroots political campaigning (right to repair laws etc.) rather that some argument that software should be free (in the FSF sense).')
