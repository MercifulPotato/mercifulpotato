It&#x27;s inherently an inefficient process even a theoretical maximums, and we can probably put that capacity to better use through other mechanisms with a higher conversion efficiency.<p>On the other hand, there are a ton of sources of methane that society pretty much will always generate through agriculture or landfills. For example, BMW ran a pilot a few years ago running a large factory&#x27;s forklifts on hydrogen sourced from biomethane from a local landfill[1]. Cost and technology improvements in areas like steam methane reformers and anaerobic digestion could drive costs down to the point where those facilities can actually gain meaningful adoption, and meaningfully, co-locate hydrogen sources near points of consumption, so you can worry less about the headache of transporting H2 molecules around.<p>Hydrogen is unlikely to wholesale compete with battery electric at this point, but it absolutely shines in certain niche performance applications. To me, aligning the supply chain to leverage those particular instances seems like the best way to work it into a green(er) energy portfolio.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, while in school, I did a 7-month co-op a few years ago working on next-gen R&amp;D of PEM fuel cell stacks, so I generally consider myself fairly well versed on potentially out-of-date information.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;garbage-power-out-south-carolina-bmw-plant-demonstrates-landfill-gas-hydrogen-fuel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;garbage-power-out-south-caro...</a>')
