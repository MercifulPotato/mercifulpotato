Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=[25222118], score=None, time=1606412228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221513, text='Yeah, Ireland is listed as more expensive on average than the UK or Canada, for example, but everything I&#x27;ve heard about the quality of internet services in Canada or the UK leads me to feel that at least outside more rural areas, we get a better quality of service here.<p>For example, I can go to Bell Canada, and spot they have the following prices (prices converted to USD from CAD):<p>* $23 for 10mbit&#x2F;s with 100GB cap<p>* $40 for 50mbit&#x2F;s<p>* $75 for 100mbit&#x2F;s<p>* $90 for 1 gbit&#x2F;s<p>Also I spot checked a couple of suburbs in quebec city (because everything I&#x27;d heard indicated the above was suspicious) to see what the internet availability was like, and the ones I checked all only offered DSL at:<p>* $55 for 5mbit&#x2F;s with no cap<p>* $46 for 5mbit&#x2F;s with 50GB cap<p>We&#x27;re not talking the sticks or some frozen house up super far north here, we&#x27;re talking suburbs of a decently sized city.<p>Compared to my own ISP, Virgin Media Ireland (prices are post 6 month-introductory prices converted from EUR to USD):<p>* $70 for 250mbit&#x2F;s<p>* $85 for 500mbit&#x2F;s<p>* $100 for 1gbit&#x2F;s<p>They are available in most of the area of our cities and most medium sized towns also.<p>I also checked with eir, who are effectively the ISP of last resort for my parents home where you get DSL also, and they offer:<p>* $35 for 40mbit&#x2F;s<p>My understanding is this is VDSL2, but not fibre to the cabinet at their particular exchange. The pricing tier is for 100mbit&#x2F;s but eir are at least upfront with the fact you won&#x27;t get this at their address.<p>This is a village of a few hundred people that&#x27;s not along a major infrastructure route between cities or large towns. However, reliability and contention would likely be as bad as the Canadian option from when I lived there.<p>We&#x27;re not the netherlands here or some of the other central European countries with gigabit for â‚¬20&#x2F;month in Ireland, but I&#x27;d still take it over Canadian internet, while the chart implies it to be worse.')
