If its consistent $$$ that might be worth it. For a one shot thing, maybe not as much.<p>I think it also can be difficult to mix volunteer stuff with money. Posting in a bug tracker that multiple people work from which anyone can take on a bug from, that you will do it for $x, can make it feel like you&#x27;re using a community resource to spam your business. There&#x27;s probably other places where that type of advertisement is ok, but it ads an extra element of difficulty in doing these sorts of things.')
