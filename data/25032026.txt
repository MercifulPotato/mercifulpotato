If we voted on our president via popular vote, we would have had a few different presidents in recent times, but I doubt any of them would have reduced state sovereignty significantly.<p>States are still free to set their own taxes, run their own police as they see fit, etc etc.<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t think the popular vote would vote to repeal the 10th amendment, so it seems silly to say it would &quot;destroy any shred of sovereignty&quot;. Especially since in this election, the outcome would have been identical.')
