They play together typically based on a plan known as &quot;score&quot;.<p>But when they play a piece for the first time the performance is typically much lacking. They have to rehearse the symphony or rock-opera or whatever.<p>Removing technical debt is like playing the song again, this time better. You learn what works what not and can do it better.
