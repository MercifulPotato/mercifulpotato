Managers use it also to see how much time employees spend in the field. To count how much time is spend in some specific location my app uses background location updates.<p>10 years ago I was distributing just the apk file. Then I moved to Play store. It turned out that most people on their company owned Android devices don&#x27;t configure Play Store. App updates are disabled until you log in. So I had to educate my customer employees how to log in to Play Store and install my app. The additional benefit was that people had security updates of Chrome and other apps.<p>Two months ago my app was suspended after I made all necessary changes to support Android 10. The Gbot claims that background location updates aren&#x27;t essential for my app. As you may guess I wrote appeal without success. My customers pay mainly for that time report feature but Gbot knows better what my paying customers want.<p>And I just do not care about securing my customer devices and Play Store any longer. Now I distribute apk files again and train people how to install apk files from unknown sources.')
