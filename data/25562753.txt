It seems like with most people WFH, there is a lot of home improvement and repairs to be done.<p>Of course, a job well done means there won’t be demand for the same job for a while.<p>Personal perspective: With Ag, you have to know everything..from plumbing to irrigation repairs..to building sheds to repairing machines. If we paid for each of these jobs, it would cost more than what many small farmers would make as income.<p>It’s unfair that these are unpaid for because at the bottom of the supply chain, farmers still get paid the lowest price because food has to be cheap and accessible to all. Cost of food increase at the top of the supply chain. The broccoli is expensive because it’s sold at Whole Foods rather than Walmart. Otherwise farmers get paid the same.<p>Because it’s perishable and most can’t afford the cold storage and distribution lines, they have to offload produce whenever it is ready. Regardless of what they get paid. We are price takers. Not price makers.<p>We buy everything at retail and sell at wholesale. So manual skills that are married to high value items is also a way to make most out of it.')
