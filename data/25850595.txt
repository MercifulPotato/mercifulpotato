Item(by='ncmncm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611170012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849522, text='There is no free market in communication. &quot;Was able to deal with it&quot; is a curious turn of phrase: Yes, there are still companies. But has Americans&#x27; access to communication kept pace with the technology and with the rest of the world? <i>Very, very far</i> from it. Americans, collectively, pay far more, for far fewer bits, than others in the world, particularly once you get just a few miles away from a city center.<p>It is telling how much higher prices are in places where competition has been curtailed by the FCC&#x27;s failures, and how much higher even prices where two services operate are, than in other countries. The number of states where towns have been forbidden to operate a municipal network also reveals our poor condition.<p>America is a third-world country in communication, just as it is in infant mortality. It is not accidental. There are reasons that a cable service is the most hated company in the US, more even than Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, or Koch Industries, which might deserve it more.')
