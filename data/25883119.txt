What drives me crazy is people who say &quot;can I ask you a question?&quot; I <i>really</i> try hard not to say &quot;you just did&quot;.<p>None of those compare to those folks who do not understand that to help them we need details. How do I infer what a problem is without any details? I used to ask all sorts of questions so as to be able to help them. Now I tend to post a &#x27;More details please! Once I have those I can help you.&#x27; What amazes me is that sometimes we get no response at all! (By we I mean those of us in the channel&#x2F;group).<p>Note that these are co-workers who have been told many many times that we need some basic details to be able to do anything at all, like a client&#x27;s domain name, or a client id in our CMS.')
