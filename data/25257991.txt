My friend Mike Rowe said it this way: its like having an altimeter on your car so if you go off a cliff, you know how far it is to the ground. When hard limits on system resources are exhausted, it can be very hard to write code to recover. Imagine if the kernel call fail recovery code needed to create a thread to handle the exception!')
