I don&#x27;t know when&#x2F;if GitHub will allow workflow reuse like with GitHub Actions.<p>I came up with a simple tool that lets me write workflows in a repository and easily copy them elsewhere. Updates aren&#x27;t automated nor versioned since they are manual, but &quot;manual&quot; means running a command, not &quot;careful copy-pasting&quot;<p>I&#x27;m open to ideas and questions and I hope this simplifies your work.')
