We do not pay mail-providers for the address alone, but mainly for running the servers which deliver and store the mails. Which is the same for which USPS&#x2F;Fedex&#x2F;UPS&#x2F;etc. are paid for.<p>You want a mail-address? Grab your own domain (thus pay &quot;tax&quot;), put a server there (build a &quot;house&quot;) and you are there. Getting an address, be it physical or digital never comes for free, and there is not human right for having one.')
