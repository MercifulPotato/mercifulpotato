Tons of stability issues, but that aside even in the best of times it&#x27;s as you say.. super low upload bandwidth. And even worse they still impose a terabyte bandwidth cap on me unless I pay them an additional $30&#x2F;mo.<p>Well, I looked into the t-mobile internet. It&#x27;s an LTE router, no bandwidth cap, a flat $50&#x2F;mo total... and the upload bandwidth I get is around 40-60Mb&#x2F;s. Download bandwidth between 60-100Mb&#x2F;s.')
