Your questions are interesting so I&#x27;ll answer anyway.<p>1. The 80s sucked. I was a dateless nerd in a shitty town in a shitty state for most of it. They got marginally better when I went to college in the more sophisticated and urbane state to the immediate east.<p>And that state was <i>Alabama</i>. No kidding, UA was MILES more sophisticated than the crappy college town I grew up in. I think this is probably because the University had much, much more influence in Tuscaloosa than USM had in Hattiesburg.<p>The music was cool, though. The last waves of punk plus the waves of more indie-style stuff, plus the explosion in Athens, GA, all made for great tunes. To this day, the opening chords of REM&#x27;s first albums are incredibly transportive and soothing to me. (And one of the only times I&#x27;ve ever been truly star-struck is when I found myself in line at an airport bookstore behind Mike Mills.)<p>2. In the late 90s, I was briefly (and theoretically) rich on paper. Not &quot;Netscape stock&quot; rich or &quot;MSFT rich,&quot; but worth about $5MM. Sadly, it was not liquid, and became worth $0 in short order. I was an investing partner in an Internet tech consultancy -- mostly, custom web sites and software, which at the time you could charge a lot of money for -- but didn&#x27;t have enough stock to turn the boat. We got sucked into the massive-land-grab mentality, and tried to go toe to toe vs. firms like Agency, and predictably lost. But had we aimed lower we could&#x27;ve been a tidily profitable regional player. The lesson is that there&#x27;s nothing WRONG with mid-market, you know?<p>The experience cost me actual money (not options), but it was also incredibly educational, and cheaper than grad school would&#x27;ve been, so I&#x27;m not sore about it.<p>Sadly, the dot-com crash left me richer only in skills. I had to burn savings to keep my house from late 2001 through early 20003, when I started making money again.<p>3. I have enjoyed my life in every state. At 50, I could prattle on about this or that that used to be cooler, but so many things are manifestly cooler NOW it&#x27;s a bankrupt enterprise. And God knows I don&#x27;t want to come off like some bellyaching boomer. I mean, think about it: how much would this pandemic have sucked in an era without broad connectivity and online community? There&#x27;s widespread enough bandwidth, and good enough software, that my 80 year old mother can very easily initiate a video call with anyone she likes. Sure, most of the folks who post on HN probably had online pals they were gaming with or chatting with or working with a decade ago, but the non-digital would&#x27;ve been materially more isolated.<p>However, I will admit I definitely miss the Internet before Eternal September happened. There&#x27;s more HERE now, but the broad internet culture moved from fairly intelligent and articulate to, well, nihilism. Few places reward multi-sentence or multi-paragraph expression now. (HN is a very notable exception.)')
