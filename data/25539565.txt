What is the soul of design? I would argue that it’s improving the human experience. Graphic design does this by creating beauty,  industrial design by creating valued products, UX design does this by improving interfaces.<p>Reusing common elements across UIs is a good thing. People complain about the “standard” splash page layout, or the stereotypical web-app styling... but Jakob’s Law is real, and users don’t want to learn another damn UI paradigm, they want to use your product to solve their problems. Reuse simplifies learning and so is a massive positive from an end-user perspective, and making the user’s life better is the designers role.<p>As you’ve noted, Figma is not infinitely flexible. For graphic design this would be a drawback, as novelty is heavily rewarded. But for UX design? Novelty is less important, and correctly communicating how a design should be implemented is much more essential to a user’s experience. And if I need maximum flexibility I can always use another tool.<p>I’m not claiming everything is perfect in Figma or the industry - but I think the doom is overstated.')
