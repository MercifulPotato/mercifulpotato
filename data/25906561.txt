Their common trait is mistrust: They often have been <i>hurt</i> by those that they should be trusting, they are not being heard and sometimes they see through the bullshit. The <i>best</i> case is that there is simply a lack of real communication, education and direct involvement, because that problem is solvable.<p>It is very simple: for trust to grow and stabilize, both parties need to care and invest in each other. There is no shortcut, no trick and no amount of marketing, propaganda or talk will get either side out of this. That means both sides need to admit their mistakes, be vulnerable, caring, hopeful and most importantly honest and transparent.')
