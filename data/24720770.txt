Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602174834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720316, text='&gt; The questioning seems to imply there&#x27;s a split among party lines. Is that a coincidence or is there some political aspect to this?<p>A little bit of both; the right is more inclined to strong, especially commercial, property rights even for things like copyright that are expressly, both Constitutionally and statutorily, bounded and contingent, while the left is (from a judicial perspective) generally more supportive of public interest limitations in general and fair use, which while statutorily enshrined was judicially created based on the First Amendment before being written into statute, in particular.<p>That said, its far from a perfect mapping and you&#x27;ll often see splits that don&#x27;t follow party lines in copyright, and the late Justice Ginsberg, while one of the more liberal justices on the court, was known to favor strong copyright.<p>in general, outside of perennial hotbutton issues that are permanently both highly politically salient, stable in partisan orientation, and at the focus of judicial selection, which copyright very much is not any of, divisions of the court aren&#x27;t strongly determined by party even when they happen to align with party.')
