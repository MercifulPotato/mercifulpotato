Most consumers have gotten exactly what they wanted. I never said everyone should have boycotted all smartphones, I said that if consumers didn&#x27;t like the smartphones we have they wouldn&#x27;t have bought them. They practiced &quot;just don&#x27;t buy it&quot; for all the other dead tech options that no longer exist today. Consumers clearly don&#x27;t believe that there is a problem that needs a &quot;solution&quot;.<p>Let me be clear: it&#x27;s your problem to deal with as a minority consumer who apparently doesn&#x27;t like anything most other consumers like. The tech world we live in today is the world that most consumers want and are happy with. <i>You</i> are stuck with the brands we have, the rest of the consumer market have bought the smartphones that they&#x27;ve happily, willingly and repeatedly chosen.<p>Whatever you may think of the tech industry, it very closely reflects what most consumers want. If you want something no one else wants, make it or evangelize, asking the government to forcibly change outcomes is awful.')
