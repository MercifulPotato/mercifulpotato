I liked &#x27;&#x27;War and Peace too&#x27;, and can somewhat understand why they call &#x27;Anna Karenina&#x27; one of the best books ever written.<p>Just recently, I finished &#x27;Doctor Zhivago&#x27;, and &#x27;Fathers and Sons&#x27;, and &#x27;The Master and Margarita&#x27;. I thought they were all brilliant.<p>Since the year is coming to and end, I hope to reread VS Naipaul&#x27;s &#x27;A House for Mr Biswas&#x27;. It&#x27;s my favorite novel and I keep coming back to it again and again.')
