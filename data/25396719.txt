If at all possible our network admins want IPv6 only networks, the sad fact is that it&#x27;s not possible in most cases.<p>We had to return stacks of Cisco equipment, because despite being brand new it had no IPv6 support. We should have checked of cause, but we just didn&#x27;t imagine that you could buy IPv4 only equipment in 2020.<p>Software is even worse, we have had software that advertised IPv6 support, so we build an IPv6 only solution, only to find out that the manufacturer has NEVER had a customer using their software on IPv6. They tested it six years ago and never followed up, meaning that IPv6 does actually work in the latest versions.<p>Docker is another example, who in their right mind designed Docker to be a IPv4 only solution and then attempts to bolt on IPv6 later. It should have been IPv6 and then if you really needed it you could add an IPv4 ingress. Most of the issues we have experience using Docker could have been avoided by using IPv6 and dropping IPv4 all together.')
