Item(by='lloeki', descendants=None, kids=[25411735], score=None, time=1607901994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411362, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think the problem is actually swap files themselves, though, but the user experience with them.<p>Agreed, the UX is 99% the reason of me hating swap files. More often than not I choose recover, only to discover the diff is literally null. Come on, you could not check for that before interrupting? And then in any case you have double the annoyance with that recovered buffer as the old swap remains and you have to delete it or you get the warning again on the next open.<p>It’s kind of like changing branches with git and then back again, vim notices the time stamp of an opened file changed vs the last buffer save, lets you change the file but complains on :w that the file “changed” outside, yet is unable to a) show you a diff of current buffer vs current file, nor b) realised that the filesystem state vs buffer state at last save (which vim fully knows about) produces a null diff, so the buffer changes are safe to write.')
