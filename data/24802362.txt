Everything in software these days are about; &quot;how do i avoid doing any work?&quot; No one implements anything, they just use what someone else has written. Nobody wants to learn of understand how things really work. Nobody cares how well something is written. We write single threaded applications in interpreted languages that could literally fun 1000x faster on the CPUs we have (add a few zeros of you add the GPU).<p>So often when I talk to programmers they excuse their code with &quot;Its just a toy implementation&quot;, &quot;Our customers dont need all the features&quot;, &quot;its fast enough&quot;, &quot;we can re-implement it later&quot;. Rule one if you avoid failure: Aspire to be good.<p>Why are we fetishizing mediocracy? Why are so few people aiming to implement things on the beading edge? Why are we trying to avoid anything that is hard?')
