Entry is essentially free and so is the emergency &#x2F; opd treatment. For procedures they charge peanuts compared to private sector. The only thing, there is a waiting list and hygeine is not always a priority.<p>There is an AIIMS  hospital in Delhi and I had the misfortune of taking a relative there for treating surgical infection. It was brutal. We got in line around 9 am. Had to put the patient on a gurney and wait. Around 3 pm slowly our place reached to the inside emergency ward. Around 7 pm we finally were attended by an intern. Took 6 pricks to insert a catather then a senior resident was called in to help. Around an hour later the medication started to do some work. Around 10 pm more medication was administered. We ended up asking the doctor to let us go because it was 12 am and we needed to consume some food, pee.<p>Never again. This was around 5 years ago and I hope things have improved for the sake of patients.')
