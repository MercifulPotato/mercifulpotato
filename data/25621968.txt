Even if Google wins this case and the APIs cannot legally acquire copyright protection, the third-party can sue the developer&#x2F;s for disclosing trade secrets. The code legally is clean (IP-wise) at this point, but the developer&#x2F;s have broken a contract with the third-party provider in doing so, and they can sue those developer&#x2F;s (however, any users of the released code are protected since they are not the signatories&#x2F;parties to the contract).')
