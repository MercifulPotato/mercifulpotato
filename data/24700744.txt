Revenue which comes from consumer spending, not ads.<p>An article from SensorTower (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensortower.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensortower.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-20...</a>) says that in the first half of 2020, people spent $17.3 billion through Google Play.<p>Assuming Google gets a 30% cut of all of that, it would be $5.2 billion of revenue for half a year, so annualized that&#x27;d be over $10 billion&#x2F;year. Perhaps Google doesn&#x27;t get a 30% cut of absolutely every transaction (different rules could apply to books, music, TV, and movies), but it gives you a ballpark number.<p>The Play store and the Android OS aren&#x27;t the same thing, of course, but creating Android obviously helped put Google in the position to get that Play revenue. And if it were to stop developing Android, that would probably hurt Play revenue.')
