It can still be helpful even if you don&#x27;t want a cert because naturally there is <i>some</i> overlap between passing a cert and knowing how to use AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure, and one great thing about ACG is access to the AWS playground environments where you can get hands-on experience. However, if your goal is to ignore the cert and really <i>learn</i> the material, you might look elsewhere.<p>That said, the ACG courses for the basic level AWS certs really don&#x27;t take more than a couple weekends to go through, and at only $25&#x2F;mo, it&#x27;s not a bad investment to just pay for 1 month, get the foundational level knowledge, then move on to other ways of learning.')
