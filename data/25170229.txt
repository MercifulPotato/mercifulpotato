The idea of a 10x engineer isn&#x27;t one who codes a similar implementation 10x quicker, that&#x27;s ridicules and clearly taking the idea too literally. There&#x27;s a clear upper bound on implementation efficiency, and it&#x27;s probably below 10x. There is, however, no upper bound on efficiencies gained through creative problem solving.<p>The real magic, as you noted, is in understanding the business and being an expert in creative problem solving. A 10xer might develop a tool that thousands of people in the company use and saves millions of hours of time. Or they might design a system with the absolute minimum of complexity, that is a joy to work on and reduces turnover and increases feature velocity. Or, they might just learn to say NO a lot and cut scope creep and allow the company to deliver what&#x27;s actually important.<p>I imagine some people don&#x27;t believe in 10x engineers, because they work really boring jobs where creative problem solving isn&#x27;t that important. When the implementation is straightforward there&#x27;s not going to be that much of a gap between the worst and the best. But even in a boring job there is ample room to be a 10xer, you just have to think outside of the box more, understand the business, and understand what&#x27;s causing friction in implementation.')
