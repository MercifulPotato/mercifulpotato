Item(by='choward', descendants=None, kids=[24702016], score=None, time=1601976316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695928, text='&gt; With end to end encryption, however you can show up with a warrant all you want it makes no difference because they physically cannot hand you clear-text communications.<p>Well, no. That&#x27;s the issue!<p>They shouldn&#x27;t be executing search warrant behind your back to some their party that happens to be stirring your data. They should execute the search warrant on the person who owns the data they&#x27;re investigating. If they refuse to give up the data they&#x27;re breaking the law.<p>&gt; Same for encryption at rest. The strength of the encryption algorithms we have today makes it near impossible to recover the clear-text data.<p>Same for encryption at rest. We already have laws for that. Get a search warrant. If they refuse to give the data you have a warrant for they broke the law. For example, if you have something in a safe the cops won&#x27;t just come into your house and crack your safe. They&#x27;ll get a warrant first then in theory you&#x27;ll open it for them or they&#x27;ll have to crack it if you break the law and don&#x27;t open it.')
