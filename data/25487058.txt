Any type of radiant energy would presumably support SAR techniques, from sonar to x rays, although the &#x27;R&#x27; in SAR presumably limits it to radio frequency range (~30Hz-300GHz).  Some of which, as I mentioned originally, absolutely would see through buildings.<p>My point is that the headline and article are trying to make the case that &#x27;SAR can&#x27;t see through buildings&#x27;, when it should be &#x27;Why it looks like our satellites are seeing through buildings&#x27; because that is all that is explained.')
