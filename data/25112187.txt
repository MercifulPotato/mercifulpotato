It doesn&#x27;t really effect my life. I&#x27;m slightly supporting abortion because I&#x27;m concerned about the quality of life of the mother and father.<p>However I am saying that the ethical logic is sound. What&#x27;s the difference between killing a man versus killing the man while he&#x27;s still a baby inside his mother?<p>That being said there are scenarios where the above logic does get seemingly absurd. At what point is it considered murder? If I use a condom, I&#x27;m basically aborting sperm, because anyone of those little guys can become a full blown human being. Is that murder?<p>Note that I used the word &quot;seemingly&quot; it seems absurd but the question is worth considering as much as abortion itself. Is using a condom murder? Is abortion murder? I don&#x27;t know. But the ethical paradox is real.')
