I was so disappointed on what protestant christianity had to offer and felt spiritually bankrupt. I tried zen buddhism and drugs but they couldn&#x27;t fill the void. Eventually I found my way to Orthodox Church. The deepness and practicality of it&#x27;s teachings has given me a purpose for my life and something to live (and die) for.<p>So if you ask me should you explore the Faith, I answer with a counter question: do you want to know what - or who - the Truth is before you die? In your dead bed you won&#x27;t regret exploring it but you may regret not doing so.<p>Enjoy your search!')
