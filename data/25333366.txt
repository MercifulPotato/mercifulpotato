Contrary to all the current replies to this comment, it does not look to me that this is using a generalized Electron escape; rather, it is using specific main&#x2F;render IPC calls which Teams has implemented unsafely as the escape mechanism. Perhaps folks are confusing this with an electron sandbox issue because Teams happens to have called the variable containing their IPC APIs &quot;electronSafeIpc&quot;.')
