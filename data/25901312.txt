I thought it&#x27;s &quot;just a guy&quot; sitting in the car for good measure, but it turns out that the majority of drivers is not fit for the job even after lengthy training, see e.g. [1] (a gread podcast in general).<p>Also all autonomous driving companies employ safety drivers - except one.<p>&gt; NHTSA scrutinizes crashes that involve anything close to Autopilot and FSD quite heavily.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t put too much hope into the NHTSA regulating Autopilot. It took a two year legal battle to get the data driving their analysis of the Autopilot in 2017, turns out it was completely provided by Tesla, but worse, when confounders where removed, it still showed a higher crash rate for Autopilot.<p>If you take a non-American view of Autopilot, Europeans agencies did scrutinize the crashes more closely and as a result have restricted the use of Autopilot.<p>If you are interested in the topic of autonomous driving I recommend the Autonocast podcast.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autonocast.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;205-why-teslas-full-self-driving-beta-is-dangerous" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autonocast.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;205-why-teslas-ful...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;cars&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;in-2017-the-feds-said-tesla-autopilot-cut-crashes-40-that-was-bogus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;cars&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;in-2017-the-feds-said-t...</a>')
