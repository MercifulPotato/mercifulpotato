You could put a lot of effort into it but it&#x27;s not worth it. Nobody beyond a few vociferous cranks _really_ cares about IP scanning.<p>The real way to stay off radars (eg dshield) while mass scanning is have a ton of unrelated IPs and scan as slow as you can stand. This assumes good randomization (not obviously striping across networks from the same IP).')
