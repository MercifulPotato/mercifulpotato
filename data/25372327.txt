If you are buying lots of infrastructure from AWS, there&#x27;s just no reason to buy MongoDB or Redis from their creators: you would just put more load on your accounting, monitoring and cost controlling and will have nothing extra in return, except pride for supporting open source.<p>There is an interesting model at Google cloud, where I can deploy and use a Grafana stack for moderate $50&#x2F;month.
