Michal and I published papers based on its resulting data, which was collected with user consent and only from users who used the app (not their friends). We worked in the Psychometrics Centre - a research group in Cambridge University. Prof. Kogan joined Cambridge University later on in 2013 as an independent faculty member not in the Psychometrics Centre, created his own app &#x27;mydigitallife,&#x27; and went on to work with Cambridge Analytica using data from users of his app and their friends.<p>So key points from my perspective are (1) My app isn&#x27;t the same as Kogan&#x27;s app, (2) I didn&#x27;t work with Cambridge Analytica, (3) Kogan was independent faculty, not part of the Psychometrics Centre.<p>As you&#x27;ve noticed from my post history, I don&#x27;t usually use this website. I do, however, have an alert set up that pings me links when someone uses my name online. I have it set up so that I can attempt to correct journalists who write about me and my research group and get the facts wrong.<p>Hope this clarifies things<p>Edit: Since I&#x27;m here. I think it&#x27;s critical that NYU&#x27;s Ad Observatory continues and that academics have freedom to collect data and report results that might embarrass rich and powerful companies. Tweet #9 in this thread is the key one ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;doctorow&#x2F;status&#x2F;1329873620353515520" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;doctorow&#x2F;status&#x2F;1329873620353515520</a> ) - how do we know that FB&#x27;s own ad library isn&#x27;t good enough? Because Ad Observatory found that it wasn&#x27;t reporting all instances of political ads.')
