Item(by='bcrl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608082251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432615, text='Having watched how our local TV station has steadily cut back on staffing at all levels, I would say that front line staff covering the news are in more danger today than 10-20 years ago.  Covering a story used to mean having 3+ people on site to cover the story: the reporter, a camera person and an microphone or uplink tech as well.  These days reporters are sent out on their own with a camera stand and do almost all of the work by themselves.<p>Our local newspapers have seen similar cutbacks.  The left and right wing papers were bought out, merged and now the same staff produce 2 different papers with slightly different spins on the same matters.<p>With all these cutbacks, it&#x27;s no wonder journalists have a harder time doing in depth and thorough jobs reporting the stories of the day.  The advertising dollars have walked away from the local news outlets, and as a result there is far less local oversight.<p>If we as a society don&#x27;t figure out how to address how journalism is funded, things will continue to the point where only some well funded niches remain covered in any depth.  Democracy can&#x27;t function without oversight, and citizens can&#x27;t exercise their oversight of governments without knowledge of what is going on.  This is dangerous for the public, but it&#x27;s not the journalists&#x27; fault.  And bad journalism happens when journalists aren&#x27;t funded to do the kind of in depth stories that cost real dollars to investigate and produce.')
