When someone says &quot;Just believe in yourself and anything is possible&quot;, they don&#x27;t actually believe that ANYTHING is possible.<p>Phrases like that provide a framework for people to live their life by.  Religion is the same thing.  These are psychological tools that can be used, to help keep yourself on the right path - One of happiness, productivity, etc.<p>Anyways, just another way to look at it I guess rather than dismissing them.  I have that initial reaction too.')
