It was kind of a programming thing, but not exactly. You could certainly program it. And it could load XCMDs and XFCNs to  expand the universe of things you could do with it. But it was a lot like PowerPoint too. I wasted a ton of time playing with transitions (dissolve, fade, swipe up, swipe across, etc) between cards.<p>I think HyperCard was the last thing of its kind. By that I mean its a throwback to when the default assumption was that anyone who bought a computer was, as a matter of course, going to program it. The same way many machines in the 1980s booted into BASIC interpreters and pretty much all of them included one in the default environment. HyperCard was the last effort that I can think of to take that idea and make it accessible to people who didn&#x27;t know what &quot;programming&quot; was.<p>The last macs that shipped with it were, IMO, the last computers that came, by default, with everything their users needed to create and distribute programs for them and the assumption that most of their users would do just that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that idea can be replicated anymore. I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t, at scale.')
