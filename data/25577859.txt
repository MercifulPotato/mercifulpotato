Item(by='manigandham', descendants=None, kids=[25578133, 25578690], score=None, time=1609296524, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577657, text='Like I said, if you zoom out then you can clearly see the actual &quot;Ice Caves&quot; road #53 with lane markings, and a smaller &quot;Ice Cave&quot; dirt road that ends near that group of buildings. Everything after that is just dirt, no roads at all regardless of what Google says, which is my point.<p>Zoom out, assess the terrain, look for markings, check for buildings, and compare paths to the destination. Unless you&#x27;re visiting the bottom of the crater there, you shouldn&#x27;t ever be going off that main highway.<p>The map tiles should also cached (how else would it show you the turns?) but yes offline&#x2F;paper maps are a must when going into unfamiliar areas.')
