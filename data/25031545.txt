These creative and thought provoking exercises allow the reader to reflect on their life and determine what they should do with their future. They can then generate a road map and plan how to accomplish their goals.<p>The book is largely geared towards working people but I think itâ€™s actually more relevant if you have the freedom to do anything you want. Figure out what you want to be doing and motivation will follow.')
