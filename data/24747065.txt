I don&#x27;t doubt what you say about being burnt when adopting in the early days. However, it is simultaneously true that people have successfully used Julia in several commercial applications and significant research codebases for many years now.<p>I routinely point people to the Julia Computing case studies for this reason: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juliacomputing.com&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juliacomputing.com&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;</a><p>We also request people to please file an issue against Julia or a package if it doesn&#x27;t do what you expect it to, or post on discourse. That way, even though you may go ahead with a different tool, someone is likely to fix it by the time you come back the next time. :-)')
