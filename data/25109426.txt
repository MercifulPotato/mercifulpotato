There is a sentiment in investors about travel being a cold market, and many arent interested outright(regardless of traction).<p>Airbnb was an exception given they had good people backing them (PG et al) just based on team and they competed in a different segment and that they had enough funds to actually show repeats and retention (something many others lack). It did spawn a few clones all over which got funded, but folded very early. This indeed helped Airbnb in later rounds as they virtually had no competition.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s plenty of investors for software as a service.<p>True when the Gross Margins are 60-80% and not about 5-10% as in case of travel.<p>&gt; tech services like AirBnB and TripAdvisor are competing with DIY search<p>Travel planning is an experience in itself, and hacking those prices&#x2F;places gives a dopamine hit which no app can compensate for imo. People like to try out the app and use it once, but the retention for these apps are low. Users tend to forget about these apps next time they travel.')
