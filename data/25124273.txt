We have prescriptions here and it&#x27;s a service that needs disrupting. My Dad has a monthly prescription he has to pick up from Boots because no delivery service he has ever used has been reliable. The branch he goes to is 10 miles from his home because every other branch nearer to him has let him down badly in the past with missing items he has had to chase up for days afterwards.<p>We&#x27;re talking about picking 6 labelled items from a shelf and putting them in a paper bag.
