The indirect symptoms of heart disease such as loss of athleticism and cognitive function would be important.<p>Only if as you say the meaningful symptoms show up during common reproductive years.<p>So far I see no evidence that that is the case.<p>&gt;Heredity is one of the stronger predictors of heart disease so itâ€™s got a strong genetic component beyond diet and lifestyle.<p>Again there is no evidence that it is common that hereditary heart disease that generally affects people 50+ has meaningful symptoms during reproductive years.<p>And there is even less evidence that these symptoms are meaningful enough to impact fertility to such an extent that it creates significant short term evolutionary pressure.<p>You&#x27;re taking 1 condition which is common in later life and saying: well maybe some people with that condition actually develop it earlier in life, and just maybe some people that develop it earlier have some externally significant symptoms, and maybe some of those people have specific symptoms that would make them less likely to reproduce all else being equal.<p>Each step of that funnel is a complete unknown, and each step diminishes the overall impact that genes that control the most common forms of hereditary heart disease have on reproductive fitness.')
