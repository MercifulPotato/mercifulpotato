How do we know it&#x27;s a feature vs a temporarily convenient oversight?<p>I would point out that Apple has permitted booting alternative operating systems throughout their m68k (at least the m68ks that could meaningfully boot Linux or a BSD derivative) [1], PowerPC [2], and Intel [3] phases. It&#x27;s only on Intel they actively made this a feature, because Windows Bootcamp probably allowed to sell them a certain percentage more Macs.<p>The only reason to believe they would change this is that the Apple Silicon architecture changes would have Apple be interested in the Mac being some sort of equivalent to an iPod Touch. I don&#x27;t really see Apple being interested in that, and Apple reps have gone on record to argue similar points as well.<p>[1]: e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.netbsd.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;mac68k&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.netbsd.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;mac68k&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.netbsd.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;macppc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.netbsd.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;macppc&#x2F;</a>\n[3]: Uh, anything that boots on x86 EFI will probably boot.')
