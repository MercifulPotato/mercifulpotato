But we can discard this (personally I think its a weak argument and is a distraction).  The main point is not &quot;are we better than we were 50 years ago?&quot; but rather &quot;will we continue this short term trend and reach star trek society?&quot;.<p>The warning from Gray is that if you believe that the world is going automatically on the right path then you don&#x27;t need to fight for it. You dont see the return of torture as something to be fought against, but just a minor setback.  You dont see the rise of proxy wars as something to be criticised, its just a setback to progress. The rise of fascism in Eastern europe and the removal of rights is just a setback in the inexorable rise of progress. We toppled Saddam after all. China will naturally move to democracy. Its neo liberal science fiction.<p>The warning is that any progress we make is not a natural law. &quot;Progression&quot; is created by and can be destroyed by humans. Indeed when you see history through this lens one often stops calling change &quot;progress&quot;.<p>The warning by Gray is that &quot;believe the Long Peace and technological progress put us at the dawn of the Golden Age&quot; is dangerous hubris and is a belief that can destroy the very things that have been achieved.<p>Gray does not try to prove that no change has been made, he tries to point out that the good changes need to be continually fought for and defended.<p>Cats are humble.')
