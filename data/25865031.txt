Every state gets a minimum of three electoral votes regardless of their population, so as a result, a single vote in a sparsely populated state like Wyoming has up to four times the influence that a single vote in a densely populated state like NJ has.  The current political make-up of the country is such that right-wing politicians find far greater support in rural areas and thus are favored by the electoral college.  So far only right-wing politicians have managed to win the electoral college without winning a majority in the popular vote.<p>Similar logic applies to the Senate:  regardless of population every state gets two senators.  Right-wing senators have received fewer actual votes (by individual voters) than left-wing senators for years, yet in that time right-wing control of the senate has been more common than left-wing control.  Right now the split in the Senate is 50-50 (Vice President, a Democrat, breaks the tie) but the total number of votes cast for Democratic senators was much higher than the number cast for Republicans.<p>You literally have to deny reality when you deny that the electoral college and the senate represent a structural advantage for Republicans right now.')
