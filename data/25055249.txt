But Apple keeps making changes with every version, and some of those changes seem to be for no good reason. You get a kind of muscle memory after a while, from using your IDE. When a button is moved or removed, or a menu is changed, it adds friction to your day.<p>Also, I got bit with this thing they did for the new ARM chips in the Macs. Our script to build a fat binary (device and simulator) for a in-house framework broke, and we couldn&#x27;t add the simulator anymore. That took a lot of tracking down to fix. It&#x27;s constant aggravation like that that wears on a person. Last year, we had the 3rd-party mapping software we use break, because -- as best as I can tell -- Apple changed the implementation for drawing. That was a pain in the ass to track down, too.<p>I wasn&#x27;t kidding when I wrote that I was a fanboy. But the other day I was thinking of Steve Ballmer, years ago, running around on stage like a sweaty lunatic -- &quot;Developers, developers, developers!&quot; I mocked him then. Now I&#x27;m sorry I did.')
