I think &quot;pro&quot; software (a wiggly term) tends to require a non-standard UI (however, I do miss when Photoshop used the base OS&#x27; UI). Pro tools end up being a bit of their own window management and filesystem that overlaps with the OS. Their decisions are part of the ergonomics of being productive in the app.<p>I remember when macOS started adding smart folders and other database features to Finder. I was hoping the base OS could do photo management and Photos&#x2F;Aperture could just do the retouching. The same tooling could replace iTunes. After all, a filesystem is just a very opinionated database, right? In practice I&#x27;m not sure how well it would have played out.')
