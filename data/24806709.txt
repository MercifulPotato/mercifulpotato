If you were a contractor they wouldn&#x27;t have to do that stuff and you&#x27;d get taxed at a weird rate and have to report it yourself. But you&#x27;d have to actually be a contractor for that, if you&#x27;re truly an employee then it is what it is.<p>So it sounds like the workaround is that said MA company has to start a NH foreign entity, which I assume is all but free, and have that foreign entity pay the employees. That way they&#x27;re &quot;working remote&quot; for a NH entity and sidestep all this nonsense.<p>But it&#x27;s fair to say... why bother, just go back to using the rules you clearly understood to be fair which you were using earlier this year.')
