Still, it matters in a quick evaluation so I&#x27;m surprised it isn&#x27;t in there.<p>A few examples come to mind where, for instance, white has a bishop and knight attacking f7 and it&#x27;s black to move. If black castles nothing interesting happens and white is likely overextended. But if black cannot castle white will win a rook.<p>I can make up a similar situation with en passant, and this does come up, but a lot less frequently.<p>So anyway, surprised you wouldn&#x27;t toss a few bits in there, at least the 2 for ability to castle by each player.')
