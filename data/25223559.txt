Item(by='ihmissuti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606425120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222478, text='Thanks for testing! I&#x27;ll write a description of how it makes the predictions and add it to the tool.<p>But in short, it uses a machine learning model that I trained with a dataset that contains all stories and comments between 2006 and 2017: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaggle.com&#x2F;hacker-news&#x2F;hacker-news" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaggle.com&#x2F;hacker-news&#x2F;hacker-news</a><p>I&#x27;ve tested various approaches, and currently, the algorithm takes the title as an input and transforms it into an array of numbers between 0 and 1 (each character is a number). Then I give these arrays to the machine learning model (brain.js feed-forward neural network) and the number of scores as an output. After learning and iterating over the data, it spits out the prediction model that I can use to predict the outcome of different title variations.<p>I&#x27;ve tested the algorithm with approx. 10.000 posts and it has been able to predict 60% of the cases correctly. So, it&#x27;s not perfect yet, but I use this method in a situation where I don&#x27;t have any experience of which type of title would work + I don&#x27;t have time to do &quot;proper&quot; pre-testing.')
