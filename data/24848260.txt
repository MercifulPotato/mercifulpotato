SQLite becomes a universal desktop workbench for SQL. This flexibility also applies to things like delimited identifiers [1].<p>The problem is not that SQLite uses VARIANT datatypes, the problem is that once a datatype is specified it is not enforced by the engine. SQLite could&#x2F;should add a PRAGMA to enable Domain Integrity much like it does with Foreign Keys (PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_keywords.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_keywords.html</a>')
