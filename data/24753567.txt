I&#x27;ve heard the opposing argument, that since it&#x27;s a relatively new card (out since Dec 2019?) I should expect some bugs, which is insane one year later. It&#x27;s actually unusable, I have to log into my machine via SSH to restart it, or force reboot. It might break after 30 minutes or 3 days, when idle or busy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;drm&#x2F;amd&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;929" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;drm&#x2F;amd&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;929</a><p>AMD developers in that thread are chasing their tails and still haven&#x27;t figured out why so many cards are having issues, and why other aren&#x27;t, but as a consumer, that&#x27;s really not inspiring at all.')
