We would however be interested in switching to JaaS as we’d like to get away from managing our own infra and just host a landing page through, e.g., NextJS on Vercel, with a JaaS iFrame.<p>The landing page mentions deep customisation but when clicking through to the documentation I see only custom branding, etc., through the developer web console. We have some customisations on the front-end (custom kick messages, auto-enabling lobbies, etc). Is it possible to make these sorts of customisations to JaaS? It seems like an iFrame is the recommended integration so would be great to get a sense if any of these things are possible. Could you speak generally to the degree of customisation possible outside of the developer web console?<p>Thanks in advance.')
