It&#x27;s a basic tradition that helps instill patriotism, which from a purely practical point of view, is almost a political necessity in a country as diverse as America. Criticizing one&#x27;s own country, which is probably one of the most American things one can do, is absolutely not possible in North Korea.<p>I don&#x27;t want to assume the country that you&#x27;re from, but I&#x27;ll say this: Europeans often have this constant attitude that they&#x27;re the forefront of civilization and that anyone who doesn&#x27;t match their highly subjective standards is ethically &quot;behind.&quot; It&#x27;s nauseating and frankly just the new flavor of Eurocentric imperialism.')
