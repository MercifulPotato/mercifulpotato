Start with a dual boot windows and linux system, and delete the linux partition...   And suddenly windows won&#x27;t boot!   Or with some UEFI setups, leaves linux as a default boot option that half boots linux and then won&#x27;t complete because it can&#x27;t mount the root filesystem.<p>It&#x27;s just poor design.<p>I&#x27;m imagining something more like the UEFI menu having a &quot;Right click, Delete&quot; option next to each bootable OS.  Clicking delete would run that OS&#x27;s uninstaller code and refresh the menu.<p>You could likewise have a &quot;Add new OS&quot; button in the UEFI firmware where you can select from a list of available OS&#x27;s to download from the net, or provide your own URL to an iso or some installation metadata file.')
