If I understand things correctly, you are currently trying to build a font editor in Rust(runebender). Because there is no good UI library in Rust, and there&#x27;s good reason to think Rust is a good fit for this, you want to build your own (Druid). So far so good. But, now you are also trying to build your own 2D renderer and not a basic one: you want to advance the state of the art in that field too.<p>Not that I&#x27;m not exited, because if all this lands, it will be super great for the Rust ecosystem, but sometimes because you&#x27;re so deep in the rabbit hole, I&#x27;m afraid you get burned-out (or bored) and that everything would be lost because nothing would be polished enough to be usable at that point.<p>Is that a risk you&#x27;re taking on purpose? Or is it just that you have a plan to avoid it?<p>Thanks in advance.')
