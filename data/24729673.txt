I always get heavily downvoted as I don&#x27;t think others are as open minded to hearing a different viewpoint as you.<p>I agree too.  But, I see science as an individual&#x27;s pursuit.  I really mean it when I say that science is something one should verify personally.

As an individual, it is very hard to stand against the herd.  Whether that is avoiding being drowned as a witch, or being forced to vaccinate oneself for the good of the herd.')
