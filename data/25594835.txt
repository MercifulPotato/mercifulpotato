FYI the soundtrack is available on Spotify or for sale. \n(I have no affiliation with the Hades folks, i just like what they do)<p>I also really enjoy The Binding of Isaac AB+.  Item interaction is amazing. I have it for Switch, though I have considered picking it up for PC as well so I can use the mods.')
