It might be slightly inconvenient, yes, but you almost make it sound like even SMS is an impossible task; SMS is not even <i>that</i> old and none of the millions who used it before there were even apps to do so had much of the problems you mention. Also because not everyone has a usecase requiring to know who has what app.<p>I run WhatsApp on an Android instance with an account solely for that, so no contacts etc, and literally all my contacts&#x2F;groups in WhatsApp are people who at one point told &#x27;let&#x27;s do this via whatsapp&#x27;. Then again, I don&#x27;t need to message people I don&#x27;t know with it so I don&#x27;t have any problems.<p><i>Do you, every time you want to message someone, manually copy in their number? For every person you communicate with?</i><p>No, just once, or else they send me a message and we&#x27;re talking.<p>tldr; ok I&#x27;m not &#x27;most people&#x27; in this regard, but still I think you&#x27;re making things look way harder then they actually are')
