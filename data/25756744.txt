I&#x27;ve never been a huge reader but would like to read more. I find I have no idea what book to read and I didn&#x27;t want to waste to reading a book I won&#x27;t enjoy.\nThe site works by users entering a tv show, movie or game they like and we&#x27;ll recommends some books. Books have links to Amazon where if a book is purchased we&#x27;ll take a commission.<p>So far the biggest issue has been manaully finding content. It&#x27;s a slow process but hopefully it will slowly grow to be a great resource.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;similarbooks.to&#x2F;')
