Given that this is HN I expected to find some good discussion in the comments - and there is a bit, increasing over time - but there&#x27;s just so much propaganda &#x2F; outright stupid stuff here in the comments.<p>This article seems like it <i>should</i> be on HN, but the stuff in the comments made me want to flag it (I didn&#x27;t). Fortunately it seems the good discussion <i>is</i> coming out on top over time, and the worst comments do get down voted &amp; flagged pretty quickly. But, as you said, there is a lot of repetitive back-and-forth here which has already been done over the past few days.')
