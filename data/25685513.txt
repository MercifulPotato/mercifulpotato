BK traffic (for the most part) moves significantly slower than SF traffic. There aren&#x27;t as many uninterrupted stretches of road in BK where motorists can speed up to 50 mph. This makes BK (and Manhattan where traffic moves significantly slower than both) a safer place to walk and bike. Furthermore, the hilly topography of SF creates unique blind spots that the flat expanse of simply NYC doesn&#x27;t have.')
