I&#x27;ll wait until the next couple of episodes of the saga are out. The thing is that Navalny and Putin are the only actors of Russian political theater widely recognizable outside Russia (Dyomushkin? Platoshkin? Anyone heard about them?). Now that Navalny made it to CNN news, (hell, his was in HN top!) I&#x27;m  curious what&#x27;s his next move. It has to be something really-really strong. Also I&#x27;d be very disappointed if he doesn&#x27;t return to Russia.')
