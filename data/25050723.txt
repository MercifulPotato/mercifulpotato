Do you know more about the patents? I don&#x27;t have any example at hand, but often I saw when browsing patents in the space I am interested in, that the patented solutions are kind of obvious when you dig deeper into something and the engineers who patented them just got there first. This is very frustrating, because then you need to spend time on finding different way, sometimes more difficult to achieve the same goal. It&#x27;s like someone learned about numbers and then found that 2x2=4 and patented it, and then you cannot use this equation but instead you have to do like 1+1+2=4 if that makes sense. So my point is - if there is similar situation with these patents, then that kind of explains why there is no real competition.')
