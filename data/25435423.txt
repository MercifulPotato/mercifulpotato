Item(by='altarius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608067288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434865, text='RAW is supposed to be the data that the sensor captures (well, today that&#x27;s more or less true). The actual images saved on phone&#x2F;SD (JPEG or HEIC or whatever) are just processed RAWs with some destructive presets (WB, contrast curve, sharpening, color tone-mapping, ...) applied and written out to storage. Some of these presets are destructive (gamma curves, bit-depth reduction for JPEG) and cannot be undone.<p>So of course RAW doesn&#x27;t make for better photos, but for original input data to do your own edit on. If you don&#x27;t know how to edit, you&#x27;re probably better off with the experience&#x2F;work that the manufacturer put into the in-camera presets.<p>In my opinion the main advantage is that RAW files save the full color-depth info _and_ RAW files are not gamma-mapped (i.e. linear encoded), that enables all of your use-cases above. You would still get 90% of that advantage if you were to demosaic, color correct to a profile-connection-space but keep the linear encoding and original 12-16 bit depth, even if you were to compress that data via DCT&#x2F;JPEG to save space. That&#x27;s sort of what ProRAW is.')
