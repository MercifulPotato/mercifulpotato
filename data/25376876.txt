To add bokeh, you have to separate the subject from the background, and then also determine how far different parts of the background are. This requires very advanced AI for non-trivial images (see the imperfections in Photoshop&#x27;s &quot;select subject&quot; tool), which Apple is actually still doing (that&#x27;s what portrait mode is). But if it&#x27;s not perfect, it quickly becomes worthless, so in short, they are doing it, but only the most advanced companies can try.')
