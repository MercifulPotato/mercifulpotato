I&#x27;d argue programming specialties are still broad, maybe frontend, backend, iOS, android, and embedded. Perhaps as the software development matures, we&#x27;ll see more specialized fragmentation.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nursinglicensemap.com&#x2F;advanced-practice-nursing&#x2F;nurse-practitioner&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nursinglicensemap.com&#x2F;advanced-practice-nursing&#x2F;nurs...</a>')
