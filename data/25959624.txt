Meaning, are we about to see a ton of cheaper chips like this RP2040 that are using older&#x2F;slower&#x2F;obsolete fab capacity? Or is the same equipment able to be used across a family of process sizes?<p>In other words, once TSMC has X amount of capacity on 40nm, is that capacity always around and fixed to 40nm? If so, I imagine that creating new chips that don&#x27;t need to be super fast will just become super cheap.')
