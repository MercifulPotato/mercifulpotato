Before I was just trying to explain what the person I replied to probably already knew intuitively.<p>&gt; how Weta actually worked in Kong which is very typical<p>It is not typical to have 10,000 4k maps on a creature.  What has been typical when rendering at 2k is a set of 2k maps for face, torso, arms and legs. Maybe a single arm and leg can be painted and the UVs can be mirrored, though mostly texture painters will layout the UVs separately and duplicate the texture themselves to leave room for variations.<p>&gt;  it is not feasible to have a TD in the delivery deadlines of the shots for a show.<p>Actually most of the people working on shots are considered TDs.  Specific asset work for some sequence with a hero asset is actually very common, which makes sense if you think about it from a story point of view of needing a visual change to communicate a change of circumstances.<p>4k rendering (was the 2017 king kong rendered in 4k?) and all the closeups of king kong mean that higher resolution maps and more granular sections are understandable, but it doesn&#x27;t add up to going from 16 2k maps to 10,000 4k maps.  Maps like diffuse, specular and subsurface albedo are also just multiplicative, so there is no reason to have multiple maps unless they need to be rebalanced against each other per shot (such as for variations).<p>You still never actually explained a problem or inconsistency with anything I&#x27;ve said.')
