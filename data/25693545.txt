Trump was allowed to use the platform because media companies used it to follow him and Twitter wants everyone at CNN and FOX to be reading Twitter. Trump was always going to be permanently banned from Twitter when he was no longer politically relevant simply because he&#x27;s broken the rules literally hundreds of times. It simply happens that he finally ranted himself into irrelevance (Facebook&#x27;s ban helps here) and Twitter realized that they could push the ban up two weeks and snag a bit of the spotlight.')
