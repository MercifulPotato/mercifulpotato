This is a centuries-old debate and not one that can be settled quickly and easily.<p>As a Jew who lost some family in the Holocaust, and whose father and his parents barely got out of eastern Europe in time, I absolutely despise those who just flatly deny historical truths like the number of people tortured and killed by the Nazis.  But I&#x27;m very mixed about silencing them.  Sometimes silencing people has a way of amplifying their voices ever more.<p>But I also despise Big Tech and Big Media for obviously pushing people to vote against Trump. There&#x27;s plenty of evidence of this, ranging from suppressing and distorting his speeches to literally suppressing any good news during his tenure.<p>And by the way, Facebook and Youtube host thousands of Muslim &quot;scholars&quot; who deny or belittle the Holocaust, who accuse Jews of nasty behavior, etc.  They are not suppressed or silenced.  However, watchdogs like MEMRI and PalWatch that expose these louts are frequently suppressed, their material removed as &quot;hate speech&quot;, ironically. Why?  Because a cancel mob is constantly trying to take them down, for being supposedly islamophobic which is a trigger word. These same mobs seem to have no problem with the widespread belief across the Muslim world that the Holocaust was a hoax, that 9&#x2F;11 was perpetrated by Mossad, and similar conspiracy theories.<p>The same entities that suppress anti-vaxers also suppressed most information about hcq.  Why?  Because Trump advocated it.  Even a group of medical doctors, who have treated thousands of patients with hcq and seen positive results versus covid19, were silenced and their video taken down from Youtube and other mainstream outlets.<p>Freedom of speech is a fragile thing, easily broken.  It&#x27;s too bad so few young people have studied Voltaire and others who originated the concept that &quot;I may disagree with what you have to say, but I will give my life for your right to say it.&quot;')
