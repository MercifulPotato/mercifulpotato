Item(by='reason-mr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601741020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668643, text='All of the app stores charge 30%, with some stores going so far as to impose an evaluation fee when listing a new app.  It is completely outrageous relative to the amount of work they have done (which is amortized over all of the apps in the store), versus that of creating the app&#x2F;game.  Plus I find it fishy (in a collusionary way) that all of the stores charge basically the same percentage.  And, as pointed out, they will not allow another competitive app store on their platforms. Each store in basically a monopoly per platform, with the possible exception of steam&#x2F;windows.')
