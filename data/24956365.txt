(sure this is just for laravel, but that&#x27;s a huge subset of users, just as django&#x2F;rails are for python&#x2F;ruby)<p>Even rails doesn&#x27;t have auth baked in. For launching something fast, nothing beats prototyping in laravel. For more heavy work-loads you can offload services to go or rust for data intensive things, and still keep the majority of the code&#x2F;api.<p>For new devs especially, community matters more than just about anything. While, wordpress is a clusterfuck of security issues, vulnerabilities, and bad practices the laravel community and (symfony which is more for enterprise apps) are generally top notch.<p>Show me how you can bootstrap a full SaaS app w&#x2F; all the same features as:<p>laravel new myapp --jet --teams<p>In ANY language without using some sort of cookiecutter template, or something that is custom-brewed.')
