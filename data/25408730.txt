Devs are supposed to implement what is requested, as requested. Designers and architects are supposed to figure out <i>what</i> to request to the devs, based on the customers&#x27; needs. And this indeed entails figuring out the customers&#x27; actual problem, rather than parroting their solutions (which they are almost always unqualified to design).')
