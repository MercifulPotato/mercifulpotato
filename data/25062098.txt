Each pair can arrange a brief informal meet-up at a time that suits both parties – be it a phone call, Skype call, Google Hangout or even a coffee in person.<p>&gt; “RCTs have given me the opportunity to talk to people who work in areas that I don’t usually come across in my day to day work.” Lesley Goodburn, Patient Experience Consultant<p>&gt; RCTs allow Q members to connect with a new member each month and hear about what other colleagues are working on and share any ideas and inspiration. There are no rules here – RCTs should be viewed as an informal opportunity to connect with peers, however if scheduling means that you can’t meet that month then it’s ok.<p>&gt; We think you’ll enjoy these fun and fruitful conversations – it’s organised serendipity. Matthew Mezey, Q’s Community Manager has written a blog about the benefits of RCTs.<p>And here&#x27;s a link to that blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;q.health.org.uk&#x2F;blog-post&#x2F;easy-time-light-impact-heavy-join-qs-randomised-coffee-trial-chats&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;q.health.org.uk&#x2F;blog-post&#x2F;easy-time-light-impact-hea...</a>')
