I love the thing and it works fine, but I can&#x27;t do video editing, which I need to do. The new Macbooks were on the horizon, but I figured I&#x27;d wait for v2 of whatever came out.<p>So I bought a Dell gaming machine, for the GPU.<p>First impressions from the week:<p>* Windows is still pretty kludgy.<p>* There are no good Gmail cients for Windows (settled on eM, but it crashes a lot, on macOS I used Mailplane, Mimestream and Outlook; Outlook on windows doesn&#x27;t automatically connect to Google Calendars, even though the macOS and iOS versions do).<p>* The Dell came with a terrible keyboard, I&#x27;ll have to buy a better one. It didn&#x27;t come with speakers, so I bought some (I was planning to get reference monitors anyway, but having NO sound for a few days was interesting). It doesn&#x27;t have a webcam, which is fine, but I&#x27;d have to buy one if that becomes important.<p>* The cables, cables, cables.<p>* I can use the Phone app to connect to my iPhone, and iCloud on Windows works well enough (for Drive and Photos).<p>* Windows apps don&#x27;t adhere to the design guidelines nearly as consistently as macOS apps do. Fonts and usability is far more varied.<p>I will see about dual-booting Linux, and I&#x27;ll see about getting Davinci Resolve working.')
