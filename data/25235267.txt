They could have been used on paint company executives, who had forestalled a ban, in the &#x27;40s, on a promise to phase out lead, and absolutely did not, and tobacco executives, who actively sought to addict children. Arguably, sugar industry executives merit such treatment for actively suppressing research indicating sugar has been directly responsible for millions of deaths, and for heavily marketing to children.<p>But any bozo who shoots up a bus station apparently merits overwhelmingly more attention, so the executives directly responsible get to retire unbothered to their yachts.')
