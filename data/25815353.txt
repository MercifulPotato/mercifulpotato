I feel focusing on a niche ended up getting far more leads than when we were just a generalist &quot;We can do anything for you!&quot; company. We had a tailored website to focus on business automation, and wrote quite a lot of blog posts on the topic - being quite specific on what we can do and examples. It took close to a year after niching down like this, but eventually we started getting some good leads from good old google search. Keywords such as custom software, business software, business automation software etc.<p>Having said all that - at the end of the day my consultancy also get it&#x27;s best and biggest projects via word of mouth. In the end I realised it was very stressful for a small consultancy to work with too many clients, and we we small (5 people), so eventually I decided we need to focus on going deeper with our current client base rather than looking for new clients. This was ultimately a superpower, and took us to a consistent 7 figurers per year with a tiny team and a few key clients.<p>I sold my agency last year and have recently started writing some insights on my blog <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devtoagency.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devtoagency.com</a> - you guys may be a bit past this (as my target reader is a full-stack dev wanting to start a custom software agency), but you may find something insightful - I actually found it really hard to find good information on the internet about software agencies&#x2F;consultancies, which is why I want to try and capture my thoughts.')
