Yet it gets soundly bested by the M1 @ 3 - 3.2Ghz (running at a 50%+ advantage, 65%+ clock per clock). The M1 has an enormous IPC advantage.<p>In a multicore test the 4800u has 8 performance cores with HT. It only marginally beats an M1 with 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores (by the scaling the efficiency cores look like they&#x27;re 1&#x2F;4 performance or worse -- these are very lightweight cores).<p>Again, it&#x27;s the best of the rest, but Apple clearly holds an enormous lead here. Somehow everyone is focused on 5nm, but the A13 on 7nm was still in a substantial lead. The 4800u on 5nm is only going to be marginally better.<p>Apple clearly sandbagged this first entrant because they&#x27;re packing it into their &quot;entry level&quot; devices. In six months or whatever they&#x27;ll unveil the 6+2 core device in the mid range, the 12+2 in the high range, etc, and we&#x27;ll be back at these discussions.<p>(Speaking generally) - This whole discussion about Apple Silicon is fascinating because the goal posts have moved so much. Looking back to HN discussions a year ago and everyone was talking about some pathetically weak entrant that would be a joke, etc. Now people are celebrating that it doesn&#x27;t beat a 24-core, 300W Threadripper. Now the narrative is that it isn&#x27;t impressive because the v1 didn&#x27;t overwhelming destroy everything else in the market.')
