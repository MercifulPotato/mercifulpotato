The main downside with the weight is getting up on a bike rack to drive it somewhere, but they have rack with ramps now designed for heavy ebikes.<p>I know for sure my next bike will have full suspension, coming from mountain bikes then going back to just a hard tail was rough, even when just riding on pavement. Added a really good suspension seat post but still not like a full suspension.<p>I am looking closely at Watt Wagons new Hydra carbon full suspension at 58lbs. They are doing some good stuff with the Bafang mid drive and upgraded controller.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.juicedbikes.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;ripcurrent-s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.juicedbikes.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;ripcurrent-s</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wattwagons.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;hydra" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wattwagons.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;hydra</a>')
