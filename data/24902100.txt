Item(by='hug', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603750230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900922, text='&gt; I suppose a better question might be why hasn&#x27;t Panasonic updated this guide?<p>Because, in a general sense, it&#x27;s completely unnecessary. Cameras are used in the exact same way these days that they were 25 years ago. All of the knobs and dials are the same, they just go to 11 now. Almost everything about even a fairly modern camera is covered, including going so far as colour filter arrays and demosaicing, which is stuff that the <i>vast</i> majority of photographers don&#x27;t concern themselves with -- but if you <i>do</i> need the intro to it, it&#x27;s there.<p>There&#x27;s a few small anachronisms, and those anachronisms mean absolutely nothing to even the most technical of end users: The best example is their statement that CCDs are more common than CMOS sensors: Not anymore, but also the exact electrical mechanism by which the light is picked up is useless information for anyone reading the guide: By the time you are so deep in the weeds that the difference between a CMOS &amp; CCD matters to you, you&#x27;re not reading 101-level guides from a consumer camera manufacturer.')
