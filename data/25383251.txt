I got hired at the first and only interview in both cases. One was my first job after finishing uni and the other one was the job after that.<p>Now I work at Copenhagen University, also writing Clojure and ClojureScript (so the third Clojure job, although it was never advertised as such) along with a little bit of Java for projects inherited from my predecessor. I didn&#x27;t have any programming assignment while interviewing here either.<p>It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t get interview assignments in Denmark, but I&#x27;ve only had to do them in Python, PHP, and JavaScript.')
