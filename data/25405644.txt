I can collect everything in one central point. For example, in Thunderbird I can collect all RSS links and put them in one folder. If I then take the time once a day to read these links I can update them all at the same time. This is more a technical aspect. 2.) RSS is free. Free from advertising. Free from stuff I don&#x27;t want to see on a website or in an article. I have only the pure article, which I can then read. 3.) I can turn off the display of HTML and then have only the content of a web page. Especially for blog articles where images are not so important, I find this better.')
