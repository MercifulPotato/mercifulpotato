I have the Onesky (or rather it’s European sibling the Heritage 130P) and enjoy it. It doesn’t have any fancy features, but is easy to move around, doesn’t take up much storage space and still has plenty of power!<p>If you’re willing to spend some more, the Celestron NexStar 5 and 6 are solid telescopes that can automatically move to specific objects in the sky (this is called GoTo) which is really nice if you want to focus more on viewing objects rather than finding them. They’re low on maintenance too and work well for showing others objects in the sky as they can keep whatever you look at centered in the eyepiece.')
