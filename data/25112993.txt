Some companies get both, some just get a purchase guarantee. (I don&#x27;t know if any got R&amp;D funding without a purchase guarantee).<p>The EU has been doing commitments to purchase if approved with substantial down payments to promote R&amp;D. Japan has been doing purchase commitments, but I don&#x27;t know if they have paid any upfront.<p>For Moderna, they got both a lot of upfront R&amp;D funding and large purchase commitments from Warp Speed. They got a large purchase commitment from the EU.<p>For Pfizer, they got no R&amp;D funding from Warp Speed but a 100 m purchase commitment. From the EU they got a 300 m purchase commitment and a big down payment. They got a 120 m dose commitment from Japan.<p>AstraZenica got a big down payment in the EU and a large dose commitment, and they got R&amp;D funding and a large dose commitment from Warp Speed.<p>I believe this is how it is going with all the major COVID vaccine efforts.')
