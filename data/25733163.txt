However, is size the correct proxy for success? I would argue it isn&#x27;t for companies, and rather the opposite in fact.<p>A small company that does well what it set out to do is successful in my view, even if you can count the employees on one hand. Likewise for software projects. Also, maintenance mode is a thing, and it&#x27;s all right, so the number of commits isn&#x27;t a good proxy either, IMO.')
