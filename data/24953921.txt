I mean, this is not like carbon regulation or pollution where someone&#x27;s individual action has a negative shared cost on everyone else.   What principle are we to apply then?  There are tons of other 5% issues too -- which ones will be put into regulation?<p>I think it&#x27;s important to differentiate when your desire for something is personal and you want a company to do something despite others not caring about it, versus when there is actually harm being done and needs to be regulated.')
