Reddit makes it very easy for me to find focused, high-quality conversations about specific topics.  As others have said, the trick is to stick to small subreddits. AskReddit, like most of the big subreddits, is a cesspool.<p>Also, I find that searching Reddit with Google yields much more trustworthy information than just searching Google, which tends to return a bunch of sponsored results, ads, and SEO garbage. Folks on Reddit (especially focused subreddits) do a very good job of filtering all that stuff out already.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s often vastly better than Google alone.')
