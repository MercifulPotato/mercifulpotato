They started blocking trading with $GME trading in the $400&#x27;s, and a slew of redditors on WSB, Discord &amp; Telegram pushing penny stocks. It started out a crusade against the hedge fund shorting $GME and quickly turned into rallying dumb money to pump and dump penny stocks. Looking at the direction things were going it seems like Robinhood acted responsibly in cutting off the buys of AMC, BB, NOK, etc. They&#x27;re all stocks that have been propped up artificially in the last 48 hours based on the hype and attention generated by the Gamestop story.<p>No one serious thinks Gamestop stock is worth $400+. Robinhood cut off buying at the point when unsophisticated investors were caught up in a stampede to &quot;stick it to the man.&quot; Seems like they did the right thing.')
