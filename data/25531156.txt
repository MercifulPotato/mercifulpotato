The UK has some of the best genomic testing in the world. I&#x27;m guessing most countries have their own variants floating around with no clue.<p>I just don&#x27;t buy the gloom and doom this time. Rona mutates relatively slowly, we are very lucky. This article says half the rate of flu <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02544-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02544-6</a><p>And we should remember that flu is much more deadly when nobody has existing immunity. Even when the virus mutates, humans create a broad spectrum of antibodies against different parts of a virus and usually at least some will still bind to variants, but maybe not as well. Once a significant portion of the population is vaccinated COVID may become as or less deadly than flu.<p>This is why the only flu variants scientists freak out about are zoonotic strains. They&#x27;re different enough that existing antibodies don&#x27;t work.<p>Zoonosis is unlikely to produce more coronavirus pandemic strains like flu because flu infects our livestock and birds, and these SARS-like coronaviruses seems to only exist in bats. Humans have very little interaction with bats.<p>I find it likely that COVID vaccine will become a one-and-done vaccine given to children, given its low zoonotic hybridization potential and slowish mutation rate.')
