There’s graveyards of these cases.<p>There are 6’6 <i>bums</i> in the NBA, top draft picks, that had less of a career compared to say a 5’3 Mugsy Bogues.<p>In Basketball, part of your greatness is how well you optimized for the cards dealt to you.<p>Tech is not that much of a meritocracy like sports, it’s a way to have a living. I’d almost say, the tech industry is not equipped to assess greatness. Since it’s literally people’s livelihoods, we won’t (and shouldn’t) try to analyze this. In sports, if you come out of a top school as a top draft pick, fans will eventually say ‘hey you are a top draft pick but you do about the same thing as someone that went way later in the draft’. We in tech won’t ever go ‘look Facebook, your app looks like the same shit everyone else builds’. It can’t hold up to that scrutiny.<p>Open source is probably the only place where you can objectively assess.<p>It’s not a competition, because if it was, and tech was a sport, fans would tear it up as to what is a 10x engineer.
