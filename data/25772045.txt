Have you worked on a production React app? It&#x27;s another order of complexity above anything existing in BEAM world, and the JavaScript tooling ecosystem is atrocious in comparison. Not to mention, you will quickly end up having button clicks that require network requests if you are not careful with your SPAs as well.<p>The whole point of LiveView is that you can develop an app with a similar amount of interactivity as a React app without having to go into the split-universe world that SPAs live in and all the attendant complexity that brings with it.<p>&gt;Websockets are for things like multiplayer shooters or collaborative drawing, why would someone think it is appropriate to use it to react to clicking a button.<p>People said JavaScript was just for making ad banners flash 20 years ago and now it&#x27;s the most popular language on the planet. I don&#x27;t think a technology&#x27;s current uses are a good predictor of what it is most useful for.
