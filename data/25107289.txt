Once the constellation is dense enough and OISLs are working, they&#x27;ll be able to undercut fiber latency. That is, if they actually decide to route signals in a purely latency-optimized manner. I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to see some sort of tiered pricing related to latency and latency jitter.<p>No doubt the scummy high frequency traders are already jockeying to get out in front of this change in the telecom industry.')
