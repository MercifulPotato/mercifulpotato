Item(by='tobmlt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612201506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986404, text='In my industry (computational engineering) I fear leetcode etc. is becoming the bar one must pass before being questioned about anything germane (e.g. what kind of time integrator to use in this situation, different ways to handle that boundary condition, derive a numerical system for some physics with some spatial accuracy, etc)\nThis takes time away from me actually being the best numericist I can be, and puts me off doing leet-code challenges.  It’s absolutely infuriating.  When I arrived on the scene ~8 years ago we were isolated from that crap.  No more.  (It’s crap because there are better ways to test if we are competent (ie give me a multiresolution analysis problem on the proverbial white board, not a string puzzle, otherwise you throw the employee baby out with the bath water or make the baby memorize pointless (for this kind of baby) trivia.<p>I wonder if this is somehow a scheme to reduce employee turnover in general - to get salaries under control.  I doubt it could so be planned.  I have no doubt it has some effect in that direction as it adds friction and to the job hunters process.')
