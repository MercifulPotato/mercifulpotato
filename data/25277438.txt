Clothing, electronics, disposal of electronics, plastics, etcetc. Which isn&#x27;t an excuse, it&#x27;s just that - i don&#x27;t know if i can throw a stick and not hit something humanity is actively and aggressively exploiting.<p>The only way out of this that i see is to make &quot;other things&quot; our slaves. Eg, i don&#x27;t think we can convince people to always pay for their shirts&#x2F;phones&#x2F;etc from ethical sources - even if they had the info to base those decisions off of. However once we get to the point where machines can outcompete slave wages that problem will start to realistically be mitigated.. i hope.<p>Same is true for everything we&#x27;re destroying i imagine. Humanity has no moral compass when beyond arms reach.. it seems.')
