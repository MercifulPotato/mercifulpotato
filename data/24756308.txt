Ironically, the problem is that the signal gets divided into shortened binary views which are easier to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to. The answer isn&#x27;t no censorship ever or censorship is always okay. The real answer always depends on context.<p>The problem with platforms like FB and Twitter is that anyone can say anything, and that can get amplified organically, or by state actors, or by trolls who are just saying offensive things to get attention. It&#x27;s obvious that they need some form of moderation -- in most societies, you can&#x27;t legally threaten to kill people for any reason, etc.<p>I think the main problem is trolling and foreign interference because it is basically free. Trying to establish a fringe idea required a lot of effort when making pamphlets or sending out biased newspapers were the main ways of doing it.<p>In the current digital age, people who are easily influenced are being blasted with controversial ideas by algorithms that are not trying to spread good information, but get more clicks. Foreign psyops efforts and the trolls who would not publicly support an idea, but will do so anonymously, falsely inflate its value. <i>This is a new problem</i>. It may need a twist on an old solution, like allowing people to choose between moderated or unmoderated news feeds, with the default being moderated.<p>Our democracy (and dozens of others) have survived for hundreds of years with limits to free speech.
