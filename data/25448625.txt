Imagine coming to a forum where people commonly give their opinions only to accuse them of &quot;whining&quot; and &quot;entitlement&quot; when they simply give an opinion that you don&#x27;t like.<p>As if questioning whether a project name is any good suddenly equates to an application to be an &quot;idea guy&quot; or a logo designer.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the majority opinion about something as trivial as a name, stop visiting this forum. Does that advice sound familiar? Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t feel fair for someone to offer you only one of 2 extremes? Hmmmm.<p>The last thing this forum needs is another open source warrior patronizing everyone for participating here.')
