I also didn&#x27;t say the review was nonfactual, just that it contains within it an inaccurate framing and conflation of M1 as a processor and the overall product. It&#x27;s worth noting though that many others&#x27; experiences with it, and Rosetta 2 specifically, were quite different than Moorhead&#x27;s, so unless you&#x27;re using the specific set of software Moorhead mentioned in his review, it&#x27;s very possible you would have been better served by an M1, even today.')
