Item(by='dbg31415', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1611263108, title='Question about Firefox Energy Use', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='So I was just on a Google Meets call with about 12 other people. Most of whom had their cameras on.<p>My 2019 MBP 16&quot; got super hot pretty much instantly and the fans kicked on. This is common for every video call I do.<p>I checked the &quot;Energy Impact&quot; score in Activity Monitor and it said 56. Nothing else running had an impact score higher than 1. I know that if I don&#x27;t plug the power cord in, as soon as I do a call the battery drops by 1-2% a minute.<p>Someone on the call suggested that I switch to Safari, and when I did after 20 minutes (on the same call) the laptop was normal temperatures, battery had only dropped 2-3% total, and the energy impact said 1.7.<p>Now... 56 to 1.7 seems like a huge difference. I don&#x27;t know quite what the numbers mean in Apple&#x27;s &quot;Energy Impact&quot; but I do feel that Firefox turns my laptop into a toaster.<p>So questions:<p>Is this abnormal? Should I be worried about my MBP? It seems fine in all other regards.<p>Are there any settings I can change to improve Firefox?<p>Surely the Firefox team is aware of this sort of thing, yeah? Curious why it&#x27;s hard to fix -- is it Google Meet or Apple that&#x27;s making it harder for Firefox to work properly? Or is battery life just not something on the Firefox radar?')
