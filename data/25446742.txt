It&#x27;s built on top a minimal ubuntu install and gnome-settings-daemon, so it gives you most of the non-window manager desktop stuff you would expect. At first, the distro was all the same stuff I would uninstall&#x2F;install to roll my own environment. But they keep working on it and expanding the docs.<p>The only difficult part for me, is that they change the i3 config defaults. So often, instead of checking the i3 docs, I have to read my local config first.')
