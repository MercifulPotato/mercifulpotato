Imagine a tiny fruit-fly brain, vastly smaller than a human brain.  Remarkably we can slice that brain into over 4000 pieces and try and rebuilt the connectome, which is a huge challenge in and of itself. Describing what&#x27;s going on there as &quot;state-machine&quot; miss-represents a computer-science definition of &quot;state-machine&quot;,  and doesn&#x27;t remotely reflect the biological complexity going on.')
