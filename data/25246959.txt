Hashicorp&#x27;s Raft+Serf implementation allows for shocking amounts of latency between servers&#x2F;clients.  I have several centralized server clusters (the &quot;servers&quot; _should_ be geographically close, the &quot;agents&quot; can be far and wide), and agents more than 200ms+ away, and across multiple clouds&#x2F;on-prem.
