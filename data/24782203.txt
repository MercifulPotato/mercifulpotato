Every other new device (iPads, laptop and desktop) is 100% USB-C. And, again, you don&#x27;t even strictly need a lightning cable for your iPhone for most scenarios (airport charging type scenarios used to be the big exception in olden times).<p>Some reviewers are guessing that iPhones will drop the wired charge port entirely at some point, so will become a moot point.<p>And as for squeezing customers, switching away from the Lightning port would &quot;squeeze&quot; quite a few iPhone customers with lightning cables and docks and such strewn around their house.<p>I just wish Apple had included a puck-type Qi charger and cable in the box. Could have kept the box pretty slim.')
