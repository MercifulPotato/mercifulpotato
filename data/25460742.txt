Then Amazon is only on the hook for the shipping for one of every product they get a complaint on.  That seems like a pretty reasonable amount for them, especially given that there is 0 shipping fee for anything from Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment.  Unless merchants are hiding these things inside the actual product box, instead of inside the shipping box.  In that case, they should just ban the manufacturer&#x27;s goods from Amazon entirely.')
