Pihole doesn&#x27;t provide much additional benefits that can&#x27;t be achieved with ublock origin advanced filters.<p>Granted someone could argue what would be the benefit of using the dnscrypt-proxy at that point. In that context, you benefit from better privacy (DNS requests aggregated) and caching benefits.')
