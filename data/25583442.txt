Many of the times I have gotten shots I had to wait in the room for 10-20 minutes afterwards so the nurse could verify I wasn&#x27;t allergic. I think everyone should get vaccines, and they are more than safe enough for most people, but they aren&#x27;t as safe as this article is implying. There are also historical examples of vaccines that caused non-trivial medical issues with segments of the population (the narcolepsy issue that occurred with a vaccine in Sweden a few years back comes to mind).')
