Probably a result of both increasing polarization and shrinking media budgets.<p>For example, covid is just the flu, and only xenophobes would enact travel bans over it. No wait, corona is terrible and it&#x27;s Trump&#x27;s fault for not containing it. No wait, we should all go to BLM protests, did you know they actually _lower_ Covid rates? Listen to the science, don&#x27;t wear masks!
