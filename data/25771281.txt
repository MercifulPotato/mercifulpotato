Healthcare in the US is twice as expensive per capita as most European countries while the healthcare system ranks near the bottom of the OECD [2, 3] and 11th out of 11 in a recent commonwealth fund survey [1]. For the first time, life expectancy in the US is actually going down.<p>Even the best area identified in [2, 3] re: 5-year mortality for cancers is misleading as the US notoriously over-tests early on, detecting disease early, but isn&#x27;t actually more effective at <i>treating</i> the disease, and folks die at the same time as they would in European systems. This naturally makes the 5-year mortality rates look good, but doesn&#x27;t change the fact you&#x27;re still gonna die at the same time.<p>While admittedly cherry-picked, it&#x27;s also the only developed country in the world where mother&#x27;s mortality rates during childbirth are rising. A mother is 5X as likely to die giving birth in America as compared to Canada (where healthcare costs half per capita and covers everyone).<p>Also, consider the median amount of tax collected in the US (excluding private $800&#x2F;month tax your employer pays to insurance companies on your behalf) is actually higher sometimes than Canada now. The top marginal rates are also higher, consistently.
