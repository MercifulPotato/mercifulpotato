Instinctively I feel that better browser tools would be beneficial, but it’s an odd problem that we are trying to solve. I am not even sure we understand the root issue.<p>Some companies want to use the web to try to change users behaviour, and many users want those companies to change <i>their</i> behaviour. That’s not a solvable problem, it’s a circular reference bug.<p>So maybe better tools might actually make it worse, in a race to the bottom sort of situation.<p>My main concern is that the consent forms, however well meaning they might be, are creating a horrible environment. There are lots of perverse incentives for people to ruin the web experience. Some players stand to gain a lot from a horrible web environment. For example ones that have competing information products.<p>I’m increasingly thinking it would be better to just not have consent forms, and with better browser tools, people would hopefully go to websites that treated them well.')
