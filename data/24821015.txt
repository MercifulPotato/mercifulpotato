One big player like a famous lab at Stanford or MIT publishes an incremental paper that is a followup on a well known existing research direction, where several groups are working in parallel on very similar things, and then it&#x27;s presented as if it was some breakthrough and the whole subfield was invented by them right now.<p>It&#x27;s very, very hard for outsiders to recognize this and to really understand what the actual incremental step in a particular paper is. Necessarily, when explaining to laypeople, you can only scratch the surface and present the rought idea of a whole big research field, and it gets really murky what is part of the established, pre-existing research field and what is the novel contribution.<p>I&#x27;m sure I fall victim to this when reading outside my expertise as well, i.e. when reading about genetics stuff or quantum computing.')
