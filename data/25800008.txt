The parent comment&#x27;s error (or perhaps an intentional omission if for example they thought it to be self-evident) is in not taking into account the volume of people starting companies vs the volume of people doing other things which could turn them into millionaires.<p>On that note, I do think there&#x27;s a flaw in the logic or premises (or unstated assumptions -- maybe &quot;millionaire&quot; is code for some larger quantity of wealth) somewhere. A decade in FAANG with conservative spending habits will easily create a millionaire with a near 100% success rate, and it would be surprising if starting a company would have better odds than that.')
