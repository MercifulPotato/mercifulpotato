But the election was shady as F.  Over 1000 sworn affidavits from witnesses. Video evidence of votes being pulled out in middle of the night, from under tables and scanned multiple times while observers told to go home,  crazy one sided spikes. and so on. But lets say I take every plausible explanation they came up with at face value.<p>What exactly is the point of voting in your state running legit by the book fraud proof elections, if another state isn&#x27;t going to verify signatures to make sure there are no fraudulent ballots? Even if your legitimate election state is won, the unsecure election state will nullify your state with their electoral count. Specially if the state has more electors than your state. Because the Supreme Court said it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>You are also making appeals to law, which is fallacy because all kinds of Rogue states have laws too that they follow.')
