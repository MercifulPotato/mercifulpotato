There is not enough space. Cities with higher density are still not cheap anyway, and when people have kids&#x2F;families they really start wanting a lot more space.<p>The solution is to actually <i>use</i> this Internet thing we have built and make place far less relevant. The only blessing so far from COVID is that it has forced this issue and overcome probably a generation of institutional inertia, helping people escape the unaffordable housing trap a lot sooner than they otherwise could.<p>The US has no housing problem if you broaden your hunt to the entire country. There are tons of really nice small to medium sized towns, and if you like having access to something more urban there are also numerous medium sized cities with functioning downtowns and affordable housing in decent neighborhoods.')
