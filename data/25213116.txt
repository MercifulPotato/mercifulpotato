I imagine how the use of whitespace to organize the layout probably looked very simple and attractive in Sketch or Figma at some point. Then reality crept in, and that whitespace was gradually carved up into more and more incoherent pieces. And as that was the only indicator of hierarchy and relationships there was to start with, there’s now no organization left at all. Many screens are just a bunch of words, all imperceptibly different shades of dark gray, strewn out randomly over a solid white background.<p>To make things worse, they all seem to be implemented in slightly inconsistent ways (you can tell when an h1 is wrapped in ten (10) layers of nested divs, each just containing the next div) so things that should align are all off by a pixel and have slightly different behaviors.')
