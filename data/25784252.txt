But then look at all the recently successful companies that IPOed and mega billion dollar companies. There is absolutely nothing great about their tech or their business model or their intelligence.<p>Lyft is just smaller uber clone. Doordash is just another food delivery service. Pinterest is just a spammy link aggregation service. Faster and better home sharing services existed before AirBnb (VRBO is more than 10 years older than airbnb).  And the list is endless. They are all successful because they got the right network, got the money, early investors, early users from network.<p>Business models, tech, intelligence, smartness, timing all means jackshit. The only thing that matters is networking (and persistence)')
