The effect is the same as if you were going downhill and decided to stay in 4th, 3rd, 2nd or even 1st gear - it&#x27;s up to you. The mechanical result of it is exactly the same as when using engine braking, so I&#x27;m really not getting what you&#x27;re trying to argue here.<p>&gt;&gt;you can&#x27;t become an expert if you aren&#x27;t allowed to control the parameters.<p>Except that you are, I honestly think you aren&#x27;t very up to date with what the current designs are, and almost certainly you haven&#x27;t driven an electric car.<p>&gt;&gt;that&#x27;s another point, automatic transmission is more expensive, less robust and increases the cost of the vehicle without adding any other benefit than being &#x27;easier&#x27; to operate.<p>Again, you operate on &quot;common knowledge&quot; from at least 10 years ago. The &quot;traditional&quot; hydrokinetic automatic - absolutely, sure. But those aren&#x27;t really being used in most cars nowadays. Modern Dual-Clutch automatic is as light as a manual, marginally more complex than one(because in fact is is a manual in operation), and indeed, has other benefts like improved fuel consumption and vastly faster shift times than any manual transmission can even dream of having. Again, I doubt you have actually driven one recently or at all.<p>&gt;&gt;would you fly on a plane where the pilot only knows how to use the autopilot? that&#x27;s where safety comes in, when things take more time to master, people tend to become better at them<p>Sure, if your goal is to have everyone on the road be a professional driver, then yes, I 100% agree with you. I think people should be trained like in Germany, where a part of training is going on the Autobahn and driving at 200km&#x2F;h+ for a little bit. I&#x27;d love that. I also think that my opinion on this topic is irrelevant because like I said earlier for most drivers this level of skill is unnecessary.\nFunnily enough, the exact same argument has been used to argue against autopilot in planes though - that its introduction will lead to pilots becoming inept and unable to act in emergencies. And that has actually happened in at least one documented plane crash - the autopilot disengaged and the pilots couldn&#x27;t figure out why and the plane crashed. But....that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that overal the introduction of autopilot has decreased the amount of accidents by several orders of magnitute - it made flying safer for everyone, even if it meant that pilots are now slightly worse at flying without it.<p>&gt;&gt;Manual gear is not stupid, it is simply technically superior (it costs less and lasts more).<p>Yeah except that in practice it doesn&#x27;t, because people wear out manual transmissions all the time by being crap at using it. My dad used to have a car repair shop and someone who isn&#x27;t &quot;passionate&quot; about cars will destroy a manual by just being an idiot at how they shift gears. \n People constantly break them by not using the clutch properly, shifting at the wrong moment, staying in the wrong gear for too long.....you physically cannot do this in an automatic, because you don&#x27;t get to change the gears yourself - so in practice and for &quot;an average consumer&quot; they last longer.<p>Besides, I just want to point out - I love how you took my argument against a blanket ban on ICE cars, and you turned it upside down into an argument about manual cars and the love of driving.  I have started by, and continued to argue that the ban is stupid because:\n1) people will need ICE cars<p>2) There are enthusiasts who should be able to keep driving them if they already own them<p>For my enthusiast driving needs, please give me a good MX-5 or a roll cage equipped Impreza, any day please. But for most cars for average consumer shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near like that. They should be electric, they should be full of safety tech, and they should baby their drivers and passangers. Like, again, like I said multiple arguments ago - these are not mutually exclusive positions to take.')
