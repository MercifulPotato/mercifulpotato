You could have high density low income districts and low density high income districts and all sorts of things. The different wealth classes demanded different services and jobs, had different commuting requirements, etc. And districts desirability changed over time as conditions changed, so you could have a formerly high-wealth condo become a low-wealth slum; the building would be the same but have a dilapidated appearance, etc.<p>As much as I like Cities Skylines, it kind of assumes that everyone can aspire to live in a nice high rise condo with solar panels on the roof.')
