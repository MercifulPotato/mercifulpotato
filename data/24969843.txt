It’s spendy at $100&#x2F;month (which is comparable to other, FAR worse, satellite internet options... and some non-satellite broadband in the US costs this much for worse service), but rural folk should qualify for the rural broadband subsidy which should help a lot.<p>This post shows some unboxing of Starlink: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=48297.msg2148953#msg2148953" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=48297.msg2...</a><p>I’m really excited about these LEO satellite constellations just <i>solving</i> the rural&#x2F;urban digital divide. As launch costs continue to go down (SpaceX’s partially reusable Falcon 9 has already made a massive difference in making this feasible, about a quarter the marginal launch cost per kg, and Starship should enable an order of magnitude improvement on that) and competition increases (OneWeb has been brought through bankruptcy but is starting to launch again, plus Amazon’s Project Kuiper and the potential of launching on the partially reusable New Glenn), it’s an exciting time for the ending of digital poverty in rural areas.')
