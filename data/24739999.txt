Such a book (or whatever book-like device, i.e. a list of inputs with corresponding outputs) that allows a person to interact with someone in a language they don&#x27;t speak is an absurdity, it cannot exist. Human language in use does not work like that. But the notion is not far from the bone-headed simplicity of early AI and machine translation efforts.')
