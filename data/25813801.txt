Item(by='hiq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610910456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812544, text='&gt; Signal will have very hard time competing as a product with WhatsApp.<p>You seem to assume that they want to be bigger than WhatsApp, but as a non-profit I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s their goal. Their goal is (broadly) to secure most communication in a privacy-preserving way. If WhatsApp does it because of the pressure from Signal, it&#x27;s also a win for them (again as a non-profit).')
