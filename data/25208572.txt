Item(by='DennisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606307948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206738, text='The SyFy article said &quot;up to five launches a day at the cost of around $500,000 per paying customer,&quot; which is a bit ambiguous, but it linked to Wired which says &quot;A ride to space with SpinLaunch will cost under $500,000 per launch.&quot;<p>Making the rocket reusable would be the next step, but that&#x27;s a nontrivial task itself, since it&#x27;s effectively the upper stage which is the hardest part of reusability. Maybe it&#x27;s easier for such a small rocket, I don&#x27;t know. But even then they&#x27;re just shaving a little fuel off a very low launch cost, in exchange for a 200 lb max payload that has to be hardened to 10,000 gees. The launch cadence would be an advantage today but Starship is supposed to launch three times per day, if the customers are there for it.')
