(calculating what the coffee serving price difference should be from the market price of free trade beans per pound vs. normal)<p>The rest of the 9c is just price discrimination of the coffee chain being able to see that you value the <i>idea</i> of supporting organic coffee farming and are willing to pay that much more, even though it doesn&#x27;t translate into anywhere close to that for the actual people.<p>Edit: you can check it yourself -- Fairtrade coffee reports to be sold at $1.80 per pound versus $1.40.  A typical cup of coffee &#x2F; shot espresso uses 15 grams.  The cost difference is &lt;$0.01.<p>(I don&#x27;t know if this is still sold as an option, not a coffee drinker myself)')
