I imagine you could also turn it into a science, with carefully researched formulae and experiment-driven results.<p>This, to me, seems to miss the point a little bit. You&#x27;re not supposed to give the perfect gift. You&#x27;re not supposed to generate the optimal amount of joy in the recipient. You are supposed to form a connection with the recipient, and have that feeling reciprocated. That&#x27;s the real test of a good gift.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if they never use the gift after tomorrow. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they have the same dollar valuation of the gift as the giver does. What matters is if they genuinely appreciate the gesture and, at least for the moment, enjoy the feeling the gift gives them.')
