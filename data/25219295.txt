There are companies like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexdock.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexdock.com</a> making these &quot;lapdocks&quot; that work with phones, but also with things like Raspberry Pis. And then there are dozens of Chinese clones on AliExpress.<p>I&#x27;m personally using DeX (Samsung&#x27;s desktop mode) on daily basis. It is a bit clunky, but better than owning, maintaining, and carrying a second big device. The &quot;real computer&quot; on my desk has only work stuff on it, and all my open source development etc. happens in DeX, mainly via the Termux app.')
