On Election Day, Driving around, I did not see my local pole have a line (which were longer due to social distancing) or anything like I saw in 2016. This is what makes me believe the highly concentrated Biden ballot dumps were more than suspicious, anything over 75% should be considered very carefully for fraud.')
