I haven&#x27;t done this in years but I always wound up with some mess of virtual envs, pip, gunicorn, nginx proxying, something to start the services, and that&#x27;s _before_ writing any of my own code. With Go I just compile a static binary, rsync it to a server and turn it on and call it a day. The only other part I often use is nginx as a reverse proxy because it&#x27;s easier to harden. Way easier to operate and way easier to not break once your project gets beyond a few kloc.')
