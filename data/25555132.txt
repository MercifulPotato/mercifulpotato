For example, the human factor. Whereas the reason Systems Engineering is so abstract and high level is the assumption that those unquantifiable factors have to be accounted for in &quot;boxes and arrows&quot;, regardless of the fact that they can&#x27;t be quantitatively engineered.... And many can&#x27;t handle the fact that these things can&#x27;t be quantitatively engineered [Edit to add the statement post ellipses]')
