In other words it is overwritten. Taking the first paragraph as an example, you could make it much easier to read by: replacing &quot;tenet&quot; and &quot;antithetical&quot; with simpler words, removing the &quot;of course&quot;, and breaking some of those run-on sentences into smaller sentences.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of patio11&#x27;s writing. There&#x27;s a man who never uses one word when three will do. I expect I will now be excommunicated from HN. :-)')
