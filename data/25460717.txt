Item(by='hbosch', descendants=None, kids=[25460840, 25461412], score=None, time=1608240669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460552, text='&gt; They won&#x27;t pop back up with 12k 5 star reviews immediately?<p>No, they will pay for those and have them soon enough. Even the OP says the product was sitting at &gt;4,000 reviews at time of purchase and now is over 12,000. The reviews are easy to come by, of course.<p>I am not pointing out that the seller here is right by any means. I fully agree that paying for 5-star reviews is reprehensible and unethical, and it&#x27;s similarly unethical for ANY marketplace to feature items that have paid for positive reviews. But now we&#x27;ve arrived at a part that is beyond Amazon itself, haven&#x27;t we? The concept of &quot;paid positive reviews&quot; is not confined to Amazon, naturally.<p>This is why it&#x27;s important to be a &quot;literate consumer&quot;. That is to say, keen and discerning and aware. Like I said in my post, the buyer (in this case, OP) absolutely CHOSE a product that was visually an unbranded &quot;knock off&quot; of a webcam that Amazon actually featured HIGHER in their own search results. You can see which camera I am talking about being the &quot;knockoff&quot; and which is the &quot;original&quot;, I hope.<p>A person with high &quot;consumer literacy&quot; will not just pick the cheap option with a bunch of 5-star reviews. Not in 2020, and not on Amazon.com -- these plain facts mean nothing about the seller&#x27;s reputation or the product&#x27;s quality. Every &quot;literate consumer&quot; should already know this! It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s OK for the seller to do what they do, but it&#x27;s important that we all know the reality is that they DO do it.')
