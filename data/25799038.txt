Item(by='tombert', descendants=None, kids=[25799221], score=None, time=1610760900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798849, text='&gt;There&#x27;s no reason all your magic bells and whistles couldn&#x27;t have been added into Java.<p>Because it&#x27;s designed in a way that doesn&#x27;t always allow these bells and whistles.<p>If I were to tell you that we should have kept using horse-drawn carriages, and that any of the fancy bells and whistles that cars have could be added to horse-drawn carriages, you would probably look at me with confusion.<p>&gt; Improving a dominant (but broken) language is called &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;improvement&quot;<p>Sure? But modifying an existing (and for most of its history proprietary) language can be a difficult, potentially-political move.  If I have an idea on how to do, I don&#x27;t know, linear-types checked at compile-time, I wouldn&#x27;t have any idea where to begin adding that to the javac compiler. It might be easier to build my own little language to build it, and then hope that maybe the Oracle devs decide to pick it up.')
