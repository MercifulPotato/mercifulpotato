Instead we had in metro area the teachers unions all running FUD campaigns even while some areas did have face to face teaching; with masks and social distancing to teachers because students won&#x27;t do SD each other.<p>So anecdotal for my area, yours may be different.<p>1) Body bags demonstrations on administrator buildings and in case the lawn of a few board members<p>2) One county where the union stated that it was optional for members to take untested and possibly dangerous vaccines<p>3) Two demanding extra money for virtual teaching because the contract did not specify, another wanting to ban it in the future contract<p>4) More than one local union has demanded no more vouchers and ending even magnet&#x2F;charter type schools before returning to class.<p>5) Nearly all of those not doing any in person have demanded no testing be permitted with some wanting a three year moratorium<p>All this with some local counties doing just fine with no one dropping dead. Yes there were two deaths in a neighboring county but tracking it back to school is near impossible but heavily suggested as proof.<p>Two neighbors in different districts basically tell the same story, you are required to be on the FB group and do what you are told. Which mostly is agree with the FUD, do not talk to administrators without permission and follow the script.<p>Just like the police unions which have effectively isolated the police members from real oversight by the public so have the teachers unions done the same but those at risk are our children. Public sector unions are dangerous as they answer to no one. They pretty much walk the local politicians around on strings like puppets and whoa to any in office or campaigning person who dares talk &quot;reform&quot;.<p>We had the perfect opportunity to right education. In the US the DOE has been around since Carter and spent hundreds of billions of dollars for no improvement. Teachers Unions stamp out school choice whenever they can. Basically their number one job is to prevent people from having a choice to get their children educated and they have the power of government and control over politicians to force it.')
