Here&#x27;s a better example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;44pNDuRO77g?t=269" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;44pNDuRO77g?t=269</a> , it&#x27;s straight to a point where I&#x27;m in a vimrc file with about the smallest text I ever use on video. I&#x27;m guessing the comments would be pretty hard to read in a high sun light area, that&#x27;s my only complaint with the One theme -- the contrast on them is a bit low.<p>In the video you linked I see what you mean. I haven&#x27;t tested it outside but just eyeballing some of the screenshots in the presentation the blue function names are likely impossible to read, the dark orange &#x2F; red module names could be borderline too since it&#x27;s kind of dark text on a dark background, and even the green atoms are a bit similar to the background in terms of darkness. I&#x27;m not sure what color theme that is but personally I wouldn&#x27;t use it.<p>I try to stick with One and Gruvbox. Both have pretty decent contrast ratios for both light and dark variants. I have 1920x1080 screenshot side by side comparisons of both with dark vs light in my dotfiles at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;dotfiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;dotfiles</a>.')
