VR and AR are going to be big, and Facebook is making a play to own the social space and tie it to their hardware with Horizon.<p>There&#x27;s literally no one competing with their Quest platform, so they&#x27;ll be in a market position to turn Horizon into the dominant social environment for a whole lot of VR users.<p>Without cross-platform social systems like this, you end up in a world where your grandma has an Oculus headset and if you want to virtually visit them you need to be on a Quest as well.<p>BigScreen is another example that I&#x27;m glad still exists. Facebook would like to either own them or crush them: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DShankar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1295825811748999173" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DShankar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1295825811748999173</a><p><i>&gt; When I announced a beta version of @BigscreenVR\n in 2015&#x2F;2016, Facebook reached out.

I can share a long list of VR devs who have been trampled by Facebook.</i>')
