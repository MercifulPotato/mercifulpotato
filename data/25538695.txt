As such, Google probably should consider changes to their algorithm to compensate (cat and mouse) for pinterest&#x27;s gaming.  That is assuming how pinterest does it is not against any google rules... because if it were against any rules, they should be slapped down hard.<p>When my searches result in mostly pinterest results, I give up more quickly.  That means I spend less time using google, and that in theory means less money for google.  Unfortunately, I do see other more regular user types operate their computers, and they are less or un-descriminating about the domain name listed under the image.  So they&#x27;ll head directly into the pinterest waste pond anyway.')
