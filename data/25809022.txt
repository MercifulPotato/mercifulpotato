It was never about (and still isn&#x27;t about) tanks, or cannon, or warships, or nukes. So no, you don&#x27;t have to be committed to allowing tanks to be fully keen on the right to keep and bear arms.<p>(if you still doubt this, focus on the word &quot;bear&quot;.

They&#x27;re expensive, get terrible gas mileage, probably not street-legal to drive on the freeway, unlikely to fit in your garage and the neighbors are bound to complain if you fire the main gun...but you totally <i>could</i> own one (and drive it around your own private property) if so inclined.')
