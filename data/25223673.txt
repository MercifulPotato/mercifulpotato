Yeah, for the limited amount of stuff I maintain, I really like the simple, single-file Ansible script— install these handful of packages, insert this config file, set up this systemd service, and you&#x27;re done. I know it&#x27;s a lot harder for larger, more complicated systems where there&#x27;s a lot of configuration state that they&#x27;re maintaining internal to themselves and they want you to be setting up in-band using a web gui.<p>I experienced this recently trying to get a Sentry 10 cluster going— it&#x27;s now this giant docker-compose setup with like 20 containers, and so I&#x27;m like &quot;perfect, I&#x27;ll insert all the config in my container deployment setup and then this will be trivially reproducible.&quot; Nope, turns out the particular microservice that I was trying to configure only uses its dedicated config file for standalone&#x2F;debugging purposes; when it&#x27;s being launched as part of the master system, everything is passed in at runtime and can only be set up from within the main app. Le sigh.')
