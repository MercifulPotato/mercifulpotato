Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602310052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24728570, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t the correct analogue to the API code the instruction book rather than the resulting ledger templates?<p>I would say it&#x27;s the latter and not the former. APIs aren&#x27;t instructions in and of themselves, they are instruction identifiers. And the instructions they identify correspond to interactions in a working system. If one wanted to recreate the working system, they&#x27;d be hard pressed to do so without recreating instruction identifiers. This isn&#x27;t just an interoperability issue, but also because experienced practitioners have certain expectations re instructions semantics. Those semantics are often unexpressed directly and come from for example their organization into a given module.<p>&gt; But here they&#x27;re alleging something further: that the API (instruction book) itself has been copied.<p>This is where I&#x27;m really puzzled. The API is not the instruction book. The API is a method of interacting with an invented system. You cannot use the API in isolation from the system, by itself it&#x27;s largely useless. You can&#x27;t take the API, read it, and then be able to use the system. You need the API to use the system as well, by definition it <i>cannot</i> be used without an API. You could say that the instructions and the ledger templates are fused and inseparable here, but that&#x27;s only in cases where no other documentation exists which is not the case for the majority of system on the level of Java.')
