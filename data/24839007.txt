Its 60% US Market share could be a determining factor in the US although they do have a clear unobstructed competitor in Android - time will tell as rulings from current investigations &amp; trials get handed down. Of course it&#x27;s not illegal to have a monopoly, only if its dominant Monopoly power position is abused for anti-competitive purposes, typically for creating a monopoly in a different market, but there are a few other abuses.')
