The Southrons did not have it, and partially lost their war because of it. America grew strong in their loss: the Yankee culture of building came out of the war triumphant, and those who won the war would go on to build the country we live in today.&quot;<p>(This reads like Yankee propaganda, but it&#x27;s not historically inaccurate)<p>However, the Southrons never went away. Somehow they built statues to their defeated leaders. And it seems - again, as an outsider - that so many of the US&#x27;s current problems stem from the south rising again and replacing &quot;builder&quot; culture with supremacist, anti-science culture.')
