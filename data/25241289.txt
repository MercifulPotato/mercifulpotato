Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=[25243417], score=None, time=1606604378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240026, text='I&#x27;ve got a belt-drive &quot;commuter bike&quot; that doesn&#x27;t get ridden much these days. It currently has a Gates Carbon Drive which I mostly like, and you&#x27;re mostly correct. But it came with a Continental belt drive system that was awful. I snapped my first belt on it under load when it was about 6 months old. The damn thing always squeaked no matter how clean i tried to keep it. The rear wheel had to be on perfectly straight or sometimes the belt would slip one way or the other -- and of course, belt tension is very hard to get right. I think the gates system operates at lower tension than my continental did, which is a plus.<p>I hope the Gates belt is stronger than the Continental one, but I don&#x27;t know for sure.<p>I think Ghost ultimately was willing to goodwill replace the continental trash with a complete Gates drive system because a continental belt could not be sourced anymore. But, I still have to worry about the nightmare of axle nuts, belt tension, removing the tiny nut from the hub to disconnect the shifting, and removing the brake caliper (!!!) to fix a flat.')
