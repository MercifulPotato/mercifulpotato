I always had my pet theory on possible solution for this problem, and I wonder what do you think about it. I see it like that.<p>New contributors come to contribute. Conflicts arise, thus rules are needed. People who enjoy rules tend to win arguments, geting a kick out of it, while losers feel miserable. So far so good. Normal churn of editors occur, but with time dynamic above leads to old crew &#x2F; good rules players to stay, while more idealistic people who care about rules less tend to drop the project faster. Thus with time old guard becomes a problem - they feel skillful enough to control the process and perversely get enjoyment mostly from moderation &#x2F;rules application process, not from actual content contribution.<p>My solution for this problem - force old guard to retire. I.e. you can edit Wikipedia for X years. After that you are banned for life.<p>Would that help?<p>(obviously, enforcement of this rule is not trivial, but that is another problem).')
