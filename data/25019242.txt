I handle the input myself (so that it can look like C64 console), but this is done via pretty simple &quot;window.onkeypress&quot; and &quot;window.onkeydown&quot; - so if it receives random inputs, it&#x27;s either odd events or some glitch elsewhere (I&#x27;m using Firefox myself, but on Windows). I&#x27;m not sure how to debug this - but if you have any insights, let me know!')
