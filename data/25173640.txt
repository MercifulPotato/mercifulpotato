It&#x27;s not even a &quot;poor people&quot; thing, it&#x27;s remembering there are products that make sense to buy at the dollar store, and ones that don&#x27;t.<p>There are a billion product categories where an unbranded direct-from-manufacturer product is entirely adequate.  I don&#x27;t need to pay for a premium name brand on a basic phone case, Arduino clone, USB 2.0 cable, or a replacement part for a toy.<p>You can lean into that.  With sites like Aliexpress and Banggood, I know more or less what I&#x27;m going to get, and generally the products meet expectations, so I&#x27;m a happy return customer.<p>Wish starts out in much worse territory.  They overpromised and underdelivered for long enough that they&#x27;ve become a meme, an anti-brand.  I suspect they&#x27;ve been able to show appealing numbers just by burning through the suckers who will try any too-good-to-be-true offer once, but eventually you run out of those customers and have to pivot towards building a repeat customer base.  How do you do that?  Maybe aggressively culling products with poor customer feedback, strong guarantees, and reined in advertising designed to prevnent disappointment.')
