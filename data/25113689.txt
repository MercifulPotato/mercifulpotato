I never said anything about the efficacy or the safety of the vaccines in my comment. I personally think that these preliminary results from these trials are also not completely reliable. While we should all be thankful for the results, the current announcements aren’t the end of the story. Even when they get to further trials, we wouldn’t have had enough time and enough broad range tests to conclusively state certain things (and the unfortunate fact is that we don’t have the luxury of time).<p>If you look at what the experts say, you’d find them being cautious with their words when commenting on vaccines, efficacy, etc. It’s in people’s best interests to follow precautions like wearing masks, washing hands with soap and maintaining some distance from other people, regardless of what news comes on the vaccine front.')
