That does nothing to change the fact the &quot;Freedom of the Press Foundation&quot; inflates their &quot;arrest&quot; numbers by including journalists being caught up in &quot;kettles&quot; for a short time and released once they got around to checking for press.  It is all in their data.  They don&#x27;t even try to hide it and do not see it as disingenuous to include them as arrested or detained.')
