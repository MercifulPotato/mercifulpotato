And that&#x27;s exactly why we shouldn&#x27;t skip the usual extended 5-year, 10-year studies before giving it to a billion people.<p>There are potential long-term side-effects for this vaccine that we couldn&#x27;t possibly know about yet (will it affect the fertility of your future children, for instance? Will it affect your cognitive function within a year? Ten years? Nobody knows). And what exactly is causing the Bell&#x27;s Palsy, and how is that cause going to interact with people&#x27;s predispositions to develop other neurological conditions as they get older? We also don&#x27;t yet know about the costs and benefits beyond a very short timeline relative to not having it; is the immunity conferred amongst the population more or less effective than that which people are developing naturally as they come into contact with strains of the virus that are more infectious and less lethal? For that matter, how does does immunity for this virus even work, antibodies or T-cells? If we&#x27;re in a position where we understand this virus enough to be rolling out mass vaccination in a responsible way, why are we relying on flawed PCR testing (especially in terms of the elevated numbers of cycles) to track cases and justify the rushed deployment of vaccines, especially in the case of this highly experimental (albeit exciting) one? These are all questions that I would expect the regulatory authorities to have answered definitively and to be broadcasting widely before any widespread program of vaccination. Especially seeing as the manufacturers have been released from liability from the vaccines&#x27; effects.')
