I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s true. The real question is whether these sites are entitled to some equivalent of the DMCA Safe Harbor if they attempt reasonable policing. I think the answer is yes and I think automated analysis and ID verification is sufficient so long as they pass human-reported cases on to law enforcement.<p>I believe this for Pornhub but I also believe it for Youtube and Facebook or whoever else. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if your site is a porn site or a family pictures site. You should be allowed to have user-generated content with some reasonably high-sensitivity auto-detector coupled with human reports that are passed on to law enforcement and be indemnified.')
