Thanks for providing it open src!<p>I wrote you a separate email .....<p>Some features that would be great for mediaCMS:<p>-OpenCV for facial and object recognition for auto identification and categorizing<p>-Read image&#x2F;video metadata to auto title generation instead of IMG_12324_433.jpg<p>-A.I. to group and create a story from pics&#x2F;vids based on time&#x2F;location&#x2F;faces etc...<p>and&#x2F;or make it extensiveable so one could create plugins?
