Of course people on the Internet are going to add fake names to the list.  That doesn&#x27;t make the declaration fake.<p>The Politifact piece explicitly notes that the official signatories are real.  It then goes into an explanation of why their heterodox opinion is wrong, which maybe it is.  But that doesn&#x27;t make it fake.')
