My friend was one of the first to buy a Pixel 4 in the UK, and unfortunately dropped it and broke the screen. He contacted Google for a repair, and their response literally was that they don&#x27;t repair Pixel phones, but they can sell him a new one at a slightly(by about Â£100) discounted price as a &quot;good will gesture&quot;. That&#x27;s absolutely unacceptable . Imagine if a car manufacturer sold you a car and then just didn&#x27;t offer a repair option for out of warranty issues.')
