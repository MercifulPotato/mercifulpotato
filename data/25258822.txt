Just correcting false facts propagated by ignorant folks. Such as yourself.<p>India has been a democracy in spite of the monarchies the UK used to support in Indian territory, in spite of the regional and sectarian conflicts the British tried to impose on (and succeeded) India.<p>Have you ever considered the reason why India has been forced to languish in the background in world affairs, in spite of being on track to be the most populous country, to be because of American and British (and for a while European) interference? The nations stopping the likes of Japan, Germany and India from joining the UN security council are those within. Britain has gained a lot more from the relationship with India, just as India has gained a lot from the same. The Indian power bloc in the UK parliament and the power it has wielded for a few decades now is solid evidence of this.<p>To correct your preconceived BS, the CoN is a meaningless patchwork of nations of the British empire for Britain. The only benefit it provides to the UK is monarchial rights to a few island nations (and an increasingly lower number by the year, Barbados just voted to become a republic within the CoN), while giving citizens of CoN nations voting rights within the UK, which is a pretty huge trade off on the UK&#x27;s part.<p>India is not a pathetic colony of Britain. If you&#x27;d been involved with the economic landscape of Britain recently, it was more or less the other way round. India has already overtaken Britain by the GDP numbers.<p>Yet you also willfully ignore places such as Puerto Rico or American Samoa or France&#x27;s former African colonies, all of which have become worse shitholes than India.<p>You have clearly no understanding of the situation in either India or the UK currently. Wish I could extend a time machine to bring you here in the present, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t admit for close-mindedness.')
