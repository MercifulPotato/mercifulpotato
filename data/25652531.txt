Like, if something would increase one&#x27;s chances of dieing within 2N years by some quantity, but decrease one&#x27;s chances of dieing withing N years by some other quantity, at what values would people make or not make that choice? (or, in the other direction).<p>Depending on how that works out, maybe that would mean that this isn&#x27;t a great foundation for translating between &quot;how much do they value this (in dollars), at their current income level&quot; and &quot;how much do they value this (in some other unit which is hopefully more natural in some sense)&quot;.<p>Is there something else that would be a better basis?')
