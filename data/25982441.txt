HF isn&#x27;t reliable enough and all it takes is a little terrain to block VHF. You&#x27;re also not guaranteed that there&#x27;s even anyone on the other side of the radio if you really need help.<p>I would recommend a SPOT or inReach as a your primary safety device with this as a (neat) backup. All they need is a line of sight to the sky which is much easier to do than either LoRA, VHF or HF.<p>[edit]<p>If you want a good idea of the limits of LoRA Ars did a pretty good write-up a few years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;lostik-usb-lora-radios&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;lostik-usb-lora-radi...</a> . You&#x27;ll see that even in a few mile radius there&#x27;s plenty of places where even a high-end LoRA device drops out because very few radios can go directly through terrain(if you&#x27;re curious <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Through-the-earth_mine_communications" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Through-the-earth_mine_communi...</a> covers some aspects).<p>It is a <i>really</i> cool modulation for low power but it&#x27;s still subject to the physics of radio propagation.')
