Or simply not very good. Or very good for a small niche.</i><p>Even if you&#x27;re very good, it&#x27;s a gamble; almost all celebrity stories contain the element that they simply met the right person or were in the right place at the right time. And fame doesn&#x27;t correlate with how good you really are; there are various famous musicians who aren&#x27;t technically good at all, but got their breakthrough for some other reason. So it is almost impossible to plan a successful career a priori or to estimate its chances of success. Just like in a game of chance.')
