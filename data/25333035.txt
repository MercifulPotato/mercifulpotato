The majority of homeless people at any given time are &#x27;down on their luck&#x27; and relatively quickly get out of homelessness. You also have to factor in the role drug use and mental illness play into homelessness. Many of the chronically homeless fit into one of those two categories, and a subset of those people do not want or will not accept help.')
