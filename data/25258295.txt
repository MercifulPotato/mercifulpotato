Designing at the raw transistor level is tedious, time-consuming, and requires specialized knowledge of low-level electrical and physics characteristics. When you design with standard cells, you only have to think about the logic functionality.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_cell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_cell</a><p>The parent&#x27;s question is about whether Apple <i>really did</i> do some of the designing at the transistor level by designing their own cells, rather than using a standard library. This could give them an edge that ordinary users of the standard library wouldn&#x27;t have.')
