My outlook.com account was locked because I was violating their &quot;no nudity&quot; policy and some random naked girls (legal aged ofc!) were uploaded to skydrive. This happened several years ago.<p>I lost everything and couldnt access any mails.<p>After trying everything possible online, I wrote Microsoft a letter. A real letter on paper. Several weeks later I got a reply that they could do nothing as their tos was violated.<p>FUCK microsoft. Since then I am very careful with centralization of accounts. I am using many different email and cloud provider today and despise people who are happy that e.g. apple is today providing everything: from music over cloud to movies, mail, pay and so much more.')
