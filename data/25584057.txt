Between the commute, meal prep, grooming&#x2F;getting dressed, etc., it feels like the day is gone anyway because I didn&#x27;t feel like doing anything resembling work when I got home. 4&#x2F;10 felt like getting a free day off. The only downside was when some sort of mandatory meeting would get scheduled for your off day, and you ended up having to do the whole morning routine and commute just to come in for an hour.')
