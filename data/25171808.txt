I know most (all?) people have failed at this so far...but I still have hope, at least in my particular case.<p>Anyway I wonder if anyone here has suggestions for the smoothest, most friction-free payment method for paying 1 USD up to 20 USD on the open web (no mobile app, browser extension, etc).<p>Amazon Pay seems like a good bet to me since I imagine a good portion of people browse while logged in to Amazon. Maybe PayPal? I know Stripe and Gumroad have smooth payment flows, but they require inputting card information, which I think would be a turn-off.<p>Any ideas?<p>Target market is mostly non-technical people around the world so I don&#x27;t expect JavaScript blocking or browser containers to be much of an issue.')
