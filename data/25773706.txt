Why would it be odd that BLM shows up in the mob that attacked Capitol Hill?<p>BLM, like most civil rights movements, is loosely organized and generally not playing 4D chess. Same applies to hate groups &#x2F; white nationalist movements, in general. If there’s anything suspicious going on, it’s probably Parler. Seems like Parler was half agitprop and half honeypot. But I’d be willing to believe that this was incompetence &amp; opportunism, since it seems like there’s plenty of incompetence and cut corners to go around. Rich people always fantasize about controlling the media but don’t realize how expensive it is to actually succeed at it, and Parler reads like a 21st century version of a rich family buying a newspaper to try and influence national politics (except it turns out, this is harder than they thought).')
