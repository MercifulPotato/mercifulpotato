In this case, hosting services and app stores.  If you don&#x27;t like their moderation either, you are free to setup your own bare metal servers, even your own app store.<p>And then there is Tor.  If you really want to live outside of any moderation, outside of even basic laws, then setup a Tor hidden service.  If you aren&#x27;t going to put in some basic effort to protect yourself (ie what ThePirateBay does every day) and instead run strait to the courts, then I have little sympathy.')
