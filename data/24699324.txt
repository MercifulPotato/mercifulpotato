Anything you don&#x27;t want to say &quot;yeah, I&#x27;d be completely fine hosting that without hesitation&quot; about, you should think about now, and put in corresponding policies now.<p>Having policies in advance means people will just go elsewhere. Trying to add such policies later, when you have existing users, will be much harder. You&#x27;re likely to want to draw that line <i>somewhere</i>; better to draw it in advance.<p>(I&#x27;ve dealt with user-generated content before; please feel free to reach out privately if you&#x27;d like to talk about it further.)')
