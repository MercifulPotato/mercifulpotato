If I&#x27;m not getting a thousand dollars worth of <i>value</i> from a day, that money is wasted. Spending $50 at a normal restaurant is not &quot;saving money&quot;, it&#x27;s actually a waste of a day! Once you&#x27;ve sunk days into flying somewhere, and dedicated weeks of <i>not working</i>, you may as well spend $200-$300 on a really fancy dinner.<p>For a contrast, a friend of mine came with us on a trip and tried to save money by buying the exact same $5 takeaway budget pizza that you can get here. He got food poisoning from it and spent several days of his trip in his room feeling miserable. He spent the same time on the trip and spent the same money on flights and accommodation.')
