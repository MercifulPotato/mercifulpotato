Resilient economies are well-balanced economies. When Big Tech falls - and it <i>will</i> eventually fall, because no industry is immune to corrections or busts -  - the effect on the wider economy will be all the greater. The greater a share of the stock market that Big Tech holds, the larger the blast radius their failure will impose on the wider economy.<p>That FAANG constitutes such a large part of major market indices communicates a failure on the part of regulators. Not just the kind of regulation that technologists care about, i.e. protecting free software and open access, but <i>economic</i> regulation as well, that tries to smooth out the business boom and bust cycles and care about the health of the wider American economy.')
