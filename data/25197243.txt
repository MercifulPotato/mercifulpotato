It would be great to get an updated version which includes advances in renewable and battery technology. It is also focussed almost exclusively on the UK. Would be nice to have a version to cover feasibilities for all countries.<p>Edit: if memory serves, it also doesn&#x27;t really cover carbon capture?')
