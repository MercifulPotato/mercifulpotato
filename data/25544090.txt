Deno&#x27;s official module registry stores immutable tagged versions of open-source projects, but there&#x27;s a project called Nest.land[1] that takes the immutability one step further by putting modules on the arweave[2] blockchain.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where the JS standardization process is at with import integrity checks for non-script-tag imports, but Deno has lock files and integrity checking built in.[3]<p>I like the idea of a language that&#x27;s built with content addressing from the ground up. I dream of being able to import IPFS urls (or something like that) directly within JS. Although that wouldn&#x27;t be as good as a language that forced usage of content-addressed imports, since that way you don&#x27;t have to scour the code for any sneaky dynamic imports (especially since in JavaScript there&#x27;s `eval` and the like, and they can be obscured).<p>I guess this is partially solved by Deno&#x27;s ability to limit the network requests to specific domains like:<p><pre><code>    deno run foo.js --allow-net=deno.land,foo.com\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on this project - thanks for sharing!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.land&#x2F;x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.land&#x2F;x</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nest.land&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nest.land&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arweave.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arweave.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.land&#x2F;manual&#x2F;linking_to_external_code&#x2F;integrity_checking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.land&#x2F;manual&#x2F;linking_to_external_code&#x2F;integrity_...</a>')
