I am delighted to hear that this might be useful for your personal use.<p>I spent four or five days intensely working on the script to convert an .epub to .txt. It&#x27;s a surprisingly hard problem, so I tried to be correct in every detail. It was important to me that an AI learn the way humans learn.<p>Therefore, yes, I have found that these books are quite readable. However there are some unique challenges due to the nature of it being .txt, which I would love to help you navigate.<p>Firstly, the top and the bottom of each file is usually &quot;repetitive&quot;. By that I mean, there tends to be a lot of metadata that might be hard to skip.<p>However, the neat thing is, these aren&#x27;t actually .txt files -- it&#x27;s Markdown. And we can take advantage of the markdown format to help you out.<p>Here is a direct link to &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;shawwn&#x2F;1b399325e8667311654cee583b162e73&#x2F;raw&#x2F;7a4b28c84f3db9df7bc5ea8215fa64d4ea2a412f&#x2F;apology.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;shawwn&#x2F;1b399325e866731165...</a><p>I like this file as an example, because it illustrates both problems that will be challenging for you. Firstly, the book itself doesn&#x27;t begin until <i>halfway down the file</i>. There is a ridiculously long &quot;forward&quot; section, written by someone else. Normally this would be easy to skip.<p>The cheat code I use to read this book is to search for &quot;# 1&quot;. Double quote, followed by pound sign (or &quot;hashtag&quot; as the kids say nowadays, ha), followed by a space, then the number one.<p>That brings you straight to chapter one.<p>However, not all books use that format for chapter one. So I would recommend searching for a regex, if you can: &quot;beginning of line&quot; followed by pound sign.<p>That&#x27;ll usually do the trick. And yes, I find all of these to be quite readable, which I was proud of.<p>The code is courtesy of Aaron Swartz, by the way. I merely refined it. I am so proud of him for what he was able to achieve during his lifetime. This is &quot;html-to-text&quot; with some modifications.<p>If you want to convert .epub files to .txt for your own use, the script is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;shawwn&#x2F;scrap&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;epub2txt-all" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;shawwn&#x2F;scrap&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;epub2txt-all</a><p>It has a rather cryptic name of &quot;epub2txt-all&quot;. Sorry about that. But the script itself should be just a matter of running it.<p>Here are some notes on what I did with this script, in case you find it helpful: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;soskek&#x2F;bookcorpus&#x2F;issues&#x2F;27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;soskek&#x2F;bookcorpus&#x2F;issues&#x2F;27</a><p>Happy reading! Please let me know any other questions you might have.<p>By the way, dmca.mp4 is a joke video. Sort of. It&#x27;s a good question of what is actually going on there. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s a dozen professionals who have gathered together to simulate jacking themselves off while singing &quot;ahhhhhhHHhhH&quot; for ten minutes. I don&#x27;t really know anything beyond that, but the-eye.eu community seems rather proud of it.')
