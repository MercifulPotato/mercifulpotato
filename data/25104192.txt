I understand the convenience they offer but I do not think they are worth the complexity they add to the language. There is a whole zoo of syntax around them, as the author states arbitrary computation can sneak up on you when you don&#x27;t expect it, and ultimately all you are doing is creating some shorthand for functions.<p>If you like, make some shorthand for creating a getter&#x2F;setter pair that link with some field, that would be fine. But keep them functions, so that it is clear that they are functions to consumers.')
