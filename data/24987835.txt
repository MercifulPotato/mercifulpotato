For example, there is a clear argument post prop22 that a law which prohibited registered sex offenders from being rideshare app drivers would now require a 7&#x2F;8th&#x27;s vote.<p>Uber has repeatability shown itself more than willing to exploit loopholes in an unethical manner and we&#x27;ve now granted them a fairly generalized shield against loophole closing.<p>Ultimately the courts may not be willing to follow such a broad effect, but the recipe for a lot of time and money to be wasted litigating it is coded right into the proposition.')
