This is actually when even very expensive lenses often use plastics inside, because those plastics don&#x27;t expand&#x2F;contract&#x2F;deform as much because of heat as metals, leading to more precise optical alignments and higher image quality.<p>Ironically, since these lenses often need much smaller adjustments and don&#x27;t need as much to be readjusted after taking them apart, I find it easier to repair them than some complex metal lenses.')
