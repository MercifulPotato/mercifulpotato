Typically they&#x27;d list the file getting shared and a timestamp (often without a timezone) and the university IP&#x2F;port.  They never included their own IP address...<p>Of course, the traffic was behind a firewall.  I had the logs but wasn&#x27;t about to accuse &#x2F; punish anyone when there were a bunch of potential students behind any given complaint, and without the other end of the connection I couldn&#x27;t identify which one for certain.<p>Funny thing is they refused to give their source IP because they didn&#x27;t trust us to not leak it to whatever pirates to put on a blocklist.<p>But of course, I had their source IP because I had the network traffic.  Were I in kahoots I&#x27;d have just listed all 5 of the possible snitching peers to the badguys.<p>Shady and incompetent then, same now I guess.')
