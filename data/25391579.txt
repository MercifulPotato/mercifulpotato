The reason MBA-zation is a thing is because companies are forced to permanently grow and cut costs to indulge investor expectations.<p>If you hire non-MBAs they will be tasked to do the same thing and you will have the same result.<p>Change your capital structure, stay private, take as little money from investors as possible and you&#x27;ll no longer need MBAs to make every single quarter look like a success. However you may not grow as fast as you like.<p>If you need large capital inflows on a regular basis, you have to satisfy the people that gave it to you.')
