The correct mapping would be public employee &lt;=&gt; programmer, or Raytheon weapons engineer &lt;=&gt; Soldier, for example. It really is the social function that is core to this argument.<p>The social function that cops represent is the enforcement of laws and many of these laws are of a net benefit to society. it is an error to reduce the law enforcement function to brutality and expropriation when there are plenty of violent, malevolent, and larcenous individuals who are not police and still engage in socially undesirable behaviors.')
