As far as I know there is no way to determine the long term risk of a medicine other than just waiting to see.<p>(4) I live in a county that has not been hit hard.<p>(5) It looks like there are at least two vaccines that are going to get quick approval, and I believe there are more deeply into their phase 3 tests.<p>Putting this all together, it seems I personally have a pretty low chance of getting COVID, and if I do get it a pretty low chance of spreading it while I&#x27;m still asymptotic, so can afford to wait and see if any of the vaccines have longer term issues or if one of them is clearly better than the others.')
