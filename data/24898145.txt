This can get complicated to measure.<p>And specifically for this particular thread, this is a vaccine, not a cure -- so in any case, when we say &quot;least healthy&quot; in this context, we&#x27;re not talking about giving it to people who are already diagnosed with the virus, but rather to those who are _at most risk of complications_ from the virus, _if they were to contact it_. So it would be giving a drug to people who _don&#x27;t_ immediately &quot;need&quot; it to survive, but who are still most at risk from any side effects.')
