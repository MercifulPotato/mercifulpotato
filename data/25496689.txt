Now the provider and insurance company have to work together to resolve the bill. Most importantly it would be charged against the patient’s <i>in-network</i> deductible.<p>It’s really too bad that this bill was watered down in one particular way. The Senate version of the bill would have set the price as the median in-network price for the procedure&#x2F;service in that market (which ~5x the price that Medicare would pay). Out of network prices are usually another ~5x higher than in-network prices. House Democrats instead pushed for the rate to be set in arbitration, which is the version that will be enacted.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;theapothecary&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;house-democrats-capitulation-on-surprise-billing-proves-theyll-never-pass-medicare-for-all&#x2F;?sh=4e735b9b2538" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;theapothecary&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;house-...</a>')
