Item(by='javert', descendants=None, kids=[25004040], score=None, time=1604619565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001429, text='&gt; getting at the hypocrisy of asking for a citation and then making an uncited claim<p>A person asking for a citation is not disallowed from making a claim. Someone else is free to ask for a citation from me, in return.<p>You are not only incorrect, which is fine, but you&#x27;re unjustly calling me a hypocrite, which, personally, I consider to be a rather non-nice thing to say.<p>Furthermore, my request for a &quot;citation&quot; was supposed to be equivalent to asking for &quot;any sort of rationale.&quot; You are interpreting that overly legalistically. I&#x27;m was just trying to have a conversation, OK? And I did it in a polite way. I would have been happy to hear a rationale that was not a citation <i>per se</i>. It would even have been OK for the person I was responding to to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I just suspect it,&quot; or &quot;I heard it anecdotally,&quot; or whatever.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a related issue in the current scientific paradigm, fetishizing statistical p-values. People are so distracted by the veneer of a p-value (or a citation) that they forget to look for a plausible causal mechanism.<p>I agree, although that&#x27;s not related to my behavior here.<p>I&#x27;m annoyed by the same thing you are, which is when people use &quot;citation?&quot; as though it&#x27;s a counter-argument. But <i>I wasn&#x27;t doing that.</i> I wish I had just said, &quot;What&#x27;s your <i>rationale</i> for saying that.&quot; But you know what? I can&#x27;t predict when someone is going to misinterpret a perfectly reasonable and polite thing I&#x27;ve said.<p>I think the thing I was responding to is exactly the (rare) kind of thing where an actual citation <i>probably is</i> the kind of answer someone with a rationale would <i>want</i> to give, as opposed to a causal explanation or some other sort of evidence. So you&#x27;re preaching to the choir, here. I get what you&#x27;re saying, i.e., that many people ask for citations in a context where a citation doesn&#x27;t really make sense (for example, a controversial medical claim where there are probably numerous studies that seem to disagree with one another). This just isn&#x27;t that sort of context. I could see myself making the same point you are making <i>in a different context</i>. It annoys me to be lumped in with <i>those people</i> that you and I are both justifiably annoyed by.<p>&gt; By the way, you still haven&#x27;t explained your skepticism of the original statement you replied to.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true. I know that cryptocurrency is being treated as a financial asset. I haven&#x27;t seen evidence that extortion or fraud are a major fraction of what&#x27;s going on with cryptocurrency. I have enough familiarity and experience with the field to think that my sense of this is probably correct.<p>Bitcoin is 66% of the market cap of cryptocurrency. It&#x27;s clear that bitcoin is being used widely as a financial asset (it&#x27;s available in multiple funds you can get in brokerage accounts, there are many high-volume OTC desks, there are derivatives, there is now lending). There is a <i>lot</i> of journalism showing that large sums of money are flowing into bitcoin <i>as a financial asset</i>; for example, the company MicroStrategy purchasing $425M of bitcoin, or Robinhood facilitating bitcoin trading, or GBTC accepting inflows of hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase bitcoin.<p>In contrast, I&#x27;m aware of ransomware, but I suspect it&#x27;s probably a very small fraction of the bitcoin&#x2F;cryptocurrency economy (but, as I <i>said originally</i>, I would be interested to see evidence contrary to that). My sense is that it&#x27;s pretty hard to <i>effectively</i> launder money with cryptocurrency, unless you stay out of the US and Europe and parts of Asia, i.e., unless you stay in the places where it&#x27;s already probably easier to launder money. But again, that&#x27;s just my sense, so if someone has an explanation contrary to that, I&#x27;d be interested to see it, which is <i>why I asked.</i><p>I view many of the smaller crypto coins as scams, so there is actually an interpretation of OP&#x27;s statement that I agree with - I guess it depends on how you define &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;a huge fraction.&quot; Again, bitcoin is 66% and is clearly not a scam (though it would be fair to ask why that&#x27;s clear if someone doesn&#x27;t already know - but my answer right now would be, go research it yourself, I can&#x27;t take the time to explain all that). Bitcoiners may be <i>misguided</i> or <i>wrong</i>, but it&#x27;s not a scam.')
