Seems reasonable to me - they&#x27;re just a couple of bulbs?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t really care vs Amazon&#x27;s 2-4 days<p>Isn&#x27;t the big thing about Amazon is that it&#x27;s next-day shipping? I don&#x27;t live anywhere near a major city and Amazon still manage to deliver to me in about ten hours now.')
