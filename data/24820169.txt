And yes, very early on in the grand scheme of things. :)<p>&gt; (2 minutes per game!)<p>Sorry, I was creating short games so we could get people in and they could try it out. About 20 tiles per player. You can go up to 75 or 100 tiles per player, and those games tend to go on for a lot longer. Playing with friends for an hour or so usually places us around 10 games, we usually do about 50 per player. YMMV of course, depending on your host, your group of friends, and what letter distribution you use. :D<p>Thanks for playing and the feedback though!<p>&gt; - Is there a chat? I might have missed it. It seems like an important feature if your goal is to have far away friends play together.<p>Not yet, working on that :) Figuring out how to integrate Jitsi into another site is a fun challenge that spans multiple weekends.')
