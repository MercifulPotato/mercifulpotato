Most recessed lights I&#x27;ve seen recently are spotlights, although that could be a function of where I am looking.<p>IMO, interior designers and light manufacturers need to work together to make attractive energy-efficient lighting solutions. For example, recessed halogen-based spotlights are a nightmare for LEDs - there&#x27;s nowhere for the heat to go. Even if you get an LED bulb from aliexpress, it won&#x27;t last long because of the lack of proper heatsinking.
