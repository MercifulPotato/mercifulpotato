For Windows networks this often involves breaking into the Active Directory &#x2F; domain controller, which then gives you administrative access and makes it possible to e.g. encrypt data. This usually requires manual enumeration and specific exploits, it&#x27;s not something that can be fully automated yet.<p>So you&#x27;re describing just the first link in a long attack chain. Eliminating that weak link doesn&#x27;t mean the attackers can&#x27;t gain access to the network, it just means they have to find another entrypoint, and in a real-world network where people need to regularly click on links and open untrusted documents it&#x27;s notoriously difficult to plug all holes.<p>Even the largest DAX corporations in Germany regularly become victims of cyber attacks, and trust me they spend a ton of money on cyber security and have thousands of people working on it.')
