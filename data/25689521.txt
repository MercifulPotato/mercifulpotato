If BTC price increases, regardless of what reason, the next buyer has to somehow have more USDT than there previously was in the system.<p>- B buys 1USDT for 1USD<p>- BTC sale at 1USDT from A to B<p>- person B now lists their BTC for 3USDT<p>- if person C now wants to buy this BTC for 3 USD, there has to be an additional 3 USDT minted<p>Given new influx of money keeps happening to buy BTC, more and more USDT needs to be printed. Meaning, extra USDT is printed BEFORE the price increases. Because it&#x27;s required to buy. Doesn&#x27;t explain why it&#x27;s seldom burned. Nobody ever cashes out?')
