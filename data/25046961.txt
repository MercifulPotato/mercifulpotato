I ordered a car roof rack, but received a pile of random plastic chunks.  I returned it for a refund. My fear is Amazon just put those plastic chunks back in the mix for some other unsuspecting buyer.  So, I left a review to the effect of &quot;one of the sellers is inserting garbage into the stream, caveat emptor&quot;.  Amazon rejected the review.  As a buyer, I would have found that useful, as it would allow me to go elsewhere.  Obviously bad for Amazon, but so is shipping be a pile of garbage - I won&#x27;t be buying roof racks from them any time soon.')
