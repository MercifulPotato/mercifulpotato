Item(by='gregdoesit', descendants=None, kids=[24780299], score=None, time=1602701701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779940, text='I both asked beta readers to share if they are seeing a change in application rates, and reached out to a few of them.<p>I have a small sample size - about 15 responses - and everyone reported getting higher response rates. Some said it was much much higher, some said it was somewhat higher.<p>I will add that almost everyone who has responded are people with 2+ years experience, many of them having 5+. So I cannot vouch if the advice here significantly helps people with less experience, where the market is more competitive and it&#x27;s harder to stand out.<p>All of this is anecdotal, though. I have a few people who agreed to share their names on the site, with reviews. And I have more emails in my inbox saying thanks for seeing higher success in going through the resume screen. There are also people who got more recruiter calls, but still have not been able to get an offer, struggling on the later parts of the process.')
