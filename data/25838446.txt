I acquired a small startup that was broadcasting police scanners online with the intent to supplement RadioReference.com&#x27;s community and content with online scanners that you could listen to.  At the time, the startup I acquired had about 400 radios online, and when the acquisition closed and we folded the content into RadioReference.com it quickly took off and doubled the amount of feeds within a few months.<p>At that point, I decided to spin the online feeds off to a separate Web site and business by registering &quot;Broadcastify&quot; (the verb-ify domains were just becoming popular) and the rest was history.  Broadcastify has over 7000+ online scanner feeds and has been wildly successful with partnerships with mobile app developers etc.')
