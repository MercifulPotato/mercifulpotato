Revoking a Developer ID cert is a death sentence for signed software.<p>Thus, basic housekeeping is not a justified reason for revoking a certificate. The express purpose of the Developer ID program was for security, and security is the only reason to revoke a Developer ID certificate. It&#x27;s an extreme measure, to be taken only in the worst case scenario.<p>Apple has a remote kill switch for all signed software on the Mac. They need to be extremely careful about when, if ever, they flip that switch. Almost all known cases of a Developer ID cert getting revoked is when the owner of the cert was a malware author.')
