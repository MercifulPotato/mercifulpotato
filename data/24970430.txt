Instead of one centralized server you&#x27;ve moved to maybe 3-4 centralized servers, which isn&#x27;t that helpful against the issue at hand, especially if those servers are all within the US, Europe and other law-enforcement-cooperating countries.<p>In a true decentralized system (e.g. Bittorrent, Bitcoin, etc.) it&#x27;s practically impossible to delete something, and there would be plenty of accessible copies of data in jurisdictions that are out of reach of any single country&#x27;s law enforcement, and even out of reach of the original creator to delete, so the original creator&#x27;s government would not be able to force them to delete it.<p>Another HN user pointed out Freenet to me in another post, which sounded a lot like the right answer, but I haven&#x27;t researched it in detail yet and whether it could be easily adapted to work with the git command to actually version repos in a decentralized fashion.')
