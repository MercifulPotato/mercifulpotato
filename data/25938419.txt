It&#x27;s also worth adding that scaling WebRTC -- both to calls with more than a few participants, and to large numbers of users on a service -- is still a bit of a specialized undertaking.<p>Partly because it&#x27;s intended to be a really, really flexible API, the abstractions are pretty leaky. You end up learning a lot about video codecs, UDP and RTP networking, and browser implementation details as you build out WebRTC applications!<p>(I&#x27;m the cofounder Daily.co of a YC company that tries to make WebRTC &quot;just a few lines of code&quot; for common use cases, and to be the best possible application-level APIs and global infrastructure for advanced developers.)')
