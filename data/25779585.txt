There still seems to be a large hole in the smartwatch market for a GOOD Android-compatible smartwatch. There are a lot of options, but, to me, none of them are as polished or feature-heavy as the Apple Watch. It doesn&#x27;t seem that one of these companies would need access to any special internal APIs or anything to be competitive, so I don&#x27;t see what Google could add other than lots of money and SWE hours.<p>If Google wants to compete in this space they should have been forced to build it themselves. IMO letting Fitbit die would have been better for users privacy-wise.')
