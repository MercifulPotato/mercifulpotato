It makes me wonder &quot;are there cases where someone made the market more efficient and was not made very wealthy?&quot; I think you&#x27;re right that there is a massive incentive for the market to be more efficient, but I suspect there are cases where people were able to develop alpha without being able to capitalize on it, because the market denied or neglected the insight.<p>Were there free markets in the 17th century, would they have been able to incorporate Galileo&#x27;s insight? Or would they have joined the church in denunciation? Part of me thinks that if they did eventually come around to the solar system, it wouldn&#x27;t be all that quick.')
