Though just from a minute or two with the keyboard I found it impractical for carrying on a conversation over SMS so I don&#x27;t think I could do a real test of the battery life anyway.<p>The on-screen keyboard is not actually the main problem, the main problem is just that the thing is very laggy compared to my flagship. I hit the wrong button and then the entire UI locks up and it can take a minute just to get back to the screen I wanted to be on. vs. on my flagship I can jump to the browser, do a search, jump back to messenger, send a message, jump to maps, look at something, and everything happens with typical subsecond responsiveness.')
