You can see there&#x27;s a big competing pattern of having multiple binaries with the same prefix like ssh ssh-agent ssh-keygen, dbus-FOO dpkg-FOO apt-FOO snmpFOO ldapFOO.<p>And there are plenty which don&#x27;t have this &quot;clearly delineated sub-command&quot; like git has.<p>&gt; where [GUI] has almost no de-facto standards like this<p>The massive main de-facto standard a GUI has is showing you important things up front and hiding irrelevant and uncommon things away. With a CLI you see nothing until you --help then you see everything. There&#x27;s no indication of what&#x27;s a common path through the tool.<p>openssl sha --help shows &quot;-non-fips-allow&quot; above &quot;-sha1&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not showing options in alphabetical order. Am I to infer that &quot;-sigopt nm:v&quot; is more common, more used, more important, than &quot;use SHA1&quot; because it&#x27;s higher up in the list? If not, why <i>is</i> it higher up in the list?<p>Hamburger menu? Right-click on a thing to show you a context menu of things you can do with a thing? A central content area with &quot;tabbed sections&quot; along the top (real tabs or links like a menu bar)? Mouse hover-and-pause tooltip? &quot;select an item and press F1 for help&quot;? Have a username link or avatar picture behind which your user-specific options are? Are these not large and common &quot;de-facto standards&quot; in GUIs?')
