That means 48% of US households had a single or no choice if they wanted download speeds over 25Mbps.<p>...and we don&#x27;t actually know what the real numbers are because the FCC doesn&#x27;t require household level reporting, it&#x27;s census block level reporting, and it&#x27;s not even if a single household in that census block has service, it&#x27;s if a single household in that census block <i>could</i> have service &quot;without an extraordinary commitment of resources&quot; by the ISP.<p>See [1].
