Investigate different pencil options.  There are quite a few cool features on mechanical pencils for instance.  Try different lead hardnesses and thicknesses.  Get a quality eraser.<p>I&#x27;m 45 and finally discovered I like softer lead.  It&#x27;s easier to read and smudging isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  I took drafting in high school but never retained any of the knowledge or put it to good use when writing.')
