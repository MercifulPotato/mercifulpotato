Imagine you call it &quot;Bin&quot;, unless that name is ambiguous, in which case you call it &quot;Bin (built in)&quot;.<p>Now, when the user does a search, they need to search for &quot;In:&#x27;Bin (built in)&#x27;&quot;.  Except when they delete the label called Bin, now the search terms they must use changes...  All their saved searches and bookmarks with search terms in the URL would break too.<p>Reserving the names in all locales might work, although I could imagine quite a few users being frustrated they can&#x27;t name something without realising that the word they are trying to use means something in some language they don&#x27;t even speak.')
