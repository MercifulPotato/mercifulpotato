I’d never answer them, but blocking the numbers never did any good.<p>I somehow managed to get the name of one of the companies responsible for it. Then, I called <i>them</i> up — not the call center employees who were making the calls, the actual corporate office — and I told them to please stop calling me, or, real soon, I was gonna start looking for someone to sue.<p>The calls stopped. I don’t think I even got any this cycle.')
