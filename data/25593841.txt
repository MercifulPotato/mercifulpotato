I won’t buy Dodge products because as a back yard mechanic they are the vehicle that has let me down the most. They have ghost issues that are near impossible to track down and fix. Transmission issues. Electrical issues. I could rant all day. I finally saved up and went with a Toyota and now feel comfortable driving long distances again and know I should be good for several hundred thousand miles. I honestly believe Tesla is playing with fire with this poor quality control. They may get away with it for now but I promise as they grow if they don’t address these issues you will have the opposite of a fan club and people who hate your product and promote others to their friends. I have convinced several people not to buy dodge&#x2F;Chrysler. They are cheap to but cheaply made as well and guaranteed to let you down. Will Tesla become the next Dodge?')
