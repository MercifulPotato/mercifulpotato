I&#x27;ve been interested in building this Pi camera using a lens with a shallow depth of field, but it&#x27;s very hard to figure out a lens to get that will work with the Pi, look right if mounted from around 2 to 3 feet away, and have a  decent quality picture.<p>After spending a bunch of time researching, I got this feeling if I pursue this project I&#x27;ll end up with hundreds of dollars of bad lenses and just wish I would have bought a real DSLR or mirrorless camera that connects via USB.')
