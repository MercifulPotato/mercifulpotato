Steam stole some of the ideas from that and got huge accolades (in part because Steam already fought the Pawn Shop syndicate and was already seen to be outside their grasp, whereas consoles are not).<p>Maybe it would take government involvement to straighten out this mess of moneyed interests, make an equitable &quot;digital buyers rights&quot; standard. It&#x27;s too bad most governments don&#x27;t seem interested in getting in the way of the current moneyed interests here. The GDPR had the opportunity to address some of it and intentionally kicked the can down the road.<p>(My personal hobby horse here is to remind people that we desperately need &quot;digital estate planning&quot; and to consider inheritance&#x2F;trust&#x2F;benefactor rights for digital ownership. Right now most digital account systems in their Terms of Service agreements explicitly expire with the death of the account owner, and there&#x27;s going to be a lot of ugly battles over &quot;dad&#x27;s Steam account&quot;, &quot;grandma&#x27;s Movies Anywhere library&quot;, &quot;sister&#x27;s Kindle library&quot; etc in the coming future, and none of the current laws are prepared to handle that.)')
