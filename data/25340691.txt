I like gitlab so much I couldn&#x27;t miss this opportunity to recommend it.<p>The nice thing about Gitlab is that you can mix on-prem and saas according to your need.<p>For example I am now running my own gitlab instance at home but I&#x27;m thinking of switching to the gitlab.com offering while keeping runners at home. By pairing gitlab with Hashicorp Vault I could keep encrypted stuff in my repo and decrypt them when they are checked out on the (local on-prem) runner.<p>Super cool, so much flexibility!')
