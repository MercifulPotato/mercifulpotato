Instead, they pivoted into implementing different things that were not part of that initial hype cycle, and implemented enough of them that they hoped people would forget about what the game was originally claimed to be.<p>And apparently it worked, because people always talk about how No Man&#x27;s Sky got &quot;fixed&quot; without acknowledging that huge, major chunks of that initial promise were never in fact developed.')
