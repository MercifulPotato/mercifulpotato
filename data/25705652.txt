The semi and roadster are nowhere to be found and the solar roof was pushed back and back.<p>The Model 3 was ahead of schedule (at least in terms of release if not production volumes) and so was the Model Y.<p>My guess is that projects that will make or break the company live under round the clock intense supervision from Musk, and have the company&#x27;s top talent and full resources assigned.<p>Projects simmering on the back burner more or less progress as they would at other companies.<p>So - is the $25k Model 2 in the critical path for Tesla? I would use that as a guide to guessing whether it&#x27;ll be vaporware or rushed through with superhuman effort.')
