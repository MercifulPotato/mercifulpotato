Item(by='ubercow13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611194493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25854255, text='Brave beats Firefox on the EFF test because it randomises parts of its fingerprint, which the Tor project seems to reject as a strategy for anonymity [1].<p>I find the claim that Firefox is less privacy focused than Brave a bit questionable. Brave certainly seems to have good and probably better defaults in that regard, but remember that Firefox is basically developed in collaboration with the Tor project and as a result has various significant (mainly non-default) privacy features architected in such as first party isolation, containers, and Tor-project-approved fingerprint resistance. Easily-disabled telemetry seems like a small hassle compared to such concrete privacy features which do not exist elsewhere.<p>And for example with something like first party isolation, it is unclear whether Brave would even want or be able to to maintain such a patch set on top of Chromium when it requires quite deep integration with the browser engine.<p>Thereâ€™s also the manifest v3 stuff which will presumably end up in Brave at some point.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2019.www.torproject.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;torbrowser&#x2F;design&#x2F;#fingerprinting-linkability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2019.www.torproject.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;torbrowser&#x2F;design&#x2F;#...</a>')
