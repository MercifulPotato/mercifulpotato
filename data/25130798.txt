Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605652251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129171, text='<i>Some kind of logic like &quot;For Python programming queries, docs.python.org and then StackExchange are the tier 1 sources&quot; seems to be the kind of hard-coded information that would vastly improve my experience trying to look things up on DuckDuckGo.</i><p>The problem with this strategy is always going to be that different users will regard different sources as most desirable.<p>For example, it&#x27;s enormously frustrating that searching for almost anything Python-related on DDG seems to return lots of random blog posts but hardly ever shows the official Python docs near the top. I don&#x27;t personally think the official Python docs are ideally presented, but they&#x27;re almost certainly more useful to me at that time than some random blog that happens to mention an API call I&#x27;m looking up.<p>On the other hand, I would gladly have an option in a search engine to hide the entire Stack Exchange network by default. The signal&#x2F;noise ratio has been so bad for a long time that I would prefer to remove them from my search experience entirely rather than prioritise them. YMMV, of course. (Which is my point.)')
