Let&#x27;s assume that there are top secret research programs. What this tells us is that the research had yeilded such results as<p>* Super High Density energy storage mechanism, that when being used actually cools down instead of heating up<p>* An energy source that isn&#x27;t based around burning fossil fuels for propulsion, that is highly efficient.<p>* A device that could atleast in theory be using some kind of an inertial cancellation mechanism.<p>Any of this could be a solution to climate change. Why would our own governments lie and put the future of this planet in jeapordy?. Just so they can win the next war but lose a Future?.<p>The idea that this is some kind of a secret research project doesn&#x27;t add up.')
