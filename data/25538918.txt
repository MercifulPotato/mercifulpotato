On linux at least there is generally not a central location for CRLs, or anything to keep them up to date. Each application is responsible for maintinging CRLs it cares about itself. And then there is the fact that a full set of CRLs is pretty big. OCSP fixes some of that, at the cost of more latency during the TLS handshake. OCSP stapling is probably the best existing solution, but I don&#x27;t think it is widespread enough that you can rely on it yet.')
