Especially for assemblies. Ideally, eliminating districts.<p>Because of path dependencies (the legal version of technical debt), we gotta start where we&#x27;re at. So I support any and all reforms that move us in that direction.<p>I&#x27;ve long advocated approval voting for executive and single member districts. But since I support any move away from FPTP, I support my friends working on RCV. (Don&#x27;t let perfection be the enemy of good enough.)<p>I&#x27;m newly curious about multimember districts. I don&#x27;t really get the math (details) yet. I read that Illinois&#x27; state house had multimember districts and that it was more effective and less polarized today. And this reform might be an easier lift.<p>I&#x27;m also newly curious about unicameral legislatures. Especially at the state level. Meaning no upper houses aka senates. Or maybe giving the senates different responsibilities. Like the lower house controls the budget and appropriations whereas the upper house does more meta stuff like democratic and governmental reforms. I like the notion of a fast changing lower house and a slower changing upper house. One of the stated intents of the US Senate. But without a more clear division of labor (balance of powers), it hasn&#x27;t seemed to work out.')
