Humans already have an issue with using terms or something such that does not exist within the manga world such as referring to &quot;china&quot; (Chinese ceramics) or Americanizing manga to the point where it makes even less sense to the reader (unless perhaps if you&#x27;re American?

And the same goes obviously towards pet&#x2F;nicknames. Heck, everyone addresses their older sister&#x2F;brother as big sister&#x2F;brother and NOTHING ELSE right?')
