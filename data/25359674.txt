Go try to script ip address changes or MAC reporting across Ubuntu 12.04 - 20.04 for instance, theyve changed the tooling like 3 times. With CentOS, deprecation has a long tail, so whatever works on 8.0 is <i>likely</i> to work in 7.0 (going back to 2012) and maybe even 6.5.<p>Likewise, in those mixed environments, go run `apt upgrade` and `dnf upgrade` across the board; your CentOS &#x2F; RHEL breakage will be quite small, compared with the havoc that will occur in your Ubuntu deployment.')
