Nobody trusted the network to say &quot;yep, we showed your ad this many times, pay up.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure how fraud detection works there, though. Maybe there&#x27;s third party counting that includes third party fraud checks? Back then, at least, the incentive to spot fraud wasn&#x27;t high - advertisers didn&#x27;t want to admit to their stakeholders that they were wasting their money any more than the adtech network wanted to admit it to the advertiser.<p>Your scenario is also interesting from the publisher side - especially on non-web properties where a musician doesn&#x27;t even have the ability to embed their own JS in their song to collect their own counts or use someone else&#x27;s playcount counting library...')
