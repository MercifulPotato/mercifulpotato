Unless it&#x27;s like a single player game where you only play through or use once. Software today is an continuous process. When a software product ships it&#x27;s far from finished. The subscription model is good for both users and developers, as it allows releasing a software product early, without a huge marketing and advertising budget. The incentive is not to make you buy it once, the incentive is to make you keep using it, by improving it, or keeping it good, take good care of customers, etc.')
