Any comment can be directly replied to and have its own tree of comments. Like... well, like HN, or Reddit.<p>I really thought forums lost something when UBB and its clones (vBulletin, phpBB, etc.) became dominant, because those systems only let top-level posts have replies. So you just had forum -&gt; subforums -&gt; posts -&gt; non-threaded stream of comments under each post. It was honestly awful, and for much of the 00s forums just became a chore to read and participate in. And it really seemed to bring the worst out of people and of moderation policies: like, back in the WWWBoard days, if you wanted to respond to multiple comments on a thread, you&#x27;d reply individually to those comments, and they&#x27;d be threaded in the proper position. But on a UBB forum, if you replied individually to comments like that, half the forum would scream their eyes out at you for &quot;double posting&quot; and often the moderators would threaten to ban you if you did it again. And it also meant that any time an argument would start in a post&#x27;s comments, that argument would take over any and all discussion under that post. In a WWWBoard system, the argument would be segregated into its own subthread and normal discussion can happen in other replies, but UBB didn&#x27;t allow that. And when you have megathreads, a lot of times they just devolve into everyone just saying their piece and nobody having any real back-and-forth discussion (and honestly &quot;megathreads&quot; are something that didn&#x27;t exist at all until UBB came around, because WWWBoard and its clones had no concept of bumping or sticky threads: every post was displayed in descending chronological order with no way to reorder anything)<p>Honestly, I jumped for joy when Reddit took over as the de facto Internet-wide forums system, because it finally meant we got to have real threads again.')
