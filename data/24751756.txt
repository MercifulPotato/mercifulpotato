It&#x27;s not like the cash bail system was some ridiculous fanciful notion that someone created to torture the poor.<p>We have arrested people pay cash bail so that we have some forcing function to ensure that they don&#x27;t flee.  And maybe a little bit to provide people the incentive not to commit crime in the first place.  I don&#x27;t know why, but that seems to be considered discriminatory these days.  Maybe if people are experiencing hardship from being held in jail, they should try not to commit crimes?<p>What I fear about all the social justice movements is that when you get into nitty-gritty details, the symbols that activists want to believe in (eliminating discrimination) do not actually improve the lives of people experiencing disadvantage in society very much when the actual plan of what to do materializes from the advocates of change.<p>Dismantle the police?  I think the people worst served by this idea are the poor and powerless being victimized by crime every day.  They need more police presence and enforcement of law and order for their neighborhoods, not less.<p>Think about the side effects of the symbols you want fulfilled.  And if all your involvement is sitting in your white neighborhood and not having to deal with the effects of your advocacy, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be so opinionated to say how things should be changed.')
