For example, you can use(without problems) fleece outside clothing if there is not a big part of your skin in contact with the fleece, like what happened with kid&#x27;s pajamas, that was very problematic.<p>Probing that on humans is something similar to covid vaccine testing. It is extremely expensive and bureaucratic process and only gives us statistical results. Knowing exactly what happened is extremely difficult or impossible in practice because there are hundreds of chemical compounds, and they interfere with each other creating factorial combinations. But we know it breaks havoc in your body for sure.<p>You also should avoid heat because it makes chemical diffusion exponentially higher. When you eat your soda can, the PET layer,is at ambient temperature. When you eat coffee or tea, it is hot.')
