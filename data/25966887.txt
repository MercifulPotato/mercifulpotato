But you can&#x27;t use that broad brush to paint all investment capital as predatory.<p>First, I can infer that your aversion to capital is due to vulture funds that have been known to extract money from perfect viable companies via buyouts (i.e. thinking &quot;barbarians at the gates&quot; type investments) for example.<p>However, the solution is not just to put everything in a savings account and disregard everything else is predatory.<p>How did we get here ? How did these funds come to exist ? Why are savers getting hurt and vultures making bank ? That&#x27;s what you should really be questioning.<p>I think a much better argument can be made in that you would much rather increase interest rates, and stop the profilgate money lending by the fed, so that extremely cheap capital would not be available for these vultures to exist.<p>How do you back such scenario by direct action ? I don&#x27;t know. However, i know you are not contributing to utopia by wasting your investment capital by letting it slowly burn in a savings account.')
