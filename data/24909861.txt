Item(by='kd0amg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603820649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894346, text='&gt; My main contra-point to Lisp is that with all the meta programming powers you get, you write yourself into your own little corner where no-one but you and your friends live. You want advanced syntax highlighting, linting, automatic refactoring for your special features? Write it yourself!<p>This is contrary to my experience (though I&#x27;ve mostly used Racket rather than Common Lisp). Tracking what&#x27;s a function vs macro, where an identifier is introduced&#x2F;used, etc., is all baked into the underlying language and not something I have to write myself for every language extension I make.<p>&gt; You want outsiders to participate (think: new employees)? Write all documentation yourself, too!<p>Were you planning to <i>not</i> document your internal-use utility code?')
