I say the shares are cornered, you say the hedge funds but it amounts to the same thing. I definitely agree the hedge funds are looking fucked and deservedly so.<p>I think we agree on this.<p>&gt; an agreement of two or more people to commit a crime, or to accomplish a legal end through illegal actions.<p>Are you saying, though, that publishing advice or suggestions on a forum to buy a certain stock is a crime, or is illegal? That kind of stuff happens all the time in newspapers and television shows. Wall Street insiders have coordinated buying and selling for generations.<p>So did giving the advice become a crime by virtue of the fact that so many people decided to act on it?')
