The internet has brought us amazing things, but its starting to show its downsides as well. I&#x27;ve said this before - that before the Internet, we had to rally up support locally and <i>physically</i> in person. If we sound too crazy, it will not take off. The internet allows for small voices to reverberate and pick off individuals that resonate, enough momentum is built up through this and then it is unstoppable.<p>I am a life long believer of free speech and free press. We need better ways to deal with these fringe theories and how they propel through society like cancer while still maintaining reasonable level of freedom of speech. At this point, QAnon is clearly unsubstantiated by any stretch of logic, reasoning and data. It needs to be killed hard with a strong dose of radiation.<p>Don&#x27;t feed the cancer. I am terrified of what else is brewing on the internet today.')
