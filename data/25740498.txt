Having written a lot of Haskell, I don&#x27;t find lazy evaluation to be an issue nearly as often as it is a benefit. Yes, it can be difficult to reason about at times, but more often it ends up leading to simpler code. I would say that if you&#x27;re consistently highly concerned with evaluation order, then yes, Haskell might not be the language for you.<p>But I would also say that you shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with evaluation order when writing Haskell, in the same way you usually shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with what the query optimizer is doing when writing SQL.')
