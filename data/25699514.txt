He&#x27;s got maybe 2 years to get some stuff done before there is the risk of a mid-term power shift like Obama faced.<p>I would suggest that his agenda should have three priorities:<p>1) Get the pandemic under control\n2) Do the opposite of the Republican&#x27;s long agenda of gerrymandering&#x2F;disenfranchising, to tip the scales back towards a point where a Democrat victory doesn&#x27;t require exceptionally high turnouts\n3) Make big changes that actually, materially, visibly improve the lives of the parts of society that have been suffering the most.<p>If Democrats can actually hold on to power for a decade, they have the opportunity to do the big, hard things that will improve life for everyone, and people have time to see the effects and appreciate them. As it stands right now, any Democrat victories seem to quickly revert to Republican control and anything they tried to do gets undone before it&#x27;s finished.')
