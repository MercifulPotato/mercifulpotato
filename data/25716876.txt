Item(by='ljm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610299169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25716624, text='Can&#x27;t really remember the last time I used or saw value in platforms like Yelp, or TripAdvisor, but generally if I&#x27;m on holiday I&#x27;m not using Google to search for &#x27;best restaurants&#x27; in the area or whatever; I&#x27;ll take a local recommendation or just experiment. Tourist traps are easy enough to identify. I might still enjoy a restaurant if the food wasn&#x27;t great, because other parts of the experience more than made up for it.<p>I won&#x27;t support a system like Yelp because the end result is that everything becomes average to serve the algorithm.')
