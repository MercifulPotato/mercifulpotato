One might even say that it makes the language superior, at least in the sense that it&#x27;s easier to acquire as a second language.  (First language learners don&#x27;t seem to have that much of a problem with irregularities, although the gradual loss of irregular forms probably means that the problem for first language learners is not null.)')
