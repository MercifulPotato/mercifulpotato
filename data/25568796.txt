They will have a series of questions they will work through with you. I have been through the process. My main conclusion is that it&#x27;s hard to respect a coach who doesn&#x27;t know about your field of work.<p>I have a good friend I touch base with sometimes which I find more rewarding. It started as a bit of a joke, &quot;maybe you could coach me for free?&quot; We talk every couple of months for an hour and I find it very valuable. In particular, talking through issues with someone who&#x27;s opinion you respect.')
