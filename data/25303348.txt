This talk was funny for sure, but it started a large amount of &quot;computers are awful, look at what this stupid thing did&quot; which was very harmful. Not because it isn&#x27;t true, but because understanding why and how these things happen, dealing with and educated people surrounding these things, and trying to make things better is the goal (perhaps misplaced) of many in the industry. It is incredibly easy to just shit on things.<p>Still a pretty funny talk for sure.')
