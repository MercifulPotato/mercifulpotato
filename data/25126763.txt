We coslept and my wife breast fed ad libitum. People kept asking me if I was tired, and I was confused about what they meant. I remember her once commenting &quot;it&#x27;s so amazing, she (our daughter) sleeps through the night without feeding!&quot; to which I replied, &quot;no, she makes a small fuss and you roll over and pop a boob in her mouth&quot;! Wife wasn&#x27;t even aware it was happening, and we were well rested and happy.<p>On the downside, breast feeding ad libitum basically meant my wife&#x27;s full time job was to breast feed, we went on a date after our kid was a few months old and we had to cut it short because she was sore and it was feeding time. She estimates she spent 40+ hours a week breastfeeding. She played a lot of video games with our daughter latched on, since it could be pretty boring.<p>Like any parents, we had a few &quot;hell nights&quot; when she was sick or teething, but in general human infants are significantly happier (and much quieter!) sleeping next to their mother, and unless a mother is either drunk or under the influence of some other substance, you&#x27;re not going to crush your baby. I slept significantly more soundly and slept in a different bed. Putting your kid in a crib in a different room is a very weird, Victorian thing to do.')
