The result is incredibly addictive. It&#x27;s a constant stream of vivid animation and sound, coupled with the gradual accumulation of different currencies and collectables that makes you always feel like you&#x27;re making some forward progress.<p>At times it can feel almost a bit _too_ slick and addictive. Like it&#x27;s manipulating the reward centres of your brain bit too perfectly. Fortunately, what saves it from feeling hollow is the quality of the writing and the story.
