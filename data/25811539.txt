And that interplanetary travel is practical doesn&#x27;t mean that interstellar or intergalactic travel must be. And considering the speed of our current technological development, vs the time needed to get to the next stage in colonization, something big may emerge in the middle. Or something different and unexpected.<p>In some way, we are like churches deciding what and how a god may think. We are not at the right stage to judge based on our lack of knowledge or perspective. It may not be just one road forward, and going galactic may be the wrong one.<p>I prefer to take one step at a time, and solve our current roadblocks, if we can. Maybe we have the great filter in front of us in plain view and we can&#x27;t recognize it.')
