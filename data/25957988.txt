It&#x27;s why capitalism works. If you get old, and don&#x27;t satisfy your customers, someone else will.&quot;<p>So, the Traditional Sake corporation example aside, I agree - you do need to have <i>some</i> improvement over time.<p>This is not what public stockholders demand though. Public stockholders demand that intangibles be sacrificed in an <i>attempt</i> to improve tangibles. Sacrifice quality of service in an attempt to increase the profit margin. Sacrifice the lifetime of the product in an attempt to lower the RRP.<p>This isn&#x27;t improving the product, it&#x27;s just moving things around. At best it&#x27;s shifting market demographic in hope that the new demographic is more profitable, at worst it&#x27;s burning your customers for a short-term windfall.<p>The core issue here is that there are limits to what you can improve in a given timeframe, and if you don&#x27;t respect those limits then you end up just making things worse. Management often just tells themselves otherwise and keeps pushing until they&#x27;ve already killed the golden goose. At that point, the lesson they&#x27;ve learnt is irrelevant - it&#x27;s too late, customers are already leaving and their reputation is irreparably tarnished.')
