Item(by='konjin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608206386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25442097, text='I build one during the forest fires earlier in the year, I bought a box fan and 6 Merv 14 furnace filters.<p>My best idea was cutting out the front and back wall of the box the filters came with and squishing the fan between two.<p>It worked well enough with the 50cm fan that it could make a 10x8m room pleasant in 10 minutes. The only improvement I would make would be buying a lower rated filter for the intake since it got clogged up with a lot of large particles that were kicked up by the fan.<p>I was planning a big build with an impeller fan, but there is something to be said for a solution so stupid that I can rebuild it in 5 minutes with $50 in parts.')
