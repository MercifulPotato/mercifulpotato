I&#x27;m no linguistics or history expert, but it seems to me there has always been two things in tension: forces which push for unification, and forces which push for diversification.<p>For unification: On the one hand, there&#x27;s obviously an advantage to having a common language everyone speaks.  2000 years ago in the Mediterranean it was Greek; 1000 years ago in Europe it was Latin, 800 years ago in the ME &#x2F; North Africa it was Arabic, etc.<p>Also, there are advantages to having larger groups of people working together; one way of getting people to work together is to have a shared identity; one way to have a shared identity is to have a shared language.  And so one way to grow your power is to unify larger areas (either via annexation or conquest) and then get the areas to have a similar language (either by education &#x2F; persuasion or suppression).  And the most natural way for the powers that be to &quot;unify&quot; a language is to declare the one spoken in the capital city as the official standard.<p>For the diversification side:  It&#x27;s very natural for language to evolve; and the larger number of people speak a language, the more difficult it is for everything to evolve in the same direction.  This means that local areas or local groups are naturally going to &quot;drift&quot;.<p>And once they do drift, then identity comes into play in the opposite ways.  It&#x27;s beneficial for leaders of a large area if everyone has the same identity; but there&#x27;s an opposite attraction for individuals to identify as part of a smaller, distinct group; and thus to emphasize or even push for the diversification of the local dialect.<p>&gt; In this light, you could say that there&#x27;s essentially no such thing as the &#x27;right&#x27; accent.<p>One thing I have noticed is that &quot;prestige dialects&quot;, as they&#x27;re sometimes called, have had people go through the language and &quot;revise&quot; it to make it more &quot;rational&quot;.  After studying Mandarin for several years, I started studying Cantonese; and it&#x27;s pretty clear that Mandarin has had a lot more effort from people put into it to revise it and make it consistent, whereas Cantonese is much more spoken, and thus a lot more &quot;quirky&quot; in lots of ways.<p>The &quot;no double negative&quot; rule in English is an example of this sort of thing.  Many languages have &quot;agreement&quot;, where the whole sentence is either negative or positive; &quot;Je n&#x27;ai jamais&quot; in French could literally be translated &quot;I not have never&quot;; but in French it&#x27;s not a double negative, it&#x27;s just &quot;agreement&quot;.  English used to be exactly the same way (you can read educated people speaking unabashedly with double negatives in, say, the court of Henry VIII); but at some point some clever people decided that it would be much more <i>rational</i> if two negatives made a positive.  That became the &quot;prestige dialect&quot;, and the &quot;common&quot; people who spoke English the way their ancestors had for hundreds of years were then looked down on for being uneducated and speaking English &quot;incorrectly&quot;.<p>So yes, you can&#x27;t say Mandarin or the Chicago Manual of Style&#x27;s version of English is &quot;right&quot;; but it&#x27;s quite probable that they are more <i>consistent</i> than the alternatives (though perhaps less florid or interesting as a result).')
