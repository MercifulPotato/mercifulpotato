For example you have some infrastructure code (like LLVM, Linux kernel, etc.) that brings you little competitive advantage but you benefit from distributed maintenance - OSS is a perfect fit. And people using it but not contributing back is not really that big of a deal.<p>The incentives to upstream exist without licensing requirement - maintaining a fork which when the upstream knows nothing about what you&#x27;re doing and could break you with every commit is not fun. You also lose on distributed review&#x2F;support aspect. At the end of the day if someone finds a way to profit and not contribute back - how does that impact you ? Unless they are a direct competitor and you OSS something critical - in which case like people above said - you should rethink your business model.<p>Also OSS has a bunch of secondary benefits - recruiting, developer mindshare, etc.<p>I think viewing OSS as a generosity is not sustainable, and the incentives exist even without restrictive licensing.')
