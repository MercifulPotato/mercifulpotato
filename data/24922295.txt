Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[24923154], score=None, time=1603909384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921537, text='Even if any tracking your site does already fully complies with GDPR as does your handling of personal data, it still takes some effort and costs some money if GDPR actually applies to your site.<p>If you are not in Europe, the main thing that determines whether or not GDPR applies to your site is Article 3 of the GDPR, &quot;Territorial Scope&quot;, and the corresponding Recitals.<p>A big factor there is whether you are offering goods or services in the Union, irrespective of whether or not users have to pay. Mere accessibility from the Union isn&#x27;t enough to show you are offering things in the Union. What matters is whether or not the site &quot;envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union&quot;.<p>There are several things that can show you <i>are</i> envisaging offering in the Union. Having localized versions of your site in languages that are used in the Union but not in your own country, accepting payment in Euros or the national currencies of Union members, targeting Europeans with ads for your site, and many others.<p>If you aren&#x27;t doing those things, it gets more subjective. If your site should be of no interest to Europeans, and you don&#x27;t expect to make any money from whatever Europeans happen to somehow end up on it, it is simplest to do a geoip block on Europe. That should conclusively establish that you do <i>not</i> envisage offering services to people in the Union.')
