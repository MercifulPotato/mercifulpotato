We don&#x27;t know how entrenched the tech giants are over decades because we&#x27;ve never had anything like them before.<p>Realistically we have little control or have any clue on what&#x27;s going to happen a few years out in almost every aspect of life.<p>Look at Kodak (the photography company). They were around for over a 100 years, then digital photography came along to disrupt their market and they pretty much disappeared in a few months.<p>Kodak and Google aren&#x27;t that different as being a company that offers a service that tons of folks use(d). Kodak used to be &quot;the&quot; place to buy film and get photos developed.<p>I&#x27;m all for controlling your own email (even tho I&#x27;m guilty of not doing so), but I think even if you controlled your own email, you&#x27;ll still be victim of the company you&#x27;re using maybe going out of business in the future. I wish nothing but success for Fastmail or any other email service that lets you control your email, but if they go down then you&#x27;re in the same position as Google going down while using gmail.')
