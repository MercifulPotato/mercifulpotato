We were talking IP&#x2F;software here - so &#x27;poduction&#x27; here refers to software&#x2F;organization.  The WWII analogy&#x2F;link has to do with what&#x27;s possible if the country really tries - or has its back to the wall as it does now!<p>Even if I had been referring to manufactured hardware type goods - which I wasn&#x27;t - ramping local production would only replace&#x2F;reestablish what we lost to China over past decades.  It would not be a world net increase in production as we&#x27;d be buying less from China (they won&#x27;t make stuff if we&#x27;re not buying).<p>There&#x27;s many other reasons too for local production: jobs, better quality products, reskilling the workforce, strategic interests, etc.<p>I&#x27;d have thought that would have been obvious.')
