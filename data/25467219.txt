I don&#x27;t know how it is at other places but I sat on zoom 6-10 hours a day with new clients giving them architecture pre-sales guidance and I have never had a week of work burn me out so much. I had no energy to talk to anyone after work, including my partner. It turned into me dreading going to sleep because at 8am I had to sit on zoom and try to summon all of my charisma for 6-8 hour long calls a day. I lost all agency of my own schedule. Couldn&#x27;t pop off and go walk my dog in the park with my partner for 30 minutes without worrying about a client message I COULD NOT MISS (leadership).<p>I&#x27;m glad I tried it, it&#x27;s unfortunate I didn&#x27;t do well as it really knocked my confidence down but I&#x27;m happy to have found a supportive and good environment after that back in SWE. Lots of bad companies&#x2F;jobs, but there are some good ones.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the same story goes with tech sales at some places and that ship was just on fire and I didn&#x27;t realize it because I had no prior experience to look back on.<p>edit: And then the culture. The enterprise sales culture. I&#x27;m sorry but I never want to encounter it again. The amount of slack messages I got that were &quot;hey&quot; and waiting for me to respond there was wild. But the biggest was nobody at all cared about what I had going on. Just a worker drone to shutup and generate revenue no matter how close to burn out you get.')
