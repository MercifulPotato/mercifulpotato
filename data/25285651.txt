I understand there are many societal problems plaguing Japan, and other comments have eluded to Japan&#x27;s very low birthrates which are also indicative of these factors. It&#x27;s not an insidious assumption that this year&#x27;s isolation may have contributed to that phenomenon, especially for women, who generally require more socialisation than men.<p>There may not be much common ground here though. I don&#x27;t personally know anybody who uses terms like &quot;micro-pressures&quot; or &quot;problematic&quot;, all of the women of my mother&#x27;s age (including my parents) have been happily married for decades (and my mum&#x27;s main source of joy through this time has been getting out to see her many children and grandchildren as often as permitted), and I think most people in my family would be at least a little troubled if a young relative was proud of her increases in &quot;productivity&quot; in isolation.<p>We&#x27;re from different worlds!')
