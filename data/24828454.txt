Author Richard Muller wrote in 2011:<p><i>When we began our study, we felt that skeptics had raised legitimate issues, and we didn&#x27;t know what we&#x27;d find. Our results turned out to be close to those published by prior groups. We think that means that those groups had truly been very careful in their work, despite their inability to convince some skeptics of that. They managed to avoid bias in their data selection, homogenization and other corrections.</i><p>Its publication helped to separate actual scientific skeptics of anthropogenic global warming from dogmatic contrarians. Warming &quot;skeptic&quot; Anthony Watts, for example, said that he would accept whatever results came out of the BEST group, regardless of whether it confirmed his premise. After the BEST results confirmed mainstream climatology, he dismissed them as flawed.')
