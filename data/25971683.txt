People from different cultural and personal backgrounds have differing views on marriage. You think divorce should be difficult so that people take marriage seriously, but there are likely many others in your country that would vehemently disagree. Even the choice of words, &quot;sanctity&quot;, suggests to me that marriage would be better served as a purely religious ceremony. The government can then provide the legal aspects of today&#x27;s marriage in some kind of &quot;registered partnership&quot;, which would have none of the cultural baggage and be purely functional.')
