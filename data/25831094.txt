But while their goal was to stifle further regulation, they were in fact making a very good argument for decentralisation.<p>&gt; After all the very reason they are in this “difficult position” is their business decision to insist on providing centrally-controlled global social media platforms, trying to push the round peg of a myriad of cultures into a square hole of a single moderation policy.<p>I think if there was a more robust social media market instead of a Facebook&#x2F;Twitter duopoly, we would have seen at least _some_ platforms move to restrict things sooner, and maybe even a majority of platforms. That would have kept us from hitting a moment so fraught that the President ended up banned from all social media overnight.')
