Seems like a decent justification for extraordinary measures. Look at Barstow Community right now. 114% of inpatient beds occupied by COVID patients (as-of 12&#x2F;15). Imagine if LA hospitals looked like that. It would be apocalyptic.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;944379919&#x2F;new-data-reveal-which-hospitals-are-dangerously-full-is-yours" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;9443799...</a><p>As it is, even with that order having gone into effect, ICU capacity in LA county as-of the 11th is 2.7%.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kqed.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;11850757&#x2F;california-icu-capacity-see-your-countys-available-beds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kqed.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;11850757&#x2F;california-icu-capacity-s...</a><p>Plus, if you look at a map of what actually constitutes the City of LA proper, it&#x27;s a pretty tiny, but extremely high-density slice of the &#x27;Greater LA Area.&#x27;<p>If you really, really want to wander around DTLA, just tell the cops you&#x27;re walking to the grocery store. They&#x27;re not walking around arresting anyone who steps outside.<p>This is a tool that lets city authorities put the brakes on people doing egregiously stupid stuff. They&#x27;re not stopping people on the street like the gestapo for going about their business.<p>So, in short the parent comment seemed to express a knee-jerk reaction to a policy without offering an attempt at a reasoned assessment of the context and policy alternatives facing the City, as well as a pragmatic appreciation for the reality of enforcement on the ground. If they offered a viable alternative that seemed reasonable and well thought-out rather than just calling it an &quot;absurd big liberal govt policy&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t have downvoted. Doesn&#x27;t matter who runs the city, Repub or Dem, if when you call 911 there&#x27;s nowhere for the ambulance to take you.')
