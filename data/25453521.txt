Were those 2 other agreements before or after the one suggested and pressured by the law enforcement asset?  If those other agreements came later, there&#x27;s an argument to be made that they were also an indirect result of the actions of the pressure by the law enforcement asset.  I would guess there&#x27;s no precedent for an indirect entrapment defense, but I&#x27;d consider it a mitigating circumstance for sentencing purposes.<p>In any case, I agree it seems fundamentally against the rule of law to punish people for crimes they haven&#x27;t been convicted of.')
