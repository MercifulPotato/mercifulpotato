So for example in a tutorial you get presented with a problem and then the tutorial shows you how to solve it. I can&#x27;t find the article that talked about this on the internet anymore. &quot;problem based learning&quot; also doesn&#x27;t yield the thing I am looking for. Anyone knows what I am looking for ?')
