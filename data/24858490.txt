Usually I only have one project per language open at a time, but suppose I have two lisp projects (unrelated) and don&#x27;t want a cluttered up set of buffers that all look <i>almost</i> the same (by name, some getting a number appended if they were the second opened). I&#x27;ll launch a named daemon from inside the project&#x27;s root directory (<i>emacs --daemon=foo</i>, or with my <i>.zshrc</i> it&#x27;s just <i>emacsd foo</i>). Then I can access it using <i>emacsclient -s foo</i> (or <i>e -s foo</i> with my <i>.zshrc</i>).<p>If you really want it customized per project you could probably add some logic to your .emacs file or elsewhere that would run custom elisp per server, maybe check to see if the directory it was launched in has a .emacs file and evaluate that.')
