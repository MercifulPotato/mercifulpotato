They also send a scary email that they&#x27;ll block my account if I don&#x27;t proceed by certain date, and the actual date is just an empty html template placeholder.<p>I ask them via support for what they want. And they send automated response. I almost ignored it, like usual, because these notices usually just say thank you we accepted your requests and we&#x27;ll respond soon. I came back to it though, and at the end there&#x27;s a note that they will not respond to me unless I ask again.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m like wtf? It&#x27;s completely ridiculous, seeing so much stupid details and omissions in user experience in a row.<p>At some point I think large orgs just stop caring about customers, and just optimize some aggregate metrics, and this is the result.')
