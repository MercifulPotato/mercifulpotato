Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid, which is created in the body as a byproduct of breaking down purines. Purines are essentially broken down pieces of DNA.<p>This makes sense when you discover that beer can cause or worsen gout, because of the large amount of yeast present, but other fermented beverages such as wine do not.<p>Obviously there are other factors that go into gout, and other causes too, but the primary cause is eating DNA!')
