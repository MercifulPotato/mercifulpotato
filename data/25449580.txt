If you haven&#x27;t adjusted before they get rid of the legacy authentication you&#x27;ll have to manually log into your GitHub account and read up how to do it then or your API calls break.<p><i>If</i> you use HTTPS URLs to refer to your github repos (more likely on Windows) from Git then you need to get tokens by the deadline to make that work. Or, switch to using SSH URLs for your repositories if that seems easier.<p>If, like a great many GitHub users, neither applies, you don&#x27;t need to do anything, it will continue to work as before.<p>As a rule of thumb, think about your <i>GitHub</i> password. Anywhere you have to keep typing that in (other than the actual GitHub sign in page) or you&#x27;ve saved it to be re-used over and over, that will stop working. That was always a bad idea, and now it will stop working.')
