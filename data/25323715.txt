It makes the counterparty believe that you are collecting the paper trail to file a lawsuit. And <i>behaving</i> like you are preparing to file a lawsuit is much more effective than just claiming you will be filing a lawsuits.<p>I imagine that when presented with a choice of $88 payment or having to deal with a lawsuit, 100% of decision-makers will chose the former. And itâ€™s not about the lawsuit outcome. Even if some complete garbage is filed which has no chance of success, the burden it creates on the business is clearly much higher than $88.')
