I believe 60 Minutes is of low journalistic&#x2F;information quality (low value content&#x2F;investigation, controversies in recent years, only some corrections, partial retractions, removal of content without issuing a correction&#x2F;reason). It sounds like you have a different opinion - seemingly that an unknown number of episodes (14 or greater) over the course of over 2300 episodes and their actions&#x2F;inactions related to them does not tarnish their reputation. And that&#x27;s fine.')
