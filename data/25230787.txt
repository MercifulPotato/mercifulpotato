But a fundamental disagreement we have is your generous opinion of the 90 %ile user&#x27;s ability and desire to become an email expert. The loss of that battle was recognized in September 1993.<p>gmail didn&#x27;t relinquish its duty to educate users as it became popular; it became popular (in part) because it did things in a simpler way, that users didn&#x27;t have to &quot;learn&quot; how to use. The vast majority of folks do not care about such trivialities as following a thread. It requires forethought that they do not want to invest.<p>You have to meet users where they are at. One can wish for better users, sure. That&#x27;s not a winning strategy.<p>As well, I still maintain it&#x27;s unfair to pick on gmail. They had to follow Outlook. Outlook willfully <i>broke</i> threads for other MUAs by <i>not</i> including In-Reply-To headers. That was just evil. At least gmail generates In-Reply-To and References headers! Which Outlook drops. Outlook should be the bogeyman for your article, not gmail!')
