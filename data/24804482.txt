If that content is created by someone else, the website hosting it cannot be sued over it.</i><p>&gt; <i>Really, this is the simplest, most basic understanding of Section 230: it is about placing the liability for content online on whoever created that content, and not on whoever is hosting it. If you understand that one thing, you&#x27;ll understand most of the most important things about Section 230.</i><p>The way I understand it, these big sites aren&#x27;t simply hosting content, they are themselves creators through editorializing content and so should not enjoy a blanket immunity.')
