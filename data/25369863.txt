Nonfiction and poetry, English language.<p>Archive.org or any other public domain pdf source is great for pre1930 texts and I often end up buying them used in paper form.  (They are very cheap in Fair&#x2F;Acceptable condition...university paper libraries are shrinking...now is the time to buy them)<p>For PD texts, the author will often cite one or two other works in the body of the text.  If you liked the original work, you will probably like the in-body cited texts.  And you can quickly download a copy for free and see.  Spider along the recommendations.  This is great for “many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore”.<p>For favorite authors, there are usually interviews, or even whole books, available where the author describes works they like.  You would probably like the same works too.  Nowadays, you may be able to contact the (living) author directly for suggestions.  Works about literature, writers, genres are another source.  And bibliographies for more academic writing.  Sometimes someone has written an annotated bibliography on a subject if you want to be thorough.<p>Please don’t “optimize” reading for pleasure.  The heart chills at the word.<p>I have never, in my 60 years of reading, ever bought a book because it was on a bestseller list.  When I see that monicker on a book, I instinctively avoid it unless I have already discovered it in some other way.  It reminds me of junk food advertisements and they can be gamed.  I have never regretted following that policy.  Nor have I ever been interested in, nor would follow, the book recommendations of celebrities outside of their expertise.')
