Even with a &#x27;proper politician&#x27; such as Obama I&#x27;m not sure where the presidency ended and the Netflix deal began.<p>If everyone has the feeling that politics feels like a mix of a season of Survivor, the West Wing and the Apprentice is because that&#x27;s precisely what it has turned into.<p>I don&#x27;t think politicians should &#x27;speak their mind&#x27; to the public in unmediated fashion, and everyone would be better served if the focus was on successfully conducting the business of government rather than politics as entertainment.
