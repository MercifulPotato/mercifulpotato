Age or health conditions means that probably at least 100 million people in the country would be high risk&quot;<p>FWIW, 65% of the 9373 COVID19 deaths in Massachusetts occurred in Long Term Care homes [0].  This is a terrible thing that could have been prevented (or at least mitigated) and do I believe the Commonwealth has failed here.  However it does seem to indicate that LTC home occupants are generally more at risk than people not in a LTC home (which seems to make some sense, if you&#x27;re in a LTC home, it&#x27;s probably for a reason -- e.g. significant health issues&#x2F;frailty).  We can do better.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mass.gov&#x2F;doc&#x2F;covid-19-dashboard-october-10-2020&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mass.gov&#x2F;doc&#x2F;covid-19-dashboard-october-10-2020&#x2F;...</a>')
