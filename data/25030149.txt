When I bought my house it was incredibly challenging because the mortgage folk <i>required</i> the I had had 3 lines of continuous credit for more than a year. My income was not relevant, because that was a hard rule that they would not change.<p>I had to get a new line of credit and wait a year.<p>That did the following:<p><pre><code>  * The first credit check for the mortgage decreased my credit score, so interest rate on the new CC - that I *had* to use - was probably higher\n\n  * Getting the CC required a full credit check, which lowered my credit score again\n\n  * The new CC also lowered the average length of credit, which lowered my credit score *again*\n</code></pre>\nSo when I finally went to get loan preapproval a year later my credit score was lower than it had been the first time round, and that impacted my interest rate, down payment, and available loan size more than the fact that I was being paid more.<p>Sure you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to get a loan or credit. But if you don&#x27;t, you get utterly screwed.')
