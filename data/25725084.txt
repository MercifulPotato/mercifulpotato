(And not just “ask”, they can notify Twitter and inform them they will file criminal charges otherwise.)<p>If its lawful content, law enforcement at any level has no business getting involved, that’s kind of the point of the First Amendment.<p>But Twitter also isn’t (unless it has a contract in place obligating it to someone) required to carry any content, just because they aren’t legally prohibited from doing so. That’s <i>also</i> what the First Amendment is about.')
