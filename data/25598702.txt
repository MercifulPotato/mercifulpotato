And the <i>feeling</i> of being bad at it often causes people to drop it before getting past the initial pain, to the point where they are basically competent enough to actually enjoy it.<p>But getting past that initial time hurdle isn&#x27;t enough for you to be basically competent either - you might no longer be put off by the overwhelm of a new thing, but you might still be really really lousy at it.

Deconstruct the skill: Break down the parts and find the most important things to practice first. If you were learning to play a musical instrument, for example, knowing just a few chords gives you access to tons of songs.

Practice at least 20 hours.<p>Personally - I tend to get lost in over-analysis without even actually starting! Googling the thing isn&#x27;t step 1 for me, but all the steps - an end to itself. I&#x27;ve got to constantly monitor myself on that one.')
