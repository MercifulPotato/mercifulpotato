She picked a wrong battle. Google didn&#x27;t do anything wrong here. An internal review process is something that happens everywhere. It&#x27;s not always consistent, but it&#x27;s still important and valuable.<p>The sad part is that social media, like always, focus on her race rather than the details. Here&#x27;s an example tweet from Jeremy Howard, a known researcher (114K followers) from fast.ai:<p>&quot;Whatever else you think of Google, you gotta admit their crisis PR response is staggeringly incompetent.<p>The day they were found to have illegally spied on and terminated activists - they picked that day to fire their top AI ethics expert (a black woman).&quot;<p>He completely ignores the most important thing - why she got fired. He calls Google PR incompetent because they fired a famous black woman researcher after what happened. You see, people expect that Google would check their employees&#x27; skin color and gender before they decide to fire them. The content is not important.')
