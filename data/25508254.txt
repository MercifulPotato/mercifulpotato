Item(by='renewiltord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608655827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504920, text='It just so happens that there are lots of people like me feeling &quot;I want to see cat pics, talk about my Subaru, and about VR and ESP8266&quot;. There aren&#x27;t that many feeling &quot;I want to talk about fanged Jews forming shadowy cabals to suck the blood of gentle babies in the night&quot;. I&#x27;m okay with drawing a nice bright line in the sand, othering the latter, and having them go start communities where they rage that they can&#x27;t meet people of the opposite sex.<p>That sort of polarization is desired. I don&#x27;t want those guys inside my community. I want them outside. And if you&#x27;re like &quot;Okay, I think the Jews have fangs but they don&#x27;t suck baby blood at night&quot; then that&#x27;s not a degree of moderation I&#x27;m interested to have in my community. Out you go. Or out I go. Quite happy to self select out of this community of yours where people want to discuss that.<p>Remember, I&#x27;m here for cat pics, not all that other angry shit. I&#x27;m okay with the poles being &quot;normal people&quot; and &quot;weird angry dudes&quot;. Seems reasonable.')
