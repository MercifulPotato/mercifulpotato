Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[24966862], score=None, time=1604310411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965918, text='I&#x27;ve got a RPI with RetroPi, it... sorta works, but the cheap controllers aren&#x27;t very good, and there&#x27;s a noticeable input lag in games like Mario Bros. N64 games don&#x27;t get a decent framerate. Mind you this is with an RPI 2 or 3 so not the best hardware either.<p>I got a refurbished N64 as well, works as intended.')
