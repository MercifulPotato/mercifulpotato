Even on HN (among other platforms), which is one of the places where I often go to find good balanced viewpoints, when sharing anything remotely different from toeing the covid line (i.e. vaccines will save the day, everyone must get vaccinated, we must force people to wear masks, schools should be closed, the virus is causing the economic disaster, etc.) I see people get downvoted, censored, etc. to oblivion.  It&#x27;s nice to see that there are other folks out there that don&#x27;t exhibit the wild levels of fear and concern for what I consider to be much ado about nothing.')
