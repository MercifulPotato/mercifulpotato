They&#x27;re generally not archived well, UI is poor [...] Links get broken. [...] Attracts thousands of useless comments on popular issues; [...] They&#x27;re generally not archived well.<p>All this also applies to mailing lists.<p>&gt; Things get locked and deleted.<p>This deserves a longer reply. List archives get lost as well, if they were available at all. I do agree that deletion rights given to maintainers is a stupid idea, it&#x27;s very prone to misuse. But mailing lists also have that, maintainers can simply block e-mails reaching the list. At least with deletion people subscribed to new issues will always get them (in the case of GitHub).<p>&gt; Editing of old messages can easily get abused (probably the reasons HN removes your ability to edit old messages shortly after posting).<p>Forum config problem.<p>&gt; Mailing lists are much less prone to censorship<p>[citation required] Pretty sure they all have some moderation tools or it&#x27;d get totally out of hand either due to spam or by malicious actors.<p>&gt; never any sort of a summary for how the problem is resolved (if at all), the root cause of any issue, or why it won&#x27;t be fixed.<p>That&#x27;s not specific to the tech used for discussion.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s been a complete mess in practice.<p>But still less of a mess than mailing lists and that&#x27;s what matters.')
