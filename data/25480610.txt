It is as if an entire world is missing, and not just missing.<p>That’s not really fair. Someone who doesn’t like to dance? Entire world missing. Only speaks a single language? Doesn’t really appreciate or enjoy food? Worlds missing.<p>Doesn’t know a lot about music or art? Has poor emotional intelligence? Enjoys history but not literature?<p>Worlds missing.<p>Only socialized in a real way with people like them? World missing.<p>I can go on.
