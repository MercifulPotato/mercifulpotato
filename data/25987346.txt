I&#x27;d say subscription and in-app purchase are the only ways that building apps can be financially viable. A one-time $1 per user is just too little. But at $10+ you&#x27;ll be crushed by low cost competition. So I believe it is generally impossible to fund high quality apps with a one time purchase on the app store.<p>But what&#x27;s the solution against copycats? I believe we should hold app stores responsible for counterfeit goods, the same way we&#x27;d punish Walmart for selling Chinese fakes. But then again, we kind of stopped enforcing that rule, too, as you can see with Amazon.<p>So effectively, the US has become the wild west for counterfeit products and copyright infringing apps.. Except, of course, if you&#x27;re the movie industry.')
