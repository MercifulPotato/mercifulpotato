I&#x27;ve been very happy with that switch, my phone always makes it through a day of use and I haven&#x27;t ran into any of the quirks that I encountered on my Android devices on a regular basis.<p>I completely understand why you would prefer Android, but there are definitely people (including myself) that are happier with iPhones.')
