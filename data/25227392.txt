Item(by='progval', descendants=None, kids=[25227445], score=None, time=1606473176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227285, text='With a finite range, you can bisect directly by splitting in the middle of the range.<p>With infinite ranges, you can&#x27;t do that; so the usual way is to start with a small number and increase exponentially until you find a number that is too large; which is what is done here. When you got that number, it becomes the upper bound of a finite interval.<p>So that&#x27;s a two step process, which we can see here. The first 32 is in the exponential growth step (so is 64), and the second one is in the bisect step.<p>This will always happen exactly once (unless the expected result is 0) and for only the first pivot in the bisect, so it&#x27;s not that bad; but indeed, they could get rid of it by bisecting on [1&#x2F;n; n] instead of [0; n], as they already know that 1&#x2F;n (and numbers lower than 1&#x2F;n) isn&#x27;t a valid candidate from the first step.')
