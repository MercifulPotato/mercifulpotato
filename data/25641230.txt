These are technical terms and they have specific meanings, and the context was provided in the communications.<p>There was a genuine concern that people would not only consume the supply of mask product, but also that they&#x27;d think they were safe because they had a mask on, and then proceed to ignore other safety guidelines, thinking they were safe.<p>This in fact happens every day right now, but you know... it&#x27;s just pedantry.<p>Again, if you look at the CDC statements, they are consistent with this. They said it could reduce the risk of spreading or contracting the disease (and the specifics of how that might work were not as well understood at the time), but that it would NOT prevent either of those scenarios.<p>If you think about it, communicating that &quot;they don&#x27;t work at all&quot; but &quot;we have to keep a stockpile of them for the people at highest risk&quot; doesn&#x27;t make any sense. It&#x27;s not what happened.')
