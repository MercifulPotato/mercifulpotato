And I used to relish in the details of building distributed systems. No more. The reality is that monolith everyone loves to rage on about as the grand opposition to microservices is actually built on an operating system that abstracts away the details programmers before us had to deal with. And I imagine they too talked of the tradeoffs in design between design patterns. If an architecture and operating environment promotes distributed systems development then these problems go away and actually you find it&#x27;s a fundamentally better experience. Unix pipes were written in a single day and they became the thing that redefined how programs were written. Imagine all your favourite tools like ls, grep, ps we&#x27;re just one monolith. Holy heck no.<p>I think microservices are waiting for the distributed operating system and development environment that makes life as easy as Unix did with C programming and bash.<p>All these things in the article. You shouldn&#x27;t have to care about.')
