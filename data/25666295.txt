The groups did this in two different ways.<p>Childs’ team used<p><i>Carleman linearization</i><p>, an out-of-fashion mathematical technique from the 1930s, to transform nonlinear problems into an array of linear equations.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;It modeled any nonlinear problem as a Bose-Einstein condensate. This is a state of matter where interactions within an ultracold group of particles cause each individual particle to behave identically.
