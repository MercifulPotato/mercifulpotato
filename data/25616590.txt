They&#x27;re identical in terms of most tech stacks including rendering and the process is largely similar overall.<p>Games aren&#x27;t really similar to either since they&#x27;re raster based rather than pathtraced. The new RTX setups are bringing those worlds closer. However older rendering setups like REYES that Pixar used up until Finding Dory, are more similar to games raster pipelines. though that&#x27;s trivializing the differences.<p>A good intro to rendering is reading Raytracing in a Weekend (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raytracing.github.io&#x2F;books&#x2F;RayTracingInOneWeekend.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raytracing.github.io&#x2F;books&#x2F;RayTracingInOneWeekend.ht...</a>), and Matt Pharr&#x27;s PBRT book (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbr-book.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbr-book.org&#x2F;</a>)')
