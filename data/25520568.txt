Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608748569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25517358, text='&gt; My (IANAL) overall judgment from cursory reading is that it looks fine, but isnâ€™t 100% bombproof.<p>Nothing is &quot;100% bombproof&quot;.<p>They probably don&#x27;t want to clog up their articles of association with detailed limitations which might not be needed and which might get in the way of doing useful things in tune with their original purpose. Keeping the association true to its original purpose is really up to people and culture, not legal terms. I&#x27;m pretty sure lawyers (which I am not) would advise to keep details out unless they really need to be there, too many detailed rules can just add to legal uncertainty (doubts over exactly what they mean) and risk (lawsuits if someone thinks you&#x27;ve violated them, or if they were accidentally violated due to oversight or difficulty in understanding them, etc).')
