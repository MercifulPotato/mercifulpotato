Zero external components required.<p>Not only do you save the costs of using a crystal, you also save two pins - which was useful in the days of 8-pin microcontrollers like the ATtiny85.<p>As internal RC oscillator drift rates can be as much as 10% (and vary with temperature) they&#x27;re not precise enough to run a serial connection, let alone a USB connection. That&#x27;s why products like Arduino tend to go directly to using a proper crystal (which gives you a 0.01% drift rate for a few pennies).')
