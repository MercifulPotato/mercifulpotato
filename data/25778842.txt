I&#x27;m old enough that I&#x27;ve actually worked with tubes (final amps for 1970s Ham Radios needed too much power to sensibly use the solid-state transistors of the day.  Also Fender guitar amps were just turning solid-state in the late 70s&#x2F;early 80s, so used tube amps were cheaper.)<p>I would not have guessed that the first ones happened in 1889; Anyone have a favorite link for tube history?')
