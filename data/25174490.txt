I don&#x27;t blame you because I&#x27;ve been there.<p>You also might not be working for a properly distributed global team. Execs I work for are on the other side of the world.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before by the exec&#x27;s at my company tell me they have to attend meetings at weird times, so I should have to as well.<p>Not everyone at the moment has the luxury to just put their job on the line by telling their manager to go stick it. I for example am not in my native country an I rely on my job to support my visa. If I lose my job right now, my visa is potentially lost at a time where finding another job might not be very straight forwards and where my home country isn&#x27;t allowing citizens to return home yet.<p>It isn&#x27;t all bad, I think distributed work culture is evolving and adapting, it&#x27;s just right now there are certainly inconveniences for those pioneering it.')
