That makes it easier to find where the error is handled.<p>Exceptions are automatically passed up, so in practice are often caught by one catcher at the top level which is not very useful and has no idea what to do with the error.<p>It&#x27;s a very different mechanism. There is certainly more boilerplate with the Go approach.')
