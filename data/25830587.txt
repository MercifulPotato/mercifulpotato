By the time consitutional lawyers and politicans were to be done arguying it otherwise thru regular channles - we would have a full blown Monarchy installed in this country, and completely lawfully should I add. I think majority of people have absolutely no idea how close we got to overturning US political system. And I dont believe Trump or his family were not on it, but it will take years to get to the bottom of it.')
