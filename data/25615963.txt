Make the roads painful&#x2F;expensive enough and the one car still using them will have a very quick journey.  Conversely, filling up the bike lakes with lots of bikes will increase bike trip times.  I prefer to measure the efficiency of a road by the number of people it carries across all types of vehicles.  Bus lanes over bicycle lanes imho as buses can more more people per hour down a single lane than anything else.')
