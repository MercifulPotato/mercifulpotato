(To clarify, this is for companies looking to produce webhook events for their customers to consume). From my experience working on the Stripe webhook system as an engineer, it takes a considerable amount of engineering resources to offer a good experience and every startup that needs one today is building it in house. Moreover, companies need similar features across the board such as logs, retries, analytics, rate limiting, idempotency, security signatures, etc. Would love feedback if anyone here has seen the need for such a product or would like to be beta customers!')
