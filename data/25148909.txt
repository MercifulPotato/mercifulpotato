Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605789946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148587, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve hit similar issues to those mentioned in the article and it absolutely infuriates me when I have to jump through hoops (or worse, reduce the readability of my code) to push well thought out code that communicates intent, only to fall foul of a robot that doesn&#x27;t understand nuance.<p>I don&#x27;t use Ruby but I faced similar issues with Rust&#x27;s clippy and rustfmt. But I still think it&#x27;s better than the alternative.<p>Every time I&#x27;m tempted to override one of these links&#x2F;formats because I feel like <i>my</i> way is better I like to remind myself that it&#x27;s going to set a precedent for the other devs on the project, and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before one of us does something that the others don&#x27;t like and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before we return to pointless arguing about coding style and inconsistent code formatting.<p>&gt;Consistency is merely a tool, the goal should be readability&#x2F;maintainability.<p>That&#x27;s the thing though: consistency is somewhat objective (and enforceable), readability and maintainability not so much.<p>TFA is a good example of this: they argue that explicitly returning &quot;nil&quot; is more readable and better communicates intent but I suspect (once again, not being a Ruby coder myself) that other experienced Rubyists could respond that everybody knows that a method finishing without an explicit value ends up returning nil, and that adding explicit code to do is is just clutter and distracts from the important things.')
