First of all many people will do the bulk of their charging at home, so paying for a charge will be mostly limited to long distance road trips, etc. It&#x27;s not something you necessarily need to do at all during your regular commute or running errands around town.<p>Second, even with a fast DC charger it still takes 20-60 minutes to get a useful amount of charge. That&#x27;s a lot longer than you need to run into a convenient store to buy a coffee or whatever. It makes more sense to put these chargers where people will naturally be parked longer: office buildings, restaurants, highway service plazas, etc.')
