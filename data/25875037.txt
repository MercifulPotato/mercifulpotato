Item(by='fy20', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611342749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874170, text='The city can provide rights to install EV chargers on the street to private companies for free, in exchange for a share of the revenues. In Europe almost all EV chargers are run by companies vs governments - which they must see as a for-profit investment, as they are for-profit companies -, so if it works here, there&#x27;s no reason why it can&#x27;t work there too. The revenue the city receives from EV charging can be used to improve public transportation, so everybody wins.<p>Don&#x27;t forget EVs are beneficial for everyone in terms of less pollution, so cities should be encouraging residents to purchase EVs over ICE with small incentives (in my city you don&#x27;t need to pay for street parking).')
