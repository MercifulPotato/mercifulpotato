Now I have 2 things.  Which one is the &#x27;thing&#x27;?  Clearly both are and are not.<p>It is a weird quirk of some logic items.  They can be both true and false at the same time.  Such as things &#x27;this statement is false&#x27; which is both true&#x2F;false at the same time.  Is one such example of that.  However, sometimes it is clear our test is lacking.  With the &#x27;ship&#x27; you could say as soon as you switched out anything it was no longer the original thing.  What happened to the original thing?  Well it went to the same place as when I created it.  Which creates its own set of questions.')
