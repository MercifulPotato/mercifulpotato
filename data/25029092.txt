Even holding political views will influence what you tell others, and who you vote for or if you choose not to vote. All that is acting politically, since you&#x27;re participating in the activities associated with the governance of a country or other area, especially the debate or conflict among individuals or parties having or hoping to achieve power.<p>So I take it being apolitical in a democracy is akin to saying you support the majority who voted.<p>That&#x27;s because you can&#x27;t act without regards to politics, you are forced to abide by the political rules and laws, and even your choice to not vote is a choice for the majority who voted.<p>So like, the most apolitical thing you could do would be never talk politics, never let any of your value judgment known to others about any topic, and randomly cast a vote at every elections.')
