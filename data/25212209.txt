And knowing you contributed to those deaths? And where are you going to go? Switch industries in the middle of this? Because if you stay in healthcare, walking out of your single facility doesn&#x27;t even get you away from the pandemic. I have friends burning out in healthcare, being paid terribly, but sticking it out because it&#x27;s a fucking pandemic and people are dying. Try some empathy.<p>It&#x27;s much more standard for people to just walk away when the moral stakes are low, like they tend to be in tech. If someone can&#x27;t log into HN because you walked out, who cares? But just because it&#x27;s money-or-walk in our industry doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s how it is for others.')
