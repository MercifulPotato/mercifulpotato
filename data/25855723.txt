And the new positions of h and l keep them in the correct relative position to indicate left and right, but easier to use. The right index finger is already on h and the pinky needs to move up one key for l. And up&#x2F;down is now the left hand, with right&#x2F;left being on the right hand.<p>I&#x27;ve found emacs to be similarly more sensible and comfortable, using default key bindings, with Dvorak than Qwerty.')
