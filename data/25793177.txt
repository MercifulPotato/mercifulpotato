It is not just Google News, but also Google Search. People will often type in breaking news stories into Google Search to get information.<p>It does not apply to products like Google Mail and Google Maps since they aren&#x27;t platforms to get eyeballs onto content written for Rupert Murdoch.<p>The suggested alternative is that instead of serving up Google Search in Australia (i.e. the thing produced by crawling websites), they might serve up an entirely opt-in service. Think of sites like the old dmoz.org. It will suck about as much as it sounds like it will suck. If they do that, I would expect Australian web search traffic to go mostly to the new Google Services Directory and spread gradually to Bing and Duck Duck Go and Yahoo. Microsoft and Yahoo will probably actively strive to avoid becoming the universal default, because as long as they aren&#x27;t big enough they won&#x27;t attract the burdens of this law.')
