It shouldn&#x27;t be that you have to learn how to take apart a type writer before you can write a book, the technology doesn&#x27;t require it.<p>A clear road beyond will also take down the walls around the silos since effort to control the user would come at a price (force them off the platform(s) faster)<p>We could perhaps start by separating the API from presentation? Have A scalable chunk of FOSS at first hosted by a megacorp but easily moved some place else and A presentation platform where people build their gui that is as easily moved.<p>(Just thinking out loud, didn&#x27;t put much thought in it.)<p>edit: your own domain should be an obvious ingredient. Which seems to suggest that domains should be free?')
