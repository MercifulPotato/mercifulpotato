Shell scripts you curl into bash are not. It is generally MUCH easier to compromise a website and insert your own malicious script than it is to compromise a developer&#x27;s secret key, which is usually stored much more securely.<p>Put it like this: if an attacker compromised Rust&#x27;s website and put in their own malicious Rust installer, macOS and Windows would both show a very scary warning that&#x27;s like &quot;This is unsigned! Don&#x27;t run this!&quot; (macOS would even refuse to run it unless you did the right-click to open trick). A Linux package manager would refuse to install such a package outright, unless you --forced it. Not so with curl-to-bash, it would just silently compromise your computer.<p>Basically, if you believe that code signing is a good thing for security (and I think we all do), curl-to-bash is awful security practice, and you should manually review the script.')
