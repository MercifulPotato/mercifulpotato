Play is just play. &#x27;Creative output&#x27; is still &#x27;work&#x27;, just with a hint (maybe 1%) of creative input.<p><i>Those with the most ostensibly aspirational jobs are grinding!</i><p>Does anyone think Lady Gaga (or Bach), any tech development, any real research, making Star Wars, putting on a Broadway Musical isn&#x27;t &#x27;work&#x27;?<p>These things require immense work, stress toil in all sorts of ways by all sorts of people - most of whom had to &#x27;work&#x2F;grind&#x27; for 20 years in school in order to develop the applied intelligence, skills, knowledge, fortitude, maturity to be able to even work in aspirational&#x2F;creative work. And then they still depend on the rest of us to make their food, cars, homes, and &#x27;stuff&#x27;.<p>Even our <i>current</i> , relatively modern systems and knowledge requires work to simply maintain, let alone improve.<p>They are not magically self-sustaining, even if they are somewhat more intelligent and powerful.<p>If we &#x27;do what we want&#x27; we will be materially poorer than aboriginals, poorer than neolithic peoples ... frankly we&#x27;ll starve to death as even they had to grind it out just to make do.<p>There is no way out. Life requires a modicum of effort, point blank. Maybe ... maybe ... we can offers some the ability to &#x27;opt mostly out&#x27; but even then I feel we&#x27;ll be doing people a disservice, for how could a unsocialized man-child, still yet illiterate and completely untutored at age 18 from not having made the effort, even realize what he&#x27;ll have missed out on?<p>We can make a better world but &#x27;some effort&#x27; will be a perennial requirement. This seems to be a metaphysical constraint.')
