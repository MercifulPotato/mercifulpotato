Also, good online documentation in a language is important imo. I still like the original Java tutorial from Sun&#x2F;Oracle: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;</a><p>I know a teenager who has taught himself Java development from YouTube videos, which YouTube suggested to him.<p>I think it is important to have a project and be dedicated to solve it. What is it you want to do?<p>To give an example of an early issue we encountered: I wanted to write a simple program with my son, that asks for your date of birth and computes the number of days since your birth. But dates were not a subject of our python games programming book, so we had to read the online API documentation to figure out how to parse dates and compute time differences. Not too hard, but I think it requires dedication.<p>In a similar way, I think books or tutorials can never cover all sorts of issues one might encounter, so a lot of patience and dedication is needed to eventually master the coding.<p>For kids, I liked Micro:Bit, and if you are German, I would recommend the &quot;Jugendwettbewerb Informatik&quot; and accompanying  tutorials.')
