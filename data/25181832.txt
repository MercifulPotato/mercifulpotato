The national healthcare system was &quot;free&quot;, but a surgery might still cost a couple hundred in gifts to the surgeon, anesthesiologist, etc.  A couple bucks to the nurses that check in on you during your stay.<p>Good luck getting your bedding changed regularly if you&#x27;re in a coma and don&#x27;t have a family member around to dispense tips in your behalf.<p>Sample size of 1 is pretty small.
