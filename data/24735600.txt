I once had the revenooers send me a dunning letter about non-payment of taxes. I sent them a copy of my cancelled check. Problem solved.<p>I also had an electronic payment made for $700 to the utility company. They said they never got it, but my account was debited. They said take it up with your bank, the bank said take it up with the utility company. After quite a bit of wrangling, I finally demanded to the bank manager that the debit be labelled as &quot;fraudulent&quot; and it be clawed back.<p>Wonder of wonders, this caused the utility company to magically find the money.<p>Now I send them paper checks. I also pay my credit card with paper checks, as one time they moved the decimal point over two places (!), and the cancelled check saved me a *\nlot* of hassle.')
