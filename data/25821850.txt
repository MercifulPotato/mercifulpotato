Item(by='nojvek', descendants=None, kids=[25824662], score=None, time=1610978510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817795, text='&gt; Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to measure anyone else&#x27;s effectiveness. They are just a continuation of the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle school, high school, and maybe even your college&#x2F;university days.<p>This has a bit of truth. In my experience climbing up the ladder is so disconnected from actual reality. There’s quite a bit of a buddy buddy &#x2F; quid pro quo system that goes on when it comes to promos.<p>There are people who do the actual work and take it 99%, and others who stitch the last 1% and take credit for all of it. Our Industry loves rewarding for features over things that customers actually care about. I’ve seen many feature promos in my life. One year later we’d have to kill the whole feature because it’s not worth the maintenance cost.<p>One of my managers believed folks who write python and JS are not real programmers, C and go programmers faced hard problems therefore they are more real. There was also the unconscious bias that women can’t lead projects so opportunities weren’t given to them. Over time women kept leaving. Over time really stellar frontend engineers kept on leaving.<p>It also baffles me how much energy is spent on hiring people, vs mentoring and fostering them so they grow and are promoted.')
