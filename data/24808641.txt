A tiling window manager, an Emacs, and a few terminals will never break, sure.</i><p>Don&#x27;t be so optimistic ;). As of recently, Emacs started freezing regularly for 10+ seconds when editing Rust code while rust-analyzer is used as an LSP plugin. First, I thought it was rust-analyzer, but I did some tracing and all time was spent in FreeType functions during the hangs (probably something going rogue, triggering a lot of font rendering). Lo and behold, use terminal Emacs (no X11) and the problem is gone.<p>But since life was busy, I didn&#x27;t have the time to debug it further and installed CLion, which works great.')
