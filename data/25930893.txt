Though I&#x27;m not sure that Economics has much to say about it.<p>As for whether it&#x27;s destructive, I used to strongly believe so.<p>Now I believe that, as long as there is unemployment in the system (and my understanding is economics tells us that there will ALWAYS be unemployment), the lack of an adequate wage floor will <i>always</i> result in a race to the bottom and a drag on wages.<p>In the minimum-wage-adjacent pay rates, you might have double the potential workers than the number of workers actually hired. There is therefore zero incentive to offer additional pay for additional productivity at that wage tier, because the employees can simply be replaced (yes, at some fixed cost).')
