You don&#x27;t need to understand the C&#x2F;libc internals to be able to operate MySQL (you do need to know it&#x27;s quirks though).  With a JVM application, you&#x27;re going to need to understand the application level configs, think of something like spark, and if you&#x27;re doing anything with large amounts of data or high RPS, you&#x27;re also going to need to understand the JVM internals.  The closest analog might be needing to understand the libc allocator for certain usage patterns, and that happens, but it&#x27;s far more rare than someone needing to tune garbage collection algorithms and parameters.  JVM tuning is just a reality of operating in the java ecosystem.')
