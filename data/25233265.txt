Proper compliance with PPE is sufficient protection. If anyone shows signs&#x2F;symptoms or has been in direct contact gets tested. During that test they are quarantined. That&#x27;s what makes this so hard on our health care system is the drop in staffing levels due to necessary quarantine while waiting for results. Testing everyone would put undo load on the labs and provide little return outside of a sense of security. The a false sense of security being negative can lead to issues with compliance. Treat all patients and coworkers the same with PPE is the underlying principle to provide the best protection.')
