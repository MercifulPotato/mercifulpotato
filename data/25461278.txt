This is what happens when you combine weak knowledge of science with a credulous mind (you think everything is a conspiracy theory invented by <i>group of people you dislike</i>).<p>Maybe &quot;processed food&quot; (whatever that means, according to the article it is everything not produced in an &quot;artisinal restaurant&quot;) is good, maybe it is bad but it is slightly hard to tell given that lots of people in the US are obese: which is a function of greed and laziness, not whether food is &quot;processed&quot; or not.<p>You can lose weight drinking nothing but soda. You can can lose weight eating nothing but chocolate. I have done it (and no, Coca-Cola didn&#x27;t pay me). As you say, the issue of obesity is a fairly simple one of: how much energy do you use and how much energy do you put in.<p>What is actually remarkable to me is how many people are obese given the high basal metabolic rate of humans (at my normal weight, it was remarkably hard and time-consuming to cram enough calories in to gain weight consistently). I have gained and lost 20-40% of my bodyweight multiple times, it isn&#x27;t hard, it isn&#x27;t about &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; foods (the &quot;you never see a skinny person drinking a diet soda&quot; phenomenom, every obese person I have ever met thought this way), and  doesn&#x27;t look at what their actual calories-in&#x2F;calories-out is (in my experience, most people regard tracking calories this as a form of mental illness...I live somewhere that has life expectancy under 70 because of obesity...so, go figure). This isn&#x27;t to say micronutrients aren&#x27;t important, they clearly are...you don&#x27;t have enough iron, you are going to feel very bad...but the issue for most countries in the West is excessive calorie consumption, and a failure to speak about this bluntly with people (pretty much all my older relatives have health issues caused by weight, it is frustrating when a doctor tries to be kind first rather than help them stay alive).')
