Item(by='cmsefton', descendants=None, kids=[25351343], score=None, time=1607435339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344407, text='In Sheldrake&#x27;s book, Engtangled Life, if I remember correctly, he suggests that it may be better not to think of it as trees communicating, but rather mycorrhizal networks passing on the information to other trees because it&#x27;s in their interest to do so (the article posted alludes to this). It&#x27;s similar to how mycorrhizal networks will transfer chemicals and nutrients between trees, because it&#x27;s to their benefit to keep as many trees alive as possible.<p>One thing I do remember that was quite fascinating, is that the exchange of nutrients and chemicals is almost like a trading network: mycorrhizal fungi will send stuff it produces that trees need to places where the reward (payment) will be highest. An example would be, if the mycorrhizal fungi has phosphorous to &quot;trade&quot; for carbon, if there is a tree that will &quot;pay&quot; less (perhaps because it doesn&#x27;t need the phosphorous, or it needs carbon for itself), the mycorrhizal fungi would rather divert that phosphorus to another tree that would give a greater return of carbon.<p>There&#x27;s a description of this &quot;trading network&quot; here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6584331&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6584331&#x2F;</a><p>Apologies if I described it wrong, I read the book a while ago.')
