Spreading peak usage out.  For example, today I get a discount on my electric because my power company has the option to turn my AC off for X time during hot days to lower the grid&#x27;s peak load. The tech is already here and a lot of EV charging will fit well into that model, especially commuters that don&#x27;t need their whole range every day. Plenty of people would opt in to &quot;at least one full charge every 3 days&quot; type of plans.')
