My FR645 isn&#x27;t particularly accurate (GPS or HR) and their software is crap (and requires an internet connection to do basic things on the watch like update watch face and other basic settings).  I had an older Edge 500 (bike computer) years ago and bug reports that caused crashes and data loss went unfixed for years.<p>Sadly, Garmin is still better than many of the alternatives.  But, Wahoo recently got into the watch game (and their bicycle computers drink Garmin&#x27;s milkshake) and I suspect they&#x27;ll soon be on par or ahead in that market segment.')
