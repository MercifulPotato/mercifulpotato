Staying true to the original spirit of FOSS and sharing, means that we have to find ways to support independent FOSS business.<p>The loudest arguments I hear at forcing the FOSS definition to remain static and blind to revenue, is from big tech companies or wealthy people being paid by big tech companies, because it benefits them. People working for a small FOSS companies understand the realities of competing in today&#x27;s tech environment, and understand that revenue-sharing far from stifling FOSS, will allow it to flourish properly.')
