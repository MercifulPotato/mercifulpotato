These companies don’t get the same work done with less labour, like utility suppliers. Instead, they pay workers less, and use complex business structures and confidentiality agreements to protect the client from the consequences (unions, lawsuits and PR damage). This isn’t capitalism realising positive-sum efficiencies; it’s just taking resources from workers and giving them to business owners.')
