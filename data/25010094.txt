TSMC is killing it. Nvidia is using Samsung to fab the RTX 3xxx chips, and there&#x27;s some rumblings that low yields are a reason why those are in such short supply (not to mention, whenever Samsung releases a new phone only some regions get the Exynos chips, because historically they couldn&#x27;t produce enough of them; Samsung used to have a pretty cool relationship with Qualcomm whereby Snapdragons were fabbed with Samsung, but more recently, they&#x27;ve moved to TSMC).<p>On the high performance side, everyone is moving to TSMC. If Samsung and Intel&#x27;s fabs continue to exhibit issues at these smaller process node sizes, the monoculture is only going to get worse. We need Intel to get their act together, not just because it pushes better design innovation from AMD and Nvidia (not that they need it right now), but because their fabs are a critical, independent part of the software supply chain. They&#x27;re the last western company with any form of high yield fabrication on high performance chips. At this point, we shouldn&#x27;t just be worried about Intel&#x27;s bottom line; we need to start being legitimately worried about national security (both in tactile cyber-warfare terms, and also more nebulous economic terms with regard to western manufacturing).')
