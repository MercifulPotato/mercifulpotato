For years it&#x27;s been completely hegemonic in the ClojureScript space and it&#x27;s definitely not going anywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve done React+Redux and it was a much worse experience than Reagent, which deliberately builds on Clojure&#x27;s native immutability-friendly state management solution (atoms) and is based entirely around functions.')
