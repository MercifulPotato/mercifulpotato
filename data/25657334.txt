That&#x27;s a good security model.<p>There&#x27;s no particular reason that that has to be two <i>phones</i> though - could be desktop, wifi tablet etc.. That limitation is a result of a &#x27;product&#x27; decision where your identity on WhatsApp is a mobile phone number. That decision was a big part of what allowed WhatsApp to scale quickly (people didn&#x27;t need to create an account, just install the app and start messaging people whose numbers they had).')
