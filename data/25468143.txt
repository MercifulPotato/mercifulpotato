I’m an artist &amp; designer.<p>The biggest issue for me is being a parent. Being a parent puts a huge damper on my time, as well as my capacity for immersion and risk. My work necessitates being freelance in a fiercely competitive environment, there are no paid positions in my niche. It’s essential to have continuous periods of total absorption in order to perform at a high level. It is very hard to keep within 40 hours per week.<p>All of this is sharply at odds with my responsibilities as a parent. Yet I feel deeply committed to being a responsible parent.<p>But if that were true, I would&#x27;ve quit already. This inconsistency has created an unresolvable split internally, whereby I fall short at my standards of parenting, yet also at work. Worse, I increasingly hold back at seizing prized opportunities in my career, because I worry about the effect on my family. Such opportunities keep being offered, although fewer every year.<p>I realize I&#x27;m in a terminal spin. Yet everyone I know, even the two therapists I&#x27;ve seen, encourage me to commit to chasing this dream, albeit in a responsible way.<p>I’ve tried diluting what do into very commercial service, ie working for advertising agencies. I found decent clients, yet felt like shit about it. The working conditions are only marginally improved, but the output is massively less unrewarding.<p>What I’ve learned:<p>- A drastic change to another field would likely have been better strategy over the long haul, than a middling compromise.<p>- Competition and proximate opportunity keep you trapped in the game. It’s very hard to disengage from a game you feel involved in, either as player or observer. Other people’s ambitions are infectious, and you model their moves.<p>- When chasing a risky dream, the introduction of a dependent hugely decreases appetite for risk. You need to have reached a relatively comfortable position, above the messy middle, in order to keep playing.<p>If I was childless, if it was only my welfare on the line, there is no question as to what I would do. I would chase the dream relentlessly and recklessly.<p>The fact is, it was time to let go of it, years ago. I&#x27;m just amazed at my own and society&#x27;s illusions of romantic perseverance when it comes to following your passions.')
