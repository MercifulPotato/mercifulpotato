YT should take them down, but they haven&#x27;t (yet).<p>Something I could do about it is personally is stop using YT until they do. I&#x27;ve seen other instances of the negatives of YT that are making me think this is what it must come to (i.e. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24571038" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24571038</a>).<p>The ironic thing is that I&#x27;m tempted not to ban YT because there&#x27;s so much content that I like (pbs spacetime, veritasium, etc). However this type of reasoning is how atrocities in the past have been allowed to happen. Essentially youtube is Google&#x27;s real monopoly and this is just another example of the problem of monopolies.<p>So I&#x27;m going to block myself from youtube (since habit is too hard to break, I&#x27;ll do it by adding these lines to &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts)<p>127.0.0.1 youtube.com<p>127.0.0.1 www.youtube.com<p>Could someone please post here when these channels are deleted?')
