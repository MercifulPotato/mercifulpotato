After that it’ll be very hard to feel the magic again.<p>I played a small one Ashen Empires because it had an amazing local community. Then WOW because it was so well made, everyone was playing it and I loved blizzard. After a few years of both, any MMO hasn’t been able to keep me interested for more than a few days.')
