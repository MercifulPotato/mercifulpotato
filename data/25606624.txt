But they are. They attain positions of power.<p>Through reflection you may come to realize they are  among people you consider friends or family.<p>You can’t “fix” them, but you can learn how to handle or avoid them.<p>Sometimes, if a person looks inward and into their past they will find a pattern of people who have taken advantage of them.<p>If that’s the case there may be work to do, like:<p>- confront these past abuses<p>- recognize those that are ongoing and how to navigate them<p>- build and practice skills in recognizing and dealing with new toxic people going forward<p>Life is hard and we get taught things unevenly.<p>It is not a wrong to be ignorant of an important life skill.<p>And even when you have read all of the evidence and logic needed to recognize and change your circumstances, some wait far too long, or never do.<p>I do not blame folks in these positions, my heart goes out to them. Because I have been there.<p>edit:<p>I did not expect this chain to get the attention it did.  And I had to look up victim blaming, because it sounds awful and I needed to understand if I got this wrong. I make mistakes.<p>Here&#x27;s the wikipedia article on Victim Blaming for those who want to learn more about what this phrase means: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Victim_blaming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Victim_blaming</a><p>I&#x27;m not going to try and further explain myself. If folks do not like this feedback, they may leave it. I will accept that some of my advice may be problematic. I&#x27;m not a therapist and I crafted these posts in the same speed and style I comment on technology platforms.<p>This is honestly not a subject I want to go into greater detail about today. I hope the empathy behind my words shows through and wish anyone in any toxic situation at home or work the best.')
