Take the time to manually skim each job posting on high-quality job lists, like the HN who&#x27;s hiring. As a generalist I tend to be a good fit for smaller teams that have diverse problems and individuals I can connect with. Those individuals usually make more open ended job postings that don&#x27;t sift well through most filters. Additionally, you&#x27;ll get a better sense of where the job market as a whole is at.<p>2) Make extra effort in your initial outreach to a few positions. Surprisingly &quot;cover letters&quot; are still effective if they&#x27;re presented in the right way and through the right channels. A form cover letter may be ignored, but a freshly written pitch for a particular job listing can stand out.<p>3) Don&#x27;t copy-paste until you have your pitch figured out. If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll find yourself rephrasing it slightly each time you write an initial outreach, and eventually you&#x27;ll find the common elements that make their way into each.
