I spent a lot of money downtown. Expensive dinners, evenings at the bar, or show&#x2F;concert&#x2F;sports&#x2F;event, bought all my clothes, electronics, gifts, office supplies, dentist, some food shopping, haircut, insurance, doctor, RMT, physio, acupuncture. I did as many errands downtown as possible.<p>Now that I&#x27;m working from home due to the virus I haven&#x27;t been back. When the office opens I won&#x27;t go back. If they force me I&#x27;ll find a new job where I can work remote. Now I spend all my money where I live.')
