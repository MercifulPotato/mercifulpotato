Also, the cost of the serverless execution would be great to know (don&#x27;t forget those API Gateway fees or other such &quot;hidden&quot; costs).<p>The tech empower benchmarks[0] w&#x2F; a single DB request and NodeJS show some pretty good results (10k-100k) and since the max was 2.5k. I think Node isn&#x27;t a particularly performance conscious choice, though it does async well and that should be pretty common knowledge these days (that doing async well is a good idea for high load).<p>Also normally you&#x27;d use Cloudflare workers to serve some data very close to customers -- was that the use case here? or was it more just that the workers were a good fit for deployment ease? There&#x27;s also the question of essentially subsidies -- I hear that cloudflare worker ingress (egress?) traffic is free right now?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techempower.com&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;#section=data-r19&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=db" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techempower.com&#x2F;benchmarks&#x2F;#section=data-r19&amp;hw=...</a>')
