I moved to a new country for work and didn&#x27;t know anyone or speak the language well at that point. This was before the internet enabled instant communication around the world, and my new timezone was on the opposite side of the planet from my home country, so I couldn&#x27;t make phone calls to family without making a plan.<p>In any case, for the first month or so before I started my job, I was totally alone in my apartment and didn&#x27;t have any conversations in my native language (English) the whole time. I began to have imaginary conversations with loved ones, both in dreams and in waking life, very much like the kind you describe.<p>I am one who has always been introverted and ok being alone, but this was an extremely disorienting experience. I coped by keeping a journal. The upside was that I eventually developed an ability to not feel lonely even while alone for long periods.')
