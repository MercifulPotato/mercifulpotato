I have a friend that is an expert when it comes to music, and I will ask him more about this. He did give me some advice, based on Logic&#x27;s app ;) I will dig deeper into this.<p>&gt; what I longed for years ago was an easy way to; (non destructive) editing on low quality copies of source material, and using their HQ originals for rendering.<p>Hehe, that&#x27;s what I do now, behind the scenes ;) It took me quite a while to develop, but I&#x27;m quite happy with the results :P<p>&gt; the use of VST plugins for the audio part<p>This is a highly complex issue, but I will dig deeper into it. I am pretty happy with how I handle the audio now (that doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t use an improvement :D), and depending on what people will want, I can slowly implement them as well ;)<p>&gt;  A while ago i read about software to cut video files without rerendering &#x2F; converting(dunno if thats common, or useful, but sounds interesting)<p>It is possible, I did a few tests, but not really worth it. In other words, I&#x27;m not sure of a scenario when that would truly make sense.')
