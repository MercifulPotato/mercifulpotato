It&#x27;s a natural way to get in a stretch. So it&#x27;s the better way to sit if you find yourself squirming and uncomfortable. All you need to do desk work on the floor is a way to put the screen at a comfortable height, and a lap desk - a large one with padding will rest easily in many configurations. If you need back support there are floor chairs; I have one and use it sometimes, but not always.')
