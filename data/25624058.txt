So if you doing normal &#x27;mvp&#x27; style of development where you ship intermediaries you should have some signal whether something works in at least six months, ideally sooner. Sometimes this means you might reconsider or even reverse a decision or apply what you learned to a new problem but mostly this just builds confidence and trust in the team that the decision making process is generally &#x27;good enough&#x27;.<p>The TTLs are tracked in the decision log which is reviewed in project retrospectives.  You can schedule these in a slot a week you hold open for presentations, document reviews, demos, wheel of misfortunes (debugging simulated production problems if on-call), production reviews, etc.')
