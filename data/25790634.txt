There are three reasons to use command line and none of them has anything to do with being easier:<p>1. It&#x27;s faster. You can(and will after some time) remember hundreds of different commands. That means that to make computer do something, you just need to type. Typing is usually way faster than clicking in GUI, especially for non-trivial tasks, which require moving through several layers of GUI.<p>2. It&#x27;s scriptable. I can automate pretty much anything invokable from command line through.<p>3. It&#x27;s gluable. I can connect output of the program to any workflow I imagine.<p>All of those are usually strictly worse in GUI. Of course, GUI has it&#x27;s uses(analysing data is usually easier in graphical environment) and there is nothing wrong with your personal preference. I object solely to your qualification of CLI being worse just because of your own taste.')
