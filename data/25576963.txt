Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609288835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25567829, text='<i>Ethics must be objective&#x2F;universal</i><p>That&#x27;s a bold statement without accepted axioms &amp; subsequent proofs to build off of &amp; establish the universality of ethics. There has never been universal agreement on any set of ethics. Genocide is itself an excellent example of that: It&#x27;s not hard to find examples where those participating in the genocide believed their actions to be perfectly acceptable.<p>If you watch children for any length of time, you&#x27;ll see that &quot;universal ethics&quot; are not readily apparent to them either. Children have to be taught not to hit people, that they can&#x27;t take another child&#x27;s toy (stealing) just because they want it, that lying isn&#x27;t acceptable, etc. Plenty of people never learn those lessons, and have no problem violating them when the consequences can be avoided (and even many times when they can&#x27;t)<p>Your other examples of what is right &amp; wrong are also not universally agreed upon. It&#x27;s not hard to find examples of any of those actions where people justify their actions as acceptable.<p>This is without even getting into the gray areas: Is it wrong to kill in self defense? Is it right to honestly tell your neighbor the story that his wife is cheating on him if he&#x27;d previously said &quot;I&#x27;d kill my wife if she ever cheated on me&quot;? Is it right for puppy mills to give life to animals it will kill in a few months if someone doesn&#x27;t buy them? Is it right to accept a gift from someone who stole the money to purchase it? Is it wrong to lie if the lie would save an innocent life?<p>If ethics are universal, then the underlying principals have yet to be discovered.')
