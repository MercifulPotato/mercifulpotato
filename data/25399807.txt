In my experience, it&#x27;s often that an engineer can build the typical use case over a weekend, but will have to continue pouring in more dev time while it&#x27;s in production to handle a huge number of edge cases that weren&#x27;t properly handled originally. That work is only &quot;maintenance&quot; because you already claimed the work was completed, and finance has it marked as having been put into service, so you can&#x27;t capitalize further costs against it.')
