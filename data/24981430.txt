The benefits&#x2F;trade-offs are usually fairly unique to each organization and require careful &quot;inward&quot; thinking instead of following trends<p>8. &quot;One microservice per business function is a good pattern and we&#x27;re going to mandate it&quot; -- terrible idea. Top-down eng culture mandates prevent better solutions from even being considered. Don&#x27;t do this at your company.')
