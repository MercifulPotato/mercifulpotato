The expressed concern is how the contents degrade in the presence of arbitrary bit flips.  Any highly-compressed format is going to be susceptible to corruption amplification from random bitflips, and the higher compression level, the larger fallout.  Ensure your compressed archives are not corrupted using some external FEC; either in your hardware, or something like par2.')
