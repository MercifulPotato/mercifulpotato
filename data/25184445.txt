It publishes national and local news and has a large amount of opinion content. It has been criticized for releasing misinformation and articles written by fake personas,[1] for having unknowingly employed an editor with ties to white supremacist-platforming and pro-Kremlin media outlets,[2] and for opaque funding and political connections.[3][4]&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Post_Millennial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Post_Millennial</a><p>IMHO that invalidates your critique.<p>Simply put, Black Lives Matter, or BLM, is fundamentally about racist police violence and systemic racism in the justice system. That&#x27;s at the core of it.<p>IMHO most critiques such as the one you raise seem to mainly be an attempt to obfuscate that simple fact.')
