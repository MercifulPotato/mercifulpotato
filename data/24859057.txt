I think learning about learning is one of the best things you can do for your personal and professional growth. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge growth in my own learning journey since diving deeper into how spaced repetition and other techniques can help you.<p>I&#x27;ve also been more intentional about my time programming at work. Focusing on certain things to improve on a daily&#x2F;weekly basis. Most of our day to day work is more akin to a performance than deliberate practice[1].<p>I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have a great way to use spaced repetition with programming skills, so I&#x27;ve been working on a platform that lets you practice python fundamentals with spaced repetition. It&#x27;s pre-launch but I&#x27;m documenting progress on my newsletter[2].<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deliberatepython.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;is-programming-at-work-performance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deliberatepython.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;is-programming-at-wo...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sendfox.com&#x2F;deliberatepython" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sendfox.com&#x2F;deliberatepython</a>')
