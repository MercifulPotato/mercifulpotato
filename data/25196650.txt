The study is designed in a way, that the most important parameters around breast (reconstruction) surgery (e.g. breast size, breast shape, areola size, areola position, scars etc.) are being combined in 88 images in a way that in the end allows us to extract the data &quot;broken down&quot; to the different parameters.  So results of the study will be something like: in case of an areola size asymmetry, more people tend to accept the asymmetry then a size correction when you therefore have scars. I hope that explanation helps a little bit! Thank you very much again for your support!')
