I just tried pronouncing it &quot;LAY-tech&quot; with a Greek &quot;chi&quot; sound (&quot;λέει-τεχ&quot;) and I sounded so silly I almost spat my coffee all over my monitor (only &quot;almost&quot; because I wasn&#x27;t drinking any coffee). Ain&#x27;t no way I&#x27;m calling it that.<p>And note that, being Greek, I can actually pronounce &quot;χ&quot; correctly. Most Native English-speaking folks I&#x27;ve heard trying to do the same sound like they&#x27;re in immediate need of someone administering the Heimleich manoeuver to them.<p>Btw, I pronounce &quot;Heimlich&quot; with a Greek &quot;χ&quot; also. I bet most native English-speaking folks pronounce it elsewise. Perhaps as &quot;Heimlick&quot;.')
