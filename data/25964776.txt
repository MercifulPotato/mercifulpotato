Item(by='agwa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611967421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964510, text='The original behavior of disorderfs was to randomly shuffle directory entries, but we quickly realized that this meant that sometimes the shuffle wouldn&#x27;t do anything, so I changed the default behavior to simply reverse the directory entries instead.  Therefore, you only have to build twice.  (Ironically, disorderfs&#x27; &quot;non-determinism&quot; is actually deterministic.)<p>As to your original question, there are so many sources of nondeterminism that trying to emulate them all away would make builds more complicated, less performant (FUSE adds overhead), and less safe (since there would be more components that could potentially be backdoored).')
