Item(by='rkangel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604501014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24986735, text='I personally believe that Elixir is an excellent &#x27;gateway&#x27; functional programming language <i>because</i> it is dynamically typed.<p>Learning OCaml and especially Haskell (I&#x27;ve done some of both) requires understanding a complex type system and learning how to encode what you want in it. On top of that you have to learn to code in the &#x27;functional&#x27; way - representing your data, pure code, recursion (or reduces), higher order functions etc.<p>When you write Elixir you eliminate most of the type system stuff, and you just have to learn to code in a functional way. There is surprisingly little &#x27;language&#x27; to learn - functions, tuples, lists, maps, modules and that&#x27;s about it. There is then the OTP (processes and supervisors) side of it, but that&#x27;s separate (and if you&#x27;re writing a web backend in Phoenix, mostly ignorable).<p>We&#x27;re just (hopefully) wrapping up a 9 month project with a team of about 8, none of which had written much Elixir before the start (a background of mostly C). It has been a very smooth process, and definitely the right choice of language.')
