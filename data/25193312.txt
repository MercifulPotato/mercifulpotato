Item(by='Fice', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606174926, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192043, text='&gt; I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone harassing him for having Asperger&#x27;s<p>I may have worded this badly (not a native speaker, it takes a lot of time for me to find the right words and formulate my thoughts in English), but what I meant is that they are using Stallman&#x27;s peculiarities (which are likely ASD-related) against him to destroy his character.  See the message I linked earlier where Wingo refers to multiple posts on stallman.org suggesting his very biased interpretation of their meanings and of Stallman&#x27;s behavior.<p>And it could be painful for RMS: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.gnu.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;html&#x2F;guix-devel&#x2F;2019-10&#x2F;msg00418.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.gnu.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;html&#x2F;guix-devel&#x2F;2019-10&#x2F;msg004...</a><p>&gt; I can empathize with people who wouldn&#x27;t want someone who says those things to represent an organization that they work with, regardless of what caused the person to say them.<p>But GNU is Stallman&#x27;s project (and it is not an organization), he started it.  They could just leave and continue working on Guix independently.  Some projects join GNU, some leave, no one is forced to work under Stallman&#x27;s leadership.  But it appears to me that Guix maintainers feel so attached to the GNU identity, that they want to hijack it instead.')
