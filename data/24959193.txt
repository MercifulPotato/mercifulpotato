Item(by='Veedrac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604235804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959109, text='&gt; Essentially that&#x27;s part of the whole RISC idea - simple means faster - you can run your core clocks faster if the decode (and address calculations etc etc) are simpler - getting rid of lots of addressing modes was a big part of the original RISC movement.<p>Nobody believes this anymore, not even the RISC guys. Look at Apple chips; the advantage of a simpler instruction set is width (degree and depth of superscalar execution) and the ability to put more optimizations in hardware. Clocks are all bound by roughly the same limits nowadays.')
