Usually I stay in one place place for 6 months or so then take 6 weeks off to travel until I find a new beach to work from while sipping coconuts, but I&#x27;m feeling more like being settled now and I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam for the past year (bonus: no covid here). There are large communities of like minded people out here doing this, lots of couples in their late twenties and thirties and even a few families. Not to mention the local culture and people are amazing.\nFor myself, it allows me to work freelance part time and work on my own projects which are far more interesting to me than working for other people, which I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend time on back home.\nThe biggest pain point is visas - depending on the country you&#x27;ll probably have to do a border run every one to three months. Also, technically, you&#x27;ll be working illegally but at least in SEA this is ignored as there are loads of co-working spaces that cater to the digital nomad crowd and nobody official has ever complained about any of them to my knowledge. The countries presumably view us as rich long term tourists. Thailand is the first country to make moves to legitimize this with a (very limited) working nomad visa. \nI hope in the future more places will do this as this movement grows.')
