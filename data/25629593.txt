But will likely require the effort of porting due to platform specific sections.<p>Practically all non-trivial C codebases have platform specific segments. They can be either isolated to their own libraries or wrapped around tons of preprocessor switches.<p>C code is portable in the sense that it&#x27;s not too much work to get a C compiler to work on a new hardware platform. On the other hand, compiling a large real-world C codebase on the said platform will probably require porting, and the effort may or may not be trivial.')
