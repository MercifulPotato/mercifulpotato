Firstly, there&#x27;s the risk they&#x27;re going to lose a tonne from these margin trades. Secondly, there&#x27;s a risk they&#x27;re going to destroy their business when the shorts unwind and GME turns out to genuinely be worth $20. Thirdly, if the market does go up there&#x27;s a whole load of counter party risk where these short sellers don&#x27;t exit, they go bankrupt. Fourthly, if this behaviour continues their business model is fucked because no one will be paying for toxic order flow.<p>There are lots of really good reasons why RH would want to try and get their clients&#x27; net positions flat. Since they are exposed to an aggregate risk that individual clients aren&#x27;t exposed to - and obviously, those clients won&#x27;t think about this, but they have operational risk that RH can&#x27;t execute trades.')
