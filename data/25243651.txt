I would try reducing the contact friction as the links engage. To do this, I would recommend using BAM coatings on the chain and sprockets. It has lower friction than Teflon, AND is almost as hard as diamond.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aluminium_magnesium_boride" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aluminium_magnesium_boride</a>')
