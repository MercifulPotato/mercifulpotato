The fact that decisions cannot be rolled back (when you go to the store and buy a gift from a God you cannot cancel if no options are interesting, when you enter in a new room you cannot go back to the previous room to try an alternative room) is removing a lot of strategy IMO, it feels like Rogue Legacy where you get more and more powerful from one run to another leading to a mandatory victory. But this might be like this just at the beginning.<p>I love The Binding of Isaac which always starts from 0 + your knowledge of the game. One thing I learned during lockdown is that this game is totally awesome when played in single-player mode with another person on PC. Using one or two keyboards, one player controls Isaac and bombs&#x2F;active items while the other shoots. The tension of Isaac (going fast can lead you somewhere, choosing certain items can lead you somewhere) goes really well with playing with someone, I really recommend it.<p>Another great roguelike that can be experienced with another player is Faster Than Light. The option to pause when fighting another spaceship makes it more approachable for players with less experience.')
