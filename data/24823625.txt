The time saved by proper tools is totally worth it.<p>This is very true IF you know it’s the tool you’re after.<p>I usually preface buying something expensive with something entry-level. In Sweden, this means Biltema - I can get a fully functional 400W impact drill for ~35€. I then ride that thing like I stole it and when it eventually burns up I’ll know the use-cases I need to consider when splurging on a Hilti.<p>But overall, yeah, buying (or renting) professional-grade equipment making any work easier and much more pleasant.')
