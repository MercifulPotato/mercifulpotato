They use public transportation or ride sharing. Parking a car in a city is expensive, especially since you need to park it both at home and at your destination.<p>Cities are full of cars during the day, but the parking lots empty out at night. They live in less-dense suburbs, where it&#x27;s comparatively easy to park and comparatively easy to have a charger installed. In the city, many of those who are willing to afford a car at all will also find ways to charge it (including sharing a few charging stations at their garage).')
