Their user was created 88 days ago, had 235 karma, mostly from recent 2 submissions that each went frontpage and each got a lot of points.<p>The second in the list had 135 karma and has been a user for 4 months, with frontpage hits periodically on submission.<p>The third comment was from a user created 8 years ago that is fairly active.<p>I’m not trying to show how HN karma is being exploited, but this rang alarm bells for me.')
