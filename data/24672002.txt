That&#x27;s what I was on when I was younger, and it seemed effective. I&#x27;m on Vyvanse now.<p>The only major side effect that&#x27;s a problem for me is the utter loss of appetite. Frustratingly, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not hungry, I just don&#x27;t want food. So my stomach will start hurting and I force myself to eat, but it&#x27;s a challenge. Plus earlier this year I had to give up sugar to account for prediabetes, every day is a struggle to make myself get enough calories. Still, the ability to stay focused on a task for 15 minutes, or even just process my students&#x27; sentences, is worth it.')
