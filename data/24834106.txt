Saga edition and D6 are both totally different games.<p>Can this integrate with other tools in the community, like RPGSessions.com? What about mysheets.com?  Or myRPGTools.com?  What about OggDude’s character builder?  What about the various dice rolling programs?<p>Can you also handle FFG Genesys, which is very similar to FFG SWRPG?<p>What about virtual tabletop games?<p>Do you handle audio chat, background music, and video as well? What about shared maps, like roll20?<p>I’m already in a number of different Discord servers for various different SWRPG campaigns, and while the games themselves don’t cost me any money, Discord certainly does. And if I want the Discord server to perform reasonably well, then I have to get yet another Nitro subscription, and that kinda gets old after the first half dozen or more Discord servers.<p>And scheduling is a hard problem that I have yet to see anyone handle right.<p>Speaking only for myself, I’m not looking for a 24x7x365 convention. I want to play with the same group of people every week (more or less). It could be a really large group, so maybe only a small subset of us can get together for any one game. But still the same group of people, albeit perhaps with a few different options for GMs.<p>Give me a reason to use your community system instead of the various Discord servers I’m on, please.  Not only will I be happy to give you money to do so, I’m willing to give you extra money if you can make that experience even better for me.')
