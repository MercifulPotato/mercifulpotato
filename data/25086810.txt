However, it seems that threadcounts this high are primarily a marketing gimmick by sheet makers that don&#x27;t really make practical sense. Furthermore, because it&#x27;s marketing gimmick, you can&#x27;t really go out and buy so-called &quot;680 threadcount cotton fabric&quot; you can get sheets labeled that way but not a bolt of fabric from a craft store. I wan&#x27;t to know what fabric they actually used to make this theoretical mask, without that this seems pretty specious.')
