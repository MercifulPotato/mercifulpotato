This enormous CL is then approved by one of the Global owners.<p>If the change is complex (or non-obvious), you generally introduce the new API in one CL, change each use manually (say one CL per team), and then remove the old API in a final CL. In that case, you need each team to sign off. This isn&#x27;t too hard in practice, teams are generally expected to approve cleanups.')
