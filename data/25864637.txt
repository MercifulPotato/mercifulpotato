Their web UI usually takes 3+ seconds to load for me on a gigabit connection which is about the same as Gmail, search also takes 2+ seconds which is definitely worse than Gmail. And they haven&#x27;t upped their storage limit in 6+ years during which the cost of hard drives has fallen 50% or more.<p>edit: Bulk moving or deleting items in the web interface can take 20+ seconds! It&#x27;s not that fast, honestly. But maybe there isn&#x27;t anything better.')
