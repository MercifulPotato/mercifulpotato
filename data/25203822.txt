There is this single task that takes up the majority of the time amd your progressbar is stuck at 56% percent for too much time compared to the other tasks. You don&#x27;t have feedback as a user. Is it stuck? Is it still going on?<p>Now is the time to optimize for use experience!<p>Why is this task taking so long? Are you loading a huge asset? Break it up, compress it, optimoze it. Are you doing something CPU intensive? Break up your computation over distinct tasks.<p>This attitude has led me to implement better technological solutions as well as user experiences')
