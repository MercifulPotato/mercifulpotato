On page 112, there&#x27;s a chart of how much profit they make per order based on how long the user has been on the platform. In the first year, the value is negative because DoorDash spends money on sales and marketing to acquire the customer. By the third year, DoorDash is making a consistent profit of 8% on each order placed.<p>When you look at the numbers in aggregate, it appears they are massively unprofitable. When you look at the numbers by cohort, it&#x27;s clear they are investing money in sales and marketing and based on their metrics, they will generate a significant return on their investment over the next few years. Over time, as a larger and larger percentage of their users become recurring users, their profit on each order will approach 8%.')
