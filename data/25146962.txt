I was basically going to recommend going the university education route. I have a degree in biochem&#x2F;molbio, and the topics you are interested was basically the third year of my degree. Not to discourage you (you can do anything if you want to bad enough), but they are pretty complex topics and without the foundational knowledge you are going to be saying &quot;wait, it did what?!&quot; a lot. I know this, because I did have all the foundational knowledge and was frequently saying that.<p>If you have no background in biology or chemistry, I would email the authors of papers you are interested in. Most of those researchers are starved for attention and would love to break it down for you. Try making friends with one or two of the locals so they can explain more papers to you. Eventually osmosis will do its thing.')
