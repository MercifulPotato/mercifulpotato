Like they can&#x27;t go pee behind a tree any more, can&#x27;t swim with shirts off.  Trust me, dynamics change when girls are around.  There was a mixed program already, btw, called Venturing.<p>I&#x27;ll add that one of the best things about Boy Scouts was that we could do stuff that was dangerous, but not too dangerous.  We didn&#x27;t have any moms come along either, and I think that helped.  Dads would stop us from doing something truly stupid (like permanent injury type stupid), but not something dumb that would bruise us and teach us a lesson.  It also allowed us to do lots more fun stuff.<p>These days, tree forts are a no-no, apparently.  Some guys from my old troop were building one at a mixed event recently.  Some girls from another troop came over and said it wasn&#x27;t safe, then got some karen from their troop to come yell at the boys.  Oh, and and apparently it&#x27;s no longer okay to climb above chest height these days, because it&#x27;s &quot;not safe&quot;.  I&#x27;m way too young to be saying, &quot;Back when I was young, we did $UNSAFE_THING all the time!  We liked it, and never got hurt.&quot;  Or at least, I thought I was.')
