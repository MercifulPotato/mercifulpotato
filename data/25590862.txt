Item(by='porpoise', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609404544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25587523, text='HN has a ton of emotional content. But it really depends on the topic&#x2F;thread. For example, I clicked into a thread recently where I found that at least 80% of users commenting have been blocked by myself for posting that type of content, and this is what I literally see:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;nGFvx08" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;nGFvx08</a><p>(I use a script so users can be blocked with one click)<p>Whereas in this thread, it&#x27;s only about 1% (1 blocked in 73 comments).<p>Despite me having a huge block list, I&#x27;m consistently amazed how often I&#x27;d click into a huge thread with hundreds of comments and find that I&#x27;ve blocked not even a single user.')
