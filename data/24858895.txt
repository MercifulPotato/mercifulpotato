It doesn’t even fill one of the 64 pages... Maybe this is a symptom of me not being an antitrust lawyer, but I’d have hoped for some specific, creative ideas on how to accomplish these good things.&quot;<p>Also not a lawyer, but I listen to enough law podcasts to make a wild guess: if the lawyers ask for specific structural relief, they constrain what the judge is allowed to do. For example, let&#x27;s assume they ask for Google to be broken up... If they can&#x27;t build a case strong enough for that to happen, they get no relief and they wasted the case. Or if they don&#x27;t ask for Google to be broken up, but they make a strong enough case that a judge <i>could</i> decide that&#x27;s appropriate, it doesn&#x27;t matter; plaintiff asked for something else, therefore plaintiff believes that something else makes them whole, therefore that&#x27;s all the judge can and should do to resolve the case. Remember, the whole point of courts is to keep society humming along by exploring how people have been wronged and righting that wrong, and the plaintiff <i>telling</i> you something rights their wrong is a good primary source.<p>Asking for &quot;Structural relief as needed to cure any anticompetitive harm&quot; leaves it in the judge&#x27;s court and grants the saddle-point of maximum potential for disruption to Google and maximum potential for <i>some</i> positive outcome.')
