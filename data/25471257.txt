Most gamers may not care but for a certain type of gamer, this is a game ruiner.<p>For example with ME3 again, I had fun the entire way through the game, assuming my prior games&#x27; choices mattered. And there actually were different dialogue options, references to past choices, etc.<p>The ending was awful, and I will never replay that game ever. But if my choices didn&#x27;t matter even <i>while</i> playing, before the ending... well that&#x27;s just an awful game to a person like me. I would never play a minute of a story-based, choice-based game where I know the choices don&#x27;t matter.')
