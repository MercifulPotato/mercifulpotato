Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=[25770936], score=None, time=1610589905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770407, text='&gt;The fact that Silicon Valley overwhelmingly supports the Democratic Party - at North Korean Levels<p>Silicon Valley overwhelmingly supports Democratic <i>politicians</i>. But Silicon Valley is also one of the most welcoming ears for the kinds of reforms that would upend the current party system, to wit proportional representation and non-plurality voting. That&#x27;s a <i>pretty big</i> asterisk: nobody in North Korea can get away with promoting reforms that would destroy the party system!<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the reason that Silicon Valley appears to, by their silence, always support the status quo, is because <i>the tech companies know you hate them</i>. Having the motto &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; implies an understood risk of <i>being evil</i>. FANGMOAT knows that if they support any dramatic reform, there is a severe risk of a backlash effect that <i>reduces</i> support for that reform.<p>As such, the idea that tech companies serve as a power projection mechanism for the Democratic Party is in my opinion a coincidence of temporarily aligned motives and <i>not</i> a true ideological alliance. Tech company <i>employees</i> support the Democrats for a variety of reasons, but, in particular, many become pro-immigrant by meeting a few of them and most understand that climate science is not a conspiracy.')
