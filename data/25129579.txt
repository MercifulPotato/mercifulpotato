If you look at barrels of oil consumed per day in the US, then just plug the barrel-of-oil numbers into a unit converter to see how many terawatt hours it comes to, it looks hopeless to put a dent in oil consumption with electric vehicles and renewable electricity.<p>But as the Bloomberg article points out, we don&#x27;t need a 1:1 replacement of joules from fossil fuels with joules from non-fossil energy. If everyone currently driving a Toyota Corolla started driving a wind-charged battery electric vehicle instead, the total energy consumed would shrink dramatically without any behavioral changes. Most of the oil energy demanded by those Corollas is simply wasted as heat.')
