Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25192814], score=None, time=1606169862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184938, text='&gt; The evidence that we were shown as kids should not be considered rigorous or acceptable in science - mixing invisible gases in an open container that allows air in, is not rigorous.<p>Well, have you seen other gas-gas reactions produce water vapor? Because most of the ones I&#x27;ve seen, especially exothermic ones, don&#x27;t produce any vapor at all. So when a hydrogen-oxygen reaction produces vapor, why else would it be if not because they reacted and produced a gas that quickly condensed on the glass? (true, I never personally tasted that condensed liquid to confirm it is water and not some other liquid).<p>&gt; I too believe that computers work. :) I don&#x27;t dispute that we are able to use things to create some excellent technology. What I dispute that we know what we&#x27;re doing.<p>Well, how could we reliably make them work if we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing? This is why I don&#x27;t need to take so many things on faith: I see people reliably make them work. If I saw a faith healer or church reliably cure people, by the millions every day, I wouldn&#x27;t even need faith: it would be obvious that they know something real.<p>&gt;  We cannot see evolution occurring. (Feel free to point me to an article or something that you think shows this.)<p>First of all, as I explained earlier, I don&#x27;t need to literally see it happen to understand how it must have. The present derives from the past, and if you simply extend how we see genetics working today into the past (or future), evolution is in fact the only possible result (assuming no magical forces are acting). Your way of thinking is a dead end for any process that lies outside the limited human senses: if something is smaller than what we can see, or further away than we can see, or takes longer than a single human lifetime, it would be completely out of the reach of science. I do not accept this view of the world, and I don&#x27;t see any reason why theories couldn&#x27;t be extrapolated beyond what is immediately visible.<p>If I understand what my eyes see, and I understand how a lense works, and I understand how an electron microscope works, then I can trust that the image the electron microscope is drawing of a microbe is true, even though if I take away the microscope I can only see a mess. The same works if you apply this reasoning backwards in time, even over millions of years.<p>By the way, there have apparently been quite a few experiments of artificially producing new species from a single colony - there&#x27;s a list here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laboratory_experiments_of_speciation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laboratory_experiments_of_spec...</a><p>The crisis of reproducibility is a tangent, and it only affects a limited set of fields, it is not a crisis in all of science. It is also caused by all sorts of economic incentives (we live under capitalism, unfortunately) pushing scientists to avoid revealing too much data - it is not necessarily a crisis of bad science (though there are fields that should barely be regarded as scientific at all - nutrition &quot;science&quot; being a prime example).')
