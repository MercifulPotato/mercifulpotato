One helming Windows 10 and another doing the impressive Visual Studio Code, PowerShell Core, .NET Core work etc. where they go like &quot;Hey maybe we should build a Rust projection for WinRT, OK here you go!&quot;<p>Windows 10 <i>should</i> have been so much more and so much easier for Microsoft to rapidly evolve in a more beautiful fashion. But I guess there&#x27;s just so much enforced backwards compatibility within it that their hands are almost tied behind their backs. Everything is ran in the same system on equal footing, from Windows XP era stuff to whatever the latest &quot;app&quot; trends are. Unsurprisingly it becomes a mess.<p>Windows 10X looked to be the right way forward where they <i>finally</i> decide to just run everything Win32 in light weight containers to shed all that dead weight for a more maintainable system, but it&#x27;s sure taking a while to see anything and I hear the ARM edition that will be essential isn&#x27;t going all too well. We&#x27;re looking at a completely different, really troublesome, performance in 10X for x86 on ARM than macOS Big Sur and Rosetta 2 on Apple M1 that is already about to ship&#x2F;shipping.')
