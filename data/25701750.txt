Fledgling companies with small user bases have very little liability by virtue of their small community.  A platform with a small community can&#x27;t be used to do harmful things like incite riots and encourage hate crimes unless you are targeting a specific demographic.  And if you&#x27;re targeting a specific demographic that is prone to doing harmful things then you should be moderating it from day 1.  If you aren&#x27;t targeting a dangerous demographic you have to get pretty big before your platform gets dangerous by size alone, and I do think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect companies to have some moderation figured out <i>before</i> their platform gets so big that it&#x27;s dangerous.  Plus, a small budget doesn&#x27;t give founders&#x2F;developers an excuse to not know what their platform is being used for.  Hypothetically, if your platform was small and you didn&#x27;t realize you were catering to Nazis, then you <i>are</i> liable if those Nazis use your platform to organize an armed march&#x2F;protest that turns into a riot and people get killed.  Or at least I think you should be, and that&#x27;s why I think that Section 230 should be repealed and replaced with something in the middle- not a blanket protection for companies that don&#x27;t even try to moderate their content, but some protection as long as they are actually trying.<p>Also remember that not moderating your platform doesn&#x27;t mean that bad things will definitely happen and that you will get sued- Section 230 only applies to civil cases already, and there must be some sort of grievance for someone to sue you.  The cops couldn&#x27;t proactively shut someone down for lack of moderation.  So even without Section 230, a company could roll the dice while they were on a shoestring budget if they decided that it was worth it to delay developing a moderation system in favor of a different feature.  That&#x27;s in their right, they just ought to accept the idea that they might get sued if something bad happened because they prioritized work on shiny features.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m saying is yes, I don&#x27;t think a shoestring budget is a defense for giving a company protections.  A new  car company can&#x27;t avoid a lawsuit from ignoring a known safety defect just with the excuse that they didn&#x27;t have the budget.  A startup that can&#x27;t afford to do something right either shouldn&#x27;t be doing it or they should accrue some risk.')
