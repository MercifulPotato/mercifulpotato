However, IIUC, a LVT would tax a plot of land by what use it could theoretically be put to in order to make the most money.  And this is evaluated individually for each plot of land, with no regard for what would actually happen in reality if every single plot of land would actually be put to use in the most money-making way.   Would a LVT not force a monoculture of, say, only lofts, where previously each landowner might have opted to allow things like nightclubs or the occasional park or other forms of variation and whimsy?  If you tax every land owner <i>as if</i> they have the maximum possible income, do you not essentially force every landowner to implement that way in order to acquire it?')
