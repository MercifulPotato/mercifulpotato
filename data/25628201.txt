Does that imply that images with similar attributes (like other hotel rooms in one of their examples with slightly different dimensions or furniture) will work without additional training? Or did each example require multiple image training of that scene before a 3d mesh can be computed from arbitrary angle? In the latter case it can still be useful as compared to photogrammetry which would require hundreds of photos to achieve similar results, so maybe this could work with a dozen or less?')
