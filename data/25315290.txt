Item(by='rmtech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607182681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25312854, text='&gt; It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.<p>Surely the obvious counterargument to this is that a fully centralized web tilts democracies towards left-wing communism and censorship-enabled dystopias.<p>Right now a small group of left-wing zealots at Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google can erase a person from the web. Is that good?<p>Do technologists want to enable this?<p>Mass bans are happening right now on twitter, often with no reason given and terms of service that allow a privileged few to exercise unlimited and arbitrary censorship.<p>The very fact that people who are politically on the left are calling for an end to decentralized tech is evidence that their side has a systematic advantage at the most powerful censorship agents in the centralized web. This post, and others like it, is an admission and a justification for why decentralization is necessary. If such posts instead merely talked about apolitical crimes like child abuse or scams, then I think the justification for decentralization would be much weaker.')
