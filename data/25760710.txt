People need to be able to get to work in a reasonable length of time, they generally need to be able to maintain prior relationships, have access to hobbies, shopping etc. that all tend to be further away from undeveloped land.<p>That&#x27;s also ignoring the problem of landlords using the excess capital extracted from rents to drive the price of housing further from the reach of the people actually interested in using it as a house. The higher prices are then used by landlords as a justification for raising rent, and this cycle then repeats.')
