Sounds like the bugs have ruined the game. At least the developers are able to fix them in updates. Could have been a lot worse if consoles were still in the age of physical copies with no way to update them.<p>Imagine if such games were on read-only cartridges, CDs with no update mechanisms like the PS2, Gamecube, Xbox, etc then we&#x27;re looking at a complete and irreversible disaster.<p>Better wait until the developers fix these bugs before playing this game.')
