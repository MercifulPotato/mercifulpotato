(Remember Telsa&#x27;s log files vs. what the New York Times reporter said?)<p>To investigators&#x2F;debuggers&#x2F;system fixers in the future, they help pinpoint the exact point in time where something unwanted may have occured, and while not the only tool, they aid greatly in getting to a root-cause analysis...')
