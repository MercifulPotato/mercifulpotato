It&#x27;s fast for landing pages and smaller sites--but when implementing a <i>real</i> design system across a complex web app, Tailwind is a nightmare. We&#x27;ve had to add so much custom stuff to the config file it&#x27;s basically the same mess our CSS was before.<p>I&#x27;ve been-there-done-that with the whole CSS framework world (have used Bootstrap, Tachyons, Bulma, Tailwind in many projects) and have completely reverted back to custom stylesheets with a few select utility classes that make sense.<p>Padding, margins, widths, heights <i>do not</i> make sense as utility classes IMO.<p>Type scales, type modifiers (like font-weight), and commonly used things like margin-x-auto and 100% width do.<p>I wish there was a CSS framework that only contained a minimal set of common utilities (like the ones mentioned above) and required no complex build process BS or NPM.<p>I just want a simple boilerplate, nothing else.')
