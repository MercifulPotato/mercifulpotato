(Plot twist, she wasn&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; a practicing anesthesiologist, but the founder and head of a whole new Anesthesiology dept. at Columbia) I <i>think</i> the short version is that she published a paper in 1953, and managed to get obstetricians using the scale in a competitive spirit, but I am still curious about how it was marketed (just publishing a paper is rarely enough to get something publicized, afaik).<p>She also carried around a scalpel and tubing for giving passers-by emergency airways (tracheotomy?), and apparently did so over a dozen times.')
