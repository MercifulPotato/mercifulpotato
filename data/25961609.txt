A religion is the cumulative result of thousands of years of culture and thought. Googling some random Biblical phrases isn’t really much of an argument...especially considering that a majority of Christians look more to the church or to tradition than the Bible itself. Again, basic theology. Likewise with the notion that God &quot;wills&quot; everything: this is called &quot;the problem of free will&quot; and millenia of books have been written about it.<p>And again, God is not a dictator because a dictator is a human concept derived from the Roman republic. The comparison to religious entities is nonsensical. As I’ve said a few times now, anyone with basic knowledge of theology would know this. You can’t expect to google something and get a clear, understandable answer in five minutes. It doesn’t work that way with something as all-permeating as the influence and definition of religion. There are literally thousands of scholars that have written books on these topics.<p>I said &quot;vocal atheists&quot; above because this is a common habit of that community: the assumption that if something can&#x27;t be argued for by assembling a bunch of google results, it must clearly be nonsense. Sorry, but reality doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>Finally, I’m not a Christian and never have been. I just find the constant ignorance of religion to be tiresome. Anyone who had spent considerable time studying Christianity or other religions would immediately recognize that you have a very confused understanding of them both. My initial comment was just calling you out for it.<p>I suggest starting here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;omnipotence&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;omnipotence&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;freewill&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;freewill&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;free-will-foreknowledge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;free-will-foreknowledge&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;divine-hiddenness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;divine-hiddenness&#x2F;</a>')
