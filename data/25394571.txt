My co-founder and I are both developers and we created Devbook to solve our own problem. We realized we spend more and more time searching for information on Google or retrieving data&#x2F;information from 3rd party tools. \nIt feels like we spend more time outside our IDE than in it. We think there should be a better way and it should be made specifically for developers to make them more productive and not less. That&#x27;s why we started building Devbook - a search engine for developers.<p>We are starting with a very simple version 1.0 where we let you search StackOverflow and public code on GitHub. Devbook is a desktop app that works similarly to Spotlight on macOS. You hit a shortcut, a window appears and you can start typing. We built the first version with developers&#x27; productivity in mind. You can control the whole app without touching the mouse. Our goal with the first version was to minimize context switching you as a developer need to do when looking for basic information on the internet.<p>In the near future, we plan to add more integrations in which you can search and more features focused on improving customizability and general user experience.<p>The app is free right now. In the future, we will introduce a subscription plan. But we would like to always offer a free plan. Also, to fully use the app, you don&#x27;t need to sign up.<p>Currently, we support only macOS. Happy to answer any question.')
