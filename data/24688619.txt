I think you&#x27;re right that Hispanic is closer, though. Think of Hispanic people like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, are they really perceived as so different from white? Also, speaking to your comment that you are an Asian that has been to the USA, I want to mention that the author of the book is partly of Asian descent himself. If you&#x27;re curious to read it I recommend it!')
