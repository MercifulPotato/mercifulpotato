What you seem to be saying is: &quot;as long as only the well-off - and therefore likely to be educated - people had the means of mass expression, dangerous ideas could not proliferate&quot;. Should it be one group of people, preferably &quot;us&quot;, who decides what the other groups are allowed to think and discuss? To me this is much more ripe for abuse than the other extreme. Doubly so because the dangers in free speech can be much better solved with education and removing the ever-widening gap between the haves and have-nots.<p>So I disagree vehemently that the solution is to limit free speech. That to me is akin to cutting off our own noses because we have a flu. The root of the problem is elsewhere.<p>What does pretty much every malicious and totalitarian regime start with?<p>1. Ban free speech\n2. Institute the concept of thought crimes\n3. Limit education<p>Concentrating knowledge and intelligence in the hands of a few, and reducing information and idea flow to the masses.<p>Dangerous and radical ideas can proliferate mostly among marginalized groups who have been excluded from welfare for one reason or another. People who are gripped by existential fears and see little to no possibility of improvement or solution to their problems will naturally gravitate towards radical opinions because they have nothing to lose, no other options and nobody else listens to them. Banning their voice will do nothing just push them further away and radicalize them even more.')
