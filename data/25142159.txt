The more I advance in my career and get exposed to more technologies and teams, the less interested I am in continuing.<p>I have taken some time off work recently to travel and unwind. Felt great at the end. Then I returned to work and quickly felt terrible: stress, insomnia, hard to keep up with everything.<p>I don&#x27;t care anymore for all the constant keeping up with new developments, team project schedules, new technologies (never did actually), the lack of creativity and open-ended thinking, the lack of time to explore the world.<p>I have given a shot to working with talented world-class engineers, to learning new technologies, to developing on different tech stacks. I just don&#x27;t see the value in that beyond the paycheck.<p>Is it time to quit tech?')
