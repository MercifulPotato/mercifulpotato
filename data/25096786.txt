I use it with my password manager. To log in to my bank account, I need the correct password. No problem, I keep it in a password manager. To open the password manager, I need the correct password. No problem, I already know it. If I don’t know it, I look it up from a less secure source.<p>Technically what I’m describing is that you can vary the behaviour of OCSP lookups such that if you’re already looking up an OCSP certificate to establish an SSL connection to an OCSP server, downgrade and check over HTTP only when trying to connect to the OCSP server itself. Yes, it would mean one more TLS connection to a random server. Yes, it would mean an extra OCSP lookup. But just one, and just for the OCSP server itself. Which means privacy is preserved in regards to which developer certificate you’re checking. It would be only checking Apple’s OCSP server certificate in the clear, which it could equally cache easily.')
