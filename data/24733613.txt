When clicking the link, it opened in the in-app browser and you could enter your credit card details right inside. Idk if that&#x27;s permitted by Apple or not, but if not, then Hey was lucky Apple didn&#x27;t notice it.<p>However, I don&#x27;t see how that can be solved. An email provider has every right to send an email to a customer informing them about anything, including a trial expiration and if that email contains a link, it is handled like a link from any other email in the app. It would be really silly for Apple to ask the provider to censor their user&#x27;s inbox and hide a particular email they received.')
