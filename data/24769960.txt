Some examples include violent crime, burglaries, robberies, and the general discomfort of being around people on a daily basis who are chemically dependent on a drug they need to take on an interval and usually because of it desperate for money, sometimes with psychological issues on top of it.<p>Having a serious problem with drugs in your area does not mean some people buying weed every now and then.
