And Times Square has nearby stations that other people also use for exiting and entering; Hudson Yards is a long hike from the next closest subway station, and 34th St is not a particularly great walk, with all the Lincoln tunnel traffic and whatnot.<p>Hudson Yards is also the only station next to the Javits Center, so it has the massive traffic from large convention events like the Auto Show and NYCC.')
