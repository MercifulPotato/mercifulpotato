It&#x27;s a good cryptographic hash function. But it&#x27;s not a password hash function. They have different goals. Particularly a cryptographic hash is trying to be fast, while a password hash is trying to be slow.<p>You can use a cryptographic hash function as a password hash, it&#x27;s better than nothing. But it&#x27;s a really poor choice. If this story happened as it&#x27;s told, it not only means that compliance is making wrong decisions, it also means the auditor didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about.<p>There are FIPS-approved password hashes, even ones building upon SHA256 (PBKDF2-SHA2-256). It would&#x27;ve been less bad to propose to move from bcrypt to such a function. (Still not really justified, as bcrypt is a fine password hash function.)')
