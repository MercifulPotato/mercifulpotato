You should never use it. Never. It&#x27;s one of those things that sound good until you&#x27;re a few years into the project. Similar to how you should never be using meaningful IDs as primary keys for objects, always use meaningless fingerprint-like integers. Or how all integers should be signed unless you&#x27;re dead sure the number is unsigned (like a fingerprint). And how many integers should actually be strings, unless you&#x27;re dead sure this is a number (externally provided IDs, such as for example customer account IDs, are not numbers). Or how you should be careful to use bytes rather than unicode strings.<p>Make your schema permissible and your code paranoid, it will pay off later. Build a data linter if necessary, but don&#x27;t tie the schema.')
