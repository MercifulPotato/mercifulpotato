I have to disagree with priyatham_&#x27;s position that it effectively targets both.<p>The <i>Loops</i> section gives a very brief description of what loops are. This doesn&#x27;t introduce anything of value to an experienced programmer, and it&#x27;s nowhere near enough of an explanation for teaching imperative programming to a beginner.<p>Personally I&#x27;d suggest targeting experienced programmers. I only learnt JavaScript relatively recently, and I found it very frustrating that every JavaScript tutorial I could find was aimed at beginners (and that isn&#x27;t an exaggeration).')
