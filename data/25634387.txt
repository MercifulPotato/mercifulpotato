The stats are there to support most assertions in the above reply. They&#x27;re just inconveniently scattered across the states and not all electronically accessible. I wonder whose interests that serves? When I taught in inner city Paterson back in the mid-90s most teachers worked at least two jobs but still spent many extra hours a week outside normal school time on phone conferences with parents, curriculum development and grading tests&#x2F;papers, because they all had a full load of classes with 35+ students each. Things weren&#x27;t much easier down here in NC two decades later where my own kids were in school (our district has a year-round calendar -- so no summers off for teachers). The master&#x27;s requirement exists in NY, but practically discouraged in other places because school districts didn&#x27;t want to pay the differential. Sure, none of this approaches the often 24x7x365 experience of many sysadmins and devs (my own tech experience for over 20 years), but it&#x27;s also far from the bankers&#x27; hours myth that&#x27;s been pushed since at least the 80s.')
