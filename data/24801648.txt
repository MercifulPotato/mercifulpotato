We have back-ported some of its features to the 1.x branch and have a 1.6.0 beta (tagged 1.5.0) out now. 1.6.0 should be late this month. We are pushing for 2.0 by EOY.<p>2.0 is a major re-architecting for performance and versatility with a rewrite of the CLI and service layer (not core protocol). If we had 100% of our time to dedicate only to engineering we could have shipped it by now, but biz and other things got in the way.')
