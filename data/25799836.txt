I just figured $300-400 a month meant upwards of $5k&#x2F;yr to <i>possibly</i> increase the number of matches you get. Could you compare what that kind of spending gets you versus going to picking up dates the old fashion way? I&#x27;ve tried Tinder in the past and it was fine but I never really felt obliged to spend money on it. Maybe because I was in college and didn&#x27;t have much cash on hand.')
