Most of my friends use Telegram (a few hundred). None of them mention security as a reason for using Telegram.<p>Writing it this way is equally stupid to making a big deal out of of the fact that everything you post on Twitter is by default public: yes, everbody knew in the  same way everybody who needs to know knows that Telegram is only point-to-point encrypted, not e2e-encrypted.<p>Then there&#x27;s the two last ones:<p>- According to the article Telegram tolerates nazis: here Vice makes a mess in at least three ways:<p>1. If contents were encrypted the  way they wished further up, Telegram couldn&#x27;t even remove it.<p>2. Telegram bans open groups and channels that promote illegal content. They just haven&#x27;t AFAIK been caught nosing in private messages. <i>IMO this is a goodnthing.</i><p>3.
