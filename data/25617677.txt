They’re easy to detect on radar, and they fly at about 100 mph—about the speed of a World War I-era bomber. (The Dassault Mirage 5, one of the most common jets in Pakistan’s military fleet, cruises at just under 600 mph and tops out at nearly 1,500 mph.) They don’t normally carry any weapons that could be used in a dogfight, and their lack of maneuverability makes them vulnerable to missiles fired from the ground. &quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;cia-drone-program-is-it-hard-to-shoot-one-down.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;cia-drone-progra...</a>')
