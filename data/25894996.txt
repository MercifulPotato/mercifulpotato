Differentiation, boundaries and context with words and language, is something then they need to learn - and if you coddle them, they&#x27;re not going to learn that - so you&#x27;re actually doing a disservice to them and society.<p>If a child is having a temper tantrum because you won&#x27;t let them taste the bleach, you don&#x27;t give in to let them taste the bleach.<p>And re: they will consider my response irrational - I just explained it with logic, and there is truth and logic - you don&#x27;t fold to that behaviour just because someone&#x27;s emotional maturity is underdeveloped or blocked - likely from coddling and adults in their life not being integral to hold boundaries for certain types of thinking&#x2F;behaviour; this has lead to what&#x27;s considered a neoliberal group - the same extreme exists on the conservative side as well, though it manifests differently.')
