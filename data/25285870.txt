LDAP CDPs are definitely a no-go, for example. CTLs, as another, are almost exclusively for server apps like IIS, and don’t correctly work in Chrome today, so no regression there. Definitely, making sure to enable metrics, and report issues, is a good way to help prioritize things that are important vs things that are possible, but profoundly ill-considered.')
