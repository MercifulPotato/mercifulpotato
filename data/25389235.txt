I assume it has something to do with reporting delays over weekends. I even noticed a big dip in reports around Thanksgiving in some state graphs, particularly the case counts, followed by apparent spikes to catch up.<p>So, I always use the 7 day average. It&#x27;s very smooth, and it looks like we&#x27;re actually closer to 2500 today. That said, maybe the CDC is using different numbers.<p>And as long as I mentioned this, I should caveat that in Sweden they actually mark the deaths according to date of death. However, this means that it always looks like there&#x27;s a big downturn in deaths in the last couple weeks, when there may not actually be.')
