Have you seen V&#x27;s roadmap? [0]<p>One major hard part, imho, is the zkSNARKs. Nobody is talking about the fact that they are hardware dependent because they are so computationally expensive. My guess right now is that we&#x27;re going to need (or they will get developed some how)... ASIC&#x27;s. Talk about kicking the puck down the road.<p>The other hard part is that this is a decentralized development project managed by humans. What happens when someone wants to flip the switch on billions of value? The ProgPoW debate proved how contentious decisions turn into a total clusterf*ck. You want to trust your funds to that?<p>Finally, the best one. There is insane pressure to rush eth2 out now that billions of value is locked up. 737 max levels of pressure.<p>I love ETH and ETH2. More than anything I want to see it happen. I&#x27;m just in the camp that we should have worked on ETH 1.5 first.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;VitalikButerin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333922620857745408" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;VitalikButerin&#x2F;status&#x2F;133392262085774540...</a>')
