Some things are partially explained at best, but you don&#x27;t get an impression it&#x27;s mystery for mystery&#x27;s sake or conspiracy theorist bait (see David Lynch movies). I love both the cartoons and the books.<p>I think Moominland Midwinter is a masterpiece. It&#x27;s just eerie.<p>I also really like how each character has his own philosophy or at least a way of doing things. Little My&#x27;s approach to vampires is &quot;Bite them first!&quot;. Yeah, Cobra Kai never dies! ;-). There&#x27;s a saying &quot;know your enemy&quot;, but Moomins take it one step further: no one is really an enemy, you just need to understand people and their motives. There are no black&amp;white evil characters.')
