You have the freedom to have wrong expectations about other people and should not be punished for that, as long as you change your assumptions once you know the persons reality and don&#x27;t mistreat them for not matching your expectations. And that last part is not that easy because people tend to not verify assumptions, yet act quickly and in hostile ways to perceived failure to fulfill expectations.<p>Note the closeness of &quot;Expecting someone to do&#x2F;be something&quot; and notice how many in this thread tell stories of trying to have a normal sleep-cycle, failing, getting shunned by society, being unable to function properly after forcing themselves to conform, feeling wrong, feeling defective, and that over decades, often going back to childhood. People compare it to left-handedness and how our society mishandled those in the past, and are fearful our society might expect them, even consider it normal, to get chemical treatment in the near future. People try to fulfill absurd expectations and suffer from it.<p>The way you phrased your demand makes you sound ego-maniacal, like you demand a right to mistreat people for not matching your expectation, like you blame your lack of empathy and decency on them being quirky, like you disrespect people for not being normal. Those are the worst interpretations of your words. There is some truth in the best interpretation, i can see that, see the freedom i mentioned above, but that <i>&quot;being disgusted&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;anti-social&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;tyrannical&quot;</i> in your now flagged comment doesn&#x27;t sound like you are <i>&quot;fundamentally respecting everyone&quot;</i> at all.')
