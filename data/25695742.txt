I&#x27;ve been ordering my cars from the dealer almost exclusively for the past 25 years.  Never had a problem.  Sure, they&#x27;d rather sell a car off the lot, but I&#x27;ve never had one tell me they wouldn&#x27;t order the car for me.<p>I did get rejected by Audi when I wanted to order a car in a special paint color.  They advertised &quot;any color you want, just $2500 extra&quot;.  When I tried to take them up on it, the reply was, &quot;We don&#x27;t know you, your dealer isn&#x27;t a top performer, and our custom paint shop is booked up over a year anyway. So kindly bugger off.&quot;')
