One may be the dominant while the other operates closer to being a black market, while not necessarily being an actual black market.<p>Maybe it would be based on cryptocurrency, or a more traditional form of currency that is centralized but isn&#x27;t USD, for instance.  Or someone with a lot of money decides that having dominance over a new economy takes the opportunity and forms their own &quot;competitor&quot; to Visa, but it operates within the economy that Visa decides it doesn&#x27;t want to be a part of.  Then again, maybe Visa one day leaks enough customers that it decides it&#x27;s not worth being as moralistic.')
