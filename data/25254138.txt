You can&#x27;t externally kill a goroutine at arbitrary points (you need to cancel them with a cancel chan &#x2F; context with manual checking). You can&#x27;t prioritize a goroutine over others. You can&#x27;t serialize a goroutine state and send it over the network. You can&#x27;t fork a goroutine. You can&#x27;t sandbox a goroutine. Etc.<p>Using WASM is a tradeoff, but WASM is very fast, surely faster than BEAM process.')
