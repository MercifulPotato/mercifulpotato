Item(by='Veserv', descendants=None, kids=[24911460, 24910986], score=None, time=1603826741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905653, text='What justification do you have for asserting that the safety critical systems are actually separated&#x2F;isolated? The people at Jeep probably thought their systems were secure, yet the researchers on the Jeep Cherokee attack demonstrated they were not and claim that they could have simultaneously affected 471,000(!) vehicles [1]. Do you think anybody at a car company would dare to claim that their systems are safe enough to bet the lives of 471,000 people on them and take responsibility if they were wrong? Do you think any engineer would, in good conscience, support such a statement and share that responsibility if asked directly? I doubt you could find a single engineer that would feel even remotely comfortable that their procedures are good enough for 1&#x2F;100th that number and you would never find an executive who would dare claim such a thing in a legally binding way.<p><i>Absolutely zero benefit of the doubt</i> should be given to systems where a single error could cause grievous harm to tens of thousands of lives. Such systems should require an absolutely ironclad public legally-binding positive assertion of security with strict criminal liability for failure (blame can not be shifted) that is independently validated before we should even think of accepting their use. We already accept nothing less for systems that are less dangerous such as nuclear reactor meltdowns and systems that are equally dangerous such as nuclear weapons systems. If systems with failure modes many times worse than the atomic bombings of Japan can not be made safe, then they <i>must not</i> be made. Anything less would be so criminally irresponsible that we lack a word for the magnitude of irresponsibility.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-hig...</a>')
