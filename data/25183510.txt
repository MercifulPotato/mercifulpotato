Their online shopping platform is a joke. I&#x27;ve had multiple bad experiences, and I&#x27;ll give you one as an example.<p>I ordered an XLR cable from their website and went to pick it up at the store in person. When I arrived, it took about 10 minutes before someone could help me, then they spent several minutes finding someone who could get the cable. That person then walked past a wall of XLR cables for sale, into a back room. I asked &quot;cant we just grab one off that wall?&quot; Nope. Another 20 minutes go by, and the person returns from the back of the store with a cable, and several sheets of paper. This next part is going to sound like a joke from the hitchhiker&#x27;s guide from the galaxy but it&#x27;s very real: they then had to run my card to ensure I was the buyer; I had to sign two forms; and finally I had to have a third form stamped twice. All for a $20 cable.<p>Guitar Center was cool for browsing in person. Beyond that? Trash. Bankruptcy makes perfect sense.')
