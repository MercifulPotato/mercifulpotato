The point I was originally making is that:<p>&#x27;a: &#x27;static is read &quot;&#x27;a outlives &#x27;static&quot; [1]<p>T: &#x27;static is read &quot;T is bounded by &#x27;static&quot; (apparently, although I can&#x27;t find a reference to it).<p>The syntax is the same, the meaning is different.<p>Maybe the &#x27;static part of these two things <i>is</i> the same, but they seem to me to:<p>- mean different things<p>- use the same syntax<p>It is what it is I guess... just confusing as to why it was decided to use <i>the same</i> syntax for these things, instead of something different.<p>You could argue that adding new syntax makes the language more complicated; but I&#x27;m not sure. Does it make it less complicated when you overload the same syntax with multiple different contextual meanings?<p>Opinions probably vary.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;reference&#x2F;trait-bounds.html#lifetime-bounds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;reference&#x2F;trait-bounds.html#lifeti...</a>')
