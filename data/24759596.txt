Item(by='portyllo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602537838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756955, text='There is plenty of bandwidth to achieve more than 1 Gbps of throughput from a 3-U cubesat (see Planet with their latest X-band comms-system [1], which results in more than 50 GB per pass). If you really need more than that, new free space optical communications systems under-development will bring multi-Gbps to small-sats [2]. For me, the real problem with nanosats is that they generate barely no power and they are really volume-constrained compared to the bigger birds (so you cannot have high-resolution sensors, and cannot fit in there a good optical-comms system, you need to be mindful of your power consumption all time during the mission...).<p>Finally, note that nowadays Planet downloads 10 TB&#x2F;day, and they could go up to 40 TB&#x2F;day once they upgrade their fleet with the latest X-band antenna, which is comparable to the 80 TB&#x2F;day that DigitalGlobe generates.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.usu.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=4405&amp;context=smallsat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.usu.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=4...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesat.de&#x2F;images&#x2F;tesat&#x2F;products&#x2F;TOSIRIS_Data-Sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesat.de&#x2F;images&#x2F;tesat&#x2F;products&#x2F;TOSIRIS_Data-Shee...</a>')
