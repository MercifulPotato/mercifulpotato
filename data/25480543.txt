Either you&#x27;re astronomically lucky or you just don&#x27;t pay attention to the detail of whats going on in the game around you. And that&#x27;s fine, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the bugs aren&#x27;t there - it just means you didn&#x27;t notice them. And hell, maybe that&#x27;s to your benefit - I wish I could just not notice the bugs, it sure would make the game a lot funner.<p>&gt;That&#x27;s in 80h so far in the game.<p>FYI it was just discovered that if you play the game for too long, your save file becomes too big and will be corrupted. A moderator on the CDPR forums just said that &quot;the game is intended to be finished within 30-50 hours&quot; and playing longer than that is liable to break your game, and specifically you should avoid using the &quot;Crafting&quot; function at all because it will corrupt your save even faster.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;cyberpunkgame&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kg47yz&#x2F;psa_your_save_file_is_capped_at_8mb_on_all&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;cyberpunkgame&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kg47yz&#x2F;psa_y...</a>')
