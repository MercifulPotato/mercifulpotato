It&#x27;s verified that it really belongs to him, and only he&#x27;s authorized to use it.<p>I think anyone who wants should be able to verify themselves. Whether you are a celebrity or you just think you are because you have 14k twitter followers (grumble grumble).<p>If you become famous overnight, you&#x27;re already have a verified identity for PR, etc.<p>So, I think centralized one-identity that you can control makes a lot of sense and maybe you can always have a kill-switch to set your profile private, or delete&#x2F;wipe the data and control your own privacy.')
