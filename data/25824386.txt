The most straightforward signature of this is the fact that a much higher proportion of Americans work in the healthcare industry than any other large country. The US also tends to consistently lead on the highest utilization of cutting-edge technology (such as ICDs, insulin infusion pumps, linear accelerators, and small bowel transplant) at any given time.<p>Cost per inpatient discharge is exactly in line with a regression of European countries against average household disposable income. (The US having nearly double the household disposable income as Western Europe.) Rather than being some signature of American dysfunction, globally we observe hospital bills rising super-linearly with income levels. This strongly suggests that hospital costs primarily rise because of higher intensity of care per encounter.<p>The strongest counterpoint to this is that despite America&#x27;s high healthcare consumption, that health outcomes are significantly worse than Europe. In particular in terms of life expectancy. But healthcare economists have known for decades that medicine, on the margin, has virtually zero impact on health.[2] The US is an extremely unhealthy country, especially because of obesity. No level of healthcare would ever be able to counteract that.<p>But again this disjointed relation between medicine and health is not an American-specific phenomenon. The ratio of healthcare spending between Norway and Spain is about the same as between the US and Norway. Yet Spaniards enjoys significantly longer life expectancies than their Norwegian counterparts.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;randomcriticalanalysis.com&#x2F;why-conventional-wisdom-on-health-care-is-wrong-a-primer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;randomcriticalanalysis.com&#x2F;why-conventional-wisdom-o...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato-unbound.org&#x2F;2007&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;robin-hanson&#x2F;cut-medicine-half" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato-unbound.org&#x2F;2007&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;robin-hanson&#x2F;cut-med...</a>')
