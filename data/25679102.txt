There are sane defaults that can be used for these things; projects like Mail-in-a-Box do most of that heavy lifting for you. (When all you want is a basic SMTP&#x2F;IMAP&#x2F;webmail server... a standard config can work just fine.) It doesn&#x27;t even necessarily have to be done through a command line.<p>What can&#x27;t so easily be done programmatically is DNS registration, because it involves money changing hands and there&#x27;s no standard &quot;registrar API&quot;. You&#x27;d have to either support an arbitrary number of differently-shaped APIs of different registrars or pick a &quot;blessed few&quot; to support.')
