Nobody has any data to know how the manufacturing costs have changed.<p>There is real chance that total costs for Apple could have increased overall and there is no way to know. Intel was in difficult position over the Apple deal for years, Apple would have negotiated down significantly given their threat to move.<p>For all we know Intel was selling at loss per chip to apple and making it up in other business.')
