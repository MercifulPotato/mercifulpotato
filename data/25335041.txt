The &quot;DPP001 - Live IP Profile&quot; recommendation has a variety of different profiles depending on the importance of the media and the network that&#x27;s involved, but it generally revolves around MPEGTS over RTP, with either dual streaming (sending the same packets down two different networks), or RIST (so a NACK based error correction), or perhaps both. Certainly when I broadcasted major international TV events recently, I&#x27;ve gone for both RIST and two networks.<p>The last thing you want is your signal to drop out for 10 seconds due to a power failure while your network reroutes just as the final touchdown at the superbowl happens - or worse in the the commercials.')
