If someone gains access to only the database and not the salt, the emails are well protected. If someone gains access to both, then it&#x27;s true that they could build a rainbow table to check if a given email exists in the database. What they _can&#x27;t_ do is easily use all the emails in the database for spam&#x2F;phishing&#x2F;etc.<p>Either way, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s better than nothing :)')
