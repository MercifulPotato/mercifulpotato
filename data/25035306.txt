I think it&#x27;s a real problem these days, we are bombarded with things competing to make us into short-attention-spanned dopamine addicts and it screws up our lives badly. The Matthew Crawford books &quot;The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction&quot; and &quot;Shopcraft as Soulcraft&quot; are super interesting reads on this topic.<p>I&#x27;m biased, being a musician, but my experience and many of my colleagues is that musicians are often excellent coders, and I credit this to the fact that you <i>need</i> to master your attention to become a good musician. There is no other way than getting good at putting yourself alone in a room with no distractions and practicing in a focused manner. I remember when I hired a friend of mine (pro bass player) as a junior coder and it was so obvious watching him learn.<p>Personally my top tips for getting better at attention management would be:<p>- Take up an instrument or some other hobby involving regular, quiet, uninterrupted, solo deliberate practice. Do it daily. It becomes your rinse cycle.<p>- Adopt the pomorodoro or other similar technique of doing 20-30 minutes of completely focused, uninterrupted work at a time and then taking a <i>real</i> break for a few minutes. This is both how I work and practice.<p>- Read a lot, on paper.<p>- Run - IMHO way better than lifting for overall mental effects and mental focus<p>- Get enough sleep, religiously<p>my two cents Canadian. :-)')
