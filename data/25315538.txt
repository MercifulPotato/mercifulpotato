And while I generally find Elons Twitter antics amusing to sometimes headscratching I think he is right about the dealership model. EVs in my totally nonscientific off the head mental model probably require 35-50% of the maintenance of ICE vehicles, so Caddy dealers arent really going to be able to make much money if they go strictly EV. I expect a big shift in how cars are sold in the next 20 years. Where I live in Houston there are hundreds of car dealers, I expect that to reduce by a large percentage when&#x2F;if EVs take over.')
