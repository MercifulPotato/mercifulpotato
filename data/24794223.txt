I explained <i>why</i> I don’t think that is helpful.  This is not the same as your begging the question.<p>As to it bring ‘obvious’ - if you’ve read my comments, you’d know that I agree that Apple wouldn’t care about these things if they didn’t make Apple look bad.<p>But that fact doesn’t make it helpful to write snark about them.<p>This entire sub-thread is driven by you not liking the analysis of your snarky original comment that <i>you asked me to provide</i>.<p>I question where the delusion resides.')
