He is one of the sharpest minds in journalism today and is also one of the most objective journalists I&#x27;ve come across. In the past 4 years journalism has become extremely polarized and it&#x27;s next to impossible for many of them to remain objective. As soon as one declares their opinion on something, they&#x27;re skewered by the side opposing the issue. Somehow, Glenn has managed to remain largely objective.')
