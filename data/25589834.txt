The virus was too well adpated to humans initially and has not evolved significantly since its first detection then (D614G and the new variants aside).<p>The animals that carried the virus in the Huanan market were probably just an infected human, and not particularly close to the origin case.<p>It was just detected there because it was a superspreading event that happened in the backyard of the nearby lab.<p>The most plausible explanation I&#x27;ve heard as an origin is that it jumped from bat to human in the process of bat guano farming.  This would have obviously happened in the rural area outside of Wuhan, but the virus found its way through spreading events into the higher density city, where it was eventually detected.  Cryptic spread would have been happening for at least a month or more as it adapted to humans.<p>The furin cleavage site may also be the result of a recombination event between two coronaviruses (coronaviruses don&#x27;t just mutation and reassortment like influenza, they also recombine and dual infection with two coronaviruses in an animal or human can shuffle parts of genes):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvi.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;84&#x2F;7&#x2F;3134?ijkey=b8e66cb01995eeb494ce222da7b25d369dac59c8&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvi.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;84&#x2F;7&#x2F;3134?ijkey=b8e66cb01995eeb4...</a><p>So if you just assume that trajectory from bat guano farming to city center, along with a missing link to provide the furin cleavage site, then the title articles analysis really falls apart.  Not surprising that the bats are far away, the furin cleavage site may be not surprising if we manage to find a similar virus in nature, and mostly what is left is that it wasn&#x27;t detected until it was right on the doorstep of the virology lab (where the virus found the people who were likely to set off the alarm about it) and the rest some mild cover-your-ass at the lab would be entirely expected.<p>But that means that there&#x27;s some bats with answers somewhere outside of Wuhan but China has been stalling efforts to go find them.')
