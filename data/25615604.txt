Maybe future medical bills would be lower. A redistribution of wealth from older people to younger people with more opportunities for growth. I am not calculating the emotional toll for these deaths. It is not a friendly comment that I bring up easily, but it is something that must be considered. Please convince me that I&#x27;m wrong. Let me say that I am not an evil person and do not wish death upon anyone.')
