That costs time and money. In the very low-end, it&#x27;s cheaper to go bare VM. As size and complexity grows, it&#x27;ll be cheaper to go with a cloud provider for a while, until you reach a point where you have so much infrastructure and so many services running that moving parts of it to on-prem will be the cheapest option. At this point, you will be your own little AWS.')
