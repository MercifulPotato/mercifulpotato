Item(by='thxg', descendants=None, kids=[25294903], score=None, time=1607028473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294035, text='&gt; Isnâ€™t solving protein folding np-complete?<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on protein folding, but if you refer to this paper [1], it only claims that one particular optimization problem, <i>believed</i> to give a solution to protein folding problems, is NP-hard. So it is not proven that protein folding is hard (in terms of computational complexity theory), although it <i>does</i> seem likely.<p>&gt; How did this new algo get past that?<p>This is a very frequent and legitimate question due to the widespread misconception that &quot;large NP-hard problems cannot be solved&quot;. Maybe it does not help that the term &quot;intractable&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;not in P&quot;, while that word has obvious connotations outside of complexity theory.<p>To the contrary, for some specific types of NP-hard problems, gigantic instances are routinely solved in a matter of minutes. Prominent examples are knapsack problems, SAT problems [2], and the Traveling Salesman Problem [3] or more generally Mixed Integer Programming [4]. To give you some intuition: yes, the complexity still grows exponentially with the size of the problem, but if the constant factor is really tiny, we may still be able to tackle fairly large instances.<p>&gt; Did it solve p=np too?<p>Definitely not. For that, again, we would need, some formal statement that protein folding as solved there is NP-hard (this seems feasible, but I don&#x27;t know that it has been done). Then, more importantly, we would need a theoretical result showing that the proposed solution method is of polynomial-time complexity -- being able to solve individual instances &quot;quickly&quot; is nice but not entirely relevant to the theoretical complexity side of things.<p>[1] &quot;Complexity of protein folding&quot;, 1993, by Aviezri S.
