There&#x27;s no such way to exert this control over web apps with current browsers.<p>For instance, how to you stop a page from snooping your keystrokes? At best you can disable javascript entirely.<p>The browser really, really, really needs to adopt the sandbox model used by the rest of the operating system for this to make <i>any</i> sense, and right now the browser is more of a gaping hole in your wall than a sandbox.<p>&gt; The user should be allowed to do what they want, right?<p>You&#x27;d need to do a hell of a lot of footwork to actually enable users to make decent decisions about random code found on the internet. I don&#x27;t trust anyone technical I know to do this, much less people who don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on.')
