Each check in into master would then be merged after a code review with you where you ask questions about why implementations are done specific ways to solve the problem&#x2F;refactor. Code is only merged when it hits a quality marker you set. Students are graded by percentage of deliverable hit from original project specs.<p>Ex: student is to implement a K&amp;R C compiler + code generator in 1 semester. Help them break up the project into manageable chunks (tokenize, AST, register allocation, etc). Each feature includes tests, comments, docs, and is presented to you by X date. Code review and cycle as many times as needed as long as it gets in by X date. By the end of the class the student hit 100% of their deadlines but only pass 70% of some test C files you create so they get a 70% (or higher if their code was consistently good and did not need cleanup) in the class or something.<p>It would never work because &quot;you need to have a final exam&quot; but it&#x27;s the ideal I think we should strive for if you are &quot;teaching programming&quot; since this is how most work I&#x27;ve done in the real world has gone.')
