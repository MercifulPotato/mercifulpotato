Rather, if the DMCA requests are not responded to, then the host may be liable for the infringing content as well.  The sequence of events is as follows, with &quot;host&quot; referring to the hosting service, &quot;user&quot; referring to the person who uploaded material, and &quot;lawyer&quot; referring to the person representing the copyright holder.<p>- User uploads material to the host.  Host did not make editorial decisions on the content, and is therefore not liable for infringement in the content (safe harbor).<p>- Lawyer sends DMCA takedown notice, attesting that they believe the content infringes lawyer&#x27;s copyright.  (Does not have to actually infringe, just need to be a statement that they believe it does.)<p>- Host receives notice, and now has a choice.  If they take the material down, they have no legal liability to either user or lawyer.  If they leave it up, lawyer can sue host along with user for infringement.<p>- (Assuming host takes material down), host then notifies user.<p>- User can respond with a counter notice, under penalty of perjury, they believe the takedown notice was mistakenly given.<p>- Host tells lawyer that a counter notice was given.<p>- Lawyer now has a choice.  Option A is to file a lawsuit against user.  In that case, material stays down until the lawsuit concludes.  Option B is to sit in sullen silence.  If no lawsuit is filed in 14 days, host can put material back up without any liability.<p>There are a couple major problems with this.  The original DMCA request isn&#x27;t under penalty of perjury, but the reply is.  The original DMCA request doesn&#x27;t require a copyright to be held, only a &quot;good faith belief&quot; that it infringes.  The duration of 14 days may have made sense in 1998, with large companies being the only media producers, but now that takes a video down for several times the duration of interest, effectively killing it.')
