They certainly look comfortable, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe them as &quot;open, warm, and inviting&quot;. They look halfway between a no-frills dorm and the psychiatric ward I stayed in for a while as a teenager. Certainly far more humane than American prisons, but still clearly _institutional_.')
