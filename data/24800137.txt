People are at their wit&#x27;s ends right now because they cannot do many of the things outside of work that they used to do. If you have a small child, you used to be able to take them with you on errands and impromptu meetups with other parents and families to break up the day and entertain them.<p>Now, many people carefully plan out these occasions to make sure they&#x27;re not bringing anything back home to their own family members. The same can be applied to childcare and even senior care. In normal times, you wouldn&#x27;t have your kids home all day to interrupt you and require help with schoolwork (or even logging into Zoom).<p>Additionally, I&#x27;ve found the hardest part of this year is that there just isn&#x27;t much to look forward to on the weekends - no big group dinners to celebrate birthdays, no vacations to other cities, no bar nights with old friends.')
