Item(by='lucideer', descendants=None, kids=[25288992], score=None, time=1607001718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288424, text='&quot;Strongly typed&quot; and &quot;statically typed&quot; are not synonymous. Yes, SvelteComponentTyped is statically typed, but that&#x27;s somewhat implicit (and irrelevant) here. What they&#x27;re referring to in that particular sentence is ease of strong typing. Static typing is a separate thing.')
