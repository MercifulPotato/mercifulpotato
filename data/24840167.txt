I did have an issue where after a few years it became almost impossible to physically click (still important for click-and-drag operations), though after investigation it turned out that the dying battery was swelling up from below and interfering with the trackpad. So, full marks on the trackpad, but I hope they&#x27;ve ironed out their battery story.')
