From there you can tap the bed icon and you will not receive notifications anymore. You can also dig deeper in to the phone app and stop each app from showing notifications on the watch.<p>Personally I leave on all notifications that would show on my phone because I find looking at my watch less distracting than taking out my phone.<p>If you purely want health features, there are many cheaper options but I&#x27;d be cautious about the accuracy of the sub $100 watches. You might find like me that the watch is useful for a load of things you didn&#x27;t think of. Using apple pay on my watch is slightly nicer than on the phone, setting timers is slightly quicker, checking the weather is slightly quicker, etc.<p>I find myself using the watch a lot for these tasks because its simply faster and lets me get back to what I was doing quicker.')
