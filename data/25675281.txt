They couldn&#x27;t have standing. They alleged that Pennsylvania law violated Pennsylvania constitution. The people who decide whether or not that statement is true is the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which did decide that the alleged violation was not in fact a violation of the state constitution. Even federal courts, when they do hear allegations about state law, are required to give <i>extreme</i> deference to state supreme courts in their interpretation of the matter.<p>Texas has no more right to question Pennsylvania&#x27;s conduct under Pennsylvania legal rules than Iran has to question US conduct under US legal rules. To <i>not</i> dismiss the case would be to say that the rule of the law is <i>literally</i> less important than people&#x27;s feelings. Do you really want to live in a country that does not care about the rule of the law?')
