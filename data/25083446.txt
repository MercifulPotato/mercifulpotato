However, in 2017 only 1 line has really changed position. Now place your finger on 1994 Democrat. Their line has only moved left.<p>Political divide is occurring almost entirely on the Democrat spectrum. The divide started between 2004 and 2011 according to the graphs.<p>The explanation is quite simple. Obama&#x27;s presidency in 2009. That makes this article quite interesting as it was written by the source of the divide.<p>&gt;This contest is not new, of course. In many ways, it has defined the American experience. It’s embedded in founding documents that could simultaneously proclaim all men equal and yet count a slave as three-fifths of a man.<p>The &quot;first black president&quot; was going to have identity politics problem.

It&#x27;s the democrats who are dividing the USA. It&#x27;s the identity politics of Obama that caused the schism.<p>To heal the divide you have to identify the above problem and find the fix. However, one thing is for sure. During a political divide like this, the 2 sides refuse to talk to each other and often make decisions that will only exacerbate the problem.')
