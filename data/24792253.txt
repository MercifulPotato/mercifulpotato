The <i>vast majority</i> of people do not need a 3d printer for more than the occasional part&#x2F;bit that they can&#x27;t get easily at a store.  And by &quot;occasional&quot; I mean &quot;a few times a year&quot;.  It&#x27;s simply not worth the cost, learning curve, hassle, etc. for an inferior part at the end of the day in comparison to an injection molded piece off Amazon&#x2F;eBay or paying someone else a nominal fee to print it for you.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet that probably 90% of people who are initially enthusiastic about printing and buy a printer only use it once a month or less a year later.  In other words, you&#x27;re in the minority here.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that none of the things you mentioned actually require a 3d printer.  Your router mounting bracket could have been made the same way I made mine - a piece of acrylic (or wood), 2 minutes of sawing, and 5 minutes of drilling &amp; tapping for a smoother surface and better strength than what you printed.  Your bike bracket could have been made with some aluminum, a band saw, and some files (or just &quot;good enough&quot; formed with some epoxy putty or hot water moldable plastic). \n Etc.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that 3d printing enthusiasts tend to be overly positive about the technology and fall into the &quot;when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot; trap.  It&#x27;s a great technology, but it&#x27;s not for everyone (or even most people) and it&#x27;s got a lot of limitations.  I always urge people who are considering buying a printer to strongly consider their actual use cases and needs beyond the cool factor.')
