What in the community ensured they didn&#x27;t do it that way? Firefox is open source, and yet it still happened.<p>&quot;Best practices&quot; is such a red herring. Best practices = don&#x27;t write bugs, too; yet there are bugs. You can&#x27;t evaluate a language in theory and ignore what happens in practice any more than you can with any other thing in life. It&#x27;s the UX, does it do what users expect it to do, and is that the lowest friction path possible to achieve the goal. &quot;You&#x27;re not following best practices&quot; is basically &quot;you&#x27;re holding it wrong&quot;. While arguably true, it is an attempt to excuse a bad design decision or impedance mismatch.')
