So while their market cap is $629B, their value is north of $1.5T.<p>Think of it like a house.   If you pay me $200K for my house plus assume my $300K mortgage, then you say that the value of my house was $500K.<p>When comparing values of companies, use the &quot;enterprise value&quot; metric, not the &quot;market cap&quot; metric.   Enterprise value metrics will still show an overpriced Tesla, just slightly less overpriced.')
