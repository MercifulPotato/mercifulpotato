I once, out of nowhere, had a bad bout of panic attacks and subsequent health anxiety.  Every symptom(which were themselves manifesting) led me to believe I was dying.  Literally the only thing that helped was googling the symptom + &quot;anxiety.&quot;. I felt like an idiot googling &#x27;random pinching pain anxiety&#x27;, but found all kinds of accounts.  After reading hundreds of poor folks in my shoes describe everything I was going through, the symptom faded, and I felt peace.  Really weird time for me for sure.  But just know people reading random comments can really put minds at ease.')
