I think they are at their worst point in decades.<p>Nah mate, I don&#x27;t think so. 2008 was worse by far, I think you&#x27;re reaching a little too hard for that one. If the Democrats had expanded their lead in the House, taken 60 Senate seats and expanded their hold on Governor&#x27;s mansions, then this would be close to 2008, but even in that case Obama&#x27;s margin of victory over McCain in both the Electoral College and the popular vote was a fair bit higher.<p>Yeah, the Republicans had their best turnout ever, but so did the Democrats! This was a record-turnout election all around. Turnout was so high that just a little less enthusiasm on one side or a little more animosity or apathy towards another side was enough to flip it around.<p>The only election in which the Republican Party was &quot;destroyed&quot; was the contest for the White House, and they saw some net losses in the Senate but not by anywhere close to the margin anyone thought. They actually gained in the House. 2008 this was not, not even close. Turnout was a lot higher, but the outcome is very different.')
