If I matrix multiply a 2D vector &lt;a, b&gt; by the basis vectors &lt;&lt;0, 1&gt;, &lt;1, 0&gt;&gt;, then I understand I am &quot;weighting&quot; an x, and y unit vector (as defined by my basis) by the x-component and y-component of my &lt;a, b&gt; vector, and then adding them together. So geometrically, I&#x27;m stretching by a factor of a, and b, then summing to get my resulting vector.<p>So, the way I&#x27;m trying to think of it geometrically is: any matrix is just a representation of some kind of basis (i.e some kind of linear system). I picture this as a sort of orthogonal cartesian grid that we squish and stretch while still being a series of intersecting parallel lines.<p>Matrix multiplication, is therefore taking in some vector, and &quot;weighting&quot; the basis vectors represented by our matrix by the components of that vector, and then summing them. To put it another way, we&#x27;re essentially mapping a vector into that new basis system represented by our matrix.<p>Is that correct? Is there a better way to try and think of matrix multiplication geometrically?')
