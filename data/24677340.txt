Item(by='sizzle', descendants=None, kids=[24687104], score=None, time=1601801205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670748, text='A big middle finger to my ~top 20 public university who wouldn&#x27;t give me any accommodations of extra time because they required some ridiculous hoops to jump through proving I had trouble concentrating and finishing an exam in the allotted time, they wanted substantial documentation with brain scans showing I had a deficit all because ADHD isn&#x27;t considered a bonafide disability by the government. I almost flunked out cause of some calculus and organic&#x2F;biochemistry classes that required tons of rote memorization (pre-med before switching to computer major).<p>Even though I&#x27;m successful now in tech with a huge salary, this experience of being treated like I had a made-up disorder (can&#x27;t easily perceive it with no physical impairment&#x2F;more obvious mental issues), and was invisible to the system full of cold-hearted academic administrators quick to academically disqualify me still makes me seethe and feel wronged to this very day.<p>Can anyone relate?')
