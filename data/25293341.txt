My older 34&quot; ultra wide next to it is really showing its age, both in terms of overall quality and 110 PPI.  The newer LG 34&quot; that is 5K2K is not horrible at 164 psi.<p>If Apple just sold there 27&quot; display for 1500 bucks or something they would make a killing for folks who want a really nice pro display but don&#x27;t need the overkill of the Pro Display XDR.')
