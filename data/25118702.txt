The fact that packet-level firewalls work is reassuring.<p>Yeah, actually it makes me feel like the complaints I was reading previously were inaccurate or at least overstated. If I understand the facts right, macOS has both a traditional firewall (like Linux does) and also a system-wide content blocking API (which Linux does not). If you make changes to the firewall, anything you block <i>will be blocked</i>, including requests from trusted Apple applications. Certain system applications bypass the content blocking API.<p>Honestly this seems entirely <i>reasonable</i>, in fact. They seem like two different tools for two different purposes. And given that most other operating systems don&#x27;t have built in content-blocking APIs <i>at all</i>, as far as I know, I think the framing of Apple&#x27;s decision as some kind of power grab is deeply misleading.<p>Let me know if I&#x27;m misunderstanding the substance of the Mullvad post.')
