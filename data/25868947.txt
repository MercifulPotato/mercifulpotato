I was a government employee for a year and so many things just sit and rot in a pile waiting to be addressed.<p>I sent a letter asking for info on a family member to the government archivist, and I am likely to get an answer in 2023 or 2024.<p>When I was in government, I worked in parking management. We just kept generating an ever bigger backlog of images to process.<p>Granted, neither of those are particularly high priority, but my point is that lagging government is a problem all over the place.<p>There are probably many waiting lists like this species one which are causing substantial harm because nothing can get prompt attention.')
