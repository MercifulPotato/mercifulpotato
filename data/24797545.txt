(I think that, even among a group of strong mathematicians, a rule like &quot;say &#x27;lucky&#x27; whenever you play a prime-numbered card&quot; is medium-high difficulty.)  Some difficulty comes from having to remember a growing set of new rules; when playing for a long time, I think people tended to say &quot;start afresh with the base rules&quot; after every 4-7 games.')
