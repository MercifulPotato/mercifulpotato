If your road was represented by basically a single texture that has 9 equal size quadrants, then you could pull out the 4 corners and two straight sections out of this easily.<p>That would also lend itself well to the railing sections, where you could pull out the 8 railing pieces from the perimeter, and the one non-railing piece from the centre.<p>By specifying it as one texture in a coherent and standardized way, you would both avoid both needing to painstakingly declare all the texture metadata, and have a clear system where the similar directional sets can be defined and used in the same way to either flood fill or to make road-like things.
