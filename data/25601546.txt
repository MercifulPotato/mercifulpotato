OK, maybe I do know why. Clickbait. Any time you can make astronomy look like there may be a hint of aliens, it&#x27;s tantalizing and leads to clicks. I don&#x27;t blame the scientists for thisâ€¦ it&#x27;s the news headline writers.<p>Unfortunately working in favor of the clickbait is the fact that certainly scientists won&#x27;t say that the above simple explanation is definitively what is happening, because it hasn&#x27;t been tested yet. But you can bet they are looking into simple possibilities like this. And no aliens or Dyson spheres are required.')
