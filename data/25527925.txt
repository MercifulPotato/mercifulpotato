Piano apps will be easy and cheap, but they have their limitations. Marketing and comments like the parent make it seem like you can just substitute a teacher and practice by using these apps. I also imagine that people can get frustrated if they see that after tons of practice they still don&#x27;t sound how they like and they don&#x27;t have a lot of tools to improve by themselves, because you don&#x27;t get those tools from apps.<p>And you&#x27;re not really understanding me. I don&#x27;t feel like these apps cheapen my effort. I just wish I knew the things I talk about in my comment earlier so that I could have taken the piano classes I had more seriously and I wouldn&#x27;t have to suffer now the lack of technique, exercise and repertoire I have now.')
