I did indeed get a ton of value from that back in the day.<p>For most of what I do the symbol is defined&#x2F;used in the same file, so a simple `*` (Shift + 8) will get what I need it, but when it doesn&#x27;t then I&#x27;m relegated to grep (I actually use a tool I wrote myself called findref[1]).  It gets me 70 to 80 percent of the way there, but that&#x27;s it.<p>To me that&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; that when combined with the other benefits of plain vim over an IDE (especially ability to work over SSH like it&#x27;s local, which I do a lot), it&#x27;s worth it to me.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreedomBen&#x2F;findref" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreedomBen&#x2F;findref</a>')
