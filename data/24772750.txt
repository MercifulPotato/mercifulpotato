He got frustrated by upstream KDE not merging his extensive refactorings on a timeline that worked for to him and is now trying to out-compete the original. Roman Gilg&#x27;s blog is a good read on that matter.<p>Both parties seem very reasonable to me. So far, the jury is still out on where things will end up - KWinFT has some good momentum and ideas, while upstream KWin with David Edmundson and other steady contributors are also continuing to fix lots of Wayland issues with every release. Either way it looks like we&#x27;ll be in a good spot soon.')
