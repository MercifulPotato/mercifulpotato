There are simply better alternatives out there.<p>Matlab and Octave are too &quot;standalone&quot; and too &quot;slow&quot; to implement into any real-time trading model.<p>I saw two big use cases for them 10 years ago,<p>1: writing Neural networks from scratch where you culd apply vectorized operations over multiple data at the same time.<p>2: Engineering work as Matlab had a huge, and just as importantly, well tested set of fortran functions for almost any engineering discipline.<p>Both of those uses cases were supplanted by other tools.  The former by tensorflow, pytorch, pandas and numpy.<p>The later by excel in alot of instances but also the python eco system of numpy and bespoke libraries on top')
