The likelihood of actually coming across a speed trap is tiny, the likelihood of coming across a speed trap that isn&#x27;t one of the ones that are regularly used is close to 0. So it&#x27;s not like people who speed get fined. It&#x27;s people who speed and get unlucky get fined (and points). I just think it&#x27;s bad policy to have relatively huge penalties and relatively rubbish enforcement. It&#x27;s capricious and ineffective. People still speed because being caught is highly unlikely, people who get caught face a penalty that is disproportionate for something so common. The increase of tools like this don&#x27;t actually address that. Tools like this don&#x27;t actually address the policy failure in speed enforcement.')
