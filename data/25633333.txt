There is a chance that this business knew they were doing something borderline dodgy in a grey area and Facebook started to weed those &quot;bad&quot; actors out in the moment of heat. I&#x27;m not implying that this is the case for sure, but it&#x27;s not entirely impossible to imagine. Perhaps it&#x27;s good that when governments take action and put pressure on FAANGs that they are even prepared to cancel a 57M customer if that means staying in business for themselves.')
