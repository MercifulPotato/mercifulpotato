When something doesn&#x27;t work they come to me, and it often goes like this (with quotes from the article):<p>First stage: someone else&#x27;s fault.<p><i>&quot;the problem is environmental: a network topology issue, a bad or missing connection string&quot;</i><p>Second stage: magical things, but not my code.<p><i>&quot;Not my code ... the problem occurs somewhere in the framework&quot;</i><p>Third stage: acceptance.<p><i>&quot;Global variables are evil. Who knew? ... It took me hours to find the bug, and ten seconds to fix it.&quot;</i>')
