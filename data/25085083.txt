Don’t insert any commentary attempting to justify anything in this part, it just comes off as defensive. Instead just outline what happened though you can include the immediate cause of decisions you made.<p>“Because I was worried about how people would react to X I decided to do Y”<p>Then after that you can write all the stuff that they list in this post.<p>I think it helps a lot to get the audience into the same situation you where in in their minds before understanding the context of how you actually screwed up.')
