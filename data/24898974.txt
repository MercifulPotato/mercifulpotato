Without rocketcrab, not only do you have to design and develop a game, it will be all for nothing if you can&#x27;t find players to play your game, which is tough! The idea is that adding your game to rocketcrab will help it find an audience! if that makes sense :)<p>Also I have a giant list of mobile web party games that I want to try to add but haven&#x27;t had the time. If anyone wants to give it a shot, rocketcrab PRs are open ;D<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1OESjJwnSVhYH84mrA9LH0hB7-rdjJK8KVa1vQKmBTGs&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1OESjJwnSVhYH84mrA9LH...</a>')
