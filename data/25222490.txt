This lets you do things like seamlessly migrate a VM from one host to another, or do a high availability thing with multiple synchronized instances and automatic failover (VMWare called this all &quot;vMotion&quot;). In any case, lots of bandwidth to the storage, but also high latency, at least relative to a locally-connected SATA or PCIe SSD.<p>So yeah, if that&#x27;s your setup, you don&#x27;t have much of an option in between your SAN and allocating an in-machine ramdisk, which will be super fast and low latency, but also extremely high cost.')
