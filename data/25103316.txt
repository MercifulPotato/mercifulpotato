I&#x27;m eagerly awaiting to hear about these solutions.<p>They have much longer than 9 years to get the infrastructure right.<p>The average car age in the US is roughly 12 years old.  I imagine is is roughly the same in the UK.  That means even if they stop selling new ICE cars in 2030 the average car might still be an ICE into the 2040s.  Assuming no further restrictions it probably wouldn&#x27;t be until the 2050s that it would become truly difficult to find a used ICE car.<p>Obviously the UK would need to improve in the meantime, but they would basically have 30 years to get their EV infrastructure into the position it works for every car owner.')
