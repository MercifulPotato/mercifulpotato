I regularly charge any of two dozen USB device in my house from any of a half dozen smart chargers, using too many micro-B cables to count, and it has been months since I spent even one moment thinking about compatibility among them all. This kind of setup was already common.<p>My USB-C devices are the ones I need to worry about. All of the chargers I&#x27;ve bought (not the ones that came with devices) have at least one USB-C port, but the charger I have in my bedroom is too weak for the laptop I&#x27;m using in the family room right now, which is precisely why they stay in different rooms. And then there&#x27;s the Switch, as others have mentioned. At least for the devices I own, USB-C is far more differentiated&#x2F;fragmented than USB-B. The <i>only</i> thing that&#x27;s unified is the physical connector.<p>ETA: I see a lot of other comments saying they don&#x27;t have problems. Almost to a one, they seem to be Mac users talking about fairly static setups, and recommend &quot;top of the line&quot; (i.e. expensive) docks etc. I suggest that those experiences are even less representative of the typical non-HN user than my own.')
