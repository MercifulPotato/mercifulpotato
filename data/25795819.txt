By saying that everybody struggles I did not mean &quot;Stop wining because it&#x27;s worse for others&quot;. What I meant was, we all go thorough periods when our spoons are not enough, and that this is totally okay. Going trough difficulties and thinking you are the only one is harmful and feeling alone in such circumstances is unnecessary because we all find our self there sometimes.')
