Synchronously managing people in distant time zones is no fun, and trying to do it asynchronously is really inefficient. There may be a solution to this &#x27;problem&#x27;, but until they come up with it, letting people work remotely from their homes in the same city isn&#x27;t a slippery slope to all jobs being off-shored.<p>Or, probably more accurately, it is a slippery slope, but not a very steep one. I do believe that jobs (and wages) are going to get distributed differently in the future. But, I&#x27;m hopeful that it&#x27;ll be an improvement over having every high-paying job be in the same 5 dystopian cities.')
