People normal say that Apple lock you into their ecosystem, but that&#x27;s not the main reason I generally choose Apple product. My reasoning is: That the hell else do you suggest I buy?<p>Windows is still to this day physically cramping up my hand when I use it. It&#x27;s a slow incoherent mess. I love Linux, on servers, but I really don&#x27;t want to manage my laptop and the desktop environments are still worse than macOS.<p>For hardware, the minute you want a good screen and trackpad, you might as well just get a MacBook of some sort, the price will be more or less the same and I get macOS.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound like an Apple fanboy, there are other great products out there. Generally speaking though, if I just want my stuff to work, and work together, I don&#x27;t have many options.')
