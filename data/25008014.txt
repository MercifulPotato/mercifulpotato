In the case of startups, it&#x27;s the investors that control consensus. In the case of the market, it&#x27;s the market manipulators that do it, in conjunction with public opinion.<p>As long as public opinion holds that Bitcoin is valuable and it continues to be a secure solution that doesn&#x27;t require edge case handling (which increases risk) then there&#x27;s no reason anyone shouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a reliable store of immutable values in the near term.')
