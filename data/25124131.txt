It&#x27;s a very nice explanation.<p>But everywhere I see, Godel&#x27;s theorem is touted as some kind of deep philosophical insight, whereas from what I understand, informally it could be rephrased as &quot;if you have a usable language for mathematical proofs, some phrases in that language must be neither true nor false (i.e. nonsensical)&quot;.<p>Nonsensical phrases in our human languages in nothing new, so the conclusion becomes that much less exciting. Though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s valuable for fundamental math theory.')
