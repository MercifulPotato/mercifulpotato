The network service and billing are done through various providers which compete on price. The ADSL <i>line</i> is monopolized by BT Openreach, who combine the efficiency of a state monopoly with the pricing of a private monopoly.<p>The government periodically gives BT money to improve speeds. BT pay this money to shareholders and then fail to improve speeds. Both parties are apparently happy with this arrangement.<p>One of the candidates at the last election promised free high-speed broadband to the country. Media commentators agreed that this was ludicrous pie-in-the-sky.')
