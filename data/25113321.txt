I have learned a lot about AOE from watching L_clan (mostly L_Clan_Chris but others as well!) replays back in 2004-2008 when I was playing a lot of Age. Never had Zone access, so we lived in a little bubble in our university of LAN AoE players with outside ideas, build orders etc. coming from watching pro replays.<p>No twitch obviously and very few blogs going around for strategy as well. It&#x27;s amazing to see how far gaming has come in 15 years.')
