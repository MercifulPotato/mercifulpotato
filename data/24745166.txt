Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=[24745546], score=None, time=1602417120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745092, text='&gt; Aerodynamics and safety legislation about things like gaps between engine and bonnet (hood) are harsh mistresses.<p>Yeah, but it is also a bit of an excuse for everyone just copying a model that sold well in the previous year. You can find &quot;sport&quot; cars which are still pretty different and yet perfectly obey the legislations.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not a car guy<p>I&#x27;m not either. I probably only step in a car once a year (I do everything by bike).<p>However, we are talking about aesthetics. External aesthetics. That is, what is exposed and seen by others: other car drivers, motorbike riders, bicycle riders, pedestrians, horse riders, everyone passing by. The huge majority of the time, cars are just parked with no one inside.<p>This exposition is continuous. The number of cars in my country has doubled since the 80s (despite basically every home having a car already then). It is aggravated by the fact that nowadays the paint jobs are much more resistant and many people don&#x27;t bother parking the cars in a garage or any kind of shelter and just leave them in the street, in the public space. Even in the country, in my village, the streets &amp; roads are now surrounded by a never ending line of parked cars.<p>Those wheeled devices are seen much more than what they are used.')
