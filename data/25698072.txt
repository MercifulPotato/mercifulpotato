Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610174733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25697002, text='&gt;  Clearly the way forward is to entrust silicon valley to regulate speech. Thanks for your insight.<p>That&#x27;s an unhelpful strawman, but I&#x27;m sorry if the tone of my response to you was not constructive and disincentivized you engaging with it more seriously.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I would prefer if silicon valley companies relied on the court system to decide what content to censor (or rather, kept up any content they thought was legal until required not to by a court order).  Of course, spam and data which exploits software vulnerabilities should be filtered without a court order, on the basis that no reasonable person wants to receive that.<p>My actual intended point was quite narrow, namely that it would be practically impossible, specifically in the case of Trump&#x27;s tweets, for an aggrieved party to challenge his tweets in court.  However, I suppose it may be possible to bring the case against Twitter itself, and have the DOJ fight on Trump&#x27;s behalf.<p>&gt; Two out of three Democrats also claim Russia tampered with vote tallies ... are you interested in holding anybody to account for that?<p>Do you mean holding Russians to account for tampering, or holding Democrats to account for believing a narrative, or unspecified other actors for &quot;tricking&quot; Democrats into believing this narrative (which we&#x27;ll say, for the sake of argument, is a false narrative)?<p>I assume you mean the latter of those three interpretations, but I can&#x27;t imagine who you would want to hold accountable, or by whom, or what the process or punishment should be.  Surely we agree that neither social media companies nor the government should be punishing people for spreading &quot;false&quot; narratives (at least if those narratives don&#x27;t come with implicit encouragement to commit crimes)?')
