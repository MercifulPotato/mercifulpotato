But the UI is severely lacking along with feature set.<p>Telegram feels like it&#x27;s adding something new every few months, though the documentation over the features is poor since it&#x27;s mostly through announcements. It&#x27;s also a lot more customizable. I ultimately settled on Telegram because it was a good balance of feature-rich and crypto (when you use it)<p>That being said, it was hard enough to get a small group of friends to transition to Telegram. Signal would be much harder due to not having so many niceties.<p>I wish both to continue competing against each other, though. It&#x27;s great to have choices that aren&#x27;t owned by the big corporations.')
