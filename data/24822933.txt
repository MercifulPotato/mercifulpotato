These companies don&#x27;t just sell email but also phone numbers and sometimes address for sales prospecting. As someone who works in sales, I would hate it if these tools went away.<p>But GDPR and CCPA ban this practice as far as I know. So, how are these tools still legal ?<p>I am not being critical only curious :)')
