Most people don&#x27;t know who owns what!<p>For example, Russians owns a bunch of funds in US mutual funds, and us big oil owns a lot stakes in Russian oils.  So the whole idea that we are still living in the idea of nation state is over!  Private company (like Federal reserve) has their own military.<p>Trump signed the moon mining order: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;trump-moon-mining-space-resources-executive-order.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.space.com&#x2F;trump-moon-mining-space-resources-exec...</a><p>We are pretty much back to West&#x2F;East India Company ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;East_India_Company" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;East_India_Company</a>\n) in the process of becoming a multi-planetary civilisation.<p>Most things are hidden behind attorney-client privilege and ran by a hand full of law-firms for the elite rich people.

Hope everyone will exercise some constrains and respect the due process even for those who have done so much bad things.')
