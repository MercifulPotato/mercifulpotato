But, if the court rules that Oracle owns a copyright to the Java APIs, and that this means they can prevent others from implementing their own versions of those APIs, and this right remains in effect even though they release a full implementation of them under GPLv2, then I can&#x27;t see any particular reason to expect that things would work differently for Amazon&#x27;s APIs and Apache2.')
