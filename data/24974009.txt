We specialize in a holistic approach to launching new software products inspired by Human Centered Design and Lean UX. We partner with top innovation and design firms (like IDEO) to bring startup best practices in launching ambitious new products into market. Our teams include CTO consulting, Software Development, UX&#x2F;UI, team building, and Product Management. We work with large and small companies&#x2F;startups on projects ranging from 2-12 months with 2-7 people on each project.<p>We build full stack web, mobile, IoT, physical installations, etc. Our favorite stack is React, React Native, GraphQL, and Rails. We also use a wide range of other tech as needed since we face a pretty diverse set of challenges. Recent and upcoming examples: Flutter, Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix, .Net, Native iOS&#x2F;Swift, Android&#x2F;Kotlin.<p>Working at Blackbird is very different from larger product companies. We operate in very strategic relationships with our clients and partners which gives us all a unique opportunity every few months to deep dive into a new interesting understanding of our client&#x27;s business and build ground up new apps where everyone is making major and early contributions. It is very satisfying and fun work!<p>We are looking for Senior and Lead Fullstack Developers excited about building great software products, who are great teammates, and who are passionate about continuously refining best practices for creating successful digital products. Experience in dev team leadership, new product development, collaboration with business and design stakeholders, and consulting experience are all a huge plus. Specific skills ideally include our favorite stack (at least very interested in learning) plus (nice to have) expertise in one of .NET&#x2F;C#, iOS&#x2F;Swift, or Android&#x2F;Kotlin. We work remotely but occasional travel to San Francisco and other locations is part of the job for project kickoffs and other critical collaboration phases or meetings.<p>Interested? We want to hear from you! Please send resume&#x2F;CV or LinkedIn to jobs@blackbird.us. I am a founder so ask me anything! If there are other aspects of what we do that interest you definitely still hit me up!')
