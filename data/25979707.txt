I&#x27;m currently using the free trial since I signed up for it around Jan 15th. I am using the standard plan on AWS (US East Ohio).<p>Snowflake charges $2 per credit in compute costs on their standard plan and $40&#x2F;TB&#x2F;month in storage. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snowflake.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snowflake.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a> for more details. Since the beginning of my trial, I have used 9 credits and 40GB of storage. So I have used about (9 * 2) + ((40 &#x2F; 1000) * 40) = $19.60 worth of resources so far. This isn&#x27;t terrible but I must caution you that Snowflake costs could balloon pretty fast. That&#x27;s why I also set up a resource monitor on my account to stop all warehouses when the number of credits reaches 20. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.snowflake.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;user-guide&#x2F;resource-monitors.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.snowflake.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;user-guide&#x2F;resource-monitors.h...</a><p>I would recommend if you were going to go my route, to setup resource monitors, and only use XSMALL warehouses which consume 1 credit &#x2F; hour. Snowflake sizes warehouses in t-shirt sizes, and the credits consumed doubles each size up. So XSMALL = 1 credit per hour, SMALL = 2, MEDIUM = 4, LARGE = 8, XLARGE = 16, 2XLARGE = 32, 3XLARGE = 64 and 4XLARGE = 128.')
