I personally witnessed one of the two startups I worked for fail as a result of code quality. Things ended up being too slow and error prone for some of our customers, and eventually they left us behind. We tried to attract new customers, we had amazing feature set after all, but the performance&#x2F;stability hole ended up being too big to dig ourselves out of before we ran out of money.<p>I agree that the poster likely focused too much on it, but it&#x27;s definitely not something you can ignore completely with the assumption you&#x27;ll always have extra time later to go back and fix things.')
