A rule that is essential in one context invariably leads to absurdity in others (there are many examples involving people strapped to train tracks). So an attempt at formalizing this will not just be ambiguous, but likely unsound and contradictory. While mathematics seem to be this perfect structure encoded in the fabric of the universe, just waiting for us to discover and describe it, ethics in contrast seems to be a very fuzzy, imperfect, ad-hoc creation of mankind.')
