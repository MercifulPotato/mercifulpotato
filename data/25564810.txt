You can get a single tape drive for under $300 and enterprise grade single tape drives for under $3k.<p>Those tapes only hold 200 GB, and you can get a 10 TB hard drive today for less than $300:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;red-wd101efax-10tb&#x2F;p&#x2F;N82E16822234407" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;red-wd101efax-10tb&#x2F;p&#x2F;N82E16822234407</a><p>While tapes are <i>theoretically</i> cool, the the drives are just too rare for them to be of any practical value to a home user.  Even if the media has a better archival life than a hard disk (say 50 years), it won&#x27;t do you a damn bit of good if there are no drives available in 50 years to read it.<p>IMHO, hard drives are better for backup (even offline backup, just get a hot-swap bay and imagine the drive is tape [1]).  Archival is a harder problem, but I&#x27;ve settled on using high-grade optical media, burned slow for fewer errors, making a bunch of redundant copies.  Even though the media might not last as long, I&#x27;m pretty much guaranteed to be able to find a drive for the next several decades [2].<p>[1] &quot;pretend this hard drive is a tape&quot; is even an enterprise product: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RDX_Technology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RDX_Technology</a><p>[2] For instance, you can still attach a 5.25 floppy drive to a modern computer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_nkw=5.25+floppy+drive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_nkw=5.25+floppy+drive</a> + <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deviceside.com&#x2F;fc5025.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deviceside.com&#x2F;fc5025.html</a>')
