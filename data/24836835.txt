They’re always a waste of time.  I used to work as a customer service rep once, and apparently we had some kind of voice menu that people had to go through to get to us, but either they didn’t implement the connection to the humans or it broke at some point because we had no access to whatever they told it by the time they got to a human.  They all had to give it their account numbers and whether they were placing an order, calling about a past order, etc, but all that info was just discarded before we picked up the phone.  Because it’s just as fast for me to just say, “how can I help you” and listen to the answer as it would be to try to have the computer relay that to me secondhand from what the menu system picked up.  It just wasted a few minutes of their time before it tossed them all to us anyway.  I assume every customer service voice menu is the same.  Maybe the management felt that the customers time is worthless since they don’t have to pay for it.')
