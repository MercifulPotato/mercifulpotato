They&#x27;ve done this by downzoning the city, refusing to build anything more. This means that <i>only</i> the wealthy get to live there. Prime example is Haight-Ashbury downzonings.<p>When there isn&#x27;t enough room for everybody, the rich get served first. So everytime somebody protests a new housing development which adds to the supply, they are advocating for the rich to stay, and to kick out the same number of people that would otherwise occupy those units.<p>In the 20th century, we declared housing a human right. But in San Francisco, we have declared that only the wealthy should be able to afford housing, and that the everybody else should leave.')
