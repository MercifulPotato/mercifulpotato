What does even “capability to act in a certain environment” mean? Is a function&#x2F;method something with “capability to act in a certain environment”? Is a C++ class that??<p>Also:<p>&gt; It is also a category error to treat them as “real objects” since “real objects” and “programming objects” have little connection with each other ontologically.<p>Mate, you link to the Wikipedia article about categorical errors, where it says that a CE is defined as comparing things that are ontologically different, thus showing your whole sentence as a tautology.
