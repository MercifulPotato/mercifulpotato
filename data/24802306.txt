I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not entirely responsible for dyslexia - but it can&#x27;t help. Having taken a little Spanish, I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s also easier to identify verbs, no letters are silent, nouns typically don&#x27;t share spelling with their verb forms, gender affects other words. There are a lot of helpers in Spanish (and I&#x27;m guessing french) that just tend to help people navigate words and letters better.')
