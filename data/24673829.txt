The results from all machine learning algorithm can be very misleading and probably some models will overfit the data.<p>So, if you throw some data and fit all machine learning models on it and then compare the performance. You will probably receive misleading values since different models require different tuning approaches. It&#x27;s not as easy as you said it, you can&#x27;t just feed data (also depends on the data) to models and expect to get the best model at the output.<p>One approach I can think of here is to integrate cross validation and hyperparameter tuning with your suggestion. However, I can imagine that this can be computationally expensive. I will take it into consideration as an enhancement for the tool. Thanks for your feedback')
