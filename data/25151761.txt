Item(by='kkylin', descendants=None, kids=[25153617], score=None, time=1605806495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151518, text='Not arguing with your point, because it has merit, but do want to add that part of the problem with math education (at least here in the US) is structural: for most students, to start with what they know when they enter and to graduate <i>in 4 years</i> with a engineering &#x2F; science &#x2F; math &#x2F; CS degree that means something, there is just too much to &quot;cover.&quot;  So we tend to cover &quot;methods and tools,&quot; e.g., calculus first, with the motivation (e.g., electrical circuits or statistical regression or what have you) later.  This lack of context makes it very hard to see how things fit together.  For my own part, I usually learned the material from one course when I needed to use it in a subsequent course -- it&#x27;s in going back to review the material when I really learn it.<p>Edit: also want to add that providing context in early courses isn&#x27;t always easy, because students are much more diverse now in their career plans.  It used to be (this tells you how old I am) that many of the students taking calculus would also be taking (or have taken) a calculus-based physics course.  Those days are long gone.')
