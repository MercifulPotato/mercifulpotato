Social media isn’t the problem: people are.<p>The internet was supposed to bring us all together as one global community based on our shared interests. Instead it’s created ghettoes and echo chambers where people of all political stripes work together to reinforce their existing prejudices.<p>We as a society are going to have to figure out how we want to deal with this because it’s not going away. The idea of government policing what people say on the internet is anathema to most people here, and with good reason.
