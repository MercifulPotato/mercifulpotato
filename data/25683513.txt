But when you&#x27;re a certain age there&#x27;s something particularly magical about the experience of waking up in the morning, finding the little door for today, opening it up and having the little (vaguely) christmas-themed chocolate shape.<p>As an adult, I have to say that for me doing AoC brought back a little of that magic. It helped that the problems unlocked at 6am in my timezone so I&#x27;d wake up, hack on the problem for an hour or so then walk my dog and get ready for work. It was also nice having a collective experience, knowing that not only 5-6 of my colleagues but thousands of other people across the globe were all going through the same problem at the same time. I really liked that feeling.<p>So yeah Project Euler has very compact, well-written, well-designed, challenging problems in spades ... but AoC is a very specific sort of event that I must admit I look forward to more and more each year :-)')
