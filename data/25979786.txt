Matrix today has more communities than XMPP today. It&#x27;s a pity that XMPP&#x27;s hopes were dashed by the EEE of Google and Facebook, but I think if we want to make people move towards a decentralised protocol, we need to pick one, and I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend my energy on reversing the direction of XMPP when Matrix is heading in the right direction.')
