Again, it depends on what your definition of &quot;best&quot; is. If not enough people in Toronto think it&#x27;s important enough to have a robust public transit system, then it doesn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m very confident Toronto has the resources required to complete an ambitious project if desired.\n&gt;If the project isn&#x27;t a good use of resources, indecision and inaction is the better outcome.<p>I wish I shared your confidence, but this suggests otherwise:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toronto.citynews.ca&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;transit-the-number-1-issue-for-toronto-voters-polls-find&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toronto.citynews.ca&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;transit-the-number-1-...</a><p>I find it difficult to accept that this is the best outcome by any metric I can think of.<p>&gt;Unlike in China, these discussions already happen regularly, and the key difference between the status quo in China and the West is the decision making process, so that&#x27;s where the conversation is focused.<p>Is it? The conversation is focused on how China is authoritarian, not on how the Western (I really should say North American) decision-making process often leads to poor outcomes and stagnation when it comes to public projects.<p>This IS getting pretty far off-topic from the actual article, so I&#x27;ll stop here.')
