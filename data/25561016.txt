Is this related to that, in spirit if not in direct affiliation?<p>One problem I have with BIFL is that the people who post are usually posting an older version of the product that has survived through time. However, many times manufacturers will change up the product to be worse such that if you bought the same product today, it would not last as long as the older version did. In other words, people posting on BIFL are exhibiting survivorship bias. Is this something that can be solved here?')
