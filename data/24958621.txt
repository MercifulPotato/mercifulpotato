The word summoned an image of clinics, often in seedy parts of town.<p>I mean that&#x27;s what I know methadon from. Always has been and still is.<p>And I also know that it&#x27;s not like a &quot;safe&quot; replacement for heroin to kick yourself off. It&#x27;s absolute shit. But it helps with the heroin withdrawal, which is absolutely worse.<p>(not that I have any experience with heroin addiction, but I know some people that work at these addict care centres, that distribute methadon (not sure how this works though))')
