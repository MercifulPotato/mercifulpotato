Here we have an example of a gene that became shorter (probably due to a mutation (deletion, change or insertion) in the middle causeing a stop to be encoded) and lead to a significant improvement, even to the extend that it resulted in a new species. Even if creationist accept that evolution is possible to some extend like we see in dogs, they argue that it cannot lead to the development of new species. Now some people, especially those from pro-life camps who usually support the idea of evolution, are having ethical problems, because they feel that due to a generative mutation a new species of ape has been created.')
