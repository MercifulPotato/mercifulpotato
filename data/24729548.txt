We remember the alliance ending and the battles starting around people like Darwin and Galileo. I suspect this is more to do with religion, and science also, being used by people who want power.  Any time you here someone talking about believing the science or proving something with a holy book, ignore them. Real science needs no belief, and real faith needs no proof.')
