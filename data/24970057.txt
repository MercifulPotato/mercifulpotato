In the process of creating this bridge, we&#x27;ve had to build many and varying tools and services, from cloud services (balenaCloud) to desktop utilities (balenaEtcher), to operating systems (balenaOS), single-board computers (balenaFin), and more.<p>Right now, we&#x27;re particularly interested in Simulation &amp; Modeling. We strongly believe that state-of-the-art business modeling is a long way behind where it could be. A business is a system rather than a machine, nonlinear, turbulent, and dynamic in a way that cannot be expressed using traditional methods. However, the tech and mental toolkits that could allow us to capture such complexity in a model and show us where a business’ levers are and what drives its growth exist. If you’d like to help us build this model, let us know by applying here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;balena&#x2F;j&#x2F;A13B328FC6&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;balena&#x2F;j&#x2F;A13B328FC6&#x2F;</a><p>We’re also looking for a Lead Security Engineer to guide our ongoing efforts to create a solid foundation for secure-by-default products, infrastructure, and operations. For us, security is a team effort, and we are looking for someone as passionate as we are about fostering a culture of shared responsibility for security to help us scale sustainably.
