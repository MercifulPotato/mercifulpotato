I remember having to fuss with autoexec.bat and config.sys to squeeze a few more kilobytes of ram to get certain games to run (looking at you, wing commander) and having to worry about the difference between “expanded” and “extended” memory, and so on.  Windows 95 and it’s descendants didn’t make things much better- now in addition to the actual file system there are virtual file systems (the registry) that frequently get out of sync with the actual one, causing additional problems.  It’s an impressive achievement if macs really were this easy to use!')
