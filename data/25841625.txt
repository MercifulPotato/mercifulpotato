We have a market that has been increasingly weaponized to continue the old traditions of Jim Crow and segregation. Lots of people will ask &quot;WTF happened in 1971?&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wtfhappenedin1971.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wtfhappenedin1971.com&#x2F;</a> ), but I find it impossible to do that without considering its implications around the Fair Housing Act of 1968 or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974. Modern America uses the economy to make the population segregate itself.')
