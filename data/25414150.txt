I mean sure, that&#x27;s the content they are dealing with-- gratuitous violence and murder is entrenched in that world and they told a story in that world.  As far as film-making and story-telling goes, Sicario will probably always be a top 50 if not top 20 film for me.  Also encourage anyone to check out Villeneuve&#x27;s older less known movies (most of course know Arrival and Blade Runner 2049), such as Prisoners, Enemy and Incendies-- all fantastic movies.')
