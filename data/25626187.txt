One day a large service tanked in some datacenter because BigTable replication in that location just stopped. Digging in, it turned out the BigTable should have been replicating from YQ but had started trying to use QQ instead, which didn&#x27;t exist. Q being one bit away from Y. Or it was something like that, I don&#x27;t remember exactly. There&#x27;d been a bit flip in the exact part of memory that contained the name of the database cluster to replicate from!')
