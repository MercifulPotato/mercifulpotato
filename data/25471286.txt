If you do this for <i>lots</i> of elderly family members, getting yourself vaccinated may be better than getting any one of them vaccinated, though. And, of course, of you are doing an off the books pre-approval use of the vaccine, accepting the risk of unexpected side effects <i>for yourself</i> may be more reasonable than imposing them on, or even suggesting them to, someone else who may be in a more fragile state.')
