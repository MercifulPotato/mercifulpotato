There are two fields where I mainly act: (1) DevOps; from database administration and data modeling to back-end programming or front-end design all the way to orchestrated deployment with latest tech and (2) Standalone software; involves embedded development in restrict environments, blockchain applications mostly related to Parity&#x27;s Substrate and plain command-line interfaces.<p>On the open-source side of things, I regularly contribute to several projects, helping and communicating with other developers. Take a look at the available coding portfolio in my GitHub profile at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c410-f3r" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c410-f3r</a> where my latest public collaborations are more focused on the Rust Programming Language ecosystem.<p>Seven professional certifications were obtained from different organizations like the Linux Foundation and the Blockchain Training Alliance that covers a wide range of areas. My newest certification is the Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer, more certifications will be earned over time and I can get any other desired certification if needed.<p>To finish, IT in general is like a living organism that is constantly changing, that is why I am always looking forward for a new challenge to increase knowledge. For example, my proudest project is a constrained NP-problem solver compiled to WASM (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c410-f3r.github.io&#x2F;mop-playground" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c410-f3r.github.io&#x2F;mop-playground</a>) where I spent years reading scientific articles to write efficient data-structures and algorithms.')
