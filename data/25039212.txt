Haskell is not really built to have runaway adoption. It&#x27;s a strength as much as it&#x27;s a weakness.<p>But I think it&#x27;ll allow me to be insanely efficient as a gamedev. So I&#x27;m a Haskeller-turned-gamedev. Not a gamedev-turned-Haskeller.<p>Haskell performance and memory usage is kind of like JVM programming. You need a mental model of how GHC and its RTS &amp; GC operate. Having frame-oriented code honestly makes it easier to reason about. We Do need more learning materials about this stuff, but first we need more experience!<p>But idt it&#x27;s any different than using GC for gamedev. And manual memory management is well within Haskell&#x27;s capabilities.<p>Haskell profiling IME makes space leaks very obvious. That&#x27;s a too-common paper cut, but once you get cut once you don&#x27;t make the mistake again :)')
