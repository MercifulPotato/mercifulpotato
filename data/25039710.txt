It&#x27;s not the path string that was written in a programming language that performs the unlink() syscall. It&#x27;s not the data itself that causes people to curse loudly.<p>Sure, secure your data, validate your inputs, ensure that your <i>code</i> cannot be misused, just don&#x27;t say that <i>data</i>, even when it is <i>in use</i>, performs some computation on its own.')
