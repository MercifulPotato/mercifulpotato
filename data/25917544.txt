Which is exactly how the RFC process is intended to be used: spreading things that are known to work.<p>It’s just kind of surprising that “internal” R&amp;D, in their case, means “billions of devices running their software are all auto-updated to speak the protocol, and start speaking it—at least to Google’s own servers—making it immediately become a non-negligible percentage of Internet packet throughput.” (Which is a troubling thing to have happen, if you’re a network equipment mfgr, and you expected to have some time while new protocols are still “nascent” to tune your switches for them.)')
