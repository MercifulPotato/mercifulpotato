The renewables lobby is - by far - the strongest lobby as the overwhelming majority in Germany supports renewables.<p>Germany has already invested more than 500 billion Euros for the transition to renewables and we are still among the dirtiest electricity producers and we are still building new fossile plants.<p>100% renewables based on wind and solar does not work and will never work on a large scale.')
