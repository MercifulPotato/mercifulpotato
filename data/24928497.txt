It&#x27;s both harder to understand and <i>much</i> harder to debug. I don&#x27;t now why more code is in anyway reflective of how hard it is to understand. That would make the Redis code base harder to understand just because it has more features now than 4 years ago. That&#x27;s just not true.<p>Haskell is also a good example, if it was easy to understand, maintain etc. we would have seen a good examples of large-scale apps and projects being developed in it by now. But we do not. Barely a single one.<p>&gt; _if you are very familiar and experienced in both languages_.<p>This can be translated to &quot;this is so cognitive challenging that you need to be really well-versed to not fuck this up now&quot;. That&#x27;s not a good user-interface for something to scale on large teams.')
