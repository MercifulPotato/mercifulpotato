But this is HP we&#x27;re talking about, so words have no meaning. Last month, HP notified its &quot;free ink for life&quot; customers that their life had ended, and they were being moved to a new afterlife where they had to pay $0.99&#x2F;month<p>And from what I can tell in a quick Google search, HP introduced the &quot;free ink for life&quot; plan less than a year ago. So &quot;life&quot; lasted less than a year!')
