Even trying to track revisions to something relatively simple like a word document over time is a big pain compared to tracking revisions to source code or a configuration file.  Trying to get a grip on how people are fiddling with a no-code product from the audit logs is incredibly difficult, never mind trying to track down a change from 1 year ago.  Often changes won&#x27;t appear on audit logs <i>at all</i> or they won&#x27;t be explained in enough detail and the format of the logs will have little resemblance to how things are actually configured.  You can use some no-code solution to modify a SQL query under the hood and the audit log will just say &quot;THIS USER CHANGED THIS QUERY&quot; and that&#x27;s all the detail you get!  It&#x27;s frequently difficult to explain to your peers how you&#x27;re going to change a system without showing them a bunch of screenshots and going &quot;Well I&#x27;m going to tick this box and move the green rectangle over here and link it to the orange oval&quot;.  Rolling back changes can often be impossible without rolling back EVERY change between now and when the first incorrect change was made.<p>I use code, and these problems just don&#x27;t happen!  It&#x27;s only when people are using some wonderful &quot;user-friendly&quot; solution that things get so jacked up.')
