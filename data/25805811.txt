In Gradle, that&#x27;s trivial. In Maven, it is impossible. You would have to write a new plugin which duplicates the existing integration test plugin to do it.<p>Maven runs the stages of the build in a fixed order, defined by the plugin code. If you have a reason to run two stages in a different order, bad luck, that can&#x27;t be done.<p>There are tons of things like this.')
