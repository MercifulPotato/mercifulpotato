Women grow up with less female role models in STEM. A Barbie doll used to say &quot;math is hard&quot;, which speaks volumes to how prevalent this message is. Sure, 18yo haven&#x27;t seen the workplace yet, but they&#x27;ve seen how women are treated, how higher the bar is for them, how more criticism they get when they take a risk and fail, how often they&#x27;d be the only woman in the room... Going into STEM for a boy is being safe in a group of similar peers, going into STEM for a girl is harder, because all your life, you have to prove you&#x27;re good despite being a girl, and because it&#x27;s lonely.<p>My personal view is that both genetics and society matter here. I don&#x27;t have a problem with genetics, but I do have one with society.')
