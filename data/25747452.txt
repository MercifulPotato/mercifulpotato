She managed to pull it off reasonably well I think. Possibly the fact that she was a bit older at the time helped.<p>I never understood why Elizabeth Holmes persisted though because, in her case, it mostly made her sound incredibly odd, and actually quite difficult and unpleasant to listen to. This may have been due to some sort of uncanny valley effect: the disconnect between Holmes&#x27; youthful and almost dainty appearance, and her weirdly boomy void giving her a sense of the unreal. The result to me was that it undermined her authority and credibility rather than enhancing them.<p>Still, as you say, next-level dedication.')
