In casual use (like above), &quot;psycho&quot; means somebody acting in a bizarre or dangerous manner, eg. trying to buy all the toilet paper in the store and not taking &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  Nothing to do with actual mental illness.<p>Obviously the etymology of the term comes from psychological illness via a certain famous Hitchhock movie, and that&#x27;s one reason why the term du jour these days is &quot;Karen&quot; instead.')
