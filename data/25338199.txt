It&#x27;s always just &quot;licence to call yourself an X.&quot; As though the job title itself is something important.<p>The other thing to note is that certain jobs can be easily offshored. If you can&#x27;t get a local (data scientist&#x2F;software engineer&#x2F; journalist) to do what you want, you can just pay a foreigner to do it. The same is not true of doctors and lawyers, due to the extra privileges you point out.')
