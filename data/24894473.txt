Item(by='numpad0', descendants=None, kids=[24894574], score=None, time=1603706991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893838, text='Say a ship in 1D is flying at 50km&#x2F;s, exhaust velocity is -25km&#x2F;s, relative to a static frame.<p>Last bit of departure burn or correction burns will fly at 25km&#x2F;s towards the ship, so if the ship decelerated to below that, the plume could catch up. Meanwhile, plume from deceleration continues at 75km&#x2F;s away from the ship.<p>I was thinking that high Isp engines generally have insane exhaust velocity, like hundreds of km&#x2F;s or more, that problems like this is not an issue even for interplanetary transfers. But interstellar is a bit different, depending on other factors such as dispersion, I guess?')
