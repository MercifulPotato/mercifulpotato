It was far more austere than either of us were willing to go. So I started over using a different equation for &#x27;fairness&#x27;, and a different layout because something about her tables was just confusing and messy. When I was done, we had $300 a month of extra spending money between the two of us, despite using the same targets for pay-down, savings and bills.<p>I spent about 90 minutes poking at her spreadsheet and mine looking for the error and never did find it. I don&#x27;t know what the right solution is to this sort of problem, at least for non-developers. But if I was skeptical of Excel going in, I was doubly so after that. Especially for something that is going to be used to make decisions that will affect every day of your life.')
