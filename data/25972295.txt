Fact of the matter this disease is very deadly and the articles of the time show it.<p>here&#x27;s articles from both sides of the aisle during that time period:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;hart-island-coronavirus-burials&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;hart-island-coronavirus-bu...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;aerial-images-new-york-hart-island-burials-coronavirus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;aerial-images-new-york-hart-islan...</a><p>Both show proper context and highlight how different the burials were. (neither of them are AP stories) fox notes that burials went from one day a week to five days a week. both offer the history of the island and what it&#x27;s normally used for. I see a fair article from both of those ideologically opposed orgs.')
