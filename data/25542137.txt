Item(by='Aeolun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608970849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25517690, text='&gt; our history should not be bought and sold as a commodity<p>The thousands, maybe millions of old coins that we find from previous eras are absolutely a commodity, and it doesn’t detract from our heritage in the slightest.<p>The largest set of coins I’ve seen was in the british museum and that was already too much. I think they have one of every variety of coin and it just makes my head spin.<p>Once they have one of each (add another 10 for other musea across the country) the remaining thousands can remain in private hands.')
