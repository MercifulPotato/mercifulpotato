That general version of the halting problem is Rice&#x27;s Theorem, and that&#x27;s exactly the thinking that proves it, by showing that if we did have an algorithm to determine any given non-trivial property of a program, we&#x27;d be able to use that algorithm to solve the halting problem.<p>As for parallel processing, it can be fun to think about how things would work if you had a CPU with infinite cores.  Any time your program wants to explore two or more options, you always have cores to explore those options in parallel.  This sort of thinking is the root of the &quot;non-deterministic&quot; &#x27;N&#x27; in &quot;NP&quot;... with infinite cores you can solve NP problems (including NP-complete ones) in polynomial time.')
