The cost to “replace items that are selling” doesn’t just cover the risk, it also covers the items actively sitting on the shelves.  A store is only buying new items after the old items have sold, so that continues indefinitely.  A store is thus better off of if an item stops selling in 1 year than 1 day, as the replacement item is also subsidized.')
