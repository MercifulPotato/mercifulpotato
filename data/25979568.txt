The Fujitsu processor just recently took #1 in LINPACK, #1 Green500 (also the most efficient) and also #1 in HPCG (an alternative benchmark that GPUs traditionally suck at).<p>Its not a full GPU yet, but that A64Fx is clearly a powerful SIMD compute cluster, very similar to a GPU. It has succeeded where the Xeon Phi seems to have failed.')
