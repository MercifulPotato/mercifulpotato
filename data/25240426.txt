Is it more pronounced in specific categories? I keep hearing this, and I&#x27;ve never gotten an obvious fake, despite a large amount of Amazon usage. But maybe I&#x27;ve just been using fake stuff?<p>That said, I almost only buy the &quot;shipped from and sold by Amazon.com&quot; stuff, so maybe that&#x27;s why. And if it&#x27;s something that has obviously similar photos from a bunch of different &quot;brands&quot;, I hop over to AliExpress to buy it at the source for 1&#x2F;10 the price.')
