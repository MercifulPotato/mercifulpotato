But perhaps Qantas just stays #1 since it has had no jet-plane crash (and no crash at all since 1951). Or perhaps it&#x27;s the &quot;Rain man&quot; quote where Dustin Hoffman says Qantas never crashes; that cemented their position as the safest airline in history.<p>Ryanair certainly seems very safe, but with all those new MAX planes, who knows how long that will last.')
