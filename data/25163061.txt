These got very detailed when questioned, and I don&#x27;t think it should be a &#x27;one time &quot;the talk&quot; either.<p>Explaining how some simple social engineering can take two seemingly innocent data points and locate someone for kidnapping or whatever - like casually throwing in &#x27;what school do you go to&#x27; - and &#x27;parents aren&#x27;t home till Xpm&#x27; can lead to bad things - and one might not notice those inquiries &#x2F; data sharing while in the middle of game.<p>technology evolves, the attack surfaces do too.<p>I&#x27;ve had the opposite happen with similar results - a kid extorting adults, that led to international request for police help - even with data proving ip and the ISP coordinating data - no resolve - and that kid keeps coming back and ruining stuff for others thanks to wealthy parents and unlimited VPNs, very hard to block.<p>In short I think roblox is no less safe than other portals aside from fbook. If 99% of [app&#x2F;game] people are nice - and one percent are looking to leverage your honesty for ill gotten gains - the apps with the most people will yield extortion opportunities that are worth the time to exploit it seems. Especially from places where $20 goes a long way for some reason.')
