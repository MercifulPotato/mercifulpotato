This is nothing against the OP but I never reach for boilerplate generators, even ones like `create-react-app`.<p>Here&#x27;s a great example of why:  I do a bunch of research before I started my project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app</a> - for anyone curious) and decided to go with prisma.js.  It looked like it was exactly what I wanted for a REST API built with koa.<p>I&#x27;ve dumped probably a month fulltime on the project and now that I have enough experience using prisma, I realized it really doesn&#x27;t do what I want it to do and is actually making my life more difficult as a result.<p>So now I&#x27;m in the process of switching from prisma to knex.  Having the glue hidden from me would really affect my willingness to switch technologies and increase my frustrations with any platform.<p>For any reasonably complex application, you will eventually need to eject.<p>I want to see how everything is pieced together.  Even these js builders like parcel that &quot;do everything for you&quot; eventually don&#x27;t work.<p>I&#x27;ll take a couple of days to set things up the way I want them to over something that tries to do it all for me while only accommodating the happy path.<p>Again I want to say that this is my personal preference when building any project.  I pick a few barebones libraries to help me build what I want and get out of my way.<p>That should be obvious when you look at my tech stack: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app&#x2F;u&#x2F;erock&#x2F;listifi-tech-stack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app&#x2F;u&#x2F;erock&#x2F;listifi-tech-stack</a>')
