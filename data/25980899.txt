You pay a licensing cost to use Windows; the purpose of this is to be able to use Windows software and development tools. It&#x27;s not going to be in any way better than using Linux directly if the goal is to host Linux containers.<p>I would heavily question this, if I was in an environment where my employment was safe to do so.<p>Otherwise - who gives a shit if it&#x27;s &quot;ready for production&quot;?
