Bitcoin uses a broadcast protocol whereas lightning needs more complex routing and nodes need to lock-up funds via an on-chain bitcoin txn to make a connection.<p>The internet itself at the backbone&#x2F;isp level is a decent analog as ISP peering can be complex and often involve cost.  It took awhile to get BGP right and determine the right cost metric for selecting a route.<p>There don&#x27;t seem to be any blocking issues though and many of the large wallets have announced that they will be supporting it eventually.')
