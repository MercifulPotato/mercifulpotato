My son hops on after HW, has a Discord for talking, and they all meet up in Roblox or Fortnight.  Mostly Roblox.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything unhealthy yet.  He has a learned a lot about scams, understanding valuations and trading (it&#x27;s like a mini stock market around virtual goods), and just hanging out with his friends.<p>One of the most interesting things I&#x27;ve noticed is that in this virtual world -- boys and girls hang out together.  He has about 12 core friends -- and it&#x27;s almost an even split girl&#x2F;boy.  Which I think would not have happened in the &quot;real world&quot;.')
