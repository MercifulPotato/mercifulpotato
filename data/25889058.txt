Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=[25890121, 25889128], score=None, time=1611460591, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888674, text='Retros should be like recall elections: always available, never scheduled, with a high but achievable barrier to entry and specific veto principles both ways. The point of a retrospective is &quot;something big happened and we should learn and adapt&quot;. They shouldn&#x27;t be routine, because most weeks&#x2F;sprints, nothing that big happened (or something that big happened too frequently&#x2F;urgently to wait for a calendar). They shouldn&#x27;t be <i>too hard</i> to trigger, or you&#x27;re never going to get one (or results from one). The best process for this is &quot;shit goes down and you should make appropriate dedicated space for it&quot;.<p>Edit to add: I want to emphatically contradict my metaphor in one way, which is that retros should be exactly the opposite of a recall election in terms of identifying&#x2F;naming&#x2F;assigning fault. They should be about identifying good&#x2F;bad <i>outcomes</i> and good&#x2F;bad <i>patterns</i>, but not about pointing fingers at or casting aspersions on <i>people</i>.')
