Just today, we got a little turned around on a hike -- in less than a minute I was able to see our location from above and which direction to bushwhack a shortcut back to the main trail. I can see how this would be invaluable in a &quot;strategic&quot; situation.<p>Even the tiny ones are noisy and give away their position immediately. The effective range is relatively short, so you know if there&#x27;s a drone, the operator is nearby. Weather is a limiting factor -- winds will tax the battery, and rain or wet snow will effectively disable them.<p>I wonder what counter-methods will be used against drones in the field. Really accurate markspeople? Portable EMPs? From what I&#x27;ve read, around airports etc they&#x27;ve been experimenting with enforcing no-fly zones with birds of prey!')
