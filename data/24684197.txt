Hypercard, for example.<p>But even with Hypercard, at some point you needed to write code if you wanted to go beyond the happy path envisioned by the tool developer.  And I imagine the new &quot;no-code&quot; tools will have similar limitations.  And then when the &quot;no-code coders&quot; get bored of playing with those toys, will hand it off to the programmers to extend and maintain.')
