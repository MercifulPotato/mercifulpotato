Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607609380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369237, text='I think the &#x27;looks like a render&#x27; effect is multiple factors; there&#x27;s some distortion and the like due to distance and heat (you can sorta tell it&#x27;s on a very long zoom?), high frame rate and high resolution. I think a lot of people aren&#x27;t yet used to high frame rate video. I mean movies were 23 frames per second for a long time, and the reactions to 60fps films was... averse. The Hobbit was one of the first that tried that I believe, and it seriously messed with the suspension of disbelief.<p>edit: another comment mentions it may be 120 frames per second footage.')
