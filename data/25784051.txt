People would not even think to look into such things if theoreticians did not come up with the original abstract proof.<p>For example, there are more combinations of characters for text messages of this length than there are particles in the entire history of all possible multiverses.  Clearly I need to use something beside blind trial and error to write a halfway coherent HN comment.  Instead I must rely on a little mental theorizing to even just rant on the internet.')
