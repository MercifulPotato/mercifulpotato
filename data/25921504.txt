I have found their service to be very reliable for years now, with throughput that does not fluctuate (I get what I pay for regardless of the time of day) and lower latency than I had with Comcast.  No regrets at all.<p>The only real complaint I have is that Verizon still seems to be unable to deploy IPv6.  They have promised it for years and never seem to get past the testing phase.')
