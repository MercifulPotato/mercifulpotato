There is no way to stop the spread of misinformation on social media, attempting to curtail it to some degree is a PR business prerogative not an actual solution to the problem. Ultimately this is a cultural issue, we need to train the next generation to understand that anything read on social media should be implicitly distrusted; citing something you read on social media should be regarded as the intellectual equivalent of citing something you saw in a movie once. Yes, true things can be depicted in a movie, but nobody believes the movie is an acceptable source for itself, if a film claims to depict true events, it is expected that reliable sources will not contradict the film.')
