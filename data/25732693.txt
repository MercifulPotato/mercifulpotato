(It even has extensions or outgrowths that turn it into more of a general purpose language)<p>This results in ample tooling, lots of documentation, multiple implementations, some of which are really good and a lot of community knowledge.<p>One may like or dislike SQL, but it is undeniable that it is useful to and mastered by a great many people.<p>Most DSLs have few or none of these properties.  In some environments DSLs tend to be presented as something you can create casually.  That it is a lightweight solution.  And what starts as a small solution can often grow - usually to a point where not having put in a lot of work in the basic design will make the language unsound.<p>I don&#x27;t think DSLs are a lightweight solution at all.  I think that giving inexperienced programmers the idea that DSLs are is something they ought to be designing probably isn&#x27;t helpful.')
