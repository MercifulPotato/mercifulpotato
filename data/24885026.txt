As a long time Emacs user I long forgot what a good IDE is capable of.<p>I know of automatic renaming, moving parts you select automatically to another file, but full automatic refactoring to multiple modules is something I haven’t seen.<p>How does this tackle circular dependencies etc. I guess the IDE must parse the code, generate the syntax tree, populate symbol tables etc. and then make the refactoring.<p>A side point I sometimes dream of writing an emacs module which would let me to write in a single file (for easy search and edit reasons), and then cut it into several modules where I mark them with =======xyz.h========= etc.<p>I also want to use this in each repo where it automatically does this. I’ll hopefuly stop procrastinating and write the thing one day :).<p>To end with a Game of Thrones analogy, hearing about the latest developments I sometimes feel like we editor&#x2F;linux&#x2F;bsd&#x2F;cli users are like Wildlings beyond the wall. We live in harsher conditions, but are amazed when we see large cathedrals, castles being built inside the wall. Our life is more free but also burdensome.')
