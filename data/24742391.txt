This is on a desk with a screen attached, so I’m not staring down at the laptop screen.<p>Rather than the hand sweeping all the way over to the right to reach the mouse, it just twists a little towards the trackpad. The palms never really leave their rests.<p>I don’t use it like this a lot, but when I do I enjoy it.')
