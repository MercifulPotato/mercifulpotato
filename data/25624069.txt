It is very helpful.<p>&gt;  It could just be that during my learning stage I learned<p>I mean, I think this is very reasonable and intentional. Trait objects are a pretty niche feature of Rust already, and non-owned trait objects are even more niche than that. The book <i>does</i> guide you towards Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt; for this reason.<p>&gt; or the String thing (really, the Deref thing), further down others weigh in with a case where it doesn&#x27;t work as expected,<p>Yeah so the trick here is a balance between not wanting coercion willy-nilly, and also making some cases work well. You had cited method calls specifically, and those should work due to auto-ref&#x2F;deref. The example given isn&#x27;t about method calls, it&#x27;s about match not doing Deref coercion. That being said it&#x27;s really easy to assume that it always does it, because it does do it in the right places most of the time! There&#x27;s interesting tradeoffs here...')
