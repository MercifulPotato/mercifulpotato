Someone who replaced their crabgrass lawn with native meadow has a daily embodiment of their value system. When such a person hears about murder hornets, is this person somehow less likely to contact his&#x2F;her representatives about the issue than the person who kept a typical lawn, in your assessment ? That&#x27;s the only way I can see this as a net negative, rather than neutral or trivially positive.<p>Or, given that the described standpoint suggests I have enough attention for either planting a meadow lawn or supporting &#x27;big action&#x27;, why are you wasting it telling us about this, instead of naming names of the big actors to write to our representatives about and avoid electing representatives that hold a favorable position toward them ?')
