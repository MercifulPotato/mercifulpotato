The other navel oranges I purchased in the same batch were ordinary, so I believe it was some factor about this orange in particular that caused a different taste. I saved a bit of flesh that was attached inside near the stem entry. What is my best method for recreating this orange: specifically what is the most affordable&#x2F;accessible way to sequence fruit DNA, can I grow an orange without a seed, and will it ever taste as heavenly if I am unable to replicate environmental conditions?')
