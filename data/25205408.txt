Item(by='othercharles', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606271829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25205120, text='&quot;Social implications&quot; angle is quite straightforward,<p>- to the informed, a device like this should not be necessary. It did not exist because it was never required, and where a desire for mobile screenspace is required, better solutions have existed for a long time. I define &quot;better&quot; as &quot;less hinges&quot;, &quot;more optional&quot;, &quot;cheaper&quot;, and ideas along this dimension. A skilled engineer carrying this without an extraordinary reason would automatically strike me as a deeply impractical person, thus limiting the trust I would be willing to place in them. I appreciate trying to push boundaries, but the instant interpretation is that it could only be intended as something like a souped up Mini Cooper covered in blinking LEDs and under-the-hood neon lighting.<p>- to the uninformed, a laptop like this basically scares normal people away. One of the greatest accomplishments of the technology industry in the past 10 years is that regular people now carry laptops. There is no longer any reason to stand out. You can pack an 8-core workstation with 16TB of NVMe in a perfectly useful and unobtrusive device the average person might only suspect were slightly outdated. The tone set by this device would be the same as wheeling a minicomputer into a coffee shop in the mid 1980s -- outlandish, curious, unaware of social norms. It would be as if you&#x27;d willingly dress in a neon pink 80s shell suit out of a desire to avoid being hit by passing cars, when the alternative is simply to stay on the sidewalk.<p>Social norms matter. They open doors just as easily as they slam doors shut. And this laptop most certainly would have people saying &quot;no&quot; more often in relative terms than they might say &quot;yes&quot; to you, much as turning up to a business meeting wearing that neon shell suit rather than a formal jacket would in most scenarios.<p>I hope this helps')
