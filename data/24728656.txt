If you&#x27;re not actively participating in the boring corporate meetings then you&#x27;ll only ever be solving problems that other people have decided to tackle - which means you&#x27;ll never be working on the things that you want to work on unless you&#x27;re very lucky.<p>If you&#x27;re <i>really</i> opposed to corporate meetings the alternative is to start your own company, but then you&#x27;ll end up in sales meetings instead and those are much worse.')
