One funny example was enemy tank recognition that saw enemies whenever there was gloomy weather, because the sample images of enemy tanks all where shot at such weather conditions to make them appear sinister to human eyes.<p>If you refer to a mental model, I guess it might simply be a resource management problem. Just because we do not experience the distraction actively it does not mean it is not there. How exactly distraction is compensated is irrelevant to this explanation. Explaining this with mathematical terms is probably pretty arbitrary and leads to framing (in a psychological sense). But I also like speculating on AI ;)')
