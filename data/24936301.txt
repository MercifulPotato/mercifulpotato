Thats perfectly renewable once you pump some energy into it to split water into the two.<p>Methane + oxygen popular in the new generation of rockets is not much different, you basically add some carbon to the process &amp; Methane can be made on Mars from local resources.<p>Best fuel for nuclear thermal rockets is again hydrogen, abundant everywhere.<p>Current Ion Engines run on noble gases, but supply does not seem to be a problem so far.<p>Sure, the uranium needed for Orion and Nuclear Salt Water rocket indeed is not really renewable but given the performance &amp;opening the way to grab more of it from space make it a non-issue as well.')
