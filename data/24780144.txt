Most declare that they would, but never will, given the chance.<p>&gt; It is an ugly perspective, to me, that we should concern ourselves with the Zionists&#x27; ethnic cleansing of Palestinians only after we have solved all other problems.<p>Meh, I don&#x27;t even think ethnic cleansing actually applies (not least because Palestinians aren&#x27;t an ethnic group, they&#x27;re a cultural group). But even more so: that&#x27;s not what I said. What I&#x27;m saying is that there&#x27;s a suspicious focus on Israel that turns into willful ignorance and self-imposed blindness when it comes to other things. That heavily suggests it&#x27;s not <i>actually</i> about what Israel does, but rather about the fact that it&#x27;s Israel doing it.')
