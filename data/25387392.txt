How often you do come across a posting from a friend who thinks the virus isn&#x27;t real? You sat in a room with people like this for over 10 years. Did you think they would someday be able to think for themselves? I had hoped for that.<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m starting to think that education as the answer might just be a naive point of view, but I&#x27;m also not desirous of a world where we tell adults what they&#x27;re supposed to think.<p>&gt; You think the problem is a lack of education or understanding? I don&#x27;t think so, it&#x27;s something else - being left behind, feeling unheard of, destitute, incapable of changing the situation no matter how you vote. Then people start breaking away from the official story and invent their own explanations, and why would they have solidarity with the mainstream society when it betrayed them? Better to vote in an antagonistic way and muddle the waters because this system is corrupt in their eyes.<p>I don&#x27;t think the GP thinks the problem is a lack of &quot;education and understanding,&quot; but rather the <i>inadequacy</i> of it.<p>You both are also right.  There&#x27;s also a problem of people &quot;being left behind, feeling unheard of, destitute.... [and] breaking away from the official story and invent their own explanations,&quot; but a good chunk of them have, in their discontent, allied with some of the <i>very same people who caused them to be left behind in the first place</i>.  And they&#x27;ve been cemented to that mainstream faction with a slop of lies, delusional conspiracy theories, and other disinformation.<p>If you were both wrong, I think the discontents would have allied into something like a new Nonpartisan League [1] to work as factions in <i>both</i> parties to change the polices to help the common man.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nonpartisan_League" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nonpartisan_League</a>')
