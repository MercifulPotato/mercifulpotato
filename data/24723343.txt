E.g. you can preach with a megaphone whatever you want on the sidewalk; you can&#x27;t do it in my living room without my consent.<p>Also people tend to forget that freedom of speech is <i>not</i> freedom from consequences; limiting consequences of speech, even if it were desirable, can start restricting <i>others&#x27;</i> freedom of expression and association. If Bob gets on a stump and starts spewing controversial hate speech his employer is perfectly free to not want to associate with that behavior and fire him.')
