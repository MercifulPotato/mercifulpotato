Accidental Luck (General, Passive luck) - you have the luck of a plant - just lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time<p>2. Active Luck (General, Active luck) - you have luck from randomly moving around more<p>3. Prepared Luck (Individual, Passive luck) - you have luck because you&#x27;ve trained yourself to notice when luck happens to you<p>4. Magnetic Luck (Individual, Active luck) - you have luck because you work on interesting things and people seek you out<p>(i drew it out here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;create_luck&#x2F;#four-kinds-of-luck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;create_luck&#x2F;#four-kinds-of-luck</a>)<p>I also like the way Naval put it:<p>1. Hope luck finds you.<p>2. Hustle until you stumble into it.<p>3. Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.<p>4. Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.')
