If decision-makers believe it is in their interests, and they can get away with it, they will keep doing it. So you can try to convince decision makers that it is not in their interests, or you can try to show them that they can&#x27;t get away with it. Quitting an advisory board does neither.<p>Note that the OP didn&#x27;t really say they thought or intended it would. They said they were glad they tried to impact AMP positively, they don&#x27;t think they succeeded, and they are choosing to spend time on other things such as an educational program.  Of course by making a public announcement perhaps they hope to affect something, but probably more encourage others in the struggle; after seeing how they couldn&#x27;t have much impact on the advisory committee, I am sure they know they won&#x27;t have much impact simply by resigning from it, at least not impact on Google directly.')
