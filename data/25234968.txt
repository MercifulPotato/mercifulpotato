They negotiate the minimum benefits the company can offer for a particular set of workers, which includes benefits and salary, ie. total wages.<p>&gt; One is that automation proceeds with or without unionization.<p>True, but it is hastened by unionization.  Automation always has a cost involved. Sometimes it&#x27;s worth the cost, and sometimes it&#x27;s not based on the cost of the human labor that is being replaced.  If the cost of the human labor goes up for any reason (such as unionization) then the cost of automation looks more attractive.')
