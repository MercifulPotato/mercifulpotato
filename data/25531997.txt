The only difference is that the gating is by OS version rather than payment.<p>An Xcode deploy target can require a minimum OS version, and when an app&#x27;s minimum version increases with an update, the update is not available to users who haven&#x27;t updated their device. If the device doesn&#x27;t support the new OS version, the user is stuck with the last version supported on the old OS, and will not receive any future patches.')
