I can absolutely see this being the future of gaming as home bandwidth continues to improve, and more datacenters get built near major population centers.<p>It is _very_ sensitive to the connection, though. This summer, I was about 11 milliseconds away from an AWS datacenter with a 500 megabit connection. Buttery smooth perfection. No video compression artifacts. Now, I am about 60 milliseconds away with a 50 megabit connection and it is unplayable. 50 megabits&#x2F;60 milliseconds is a good connection by US broadband standards these days!')
