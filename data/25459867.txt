See for example &quot;The Dental Diet&quot; for its effects on your teeth, but there are other nutritional reasons as well.  (Anecdotally, I think lack of nutrients in the fat makes you hungrier; it makes it &quot;addictive&quot;.  If you cooked in real fats, you feel sated with very few fried plaintains.)<p>The way I think of this is: &quot;Food is not a linear combination of macronutrients&quot;.  All fats aren&#x27;t equivalent; some fats are very good for you.  Again Pollan&#x27;s books are very good on this subject.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with the ingredients in Filipino cooking, but since it was an American colony in 1898, I would guess the habits are strongly influenced by industrial cooking (spam being popular, etc.)  It&#x27;s a mix of local ingredients and cheap ingredients bought from Western corporations.<p>You can see it in a Chinese-American family pretty clearly: the grandparents eat fatty cuts of meat (but small portions), fish heads, etc. and live until 100 years old.   The parents are mixed -- they eat some traditional foods (fish and vegetables), but cook with American vegetable oil instead of soybean oil, and got addicted to McDonald&#x27;s in the 80&#x27;s.  They have more health problems in their 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s a result (hypertension, heart disease), and they&#x27;re not going to live until 100.  Even without obesity, they still have these problems.  Their kids are fatter than both generations, and as a result less healthy, at least without a change in diet in adulthood, etc.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s clearer in the Chinese case because there was less western influence (fewer occupying armies and less trade).  Whenever Western processed food companies take hold in a foreign market, the health of the population suffers.  This is well known.  And I would guess it happened earlier and to a greater degree in the Phillipines than in other countries.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming to be an expert here, but it seems suspicious, and some Googling reveals that people are studying that issue.  That is, because of history you may not remember what is &quot;traditional&quot;, but I can more or less see what was traditional (non-Western) from my grandparents born in 1916.')
