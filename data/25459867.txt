Item(by='chubot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608236435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459492, text='<i>vegetable oils crushed from olives or seeds; butter and lard obtained from milk and pork; and starches extracted from corn and other plants</i><p>The distinction is accurate: These are unprocessed oils, and there is a big difference between them and the processed oil that fast food is fried in, and that industrial cooking uses.<p>The same plaintains fried in ultraprocessed vs. unprocessed Oils is going to be worse for you.  See for example &quot;The Dental Diet&quot; for its effects on your teeth, but there are other nutritional reasons as well.<p>The way I think of this is: &quot;Food is not a linear combination of macronutrients&quot;.  Again Pollan&#x27;s books are very good on this subject.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with the ingredients in Filipino cooking, but since it was an American colony in 1898, I would guess the habits are strongly influenced by industrial cooking (spam being popular, etc.)  It&#x27;s a mix of local ingredients and cheap ingredients bought from Western corporations.<p>You can see it in a Chinese-American family pretty clearly: the grandparents eat fatty cuts of meat (but small portions), fish heads, etc. and live until 100 years old.   The parents are mixed -- they eat some traditional foods (fish and vegetables), but cook with American vegetable oil instead of soybean oil, and got addicted to McDonald&#x27;s in the 80&#x27;s.  They have some health problems as a result; they&#x27;re not going to live until 100, and have more health problems in their 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  Even without obesity, this is still a problem.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s clearer in the Chinese case because there was less western influence (no occupying armies and less trade).<p>Whenever Western processed food companies take hold in a foreign market, the health of the population suffers.  This is well known.  And it happened earlier and to a greater degree in the Phillipines than other countries.  I&#x27;m not claiming to be an expert here, but it seems suspicious, and some Googling reveals that people are studying that issue.')
