A law that aims to prevent stealing should be deterring thieves, not just regulating padlocks.<p>2. Technical measures are insufficient because cookies are regulated by <i>purpose</i>. A third-party cookie for fraud detection is allowed; a first-party cookie for analytics requires consent. It also prevents using necessary cookies for secondary purposes, something that literally cannot be accomplished through technical means alone.<p>As a minor point, the so-called &quot;cookie law&quot; also regulates browser fingerprinting. I have a hard time imagining that you could legislatively mandate effective anti-fingerprinting approaches.')
