Or rather learning about the ecosystem. There&#x27;s not much information, from what I&#x27;ve found, about best practices for creating a production ready application. A lot of Lisp tutorials and books extoll the virtues of the language and REPL based development but stop there. For example, I want to figure out how to use Lisp in a CI&#x2F;CD environment to deploy binaries. Or learn the best practices for creating a project with multiple modules with dependencies.<p>Edit: Is this being downvoted because I&#x27;m hijacking the thread?')
