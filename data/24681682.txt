Item(by='DebtDeflation', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601840222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680942, text='&gt;My outlook is that things just exist in some higher dimension but because we perceive things in 3D we wrongfully assume there needs to be a start&#x2F;end.<p>This is a thought I&#x27;ve often had as well.  Like we exist on an X-Y coordinate plane, but there&#x27;s a Z axis we just can&#x27;t access.  Particles popping into and out of existence?  Just moving along the Z axis (our entire existence is on a single scalar value on that axis).  GR and the &quot;warping of spacetime&quot;?  Well, the bowling ball on a trampoline analogy obviously requires an extra dimension beyond the 2D trampoline surface to warp into.  EPR and Bell&#x27;s Theorem, viz no local hidden variables?  Well, there&#x27;s the non-locality.  I&#x27;m not a physicist and this is all obviously a vast oversimplification, but it just seems that so many fundamental questions are confounding because they all seem to point to a missing degree of freedom.')
