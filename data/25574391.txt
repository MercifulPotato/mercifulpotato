Mcdonalds has chicken burgers.  Everywhere has salads (albeit fewer than in 2019 because of food handling concerns in 2020).<p>Subway caters to this heavily in their marketing.  You can easily put together a cheap sub with whatever macro&#x2F;micronutrient combo you want.<p>Also, most supermarkets have a hot prepared food section with very healthy cheap pre-prepared food.  Again... few people take advantage of it.<p>Outside of food deserts (which yes, do exist) it&#x27;s really not hard to find healthy cheap prepared food if you want it.  But nobody does.')
