Using &#x27;blue&#x27; hydrogen to replace the natural gas for those turbines would immediately get a fully reliable, zero-carbon-emission grid. Then as renewable prices continue to fall, &#x27;green&#x27; hydrogen can close the loop &amp; eliminate fossil fuels altogether.&quot;<p>To be fair, in that instance the blue hydrogen would crowd out other battery investment, delaying cost reductions in <i>actually renewable</i> batteries.')
