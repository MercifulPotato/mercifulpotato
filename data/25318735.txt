By the mid 1990s we had the ability to make a 1600x1200 CRT monitor with a 85Hz refresh rate, but even a top-of-the-line TV wouldn&#x27;t offer much more resolution or higher refresh than a 1965 model-- that&#x27;s all you could get out of NTSC broadcasts.  (Yeah. there were some progressive-scan input formats, but that&#x27;s still only a token advance)<p>Introducing external sources (streaming, consoles, etc.) provides a bit of wiggle room to advance the resolution&#x2F;colour&#x2F;refresh rate bars, but that&#x27;s still not going to change the installed base nearly as fast as if they said &quot;here&#x27;s a new standard format and every local broadcaster starts 8k broadcasts tomorrow.&quot;<p>In contrast, streaming products evolve in a continuous curve.  Since there&#x27;s very minimal, if any, platform standards, they can say &quot;here&#x27;s 24k resolution&quot;, or equally likely &quot;here&#x27;s a new codec&#x2F;DRM format&#x2F;API that old boxes don&#x27;t support.&quot;')
