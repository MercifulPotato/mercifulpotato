It&#x27;s on a fairly niche, amateur-to-semi-advanced technical topic - basics really, but I know more people had the same issue.

I know how to organize SEO, SM promotion, how to setup domain and hosting, but I don&#x27;t want to. I just want to write a single post that will solve single problem and I want people who have that problem to find that post in the future. That is all.<p>So what do I do with it without increasing power of Medium overlords? Where do I <i>just</i> post a blog post?')
