That&#x27;s not the line that was being drawn. it was scripting vs compiled languages. It was very clear then which sides Java and Javascript fell on. There are some weird cases now like compiling scripts into different scripts, but in general it&#x27;s pretty clear, and Python is definitely a scripting language.')
