It&#x27;s more similar to Facebook Messenger. You&#x27;re better off using WhatsApp over it if you care about security.<p>Or obviously Signal.<p>When it comes to Matrix, it&#x27;s a little trickier. Riot, the most common Matrix client does E2E encryption on DMs and invite only rooms. What I&#x27;m not sure is what happens if you send a private message to someone who is using Matrix client that doesn&#x27;t do E2E. Will it fail to send? Or will it like fallback to not encrypted?')
