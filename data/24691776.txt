Since then, life on earth has been a combination of single celled prokaryotic cells, and much larger (100x) eukaryotic cells.<p>The evolution of eukaryotes, which comprise all the plants and animals you see on David Attenborough&#x27;s Life on Earth show, didn&#x27;t occur until the Earth had developed an oxygen rich atmosphere.<p>What&#x27;s amazing about eukaryotic cells is that they formed from colonies of prokaryotic cells, in  a process called endosymbiosis.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells look like little bacteria like organisms.
