Thanks for fleshing it out actually.<p>So bring it forward now like I originally stated: BLM and other leftists can protest in areas that are not high traffic roads, freeways, main streets, federal courthouses, etc. They can protest in the Mojave desert, they won&#x27;t be censored there. The can all drive there easily, by no means dangerous. Probably safer than the &quot;town square&quot; in many of the Democrat ran cities.<p>&gt;And btw, &quot;kicked your teeth in&quot; as a description of that thread exchange seems like a great reason to avoid further interaction with you.<p>You admit defeat and don&#x27;t have a response, that&#x27;s fine.<p>&gt;spoonjim&#x27;s comment was downvoted<p>Can&#x27;t have any wrongthink now can we.<p>&gt;and incidentally wrong<p>No it wasn&#x27;t, it was 100% right, and you didn&#x27;t have a response.')
