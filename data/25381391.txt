It sounds like you prefer Debian in general, and so do I - not only am I a Debian developer too, I&#x27;m typing this on my personal laptop running Debian. That said, sometimes I pick Ubuntu in a work context to be less of an oddball, since my work contexts tend to be the trendy cloud-focused tech startups where Ubuntu is comparatively common and I want to direct my day-job sysadmin energies toward my employers&#x27; infrastructure instead of my laptop.<p>Despite that, at the company I&#x27;m helping to found as CTO, I may need to set a default of Windows in the short term: the story for using MS Office and screen sharing &#x2F; other fancy features of Zoom on Linux isn&#x27;t great, web dev on Windows is getting surprisingly good with things like WSL and VS Code, we don&#x27;t already have a fleet of Intel-based Macs to use, and for now the new M1-based Macs are likely to demand workarounds for the CPU architecture on which we can&#x27;t spend the necessary time at this extremely early stage of our corporate lifecycle.<p>Macs will probably become a viable option for us again in a couple of years, and Debian &#x2F; Ubuntu will probably be viable from day 1 for any technical employees who don&#x27;t need the commercial software I listed above.')
