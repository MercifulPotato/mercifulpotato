You get a lot of support, and will definitely benefit distribution-wise later as well. Congratulations to the author - especially on publishing relatively quickly, in 10 months from the idea! And it&#x27;s very nice to read that all royalties are going to Girls Who Code.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with O&#x27;Reilly and a few other publishers on a proposal that was slightly different to what they usually publish. I went through the same submission process, working with an acquisitions editor, similar to how it happened in this case. In my case, O&#x27;Reilly rejected the proposal after a month and half. The feedback in my case was that the book competes with another project, which project got priority. Sure enough, I took the proposal without any changes to another publisher, worked with the acquisitions editor there, had the proposal accepted and we went ahead with the writing process with a development editor.<p>In the end, working with the other publisher did not work out for me. They did not publish the type of book I was writing, and the feedback from the editors kept nudging me to &quot;shape&quot; the book into the type of book this publisher knew would sell, and would sell well. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t feel like the type of book I was excited to write.<p>A year and some time later, I&#x27;m still writing the book -The Software Engineer&#x27;s Guidebook[1] - and if all goes according to plan, I&#x27;ll publish it early next year.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned with working with a book publisher, is just <i>how</i> involved the process is. Now, instead of taking a $5,000 royalty upon completion of the manuscript, I&#x27;m budgeting to spend around $5,000 out of pocket on development&#x2F;copy editing, cover design and production editing. The things that the publisher would have otherwise paid for. It&#x27;s a bit simpler to hire professionals these days for these areas thanks to sites like Reedsy[2], which I do recommend for fellow authors self-publishing in finding support on various publishing tasks.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engguidebook.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engguidebook.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reedsy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reedsy.com&#x2F;</a>')
