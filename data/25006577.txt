Item(by='feanaro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604658396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006490, text='&gt; Browsers don&#x27;t bypass the protection mechanism, they implement it.<p>This is incorrect. The <i>website</i> implements the protection mechanism, browsers execute it, just as youtube-dl. The implementor is the person writing the code, not the system executing it.<p>&gt; Certain YouTube videos are licensed only for streaming playback by the YouTube site or app.<p>The meaning of this sentence is unclear. What does it mean for playback to only be allowed <i>by the (web)site</i>? Websites alone cannot <i>do</i> anything -- they require a web agent which fetches and executes them. Firefox, Chrome, Safari and youtube-dl are examples of such agents.<p>&gt; Even if this were not the case, you would be committing copyright infringement by downloading the videos for unauthorized use anyway.<p>Luckily for me, I am in a jurisdiction where this is not the case and where DMCA plays no role.')
