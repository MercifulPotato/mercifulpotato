Perhaps it depends on your &quot;health issues&quot;. And, don&#x27;t look for an answer from the internet anytime soon.<p>I assume it depends on your condition. If you are lucky, they have tested it on people with similar conditions and there is data for it. Otherwise, they may still be able to measure the risk. If your doctor suggests that there is a risk because of your condition, then you have to calculate the risk of not taking it as well. How much risk is there for you with the vaccine? How long can you keep yourself safe from COVID19. That depends on your interactions with other people, your job, and people around you etc.')
