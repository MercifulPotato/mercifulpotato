That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t really need any publicity from AWS and that&#x27;s why AWS &quot;steals&quot; it, their customers won&#x27;t have to learn a new tool but can re-use their knowledge. Lower entry barrier = more customers.<p>&gt; If you are concerned with &quot;competitors&quot; offering your open-source project to more users, then perhaps being open source was just a poorly chosen marketing tactic that backfired.<p>How free-markety of you.<p>Now imagine that Elastic took your suggestion. They never made the elastic suite FOSS in the first place but only sold it as a closed source product.<p>1) It would have never got widely used in the industry<p>2) We would have never got a free open source tool that helped kick-start many other companies.<p>You could say the same about Mongo. Imagine what impact it would have had on the startup world if Mongo wasn&#x27;t a FOSS project.<p>That&#x27;s why it is fundamental to protect FOSS projects from corporate exploitation, in order to protect the whole tech eco-system.')
