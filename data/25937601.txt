Most of my code is plain old functions, but occasionally I find that using an object to do some things is just much cleaner. The rest of the time doing away with all the baggage associated with objects and using structs or other, simpler structures is just easier to wrap my head around.<p>Java IMO is the classic case of going way too far overboard with being object oriented. Much worse than Python.')
