Item(by='meekmind', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604150582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950569, text='Disengaging from social media or encouraging others to disengage on it&#x27;s face appears to be the well-meaning advice of someone genuinely concerned with their own mental health and the mental health of others. For many this is precisely the correct course of action.<p>But, the vocal minority and ideologues aren&#x27;t going to disengage. If all those who recognize illusion refuse to retain territory in the cultural and political dialog then the social media landscape would only be populated by the uninitiated and those who seek to initiate them into echo chambers. Those who have discernment enough to be frustrated by the hypocrisies and bias on social media are precisely the people who can de-escalate and bring more balance, reason and rationality to it.<p>The problem is then that the moderate voices are drowned out, censored, or out-right abused off the platforms (if not by actual people, but by droves of carefully coordinated bots). That leads to a larger discussion of the role of these platforms in societal discourse (or as the town square) and their woefully inadequate protections of free speech and privacy.')
