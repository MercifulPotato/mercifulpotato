This is just capitalism working exactly as it was designed.<p>The entire point of capitalism is to acquire as much capital as possible, not to be the best at what you do.  It&#x27;s not a meritocracy.  The best idea doesn&#x27;t win - the best FUNDED idea wins, which means whichever dumb idea that benefits the rich the most is what you&#x27;re going to get.<p>And if the rich people who own Match.com decide that buying up every competitor and rolling them into their platform is what&#x27;s going to make them the most money, that&#x27;s what they are going to do.<p>Don&#x27;t view it as a flaw of capitalism that needs to be fixed, think of it as a feature of capitalism that necessitates a conversation about alternatives.')
