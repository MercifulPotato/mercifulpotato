This is a cost of about $10k&#x2F;minute.<p>(For comparison, SpaceX spent ~$85m (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craft.co&#x2F;spacex&#x2F;funding-rounds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craft.co&#x2F;spacex&#x2F;funding-rounds</a>) to blow up three rockets and launch a fourth one into orbit.)<p>Quibi&#x27;s failure is on the same level as Theranos &amp; Magic Leap given the amount that was spent. Quibi might not be a scam like the other two, but it&#x27;s strange that they spent so much money before they had any users nor revenue. The most important lesson here is probably that launching &amp; iterating will result in better outcomes than a giant investment on a speculative product.')
