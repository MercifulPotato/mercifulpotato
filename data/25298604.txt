They went from being way behind the pack in terms of price&#x2F; performance pile in the 90s and 00s to the point where Apple&#x27;s base MacBook Air is now competitive in terms of performance with laptops that cost twice as much.<p>I suspect they will absolutely pick up share. I also expect AMD will gain some share here as OEMs look to compete with Apple&#x27;s offerings and Intel has come up short.<p>Also, by losing Apple, Intel is also losing one of their most profitable customers. While Apple isn&#x27;t Intel&#x27;s biggest customer in terms of units shipped, Apple tended to buy Intel&#x27;s higher end CPUs which other OEMs avoided.<p>Everyone isn&#x27;t switching to Apple, but the competitive scene is changing a lot and it doesn&#x27;t favor Intel.')
