If the input is a mix of very loud and very quiet waves, as often the case in club music, its ACF will look like a stormy ocean: huge slow waves with a lot of ripples on them. ACF doesn&#x27;t lose this information, but visualizing it is difficult.<p>Edit. The generated images in fact contain the small ripples, but our eyes don&#x27;t notice the 0.1% modulation of color. If they did, we&#x27;d see bright orange-blue waves with a fine pattern of wavelets colored with a slightly different shade of orange and blue. People who can see 100 shades of orange would see this pattern.')
