No, it&#x27;s not a single &quot;assassinate bin Laden&quot; mission, but it maps pretty well to a war where you have both tactical goals to achieve with logistical challenges AND overarching strategic goals.<p>The market SUCKS at strategic goals. It&#x27;s basically the opposite: you&#x27;re giving up on strategic goals because you&#x27;re in a situation where you don&#x27;t think central planning can be as effective as competition. But military history shows us that central planning can be very effective for this sort of campaign, complete with elaborate supply chains and logistical accomplishments.')
