You shouldn&#x27;t have a landing page. Find someone who would literally pay for it before building anything. Normally, it&#x27;s a community that has already built a hack of the product.<p>In your case, it&#x27;s probably book clubs. Try talking to them first, and make sure you have what they want.<p>If your target is yourself, and this is something you really want, then you should go ahead and just build a prototype. A prototype doesn&#x27;t have to be complex - it can just be a shiny website built on top of Google Sheets. If you get only 1-3 sign ups, you can scrap it. If you&#x27;re getting a thousand out of nowhere, then get to work.')
