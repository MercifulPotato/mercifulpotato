Every component has it&#x27;s own message stack which allows a formal interface to the component to a) reference count b) allow static analysis for deterministic memory allocation (max stack depth required).<p>Performance is great, managed memory with no GC, multithreaded GUIs are possible etc.<p>Composita is a further development of A2.
