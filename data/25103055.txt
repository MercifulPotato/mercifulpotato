If you think that&#x27;s the idea here, you&#x27;re not thinking deep enough about the nature of the systems that are problematic right now.<p>We&#x27;ve designed communication systems that are optimized for instant gratification, engagement, getting the dopamine hit of seeing things you agree with or angry at, and rapidly moving to the next. That&#x27;s not speech, that&#x27;s a designed system of attention seeking, all with the primary objective of getting eyeballs on advertisements and content primarily.<p>We&#x27;ve designed communication platforms that cause us to cease seeing each other as human beings, and instead condensed thoughts and memes that are simply repeated to conform and get reinforced for a quick natural drug.<p>I do not think we should control the discourse or have structural control over what&#x27;s right or wrong to say or think; that would be absurdly dystopian.<p>I do think we need to change our systems to incentivize human context around that speech, and reinforce our own humanity in how we read and respond to it.<p>I think it&#x27;s possible to design better platforms that don&#x27;t bring out the worst in society, and that we should do so.')
