But audio engines are also a rabbit hole.<p>For SFX editing, a sampler or VST3&#x2F;AU soft synth host with midi playback would be great as a stopgap for full audio editing.<p>If you want something totally unique that I don&#x27;t know exists: ambisonic mixing&#x2F;rendering alongside 3D video editing. There are tools for both but the medium is pretty new. This is also a bit of a rabbit hole and not an enthusiast area today.')
