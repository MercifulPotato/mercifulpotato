Simply put, some frogs feel small increments of water&#x27;s temperature and try to warn others, so that they work out the means of escape instead of keeping their pool party going, but for those partying the increments pass as not alarming.<p>That of course does not mean that less sensitive ones don&#x27;t feel some uneasiness in the environment. They do, but the cook keeps dressing the heating broth with promises of better future, and lulls the frogs into attributing this uneasiness to depression. Because you see, psychiatry is just another cook&#x27;s tool among forks, spoons and knives.<p>Erich Fromm did not use the term &#x27;punitive psychiatry&#x27; for no reason.')
