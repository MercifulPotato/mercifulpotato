Some time ago, the higher court ruled in favor of a guy who simply claimed he didn&#x27;t read the long contract and the unexpected conditions shouldn&#x27;t have been enforceable.<p>Also all consumer disputes below a certain amount have to be resolved by consumer referees, so no binding arbitration clauses here either.')
