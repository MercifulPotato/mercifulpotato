How is this pertinent?<p>We know the DTCC raised the collateral requirements by 30x for GME. Does Ken Griffin own the DTCC too?<p>We know Robinhood suffered a cash crunch and was required to raise an emergency $1B. We know that every GME purchase by its customers increased its collateral requirements, and every sale reduced them.<p>Don’t all known facts directly explain Robinhoods behavior? Wouldn’t Robinhood simply move to another market maker if Citadel got out of line?<p>Does anyone know that Ken Griffin made any demands of Robinhood?<p>So why are we pursuing baseless conspiracy theories when the facts already explain the behavior?')
