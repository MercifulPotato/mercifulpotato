They all work.<p>The concentric rings one is trivial to work out. Integrate over r from 0 to R. Each ring at radius r has thickness dr, and has length 2 pi r, treated simply as a rectangle, which is &quot;close enough&quot; since each is arbitrarily thin. Then the integral is<p>int_0^R  2 pi r dr = 2pi r^2&#x2F;2 from 0 to R = pi R^2.<p>A really pretty one cuts the circle into wedges, then rearranges them by alternating direction to make a &quot;rectangle&quot; approx r high, approx pi * r wide, with bumpy top and bottom. In the limit this has area pi * r * r, and can be shown to kids without needing calculus.<p>And it&#x27;s not magic or circular, since pi is defined (in this case...) as the ratio of circumference to diameter.')
