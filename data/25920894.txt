Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25922044], score=None, time=1611694337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920363, text='&gt; The Republican presidential candidate won in 2016 despite losing the popular vote by a huge margin<p>The 2 point margin between Trump and Clinton was less than the margin between Bush and Kerry in 2004. Neither candidate cleared 50%. Clinton “won” the popular vote with a lower total percentage than Kerry lost the popular vote in 2004.<p>Also, these counter-factual are irrelevant. The popular vote doesn’t matter because nobody is trying to win the popular vote. That’s why Clinton didn’t campaign in Wisconsin (where Obama had racked up a huge margin in 2008 and 2012.) And that’s why Trump didn’t campaign in California. Changing the voting system would change how people campaign, so the popular vote tells you nothing. Also, if we moved to a “modern” voting system, we would use a run-off, like other countries have. Trump still might have won without the large libertarian vote eliminated.<p>&gt; * There was ample evidence of the malfeasance being complained about in the 2016 election, while there was no evidence of the malfeasance being complained about in the 2020 election<p>Not in 2017 there wasn’t.<p>&gt; * The people who complained of a &#x27;stolen&#x27; election in 2016 were pushing for reforms<p>So were many of the people objecting to the 2020 election. With a Democratic House the objections were futile. They were symbolic.')
