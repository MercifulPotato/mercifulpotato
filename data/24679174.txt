There&#x27;s fear of losing some of those bits when you enter a path of medical treatments, there&#x27;s immense energy spent doing inner work that people who are considered &quot;healthy&quot; never really <i>have</i> to be doing. It&#x27;s like the neighbour is driving up a hill while you&#x27;re hiking up a mountain with a broken leg.<p>So here&#x27;s a hug.')
