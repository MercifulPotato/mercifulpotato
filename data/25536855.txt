I run a self-hosted install of ArchiveBox and it takes &gt; 10s to archive a webpage. If I am saving the page to retrieve it in a few years, I can surely wait 10-20s. One can say that an optimised setup may load and render a page in under 2s but why?<p>Apps need to fulfill our needs. Nothing more and nothing less. Just like you buy a Nissan Leaf to fulfill your need all while knowing that Bugatti Veyron is one of the fastest cars in the world pushing above 400 km&#x2F;h. Just like I use ArchiveBox written in Python and SQLite while knowing that there is Rust and RocksDB out there that can outperform Python&#x2F;SQLite.<p>Side note: I do agree that in some cases product owners <i>take over</i> both user needs and developers&#x27; good judgement and turn a good product into a horrid mess but I would argue you can do that in any programming language.<p>Go make yourself some drip coffee on this Christmas day and take it slow! Happy holidays everyone!')
