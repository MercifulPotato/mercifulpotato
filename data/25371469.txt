It&#x27;s the last past I was getting at as a rebuke to the grandparent comment.<p>Reserving service isn&#x27;t straightforward. Especially not when it comes to sharing private medical information e.g. when someone wasn&#x27;t vaccinated because of an autoimmune disease.<p>Your exact medical condition is no concern of that business, and one shouldn&#x27;t be forced to give up that information lest risking to be barred from service.<p>It&#x27;s for this reason why many businesses have terms and conditions pointing out to customers the role of personal responsibility, and asking them to waive their right to legal action. Moreover, let&#x27;s not forget the existence of business insurance that protects from calamities.<p>If vaccination can&#x27;t be mandated through public action because there&#x27;s not enough support, then that comes with consequences for the general public. One of them would be that the relationship between owner and patron gets burdened by a new liability. The question then is whether or not the harm of publicly mandated vaccination outstrips the harm caused by that liability in everyday life.')
