Item(by='l33tman', descendants=None, kids=[25656920], score=None, time=1609929974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644589, text='Yeah I guess we&#x27;re thinking similarly in that case :)<p>It IS annoying though that it seems like the &quot;last step&quot; to produce measurable results requires a global integration though even though all the field interactions are local. The path integral QFT approach even makes this explicitly manifest, and modern QFT is the gold standard of reality-matching-predictions no matter the field..<p>Oh BTW re your edit: I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;local interference&quot; would mean. If interference effects could be solved locally, there would be no entanglement, no violated Bell&#x27;s theorem or EPR experiments etc.')
