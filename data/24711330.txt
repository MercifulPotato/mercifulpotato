If it&#x27;s using 200W it&#x27;s going to dump 200W worth of heat one way or another. No cooling solution will fix that if the device is just producing more heat than can possibly be dissipated in a pleasing way.<p>In that sense, maybe the PS5 will have an advantage here by being large, because there&#x27;s more surface area to work with so it won&#x27;t feel like a little furnace, even if both consoles end up having no thermal problems (in terms of the chips overheating, etc)<p>Claims that the console is toasty even while idle are suspicious, though. It really shouldn&#x27;t be drawing that much power while idle, so I hope that&#x27;s not true at launch. So much hardware has this problem though... my macbook&#x27;s USB C dock is almost a fire hazard with how warm it gets even when it&#x27;s not in use.')
