Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604204881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956678, text='I don&#x27;t know about Canada (where the body was found), but in the US (where he was from) there is no registry of dental records. To identify someone from dental records they have to find that person&#x27;s dentist(s) and ask for the records.<p>That works great when you&#x27;ve got a list of missing persons and a body that you think might be one of them, or when you&#x27;ve got a bunch of bodies such as from a plane crash and you know who they are but just need to sort them out to return to their families for burial.<p>But when you&#x27;ve just got a body with no idea who it was? Generally dental records won&#x27;t be much use.<p>You might be able to get DNA from the pulp and use that to help identify the person, but the pulp can be damaged by fire.')
