Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603985704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931210, text='&gt; <i>In other words, they&#x27;re willing to take a loss on an asset, as that&#x27;s their fee for getting clean cash.</i><p>But like everyone else, even if there&#x27;s a loss, they want to minimize it. They&#x27;re not <i>seeking</i> a loss, so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Nobody gives up money they don&#x27;t have to -- that&#x27;s the entire point I&#x27;m making. I&#x27;m not missing the mark, it&#x27;s the article that&#x27;s missing the mark.<p>&gt; <i>Suddenly you can get an increase in supply, higher market values...</i><p>That&#x27;s the demand I referred to originally. <i>Demand is demand</i>. You&#x27;re just describing demand. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the full story.<p>&gt; <i>A launderer prefers transactions that are least likely to generate attention from the authorities.</i><p>Once the provenance has been hidden through layers of LLC&#x27;s, they still have plenty of options. They don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to give up half their money, which is my point, so they <i>won&#x27;t</i>. So it&#x27;s <i>very easy</i> to say what they&#x27;d prefer -- <i>they prefer to keep as much of their money as possible</i>.<p>The article, and you, seem to be arguing that money launderers have no problem throwing away money for no reason, as if money doesn&#x27;t matter and prices can be driven up arbitrarily without limit. My point is that this is false: money launderers <i>seek to keep as much of their money as they can</i> while still laundering it effectively. By the time they&#x27;ve made it to the stage of negotiating over a price of purchase, they function economically as a buyer <i>like any other</i>.')
