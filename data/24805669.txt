The downside is that their core strengths are in use-cases which aren&#x27;t so aligned with my interests.<p>The strength of the Python packaging ecosystem makes me doubtful of the impact Julia can have. Meanwhile for Nim, it feels to me like awareness and adoption suffer a fair bit from competing with Rust for mindshare.')
