Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608978872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25540836, text='There is very little tourism right now, ever since this started.\nBut before that, Vietnam (population 97M) had close to 20M international arrivals last year, Germany (population 83M) had 39M, Thailand (population 70M) had 40M.<p>Vietnam has essentially one train line across the county that only splits up in the very north into two train lines into China. Vietnam has 2,600km of train lines, Germany for comparison has more than 41,000km, for a comparable area size. Vietnam has about 12M train passenger rides a year (pre-Corona of course), Germany has more than 2000M (does not include intra-city light rail rides). Thailand, with an area about 1.5x of either Vietnam or Germany, has 4,400km of train lines and 38M passenger rides.<p>Vietnam has about 250,000km of roads (50% paved), Germany has 600,000km (mostly paved). Vietnam has about 3M motorized vehicles (31 per 1000 population, but there is probably a significant number of unaccounted motor scooters), Germany has 56M motorized vehicles (701 per 1000), Thailand has 40M motorized vehicles (half being motor scooters&#x2F;bikes, probably a significant number of unaccounted motor scooters) (571 per 1000).<p>You said &quot;just like the US or EU&quot;, but I disagree given these numbers. The mobility, especially medium and long distance mobility, seem quite different.<p>Public life - as dictated by climate conditions and of course economic constraints - differs as well. Average temperature in Vietnam is 24째C, Thailand 26째C and Germany 9째C (and Spain&#x2F;Greece&#x2F;Italy aka the South of Europe it&#x27;s 13째C). A lot more public life, incl paid and unpaid work, happens outside in Vietnam and Thailand, compared to Europe. When it was summer in Europe, we had a lot fewer cases and deaths than when it was cold and is now cold again. Colder weather and indoor living&#x2F;working seems to heavily correlate with Corona, at least in Europe.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean we cannot learn from nations such as Vietnam and Thailand, but it&#x27;s also not as straight forward as trying to outright mimic what they did and do in response to the pandemic.')
