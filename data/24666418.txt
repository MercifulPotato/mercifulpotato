Basically a normal situation is to have 20ppl wait for a single checkout. Then they begrudgingly open another, take 5 customers and close it again only to have the same thing repeat. I&#x27;d be happy to even pay extra just to have access to a speedier checkout self serviced or not and not have to waste half of my day waiting for this world&#x27;s worst service.')
