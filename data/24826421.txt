Back then proof of invention would establish the presumptive priority date for the whole invention. The details could be fleshed out in the subsequent filed non-provisional application.<p>After the AIA, the so-called first-to-file rule took effect where priority date is set based on the date you file the first application (provisional or non-provisional). But for a few exceptions, the first to file wins, first to invent does not apply anymore.<p>Now, US Provisional patent applications only protect the subject matter that is in the fours corners of the document. The only time we file provisional applications now, is if it there is a bar date emergency or the inventors have not had time to approve the draft non-provisional application before the bar date.')
