This move by the new district attorney in LA is so far beyond the pale that if it&#x27;s not rescinded soon, I am gone too:<p>&quot;NEW: L.A. County DA George Gascon has issued a directive to prosecutors that the following misdemeanors will be declined for prosecution, with exemptions.<p>-Trespassing<p>-Disturbing the peace<p>-Driving without license<p>-Prostitution<p>-Resisting arrest&quot;<p>This is an abbreviated tweet, and each of these has some explanation and color, for example, resisting arrest will still be prosecuted if the suspect physically assaults the officer. But they can break loose from restraint and flee and not be prosecuted for resisting.<p>Prostitution was more specifically &#x27;loitering to commit prostitution&#x27;.<p>My issue is the message this sends to those committing criminal behavior. They&#x27;d be attracted to municipalities that they know will not prosecute them. In many cases, it&#x27;s likely that this petty crime is largely in support of drug addiction or influenced by mental illness. It would be more effective (and lauded by me) if this approach was paired with an effective treatment system. None is put forth(?), and we&#x27;ll just see more and more mayhem, as we have seen already in San Francisco.')
