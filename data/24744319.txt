Item(by='mjevans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602402074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744243, text='Imagine that the laws have been written with an extremely narrow &#x27;Switzerland&#x27; clause.  This law says if something is taken down right away, with zero proof of ownership or collateral, when a specific type of legal request is made then the service provider has immunity to copyright lawsuits.<p>Due to the lack of burden of proof or stakes, this makes automating such legal requests a weaponization of the legal system.  An inordinate quantity of resources are also spent to proactively, based on a provided library of possible infringement fingerprints, automatically mark anything as something to block.  For many things the automation actually works out, however any time there is Fair Use (which is viewed as a legal defence) or Authorized Use (except problems of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing) it really doesn&#x27;t.<p>Combine this with a system where there&#x27;s also no government provided system of authenticating an individual as someone, and tying them to specific legally owned works or authorization to act by such owners and it should be obvious where the problems and solutions exist.<p>Without a megacorp&#x27;s army of lawyers, my opinion is, it seems very likely youtube and any other similar entities would either be sued or legislated out of existence.')
