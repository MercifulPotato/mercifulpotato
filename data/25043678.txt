Bombing was already at high levels in 1965. America pulled out a decade later.<p>The idea that bombing was working and political issues were the only reason America failed aren&#x27;t supported by any facts. Saying politics were the issue is mostly used merely an unfalsifiable statement.<p>If the goal of the wars are redefined to some really narrow goal like just eliminating Saddam, which is revisionist at best, it seems like sending in troops when one targeted bomb on a political event would&#x27;ve worked better is a big oversight. The invasion just caused chaos and more trouble and we still haven&#x27;t gotten ourselves out of it. Afghanistan is also total chaos, 20 years later. Military might sure isn&#x27;t helping there.<p>In most recent conflicts, the winners are generally people with motivation to fight and unpredictable attacks. Sending in aircraft carriers and deploying 50000 young guys to a place they don&#x27;t know or care about is neither unpredictable or fueled by any deep motivation. People handed a gun and taught how to make a bomb and acting to protect their family from foreign invaders are both.')
