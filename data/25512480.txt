If you&#x27;re in, say Europe, I don&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;d see a house with 120V as IIRC, 220V is the standard, and you generally have to connect to your local grid. I think the parent&#x27;s post about 120V was about international devices that may have to work in North America, for instance.')
