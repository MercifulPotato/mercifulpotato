So far this year alone I have a whole shelf of CDs that I OWN and I&#x27;ve only payed about half of what I did to stream music I don&#x27;t own for 10 years.<p>Unfortunatley some albums cost 140 dollars and up to 300 dollars for me to import, because they&#x27;re so hard to find.<p>In some cases it&#x27;s actually easier to find the vinyl print than the CD, in good condition or new. Makes me wanna get a record player.')
