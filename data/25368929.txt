Studies are still ongoing on how brains interpret different frame rates and how they effect the suspension of disbelief.<p>Clean grain dramatically increases the acutance of an image and additionally helps to prevent compression banding issues for cleaner, better looking videos (as long as delivery compression is done properly). There&#x27;s basically nothing that you see on TV or in cinema that hasn&#x27;t had grain added. It makes such a huge difference that oftentimes actual film grain is removed, color and vfx are done and applied, and then digital grain is put back on because the image improves so much. Even many video games add subtle grain (not the over the top grain settings) because of how it improves things. Film&#x27;s natural grain is the gold standard here and it&#x27;s definitely not going away.')
