I am familiar with a handful of the programs having been through one and worked with several people that were in others.  Some schools are doing a great job enacting need blind admission, others are not.<p>We are not at a point where the most prestigious schools are &quot;very cheap&quot; to any families* except the wealthiest and the poorest (where it definitely isn&#x27;t very cheap to afford plane tickets, food with the dining hall shut down, clothing so you don&#x27;t stick out as being poor, etc.)<p>* The one exception I&#x27;m confident of is Princeton, I&#x27;ve heard their need blind approach is actually well implemented and I&#x27;ve known more than one person that graduated debt free.')
