If someone can&#x27;t afford to pay the bond and then tries to run, I don&#x27;t see how that money can be reclaimed except for the taxpayer covering it.<p>Someone has decided it is easier to simply keep the accused in jail. Assuming they&#x27;ve done the math on costs properly it would make sense. Taxpayers shouldn&#x27;t be in a position to cover the cost of people running from the law.<p>It is an uncomfortable system that clearly biases in favour of the rich - but the rich are the ones covering the cost of it all so I am comfortable standing up and saying I don&#x27;t mind if they get special treatment. Wealthy people pay something like half the taxes; it seems reasonable that they can wait for their day in court in comfort. Wealth comes with privileges and they aren&#x27;t criminals until they are convicted.')
