Or would you have all the files on the target owned by the user ID accessing the target server, then keep the metadata (owner&#x2F;mode&#x2F;SE Linux attributes &#x2F; ACLs, etc) in a separate log file?<p>And do you typically turn on ZFS compression?  I tried that years ago with ZFS under Linux, but had major slowdowns after a while.  But I&#x27;m sure it has improved quite a bit in more recent years.  Also how does ZFS stack up against Btrfs in your experience?<p>But for a direct-to-cloud backup, the way you do it is really great -- to me it is much easier than messing with things like S3 buckets and similar technoligies.')
