When he was working, he&#x27;d get up at 5 am to writer for two hours before leaving for work. The whole of the Book of the New Sun was written that way. Which meant there was a certain commercial pressure to sell books, and I think his consistency flagged. I worked at Tor in the mid-to-late 1990s. I don&#x27;t think that Hartwell just accepted anything he sent, the process was a little more complicated than that, because David knew what he was working on. Gene had a tendency to resist editing; once he was done with a thing it was done.<p>I think he had some good books in that period, but there wasn&#x27;t going to be another Peace or Fifth Head of Cerebus.')
