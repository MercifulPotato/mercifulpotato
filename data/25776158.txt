Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610631901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770534, text='As a parent, is there really any difference between &quot;saving for your own future&quot; or &quot;saving for your kids&quot;? I do some saving for my future (e.g. retirement or rainy day) but I don&#x27;t have specific savings for my kids, or any particular goals for such saving (such as enough for higher education). Lots of people here save money for their kids so they can get their first apartment which is suddenly really expensive. But I&#x27;d rather improve the house we live in now, or take them on trips, and if they need $20k down in 10 years to move out, I can probably solve that. \nI started with 0 savings from my parents, they started with zero from theirs, and so on. I don&#x27;t know anyone who received a significant amount of money from their parents that wasn&#x27;t an inheritance.<p>You can&#x27;t count on politics being constant, but &quot;there is a large welfare state here also in 15 years&quot; I consider about as likely as the sun rising tomorrow.')
