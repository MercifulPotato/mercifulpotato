The other ways are:<p>1. Reduction of energy use per person.<p>2. Control of population growth - at the very least, stabilizing the Earth&#x27;s population and theoretically a reduction.<p>3. Using Energy sources which are low-carbon, but expensive and&#x2F;or difficult to deploy.<p>of course your way makes it a lot _easier_, but since reduction of greenhouse gasses is necessary regardless of the availability of a convenient energy solution, these are also relevant, and gradually are becoming necessary.<p>By the way - (1.) is already progressing relatively well in lots and lots of countries.')
