Of course they do. I however usually go along a list like this:<p>- This bed feels good<p>- So nice to be not standing or sitting, my feet are even tingling a bit<p>- This bed really feels nice, I don&#x27;t want to fall asleep, I want to enjoy this feeling just a bit longer...<p>- Maybe there is something nice to think about while enjoying this feeling of just lying in this nice clean bed with a perfect temperature...<p>- ... zzz<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky I slipped into a nice mental routine by accident.<p>To clear the mind, I recommend just the free intro sessions of headspace (and possibly more), sometimes I do the &quot;thoughts are clouds and I want a blue sky&quot; -trick when the focus on the bed doesn&#x27;t seem to work.')
