Even the Witcher 3 wasn’t all this great at launch. CDPR didn’t become a beloved company just because they released a great game. They listened to feedback, corrected a lot of bugs and introduced quality of life improvements and they put out a couple of very high quality DLCs for free. This coupled with their work in GOG restoring classic titles is what earned them their reputation.<p>There have been so many buggy video game launches, that I suspect Sony removing it from the store is not as straightforward as it appears to be.
