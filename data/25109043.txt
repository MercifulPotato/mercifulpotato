Having to pass through difficult boss level would mean literally over a week of my free time. That time would be spent by trying again and again the same thing, because it was simply difficult. But the suggestion  that it should be easier was literally mocked and treated as illegimate by far too many people. Then I realized that jounalists that wrote something similar were treated in ridiculously aggressive ways, they are not gamers, they are lazy loosers.<p>I think that is when I first realized how twisted logic of that community is. In order to not be &quot;lazy&quot; etc, you are expected to spend as much possible on gaming. And people who, like, prioritize schoolwork, work, family, create something whatever else are somehow the mocked weak lazy ones.<p>I had multiple realizations like that about aspects of gaming culture (I moved from sort of pro-gamer to disliking it all), but that was the first one.')
