For anyone who does any highway driving, it&#x27;s a competent system that a driver can use a good portion of highway driving. And it&#x27;s likely less capable than Honda&#x27;s system.<p>OpenPilot is another example - pretty good at most roads on highways or large boulevards. Like others, not for use in city streets.<p>At least for the American road system, you may be underestimating how much time people spend on large, well-defined highways that could use this system. Some other countries rely less on big highways and this could affect the portion of time available to use it.')
