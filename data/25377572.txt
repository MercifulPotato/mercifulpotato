I would wonder if they went through that thought process and what RoIs for that are from their perspective.<p>It might even take much lesser investment than equivalent of $1bil from 90s... The Java&#x2F;JVM market is huge so it might need just a little nudge :)<p>Within the JVM ecosystems it seems that basically Kotlin (as nice as it is) has been stealing some market share that might have belonged to Clojure. And all that just by selling some cheap cut syntax sugar on the corner.<p>There definitely is a huge desire within Java&#x2F;JVM community to innovate and if approached correctly Clojure could actually shine - there are just few misconceptions and fears that could be put to sleep by some smart marketing strategy. Nubank is great first step in that direction, because it gives an example of a mature large yet innovative company relying on Clojure in production.')
