We were more than 1.5% + $0.10 away from our current processor, and they wouldn&#x27;t budge to even match our existing rates. They kept saying they are a better value, and offer more things for the price - except most of the &quot;value-adds&quot; we didn&#x27;t care about (their only interesting things was the Stripe Checkout with Fraud detection - which requires you to use their hosted checkout page... which is a complete non-starter for a serious eCommerce operation).<p>Perhaps not a good fit - but paying a ton more per year in CC processing fees just because Stripe uses &quot;AI!!!!&quot; wasn&#x27;t something we could swallow.')
