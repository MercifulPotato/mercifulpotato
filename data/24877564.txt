There were special carve-outs in the one child policy for farmers. If their first child was a girl they could try again for a boy. Also the policy was very hard to apply consistently in the countryside because the bureaucracy is very thin there and its not at all uncommon for families to hide children with relatives. You can&#x27;t get away with that in the cities.<p>As for the retirement age, life expectancy in China is significantly lower than in the west. In fact in 1970 is was only 59 years. It&#x27;s still 6 years behind the USA and it&#x27;s not uncommon for significant health problems to kick in during your 50s. On the other hand as for making way for the new generation, how are they supposed to learn from more experienced older colleagues if they all retired? Oh well, I suppose that&#x27;s the problem with centrally planned economies.')
