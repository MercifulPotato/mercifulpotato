In case you read it and I know it&#x27;s too much to ask of you, but you seem to be an expert at ML, so what resources would you recommend me to read up on for a hobbyist who wants to create a project like this (I mean this x does not exist type or similar).<p>Somebody recommend Andrew NG courses but I wasn&#x27;t able to complete it and got bored. Then I tried watching sentdex and it was amazing and I&#x27;m able to fully comprehend what he does since he teaches more practical aspects like running gta v on autopilot etc.<p>So just wondering what I could learn next.')
