For the widely used stuff which big companies do a lot of, you need high efficiency and javascript ain&#x27;t gonna do that.<p>One of my co workers worked on a 5 person project for half a year that just refactored a core algorithm for a heavily used product and that halved the 5 million dollars a year in hardware costs and that&#x27;s not expensive public cloud cost but the highly efficient internal data center costs and all of the code was in C++.  Writing any of that code in javascript would just be wasting money.')
