Jeff Bezos runs a company where employees urinate in bottles because they aren&#x27;t given time for a bathroom break and asks employees in meetings &quot;why are you wasting my life&quot;. Tim Bray has some stories to tell about AWS too. Elon Musk abuses his employees, his shareholders, his companies, and everyone else on Twitter nearly every time he opens his mouth. It&#x27;s almost cheating to mention Elizabeth Holmes. Same with Travis Kalanick.<p>I think Jobs would be thought of exactly the same if he were around and in his prime today: a very controversial figure who produces amazing work but has his fair share of detractors for a number of reasons. Remember, Steve&#x27;s behavior was barely tolerated by a large number of people. He was hated by many, loved by many, merely tolerated by most.')
