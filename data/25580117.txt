Item(by='pog92', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1609320948, title='Social dilemma â€“ Removing suggested content to solve the filter bubbles?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Filter bubbles are one of the bad side effects of social medias. You see a youtube videos and you enter the rabbit hole: a world of youtube videos sharing the same &quot;ideology&quot; and creating a world totally different to what other people close to you see. You can&#x27;t agree on anything since you are part of two bubbles - different storytellings of the world - and none of you sees anything else than that bubble. \nIn the meanwhile, YT says they&#x27;re not responsible of published content such as a newspaper is, since they leave users free to publish. I agree with this position but while they don&#x27;t moderate, they do suggest content. I&#x27;d say that if you&#x27;re suggesting what to see next, you&#x27;re responsible of that suggestion.<p>So I&#x27;d say, what if YT (and al the others) could only suggest videos ranking next from the search which you  performed and&#x2F;or from the same youtube channel? Within a same channel, the publisher is responsible.<p>This way they keep you in the path you were, without targeting you with catchy videos to keep you engaged')
