Having 3&#x2F;80ish black engineers was actually significantly more diverse than if you&#x27;d just grabbed a random subset of the population. (ditto for Polish, Indians and Chinese, the actual sizable minorities in the country).<p>Now had he been talking about the 15-20% of female engineers participating, he may have had a point, but the american perspective was &quot;wow, there should be way more Black people because America has more Black people&quot;')
