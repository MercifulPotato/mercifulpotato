My personal experience was that people back then were both more nerdy and more ambitious, not a tradeoff. And now people are &quot;ambitious&quot; but it&#x27;s a personal ambition to play the game and earn more money than their peers. The people I worked with in 2009 were ambitious in the sense of building products and teams and companies to succeed in the marketplace, or creating new marketplaces. It seems like tech is where greedy people go nowadays, not ambitious people in any greater sense of ambition in the world at large.')
