Yes, capital can create value, and the inefficiency of price discovery in stock markets can lead to fluctuations in the price of a stock.<p>But ultimately, that capital came solely from labour and natural resources. If you follow the chain of value, you invariantly end up at labour and nature, because those are the only two things that can actually create value from nothing else.<p>And no, this isn&#x27;t the LTV. Read the comment carefully. Even if you admit that capital can create value, the capital still had to come from somewhere, and ultimately that somewhere is labour.')
