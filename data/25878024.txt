HN allows for easy creation of anonymous accounts, and doesn&#x27;t do much to help you track who says what. And yet some people, by choosing to stick to their handle over time, build a reputation. And yet, even the anonymous people mostly behave, and we end up with a civil community.<p>Personally, I think the important factors for maintaining a civil community is a focus on civility, some overt selection of topics (vs. having a group that&#x27;s about everything), and a lot of moderation work in the background that prevents the decay of standards. Social norms, unfortunately, don&#x27;t maintain themselves.')
