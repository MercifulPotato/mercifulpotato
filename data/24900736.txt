They act like FSD is done except for the edge cases.  The whole problem of FSD <i>is</i> the edge cases.  And, on public roads, edge cases are encountered frequently.  This is a problem of targeting Level 5.  There&#x27;s no actual way to do it.  It is <i>counter</i> to any other way of automating anything.  Automation occurs by regularizing the environment.  Every time.<p>Level 4 focuses on finding or creating highly predictable environments.  This is what allows for automation.  By regularizing the environment you can structurally eliminate the edge cases.  It works like a virtual rail system.  That works.  That&#x27;s the future.  That&#x27;s the way that automation itself actually happens in the real world.')
