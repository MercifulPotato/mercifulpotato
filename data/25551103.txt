In a tiny apartment! This trend lasted for a month, after which I sat down to actually implement this.<p>I thought it was just me being autistic but it&#x27;s interesting to know others do it as well :)<p>I never worked in an office setting, but I can only imagine it would be extremely prejudicial to people like me and the author. Restraining us to a table would limit our output for the sole reason we would be unable to pace and think (no space and too much social pressure).<p>Anecdata: sometimes I visit my parents and work from their place. I can&#x27;t pace there because I don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing so, and that alone is enough for me to not be able to tackle challenging problems there.')
