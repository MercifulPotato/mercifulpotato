A basil plant which lives on your windowsill and regrows the leaves you pick to add to sauces with essentially zero labour is certainly more efficient than buying a plastic bag too-full of perishable leaves for 80% of the plant cost from the supermarket every time. The commercial farm is more efficient at growing leaves at scale, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into a lower-cost more environmentally-friendly product for consumers not needing a large volume of leaves and paying store markup. On the other hand, people are going to need a lot of balcony space to grow a year&#x27;s supply of potatoes and spend a lot of time turning them into fries.')
