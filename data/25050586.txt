I know <i>I</i> don&#x27;t have the skills to replace my System.Speech calls with generic COM interop, I&#x27;m willing to bet that would ring true for a lot of .NET developers relying on the .NET Framework today.<p>At minimum, you&#x27;re adding a &quot;rewrite your accessibility code&quot; cost to anyone moving from .NET Framework to .NET Core. How many businesses are going to do that, versus say, drop that feature, presumably due to &quot;low usage&quot;? Is Microsoft really serving the accessibility community here? Making it harder to add accessibility to software is going to negatively impact accessibility being available in software.<p>And if it&#x27;s just a convenience wrapper, it should be trivial for Microsoft to reimplement it: And it&#x27;d be far less wasteful for Microsoft to do it for everyone than expect everyone who uses it for accessibility features to reimplement it themselves.')
