What do you think about this argument: Actually what we try to do has been done by, for instance, Google: They find people with great skills and ask them to work for them in California. They pay them so much that they will work for them and even move to Cali (at least before Covid-19).<p>Now in a Covid-19 context remote work obviously created a new way to think about salaries. If you sit at a desk in Cali or in Germany and do basically the same work, it will be very hard to communicate why the US developer should earn so much more or why the German one should earn so much less :)\nAt the end of the day we could thus start with just a few companies being willing to pay the global price tag of the skill. The result may be that these pioneering companies will hire better talents. This will also cause other developers to demand the same.  As this shift slowly progresses it might become a standard in how developers are paid.')
