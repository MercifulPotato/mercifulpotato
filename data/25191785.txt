In fact we had ours of discussions about the intensity of the scars - in the end we decided to go for a scar intensity that equals the average scar after about 2 years (so they wouldn&#x27;t be too obvious in reality either).<p>The survey has 88 picture pairs that are mixed randomly. These 88 pairs are the absolute minimum to cover all relevant breast conditions in a way that allows us to get good statistical data.\nWe calculated the average decision time per picture pair with 3 seconds - hence the 5 minutes.\nHowever the survey is structured in a way that if a participant only clicks 10 pictures, we can still use the data from those 10 clicks. So every click counts - and if someone is kind enough to click all 88 pictures, we get a full set of data.<p>Thank you very much for your interest and support!')
