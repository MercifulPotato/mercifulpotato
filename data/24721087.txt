Google has invested in natural language processing that can allow their web crawlers to make semantic sense of written text. I&#x27;m sure they would love it if a swath of volunteers did this for them instead.<p>That&#x27;s already what Google does with Schema.org<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginejournal.com&#x2F;technical-seo&#x2F;schema&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginejournal.com&#x2F;technical-seo&#x2F;schema&#x2F;</a><p>is a result I pulled up on DDG<p>&gt; Sure, some small, indie shop could use the data too. But Google can integrate with their translation engine, their home speakers and Android. They&#x27;ll make the experience nice enough that your aunt looking for a scone recipe won&#x27;t want to leave their ecosystem, even if a more free, de-centralized alternative is available.<p>Sure but without some way for smaller players to get access to the same data that the giants have, there&#x27;s no way to compete. There&#x27;s a reason Google, FB, LI, et al have spent as much energy as they have siloing their data, cutting off interop, and consolidating their services. Technical or product or user experience superiority means nothing when you don&#x27;t have the data; a polished, quick search engine means nothing if it has no results to search through.')
