Item(by='hajile', descendants=None, kids=[25839597], score=None, time=1611093448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838614, text='The FBI only lists around 30 people wanted on anything more serious than unlawful entry, violent entry, trespassing, or similar. They weren&#x27;t even charged with rioting because (as these videos show), wandering around gawking at the Capitol building isn&#x27;t rioting by any reasonable definition. That wandering also doesn&#x27;t play well with the idea that they intended violence against the legislature.<p>Yes, they should probably be charged with something, but the punishment should fit the crime and I doubt most of those people will have anything super serious happen (even if the Judge is trying to send a message).<p>EDIT: as it seems unclear, these are people WANTED for crimes NOT people actually charged (that number is lower).')
