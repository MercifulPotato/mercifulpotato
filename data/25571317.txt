I agree that compatibility probably overrides other concerns. A 3rd OS would need some <i>revolutionary</i> feature(s) to overcome its compatibility limits. And that revolutionary feature would be something that can&#x27;t be added to Windows or (x)nix. Anyone want to suggest game-changing OS features?<p>A better goal would be to <i>isolate</i> OS features to give us more choice. The file system would be independent of the GUI engine, which would be independent of the executable manager, etc. It would give one mix-and-match ability. Possible partitioning:<p><pre><code>    - Execution&#x2F;task manager\n    - GUI\n    - File system\n    - Security system\n    - App and upgrade manager\n    - Integrator</code></pre>')
