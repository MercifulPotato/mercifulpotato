I can&#x27;t even tell you what their current messaging product is right now. Google Wave is dead. Google Facebook^HPlus is dead. I think Hangouts is dead? The thing in my GMail gives me notices that it&#x27;s going away. Is it Google Voice? Why would I use a product with the name &quot;Voice&quot; to type &quot;Text&quot; to people, especially when it used to be a phone substitute. Certainly nothing is integrated, aside from whatever the thing in GMail is that&#x27;s going away (and a 100 pixel wide chat isn&#x27;t going to be useful for team discussions, anyway). Messaging for Google feels like &quot;this ought to be something we can be good at, but can&#x27;t actually figure out what to do&quot;.<p>Google makes &quot;messaging products&quot; but it&#x27;s just something that floats on top on top of the sea of Google stuff. Like oil on top of water.')
