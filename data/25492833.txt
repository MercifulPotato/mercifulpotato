For a certain type of company (well established, known resource loads) it can make sense now (though risk huge lock-in costs and wont be able to move fast enough when they arrive), but I&#x27;ve seen&#x2F;worked at many start ups that try to do the full cloud setups above and just get blown out from just costs alone.<p>The last company I worked at (south east asia start up, with just me originally as the dev, but grew to about 5 more devs when I left) we only had s3, cloudfront (though we put cdn77 infront of it cause bandwidth in SEA is a rip off with aws), and rds with postgres (and I wanted to move away from this cause backups and resizes from sql dumps are a PITA and take way too long when you have to do it over the network vs on the instance) and ran every other service we needed on ec2 instances (load balancer&#x2F;auto scaling with nginx+3rd party modules + python daemon with boto3 api, rabbitmq, solr, memcached, dnscache, pgbouncer, letsencryot, deployments to prod&#x2F;staging&#x2F;one off envs for random stuff with fabric building what was needed on a workbench then spin up instances from an AMI image [1&#x2F;4 the cost compared to using docker, with init scripts that turned off&#x2F;on applications depending on what the server was need for] to about 40+ machines at max site load]) and had to support 40+ customer domains which overall was 8-10x cheaper than the &quot;all-in&quot; AWS abomination an AWS consultant cooked up before we went that route.')
