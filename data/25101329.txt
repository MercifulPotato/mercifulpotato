If instead of oil or coal, it&#x27;s all hydro or nuclear, then presumably the biodegradability <i>is</i> an overall benefit?<p>Second, I&#x27;m curious... how actually does one measure the tradeoff between energy usage and biodegradability? The former would seem to be measured in reduction of CO2 output, while biodegradability is in reduction of non-biodegradable mass. But I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how to compare the two.<p>Is there some standard methodology? Or does it just come down to people&#x27;s personal preferences?')
