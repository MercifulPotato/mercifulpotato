Up until March 2020 it was socially acceptable to roll into your office, church, or school coughing and sneezing everywhere. In 2020 we even had to produce public health videos to teach people <i>how to wash their hands</i> and why it was a good idea to do so! This was taking place in high income, well educated countries that would consider themselves technologically advanced and socially sophisticated.<p>That casual posture is obviously gone for a generation, but what underpinned it was our collective delusion that we had conquered infectious disease <i>while all visibly ill from all the infectious disease circulating in the population every year</i>.<p>The research efforts are interesting because it seems to be a very tough vaccine candidate due in part to the sheer number of viruses and strains you’re dealing with. I’ve not seen the financials, but I’d be surprised if we were spending anything like the estimated costs of tens of billions of dollars on finding a solution. I guess it’s a case where the costs are borne in a very diffuse way but the solutions have to come out of specific research budgets. Why bother researching and getting approval for a vaccine, when you can just sell people over the counter snake oil like cough medicine?<p>We don’t have to shrug when our low baseline expectations for life get even worse. We can and must do better if we believe in progress.')
