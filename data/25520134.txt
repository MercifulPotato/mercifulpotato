A plausible link, like what dog does the &quot;Aerospace Industries Association&quot; have in the 5G network hardware market?<p>From my not-very-informed perspective US competitors don&#x27;t need to catch up to Chinese equipment, the Chinese equipment makers are locked out. If anything the US equipment makers would have the OPPOSITE motivation, get the spectrum sold and get their sub-standard equipment into the networks before the position of the US government could possibly change and they face real competition. And that is kind of what is happening, right? The actual story here is the FCC (lead by carrier and equipment friendly folks) are seemingly pushing ahead despite concerns from <i>other</i> industries, no?')
