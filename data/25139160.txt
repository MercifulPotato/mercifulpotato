I would say the social networking is more of an issue but Roblox and Minecraft are probably less so. Minecraft is basically virtual lego.  Roblox is basically puzzles outside of adopt me.. I would ban adopt me if I could.. Yes there can be issues of bullying and what not. YouTube may be the worse of the bunch b&#x2F;c it is so close to TV itself and that&#x27;s where you see celebritification.  We know its a seismic force from  unboxing videos all the way up.  I&#x27;ve seen it in person.  But there are some YouTube shows that are not just consumerism and have wholesome content.<p>I will add that remote school adds in a live video component and my kids Facetime with their friends while playing games.  I find that encouraging since it&#x27;s the opposite of social isolation.<p>Clearly these things can be addictive. We know from Asian internet cafes that they are.<p>As an anecdote... I was raised on TV basically after school for a couple hours, basically latch key.  I was also raised on a computer. The computer basically became my primary focus.  My current job is software engineering and I was way ahead of the game even before college.   Today, I don&#x27;t watch TV at all.<p>So I think there is a big distinction between active and passive screen time.<p>That being said, when I go camping or off to a remote cabin with no Internet, I find it nice to disconnect.  You could argue that&#x27;s a more natural state for us so I think it&#x27;s important to take that time with your kids for a week or two where all there is is nature.')
