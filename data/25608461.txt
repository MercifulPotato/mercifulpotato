You have input into setting OKRs and idea generation is expected for this level (especially at Amazon, not as much at G from what I&#x27;ve seen).<p>FWIW as a non-yet-Senior-SWE at Google, I have input and influence in OKRs both for myself and others on the team. This depends a lot on the particular work though. I work on internal infra, which is driven less by PMs and external market things, and much more by engineers proactively identifying areas for technical improvement and user pain.')
