Lol&#x27;d when I heard Andrew Ross Sorkin&#x27;s take on it.<p>I do know that the DFV post was the match, but I think stimulus + people generally wanting to take revenge + the WSB post that revealed that Melvin was shorting GME, so let&#x27;s fuck it up + Robinhood&#x27;s post-pandemic popularity were the reasons for this to go out of control unlike other previous movements.<p>One thing it has shown is how much vulnerable the US financial system is. Although this time it was retail investors left holding the bag, this situation could be destructive very easily.<p>Imagine now, if Russia wanted to take down the US economy. They could create a buffer hedge fund, maybe 3-5B, which would be obliterating itself anyways. Then get some bots to bump up activity around a particular stock, maybe generate fake short interest against GS (smallest big 6 bank, so I chose it). Then create a CtA on WSB, calling for a mass short to dethrone GS based on fake information, and pump it up with bots. Retail starts shorting, Algobots might pick up on the momentum and join the trend, followed by traditional HFs joining the crowd. In the end, you&#x27;ll have GS being shorted for no particular reason, but enough to cause some serious damage momentarily. Price goes down, they get deemed overlevered, and they&#x27;re forced to take a bailout (highly damaging to the politicians in Congress who support it) or led to fail (which would cause shockwaves across the street). It&#x27;s likely the politicians will sacrifice themselves for a cushy job post politics, but the current ruling party would lose all legitimacy in front of its voters.<p>I imagine such a scenario would be easily plausible in Europe, where the banks are much weaker financially (save for the Swiss ones).')
