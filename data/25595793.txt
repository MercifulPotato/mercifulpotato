Or, at the very least, remove the graying-out of the comment text; it&#x27;s childish and demeaning and serves no purpose other than to <i>highlight</i> what some people have considered to be &quot;wrong.&quot; dang (and whomever else may moderate) already has the ability to collapse comments if the subject-matter is especially egregious.<p>Some people down-vote when they simply disagree with whatever is being conveyed. This behavior is not conducive to a thoughtful, substantive conversation.<p>Beyond signaling a post&#x2F;comment is of low quality or off-topic, I do not see any use for the down-vote; the &#x27;flag&#x27; option exists for this purpose. I also believe the bar for the flagging privilege be set higher.')
