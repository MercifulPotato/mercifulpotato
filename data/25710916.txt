It&#x27;s a collection of poorly spun word-salad stolen loosely from third-parties. And the aim isn&#x27;t on quality but to satisfy the editors compulsive need to contribute to Wikipedia&#x27;s ever-growing rat&#x27;s nest of non-sense... just because. In every article there will always be a historical section probably about 3&#x2F;4ths the articles width that you just skip over (it&#x27;s useless.) Then, maybe if you&#x27;re lucky there will be some notes of value.<p>These notes are almost always useless for two reasons:<p>1. They are never detailed enough to do anything with.<p>2. They usually assume massive amounts of prior audience knowledge. To the point where said audience wouldn&#x27;t need the website.<p>So they have the unique distinction of being useless to both beginners and expert audiences (quite the feat if you think about.) In the end after you&#x27;ve realized whatever article you&#x27;re reading is useless (mostly all of them) you&#x27;ll leave and do what you should have done in the first place: your own research.<p>I really do wish there was a way to block results in Google. Wikipedia and it&#x27;s merry band of 13-yo editors would be the first to go.')
