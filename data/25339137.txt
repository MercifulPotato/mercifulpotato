I have to admit I haven&#x27;t read the whole article but from experience gas is much more pleasant to use. Excepting the fact that you have a nice glass surface that is easy to clean, cooking with electric is frustrating.<p>&gt; The people most burdened by these impacts are those who struggle the most to pay for cleaner alternatives<p>I don&#x27;t believe cost is the main issue, rather lack of awarness. I just checked, in Uk  you find both gas and electric hobs for the same price tag - stating from 100 gbp.<p>The biggest cost of installing a electic cooktop is actually having dedicated wiring with a 32amp fuse. This is more tricky in old builds, it could require changing the fuse box and running new wires - a lot of mess. In new builds it is more common to have this by default.<p>So it&#x27;s not exactlly a case of rich&#x2F;poor but rather old&#x2F;new.')
