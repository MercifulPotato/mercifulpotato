The early code examples in the article wouldn’t compile in Rust: you have to use atomic types explicitly, or pass values around explicitly (which will most commonly match the two paradigms of memory sharing and message passing). Rust makes doing things the way shown here quite difficult, which is a good thing, because the idiomatic functionally-equivalent code in Rust will be much easier to follow.')
