I&#x27;m pretty sure the US was going to war in Iraq no matter what NYT said, but I&#x27;m happy to be proven wrong.<p>The faulty NYT reporting gave the government a certain level of cover to allow them to do what they already planned to do. Parler was a forum for participants to discuss and actively plan sedition. And there&#x27;s already violence threatened in the days around inauguration so it stands to reason it could have served the same role again.')
