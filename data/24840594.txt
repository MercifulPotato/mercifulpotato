No ads for Pocket&#x2F;VPN&#x2F;whatever.  Maybe it comes with DDG as the default search engine<i>.  Or maybe it&#x27;s pre-configured with a set of tested privacy-focused extensions.<p>Pro-privacy advocates might be in the minority, but it&#x27;s a growing and generally vociferous minority.  Mozilla&#x27;s VPN offering suggests they see privacy as a market.  FF is still by far their most popular offering; so I&#x27;m simply wondering why there&#x27;s been no effort I&#x27;m aware of to explore the intersection of FF, privacy and revenue.<p></i>Recognising Google would most likey challenge that.')
