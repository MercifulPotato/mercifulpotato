Beyerdynamic has some models which are generally reasonably performant for their price range and widely recommended when people are starting out.  If I were to think of a brand that&#x27;s like the &quot;Apple&quot; of studio headphones, it&#x27;d probably be Sennheiser, although they also make some very high quality products.<p>For the $500 a pair of Airpods Max is going to cost, though, you can get some &#x2F;serious&#x2F; headphones, that gets you straight out of dynamic transducers and into the entry grade planar magnetic and even entry electrostatic earphones.<p>There&#x27;s simply no reason to spend that much on Airpods Max compared to the available market if you actually care about performance and sound quality.')
