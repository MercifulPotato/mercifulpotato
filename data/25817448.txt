I picked on cron&#x2F;syslog&#x2F;apt as there aren&#x27;t too many times I see them used on server fleets these days. That&#x27;s coming from 10 years working in both SRE&#x2F;systems and Software Eng roles on fleets of 1k+ servers both in and out of clouds.  It&#x27;s really diffiult to convince new engineers that even having a persistent process is a good idea vs. using an orchestration service.<p>As for the syslog&#x2F;cron&#x2F;apt examples I&#x27;ll share some more detail below.<p>- Syslog Isn&#x27;t used as it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to pull in ones favorite language specific log library, combined with ones favorite log tool of choice and be off to the races.<p>- Cron doesn&#x27;t get used as it can only <i>easily</i> handle scheduling on a specific host.  Whereas there are a plethora of distributed schedulers which will happily run commands on any number of hosts.<p>- Apt&#x2F;yum don&#x27;t get used as folks want to have their builds to be repeatable, and rely on software built in via their dependency management system of choice and deployed via fat statically linked binary.')
