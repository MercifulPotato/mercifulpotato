When you have a companies like MasterCard banning donations from all republicans who take a certain political positions (objecting to the electoral vote in this case) then something needs to be done.<p>If Twitter censors you it is possible to move to another platform, or even create your own, but if Visa and Master card ban you, what exactly do you do?<p>To some extent I feel similar about core AWS services. I think people probably should have a some legal right to basic internet services. I understand it&#x27;s possible to build your own internet infrastructure as Gab has proven, but it&#x27;s very difficult for the average person to do what Gab did. As an individual I could move to another social media platform, but if my web hosts bans me I wouldn&#x27;t have the resources to host my own website which seems wrong given how important the internet is to us as a utility today.<p>IMO social media censorship, while an important conversation to have, isn&#x27;t the primary conservation. This would be far less of an issue if alternative platforms like Gab and Parler weren&#x27;t constantly under attack by monopolies which provide core services like payment processing and core internet services. The fact a company like Gab has had resort to accepting cash in the post for PRO membership for simply trying to protect its users right to free speech online is a complete failure of regulation IMO.')
