The relationship between an editor and a writer is always one of mutual cooperation and agreement. Not that the editor always must agree with what the author writes, but that there is mutual agreement over the standards of what is being published.<p>Greenwald and the intercept reached an irresolvable position regarding publishing standards, so they went their separate ways.

Maybe the intercept is in fact a corrupt publication, but that depends entirely on your judgement of their decision not to publish what Greenwald wanted to publish.')
