Patented work too.<p>Not to mention, this was purely for power transmission - no one had any idea if they could hold up to mechanical forces of high power magnets, hell, they had a serious problem which was that high temperature superconductors actually would very suddenly stop superconducting if the impinging magnetic field exceeded a critical threshold.<p>All this was true right up to 2010 - is still somewhat true today because again, there is no scaled up artifact proving it&#x27;s actually possible to use.<p><i>Everyone</i> who wanted to work on high temperature superconductivity was - it wasn&#x27;t like this was a field which was struggling. And the story at the time - and in fact still, today - was that it wasn&#x27;t reliable enough and for ITER definitely would be the wrong technology choice for it&#x27;s goals - which was to build a facility handling large volumes of plasma in a plausible fusion generator environment.<p>The 5 year timelines being thrown around like gospel here sound utterly absurd on the face of that. A damn CRUD web app takes a year to build, but an experimental fusion plant using essentially nothing but bespoke parts will be done in 5? Cheaply? No.')
