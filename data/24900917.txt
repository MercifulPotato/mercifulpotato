If someone compiled the C++ app for your architecture, sure â€“ if not, you need to figure out how to compile it and depending on the compiler and set of headers you have installed, it&#x27;s not always easy. When I say, not always easy I&#x27;m being generous, there have been cases when the function signature was different between the sets of headers the author had and what I had...<p>In Java&#x27;s case if you have all the class files, all you need is the JVM for your architecture. You don&#x27;t need the program&#x27;s author to compile it for your architecture.<p>And finally, JVM tuning does not need to be performed by the user, but <i>can</i> be performed by the user. The most frequent tuning needed to be done by the user was the maximum memory that the JVM could allocate, but that hasn&#x27;t been needed for a long time (since Java 8, I think). Now the JVM, by default, has the sensible behavior to allocate as much memory as the OS will let it, when asked by the application.')
