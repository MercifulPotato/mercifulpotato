There is the odd page I use chrome for due to compatibility issues, but for the most part I really prefer the former two. I, on a daily basis, have 4-7 Safari windows (work and new home-hunting) with tabs open all over the place as well as a Firefox full screen with another series of tabs (personal tasks). Never any problems.')
