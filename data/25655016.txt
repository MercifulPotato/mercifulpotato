That&#x27;s literally the reason. It&#x27;s the same for mineshafts. These concepts are introduced to confuse you.<p>&quot;But pumped hydro requires some very specific geographyâ€”two big reservoirs of water&quot;<p>So does concrete. Expect you are building the geography and it&#x27;ll be around the same size if it stores around the same energy.')
