In high level languages you can just write huge amount of code in a try-catch block that runs in a single transaction and if something goes bad, the entire transaction will be rolled back (without writing a single line of code for this to happen). In Go you have to handle return codes after each operation and that is 100x more code. I don&#x27;t have time for such micro-optimizations.')
