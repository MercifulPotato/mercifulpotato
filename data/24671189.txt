We&#x27;re also building a business based on open-source &#x2F; open-core software and have managed to build an active Github community around our first product (Klaro - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiprotect&#x2F;klaro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiprotect&#x2F;klaro</a>). It&#x27;s a pretty simple tool that helps organizations to manage consent and protect their user&#x27;s privacy on their website. We have other, more complex products in the making as well (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiprotect&#x2F;kodex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiprotect&#x2F;kodex</a> - a privacy engineering toolkit). What we found during the development of Klaro is that even a very simple product can require a tremendous amount of work to turn into a functioning product. I think we&#x27;re almost there now but it took several months of building and refining.<p>For me, the main benefit of developing in the open is the great feedback and contributions we get from our community. A lot of people have reached out to us based on our open-source work, I don&#x27;t think this would&#x27;ve happened if we had developed a closed-source tool.')
