The salient point (defensive gun use) is not substantiated by your linked report as it specifically mentions the CDC may not collect this data:<p>&gt; In  addition  to  the  restrictions  on  certain  kinds  of  data  collection,<p>&gt; congressional action in 1996 effectively halted all firearm-related injury research<p>&gt; at  the  CDC  by  prohibiting  the  use  of  federal  funding  “to  advo-cate<p>&gt; or  promote  gun  control.”18  In  2011,  Congress  enacted  similar  re-strictions<p>&gt; affecting  the  entire  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  The<p>&gt; net  result  was  an  overall  reduction  in  firearm  violence  research<p>&gt; (Kellermann  and  Rivara,  2013).  As  a  result,  the  past  20  years  have<p>&gt; witnessed  diminished  progress  in  understanding  the  causes  and  ef-fects<p>&gt; of firearm violence.<p>Additionally, &quot;homicide&quot; is not a sufficient tally of gun deaths.  There are also suicides and unintended discharges.<p>Regardless, the original point is that guns are primarily designed to kill things.  It would not be &quot;effective&quot; defense if that were not the case.  2A advocates do not defend their gun rights purely so they can enjoy target shooting.')
