For me, it was Winter Challenge (1991), where, as an overly confident 14-year old, I tried to manipulate my high-scores by changing the EXE (or COM?) file. I broke it, of course. And with no backup disk, I set out to just make another Winter Challenge in Q-Basic. Which, obviously, failed even more so. But many PRINTs and GOTOs later, I had found a hobby that has given back so much over the years. I was curious to hear your stories.')
