If you dont sort in-place, you dont have quicksort and if you dont need in-place sort, then quicksort is the wrong choice anyway.<p>Of course, canonical Haskell does not have a concept of in-place, which makes showing quicksort in Haskell also a questionable idea.<p>&gt; You could argue that a reasonably fast implementation of quicksort is much more convoluted, which it most certainly is, but that doesn&#x27;t make this implementation any less real.<p>A reasonably fast implementation of quicksort is straight-forward in any language that has arrays&#x2F;vectors with destructive updates. This implementation will have issues with pathological cases, but that&#x27;s a problem of the quicksort algorithm, not of the implementation (whereas the Haskell one shown above has problems in the implementation).')
