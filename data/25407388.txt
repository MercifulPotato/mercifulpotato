Code becomes a many layered cake consumed by the end user. In the web development stack the simplest of features like text on a screen is the achievement of decades of technological progress. Text may be localized, shaped with HarfBuzz, run through libicu&#x27;s BIDI algorithm, encoded with a nontrivial encoding, wrapped in markup language, nested inside of multiple layers of network headers and corresponding metadata, sent over the wire as a series of 0s and 1s, and then painstakingly unpacked in reverse order.<p>This is clearly complicated and clearly works. Many different actors operating quasi-independently. You can imagine the difficulty when one actor in a time crunch tries to design a similarly complicated cake stitched together with parts homemade, parts open sourced and parts paid for.')
