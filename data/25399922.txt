Out of curiosity how did you typeset &#x2F; format the book? It looks gorgeous! Was it in HTML&#x2F;CSS? In which case I assume you are using Prince XML I guess since you got the pagination just right.<p>Separately on topic, CSS debugging is a hard thing to put in book form, and there is a lack of materials on the web on CSS (stack overflow which is usually great for programming languages, is not as good for front end design in my opinion), so for those learning CSS, or aspiring to be web developers, this could be a great starting resource.')
