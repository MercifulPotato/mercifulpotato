Item(by='joseph_grobbles', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609254423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570022, text='Maybe you lumped Canada in with the US, but Apple Maps is superb here, and I always default to it with few complaints [1]. It already was brilliant for navigation, but their recent detail update makes it much more usable for map porn.<p>The fun thing about maps is that there is little lock-in. If I go to someplace where Apple Maps is poor, I&#x27;ll open Google Maps. Heck, if a particular city or country had a superior option (&quot;ItalyMapper&quot; where the citizens and government of Italy put group effort into making an excellent product) I&#x27;d use that for the trip. There is absolutely nothing saying that it&#x27;s all or nothing (you aren&#x27;t saying this, but some other comments are arguing as if this is a holistic binary choice that we all have to make. But we don&#x27;t).<p>My son sends me Google Maps links when he&#x27;s at friends and needs a pickup because that&#x27;s what he uses. Whatever. I use GM for that trip, but revert back to AM when I am setting directions myself.<p>[1] - I enjoy the app more, don&#x27;t like Google tracking, and it&#x27;s simply <i>better</i> at navigating. GM does a lot of weird stuff. On major city streets with two lanes in each direction, but with an <i>extra</i> left turning lane that appears near the intersection, it will say &quot;stay right to continue straight&quot; as I approach. It is confusing -- do I need to move to the right lane? (no) -- and when the actual instructions are just &quot;keep going straight&quot; it&#x27;s needlessly intrusive because of course that is what I was going to do regardless. Weird little quirks like that abound.')
