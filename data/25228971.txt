Item(by='meheleventyone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606487666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228223, text='&gt; However I&#x27;m now in situations where the world is divided and asking questions (in order to make my own mind up) is considered some kind of admission of guilt for being part of the &quot;other&quot;.<p>I think this is partly because the rules or conventions that allowed rational discussion in good faith have been hacked by those acting in bad faith. The sad truth is that good faith discussion has been utterly rhetorically hijacked by things like &quot;just asking questions&quot; so when someone is genuinely asking questions you are assumed to be acting in bad faith. I have no idea what the answer to that is other than to find people you can trust to have these conversations with. And the danger is a lot of the people you think you can trust are just more people acting in bad faith.')
