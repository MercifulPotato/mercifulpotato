Item(by='Seb-C', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602081318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24706802, text='Sorry, I just re-read my initial comment and I think the way I wrote it was misleading.<p>My case was about the allow-scripts directive of the sandboxed iframe, which I thought was linked to the csp mechanism, but now that I checked the documentation, it seems that I was wrong.<p>I basically display a random HTML document in an sandboxed iframe with disabled scripts. When you do so on Chrome and Firefox, the event listeners injected inside the iframe from a script in the parent frame still works, but on Safari it does not because all the scripts (or events) inside the iframe are disabled.<p>So rather that relying on this mechanism, I used DOMPurify to filter all the scripts.')
