A sitting politician complained for fraud. Such complaints are a dime a dozen in elections all around the world. Heck, that&#x27;s what the other side complained about too, in 2016, and has a long history in US politics.<p>And if he &quot;orchestrated&quot; a walk-in into the Capitol (where nothing much happened, and politicians were up to business as usual the very same day), the other side has organized and lauded dozens of protests, including some with looting and even burning of police departments and areas of cities, throughout 4 years.<p>As a European, I see a lot of cant on both sides, and a lot of pearl clutching by the side that gets all the legitimacy offered by the mainstream media and the &quot;polite society&quot;. In other words, it&#x27;s partisanship 101.<p>Downvote freely, it&#x27;s a partisan country anyway')
