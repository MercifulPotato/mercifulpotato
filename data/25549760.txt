If most of the ship&#x27;s size is already dedicated to fuel that&#x27;s burnt, that seems to leave little left for fuel payload. I also assume fuel payload would be much heavier than other types of payload, requiring more ship fuel to launch it, further taking up space.<p>It seems like for every full refill you could provide in space it&#x27;d take an additional 3-4 ships just to get it up there?')
