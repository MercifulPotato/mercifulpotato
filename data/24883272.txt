(Not the AL1 arithmetic&#x2F;logic chip, but an I&#x2F;O chip.)  I think the main reason that Four Phase&#x27;s AL1 didn&#x27;t get more attention is that the processor was used as part of a proprietary computer, so it didn&#x27;t have much visibility. In comparison, the 8008 was sold as an individual product with extensive documentation and support (essentially creating the microcomputer industry). The other factor is that improvements in NMOS made four-phase logic the losing technology, so it was mostly forgotten.')
