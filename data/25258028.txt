Item(by='at-fates-hands', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606765471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257227, text='&gt;&gt; My employer, a fortune 100, has had a 100% work from home since late February or early March<p>The experience with my current employer (fortune 500) has been all over the map:<p>First it was: &quot;Stay home if you don&#x27;t feel safe, otherwise, you should be at the office.&quot;<p>Then it was: &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re going full WFH for a few months.&quot;<p>Then it was: &quot;We going to start transitioning back to the office - we&#x27;re going to have 2 week shifts. 2 weeks in the office, then 2 weeks out.&quot;<p><i>nobody showed up anyways, which apparently raised the ire of the executive teams since they were doing badge reports and they reports were really bad</i><p>Then it was: &quot;Yeah, you know that 2 two week shift idea? Forget it, we need everybody back in the office, effective immediately.&quot;<p>This came down from the CEO. The middle management and executive teams were not cool with that idea, so they told their team members only come in if you want to, otherwise, stay at home - regardless of what the CEO says.<p>Right now, with this new surge, there hasn&#x27;t been any new mandate(s) coming down. People are out of the office full time and nobody I&#x27;ve spoken to has any desire to go back into the office to work or wear a mask the entire time they&#x27;re working.<p>The company recently sold two of their buildings to an out of state real estate company. I&#x27;m assuming it was a cost cutting decision since the company has about a dozen buildings they own in the city. I would think a lot of companies would start doing this as well. Having a huge overhead for real estate you&#x27;re not using isn&#x27;t good for the bottom line.')
