Adding those at pishop.us (16 GB card) takes the price to $95.85.<p>We don&#x27;t know whether the BeagleV price includes those necessary items or not but either way coming within a factor of 2 of Raspberry Pi price is pretty impressive at this stage. Up until now you&#x27;ve paid $3000 for a 1.5 GHz RISC-V setup with HDMI and USB etc, if you&#x27;ve got one actually in your hands (HiFive Unleashed plus MicroSemi HiFive Expansion board), or $665 for one that will start delivery in March (HiFive Unmatched). There is also the $499 Icicle which is quad core but only single-issue (like the HiFive Unleashed) and only 600 MHz.<p>Prices are plummeting.')
