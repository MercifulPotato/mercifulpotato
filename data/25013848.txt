GitHub scans every commit to a public repo for secrets one of our secret scanning partners may have issued. We forward those candidate secrets to the issuing partner, and they take action. In some cases they auto-revoke the secret (AWS normally does this, I believe), in some cases they notify the user, and in some cases the response is configurable.<p>I checked that GitHub detects these tokens myself - within 1 second of the commit GitHub had notified AWS and Slack of the leak. AWS and Slack will then have taken action and informed the token owner, which in this case is Thinkst Canary, rather than Andrezj (the OP). I believe AWS normally auto-revoke, but they may have a custom setup with Thinkst Canary&#x27;s tokens that allows Thinkst to continue to monitor them even once compromised.<p>Finally, GitHub actually delays the indexing of our search by a couple of seconds to ensure that, for normal cases, our secret scanning partners have time to take action before anyone else can find the tokens.<p>We&#x27;re always looking to make secret scanning at GitHub better, so feedback as always welcome. It&#x27;s also fascinating (and validating!) to see what happens to exposed tokens.<p>* List of GitHub secret scanning partners: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;administering-a-repository&#x2F;about-secret-scanning#about-secret-scanning-for-public-repositories" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;admin...</a><p>* Thnkst Canary tokens: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canarytokens.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canarytokens.org&#x2F;</a>')
