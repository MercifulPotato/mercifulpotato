Item(by='ajuc', descendants=None, kids=[25569301], score=None, time=1609244784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568974, text='My best idea was to assign &quot;importance&quot; to each event, and only record when each NPCs met and for how long.<p>Then when I check if NPC x knows about EVENT y I check who he met between time of the event and now and look at importance (witnessed murder would be high) and if there&#x27;s a path for the information to pass - then he knows.<p>But it&#x27;s too much work to do in every &quot;tick&quot; of the quest process. It should only be checked when something changed (someone who knows meets someone else).<p>It became too complicated system for just a few usages and some background gossip. But I think for a big RPG it could be great. Would allow more reactive world and more interesting quest design.<p>I think the main reason AAA games don&#x27;t do this is voice overs. If we had good emotional speech synthesis a lot of new possibilities would open. So indies have an advantage here because text-only is still accepted.')
