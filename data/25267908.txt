It&#x27;s easy to forget the day to day conveniences when you are using windows or osx every day for a few years. If you could accurately sum up the time spent fiddling with your <i></i>nix desktop OS over the lifetime of the install, the &quot;area under the curve&quot; so to speak, windows and osx are going to absolutely blow any <i></i>nix distro out of the water. It is parasitic and insidious how many things don&#x27;t &quot;just work&quot;. You will invariably end up wasting much of your life getting software, printers, scanners, webcams, monitors, or whatever to work the way you want with your <i></i>nix distro. And even when it does &quot;work&quot; it&#x27;s not going to be as good as a real desktop OS. I ran freeBSD on my Toshiba Satellite 1905-s301 for 4 years before getting a MBP and I have zero temptation to go back.')
