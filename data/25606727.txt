People who are concerned about getting sick or dying, then, should take more caution (staying home, wearing PPE, etc). That standard has always existed. Up until 2020, there was always the chance that you would catch some virus, bacterial infection, etc.<p>The rebuttal that&#x27;s always applied to this is that &quot;so you don&#x27;t care about people, then?&quot; which is not the point.<p>Personally, I can and should be legally able to take whatever precautions I think are necessary without any interference or looming punishment from the government. I&#x27;d much rather this sort of thing be policed socially amongst individuals as opposed to giving carte blanche to government to lock people up.')
