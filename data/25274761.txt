Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606900896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274583, text='Sure, but the political party currently in government (and the particular <i>people</i> from that party in government) have shown great inclination to put &quot;Favour for an old friend&quot; above &quot;This makes sense to not kill thousands of people&quot; in their priorities.<p>The UK has universal healthcare so the infrastructure and public understanding are in place to actually do the vaccination programme per se. I have every confidence that the NHS medics will do their part efficiently as they do every year for the Flu shot I get, but getting frozen vaccine delivered to local NHS clinics is a logistics problem and an opportunity for somebody&#x27;s wife&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s ex-boyfriend to be given a £100M contract even though he has no relevant experience and is obviously the wrong choice.<p>Six months later, with headlines about vaccine shipments defrosting abandoned in carparks miles from their intended destination and tens of thousands more dead the government will announce it had a brain wave, the Army (always the people drafted in when policy has failed) will now deliver vaccines. Don&#x27;t worry about the money which has meanwhile mysteriously increased to £250M due to &quot;performance payments&quot; which somehow didn&#x27;t involve performance but did involve payments - that&#x27;s water under the bridge, can&#x27;t be helped ...<p>Remember when we were going to do a snap Brexit, no transition, just drop dead one day suddenly? Basically the same group of fools paid people with no relevant experience and <i>no ships</i> to provide last minute ferry services. How do you provide ferry services with no ships? You don&#x27;t, you just pocket the cash.')
