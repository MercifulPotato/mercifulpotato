I&#x27;m not suggesting everyone should do their own climate change research to believe climate change. I&#x27;m just suggesting they don&#x27;t have to believe all the headlines they read, they can read multiple news sources with different political views, etc. Basically, you want people to decentralize their trust in authority. I think that&#x27;ll quell fake news more than getting Facebook to try to moderate it all a like giant, impossible game of whack-o-mole. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that complicated.

I think it&#x27;s a lot more complicated, and risky, to overly moderate your tech platform for &quot;misleading&quot; news, particularly related to politics.')
