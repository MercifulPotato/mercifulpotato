The current value of bitcoin is an early indication of people betting on inflation. There doesn&#x27;t need to be inflation, there only needs to be an expectation of inflation for investors to pile into bitcoin, thus massively driving up the price. And investors piling in will drive the price massively because there&#x27;s a fixed supply of bitcoin so the price is entirely driven by demand and the current present value of all the bitcoins in existence is still ~500Bn, the same amount as a company on the stock excahnge. The price of all the gold in the world for comparison is ~10Tn. Or to put it another way, if inflation now doesn&#x27;t happen, the price of bitcoin looks ridiculous and there&#x27;d be a massive crash as everyone floods back out. In fact, further than that, if inflation doesn&#x27;t <i>sky rocket</i> then the value of BTC looks silly.')
