It would cut copyright bots off at the knees since they&#x27;re currently designed to err on the side of false positives over false negatives and that&#x27;s the way the media cartels want it.<p>You would have to break the RIAA and MPAA&#x27;s hold over Congress first, and good luck with that.  You can&#x27;t vote them out because they own both sides.  We&#x27;re talking about multiple multi billion dollar companies here, when they go to congress with demands they get it.  That&#x27;s how we got the DMCA and ludicrous 120 copyright terms in the first place.')
