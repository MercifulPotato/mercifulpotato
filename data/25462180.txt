Every rule has exceptions and once someone tries such a system for a time they&#x27;ll probably learn them. Having them avoid such food until then and start eating healthier right now would be more beneficial than waiting.<p>Most of rule #2 would be encapsulated by rule #1 anyway, it just reinforces it.')
