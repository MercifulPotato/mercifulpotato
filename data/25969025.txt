Apple care much more about being able to move fast and clean up bad interfaces in their software, which is a priority I value.<p>I’m not saying that’s what happened here, but I do know that Apple ultimately expects developers to pay attention to new releases and make sure their software behaves properly with them.<p>As for standard utilities being broken, I’ve never experienced that on macOS.
