They also have change logs that mention any corrupting bugs, which is getting quite rare for only on few occasions. I&#x27;m migrating from  restic to borg.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borgbackup.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;changes.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borgbackup.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;changes.html</a><p>The downside of borg is that the target is only sftp and not directly to any of S3 and some other targets but there are online services that accept sftp.<p>On the other hand, restic is new and while this can sync towards many targets, the use of memory gets crazy after a while that my machine choked out of memory and these kind of stability problem is something not mentioned in the docs until you use it.<p>I&#x27;ve tried several others like duplicacy but this also has a memory problem and both restic and duplicacy seem to have trouble fixing it quickly.<p>When it comes to backup, I&#x27;d like to use more than 1 implementation toward different remote locations in case 1 of the implementation has corruption bugs to render the backup useless.<p>Trying out kopia to see if it does any better.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kopia.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kopia.io</a><p>Also asuran seems promising but so far too early to test it out.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asuran.rs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asuran.rs&#x2F;</a>')
