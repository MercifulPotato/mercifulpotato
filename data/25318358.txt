If you&#x27;re saying that your hypothetical land shouldn&#x27;t pay the tax the neighboring 10 homes are paying, I think the economist would say something like that clearly isn&#x27;t the most productive use of the land and you should build on it, I guess. Again, not an endorsement, just my view of the argument.<p>Also I think &quot;occupancy taxes&quot; as referred to by policy people means a tax on <i>unoccupied</i> land&#x2F;homes (e.g. pied a terre laws). But I could be mistaken.')
