Outside of the issues discussed, this email was not what I would expect from senior manager.  The language is all over the place.  It is rambling.  It is not unintelligible, but is far from an easy read.  It seems like something dictated into a machine rather than something composed on a keyboard.  If you are not confident in your use of language but still want to go out in a blaze of glory, make sure someone QCs your final speech.')
