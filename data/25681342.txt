That&#x27;s 70 million people out of ~83 million in an estimate of 2019 according to Wikipedia. There&#x27;s still a bunch of different companies that provide coverage under this public system. I remember ~15%+ depending on which company you went with for health insurance. And that&#x27;s the _public_ system.<p>You can play around here if you want: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brutto-netto-rechner.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brutto-netto-rechner.info&#x2F;</a>. I plugged in 70.000EUR per year (which is reasonable for a senior dev depending on city (i.e. this is way more than I was paid in Frankfurt 10 years ago but we&#x27;re talking different level and 10 years ago ...) but you&#x27;ll get less even as a senior today probably if you&#x27;re in some &quot;flyover state&quot; equivalent of Germany.<p>Where it says &quot;Rentenversicherung&quot; that&#x27;s your pension.\nWhere it says &quot;Arbeitslosenversicherung&quot; that&#x27;s your EI.\nWhere it says &quot;Krankenversicherung&quot; that&#x27;s your health insurance. Remember, this is the public system, which has been going way down hill since I was working in Germany. Nowadays you gotta have a separate insurance for certain things in dental care for example, that were just covered for me, when I was there.<p>So for my EUR 70.000 &#x2F; year example health insurance is ~4.5000EUR or about 6%. You gotta remember in that that the employee and the employer share this 50&#x2F;50, meaning the ~4.500EUR is for the employee only. The employer pays another ~4.500EUR (officially the public health insurance system rate is like 15% and there&#x27;s all sorts of rules about what extra percentage a public health insurance can charge and different companies charge different extra rate to try and &#x27;compete&#x27; with each other.<p>So with all this in mind and percentages already given (and please do look up the German &quot;progressive tax system&quot; as opposed to the tax bracket system in the US and Canada), 70.000 EUR is about 86.000 USD or 4.500 EUR being about 5.500 USD.')
