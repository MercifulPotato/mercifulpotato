I have been stuck with fundamentals for a bit. I try to learn data structures and algorithms, but most of the places they are super long and boring. I haven&#x27;t found efficient ways to learn them, or master them. Language of choice is python, for now. What are some of the ways to master basic data structure and algorithms? How should I approach while learning them? Thanks in advance.')
