I&#x27;m curious what reason MS gave for it, if any.<p>The RIAA was founded in 1952 so it couldn&#x27;t have been a founding member, yet I can&#x27;t find any news or press release with permutations of &quot;Microsoft joins RIAA&quot;. Based on archive.org&#x27;s oldest copy of the RIAA website&#x27;s members page, it was a member since 2016 at least.')
