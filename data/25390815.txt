Item(by='ebg13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607719900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387521, text='&gt; <i>I have a pair of Audio Technica A700s, about $150 new that are now 12 years old; I&#x27;m on my 3rd set of earpads.</i><p>So you buy a new set of earpads on those every 4 years. But we can also compare with the same-market-segment-as-AirPod-Max (wireless+ANC+mic) Bose QC35, where many people have to replace their earpads _every_ _year_⁰ at $35 a pair (or $20 for third party ones that might last longer but definitely feel worse). So the question I think will be how long the pads last on these. Do you have to replace them every year like with the Bose ones or only every 4 years?<p>⁰ - QC35 ear pad extreme comfort but lack of durability is basically a meme among owners now.')
