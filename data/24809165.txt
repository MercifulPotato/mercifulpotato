He spent some time discussing the TSP. TSP solving methods are very interesting, and the techniques used here essentially boil down to setting up an appropriate linear program (albeit with a large number of constraints relative to the number of nodes) and then using duality to obtain accuracy certificates.<p>The research group maintains an excellent webpage with many resources about the TSP [1]. They have also developed an app (Concorde TSP) [2] which provides really good graphical representation of the algorithm. There is an iOS app as well under the same name which has a nice interface.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;concorde&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;concorde&#x2F;index.html</a>')
