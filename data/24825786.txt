Ammonia is made from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, it’s the Hydrogen that’s extracted from natural gas.  However, splitting it from water is again effectively unlimited and not that expensive.<p>Phosphorus is plentiful, current methods give us a 300+ year supply and other options exist.  Potassium is a little more questionable we are likely to need to mine the ocean floors fairly soon which would spike prices, but it could ultimately be a closed loop where we are collecting the runoff.')
