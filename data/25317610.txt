A large amount of new content is still targeting that.  Aside from over-the-air, I suspect that most cable&#x2F;satellite operators are offering that service level, at least without premium fees.<p>Since the end of the digital-TV transition, the TV industry has been throwing a lot of stuff at the wall trying to find something that stuck.  There&#x27;s no clear &quot;it becomes a paperweight&quot; factor to make us all go out and replace newish sets right now.  Remember the 3D TV trend?  Or the year when everyone brought out curved sets, and then went back to flat?  Smart TVs are another variation on that theme, with the added benefit for manufacturers that their lowest-bid tech and changing third-party service requirements will leave you with a set where half the hard-coded service buttons don&#x27;t work and the other half are unusably slow to depress you into buying a new set in three years.<p>I expect the next real ecosystem change will be when ATSC 3.0 becomes a workable thing.  Then you&#x27;ll actually be able to offer 4K&#x2F;HDR with an array of content without the caveat of &quot;external game console&#x2F;PC&#x2F;streaming service required.&quot;  I&#x27;d be a bit hesitant to get a new set until then just out of the risk you ended up with something not fully compliant (I&#x27;m thinking of those first-gen 4K LCDs that wouldn&#x27;t accept a 60Hz input)')
