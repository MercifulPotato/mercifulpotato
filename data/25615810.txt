Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25617178], score=None, time=1609616980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615605, text='&gt; The main characteristic of a conspiracy theory is that it cannot be disproved.<p>Then my government surveilance example fits your definition.  &quot;If there&#x27;s no evidence, then it&#x27;s well hidden.&quot;<p>However, I would also say that in practice your definition leads to fallacy. In general use, what I&#x27;ve noticed is that literal &#x27;theories about a conspiracy&#x27; are labeled as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, and then dismissed because &quot;conspiracy theories can&#x27;t be disproven and are therefore crazytalk.&quot;   (I think there&#x27;s a term for that fallacy, but I can&#x27;t find it.)')
