Maybe its some of my manufacturing background, but I feel like the best engineers are constantly thinking about how they can increase the value of the product relative to customers (internal or external). These are the only things that really seem to matter at the end of the day.<p>Would you consider someone a 10x engineer if they can crank out a super-fancy backend service in 1 weekend that nobody wants to pay for or actually use? I know a lot of developers who occasionally fall into this trap (myself certainly not excluded). They can very enthusiastically produce output at the drop of a hat, but then we frequently have to put this output in the scrap bin and figure out how to recover the wasted time. This is why for most developers we have to have explicit design review sessions to make sure we are staying focused on the important value drivers. I have to make sure our work activities are well-scoped and broken down into small enough pieces to prevent elaborate trips into Alice&#x27;s Wonderland.<p>Note that when I talk about value-add, that also includes paying off technical debt. Determining what debt to pay off is just as important as determining what new features to roll out. Determining how to balance debt vs feature development is one of the most arcane and dark magics. This is where the 10x thrives.')
