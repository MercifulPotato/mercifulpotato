Item(by='dionidium', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610042415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673774, text='&gt; <i>&quot;Slippery slope&quot; is also most commonly a fallacy, which a lot of people seem to ignore.</i><p>I don&#x27;t ignore it. I reject it outright. Politics especially (and human behavior, more generally) operates on slopes. Allowing <i>x</i> quite literally can and does often lead to <i>x + 1</i>. If <i>x + 1</i> is unacceptable, then it&#x27;s perfectly legitimate to oppose <i>x</i> on the grounds that it will produce <i>x + 1</i> (even if we all could agree that <i>x</i> is itself acceptable).<p>The fallacy, such that it exists, is that the truth value of <i>x</i> exists independent of whether it will lead to <i>x + 1</i>. You can&#x27;t disprove something about <i>x</i> by arguing that it will produce <i>x + 1</i>. That&#x27;s all well and good, but it&#x27;s not what anybody&#x27;s talking about when they invoke a slippery slope argument in the context of human systems.')
