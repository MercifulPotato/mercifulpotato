That doesn&#x27;t absolve Roost from any blame here, but I think it does suggest that Westervelt&#x27;s motivation for cutting Roost loose was at least partly informed by a desire to not suffer backlash herself.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with that, per se, but let&#x27;s not pretend that everyone here is doing things solely for the right reasons.')
