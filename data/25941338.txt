These may end up conflicting with each other leaving your terminal in a bad state or you may just get broken output (ever tried piping pv something | ... | less?). One way to regain some control is with something like tmux but this can become unwieldy (and heaven forfend it sees a multibyte Unicode character—terminal emulators don’t really have a way to communicate with applications about how wide a character is going to be when drawn)<p>I think a few things get conflated because there are few text-centric or command-line user interfaces. I put it to you that it is possible to have good composable text-centric user interfaces that don’t rely on pretending to be a VT100 or an ancient single-byte-stream-with-control-sequences protocol.')
