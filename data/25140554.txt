Advice like &quot;apply for anything saying up to five years of experience required&quot;. Combine that with a lot of grads who aren&#x27;t experienced in interviewing can lead to that sort of issue. The biggest thing I&#x27;d look for is side projects. The people doing side projects were generally the one who were keeping up, and actually had an interest.<p>I think Lambda was also a lot more selective towards the beginning (when there were like 12 people in a class) vs now where I think the class size is in the lower three figure range?')
