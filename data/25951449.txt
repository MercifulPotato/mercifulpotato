The Raphael court has always been my favourite single room in the V&amp;A, I always make time for it whenever I visit. The scale of the cartoons is brilliant, you feel very small looking up at a five metre wide tapestry in such a cavernous space. It&#x27;s especially nice on the rare occasions you find yourself alone in that room, which has happened more than one would expect in central London museum.<p>The V&amp;A is really wonderful, I&#x27;ve missed it this year. One of the best kept &quot;secrets&quot; is the top floor, which houses a huge ceramics collection and is a haven in what can be a very busy museum. Often there are only a handful of people up there. There&#x27;s a small lift you can take: pass through the Raphael court, up the stairs, on your left.<p>Hopefully I&#x27;ll find myself there in the not too distant future.')
