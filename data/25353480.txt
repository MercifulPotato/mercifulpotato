Helm makes installing tools and dependencies you may need almost trivial.<p>One of the <i>nice</i> things about Kubernetes is that it is <i>relatively easy</i> to scale from a small deployment to a larger HA deployment when (and if) you need to.<p>&gt; Last year I helped a client who had raised $5 million and then, before they hired me, they&#x27;d wasted $1 million on a &quot;high availability&quot; devops setup that was overbuilt for what they needed.<p>This sounds like more of a management, requirements, and overbuilding problem, rather than a Kubernetes problem. Even without Kubernetes, if they wanted an HA devops set up, they still would have built one. Honestly without Kubernetes it could have ended up <i>more</i> expensive.')
