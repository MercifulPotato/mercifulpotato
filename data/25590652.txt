Came for the Dropbox replacement, stayed for solid apps on android&#x2F;IOS, Notes, 360 image viewer, good sharing, face ID, and extension ecosystem. I back up to Azure Blob, but there&#x27;s nothing quite like having 10TB available on all your devices on a gigabit line at home. Also I really notice the absence of the creeping sense of unease I had when keeping all my everything on Google.<p>Maintenance has been zero, aside from when I want to add functionality.<p>My only feature gripe is that gPhotos has a wonderful &quot;archive photos&quot; feature to delete local copies of media already uploaded. You can still see uploaded photos (thumbnails stay local) and any interaction with them stays &quot;as if local&quot;, there&#x27;s just a delay while it downloads a temporary copy. I wish nextcloud had this capability.')
