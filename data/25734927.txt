They haven&#x27;t, but they could, and it&#x27;s happened frequently enough in other countries.<p>Not only is this scenario 1000x worse for freedom than the <i>very very</i> worst that Amazon could do, it&#x27;s also far more likely at the moment.<p>So my question is, why the F are we even <i>talking</i> about Amazon? Because it&#x27;s just a BS distraction from the elephant in the room.<p>It&#x27;s time to stop engaging with sophistry and fight back the fascists that are trying to take away <i>all</i> our freedoms. And this big fear of big tech is exactly the type of distraction that lets fascism flourish enough to gain a stronghold.')
