Something is not right <i>with them</i>, too. It&#x27;s almost like attacking people is the wrong thing to do, no matter what they do to deserve it!<p>Most of the time what&#x27;s wrong with them is simple. They are being lazy in their thinking, or they are ignorant of the importance of empathy and acknowledging people&#x27;s experiences, and helping them through it, even if we don&#x27;t approve of (or even understand) why they are having that experience. That&#x27;s not an obvious lesson, and its not &quot;written on the tin&quot; of any baby I&#x27;ve seen!<p>(Caveat: A very tricky case is when someone seems congenitally devoid of empathy or self-reflection (e.g. NPD, or generic sociopath). In that case you&#x27;re better off not engaging them emotionally at all, and treat them as a rational actor responding to incentives. A variant, the rational actor who clearly understands the power of emotions, who can learn to simulate them, and has no scruples about doing so--this is the nightmare person because not only are they &quot;manipulative&quot;, their existence makes life harder for the rest of us with real emotions, who sometimes get accused of being them. BTW I&#x27;ve read some really interesting stuff about successful psychopaths who are totally open about their qualities, good and bad, and have decided to integrate with society in a classically healthy way! So even here, there is hope.)')
