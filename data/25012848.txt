But the information being processed is not converted to the electrical domain<p>That&#x27;s a matter of hair-splitting.  More importantly, it hasn&#x27;t been used to make practical gates.<p>&quot;Nonlinear optics&quot; has had plenty of important successes in (electrically controlled) amplification and frequency shifting, and those victories make our lives better every day in the way they&#x27;ve improved fiber optics, especially CWDM.<p>However all-optical switching is still pretty much vaporware.  I think it&#x27;s really disengenuous to lump optical switching in with the broader field of nonlinear optics -- this basically just hides the glaring lack of progress in all-optical switching among the victories in neighboring fields.  So we get a lot of advocacy of the form &quot;hey you should believe all-optical switching will happen some day because this neigboring field that doesn&#x27;t make gates is under the same umbrella as us!&quot;')
