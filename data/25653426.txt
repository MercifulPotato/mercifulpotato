Like they might not even be directly indicative of a problem, but often are, but basically just need to have a human take a look.<p>If you wanted to get all passive aggressive about it - consider calling up your manager and skip manager every single time one of these intrudes on your non-paid time.<p>(This is a really bad idea BTW... It _might_ help if you&#x27;re on friendly terms with them both and they&#x27;re really just oblivious to the problems, but as you&#x27;ve indicated that you&#x27;re already worried about blowback from even mentioning it... You&#x27;ll almost certainly be better off walking. The &quot;extra load&quot; on the rest of the team is totally a management problem, not yours.)<p>The only people getting paged by &quot;err-on-the-side-of-caution type alarms&quot; should be the people who set them up (or the people who asked for them to be set up).')
