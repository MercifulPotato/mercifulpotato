It&#x27;s a linear dependency chain of instruction lengths, an antipattern in the modern parallel processing world. Modern x86 CPUs have to use a large number of tricks and silicon to deal with this decently.<p>While even with Thumb-2, you can at worst just try decoding an instruction at every halfword. At worst you throw away half of the results if they are the second half of an instruction that was already taken care of. If you tried to do the same thing with x86 you&#x27;d throw away many more results, trying to decode (much more complex encodings) at every byte.')
