Item(by='Arnt', descendants=None, kids=[25461834], score=None, time=1608241699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460619, text='I know at least four quite different examples. But they share one trait: They&#x27;re quiet, softspoken, avoid controversy on internet forums. I won&#x27;t name any of them.<p>One uses low pricing, is likable, and provides a fine list of enterprise features. The HN crowd will realise that these features are really different ways of describing a very small amount of code. But if you want to spend your employer&#x27;s money and don&#x27;t care to spoil that by telling your managers too much, the list is fine. Engineers who like the likable make money be spent.<p>One writes per-customer code on top of largely the same body of code, and charges very high prices, largely because they clearly know how to get stuff done using that code. They have the references to prove it, and they wrote the code, and the customers accept that they invoice customers for improvements to the free base too.<p>One uses a technique I don&#x27;t understand at all. It&#x27;s different from the other three, and it works. I mention it to say that the other three aren&#x27;t an exhaustive list.<p>The fourth targets nontechnical customers and sell SaaS, I don&#x27;t know the price level. You can git-clone the code and selfhost if you want, they&#x27;ll be friendly but not helpful. If you make a PR on github they&#x27;ll at least look at it.')
