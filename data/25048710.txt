Laurence Gonzales has a story about declining to fly on a DC-10, which saved his life. But even he admits that that decision wasn&#x27;t rational: you can&#x27;t judge a decision by what you know after the fact. Even at its worst, a flight on a DC-10 was much safer than his morning commute.<p>You&#x27;ll have less luck getting a refund for that decision, but I do appreciate your admitting that the decision is about your feelings, not demonstrable evidence.')
