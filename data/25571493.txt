From the most basic form of just teaching you new vocab to things like seeing into a job you haven&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t do in real life. Games are basically virtual work that&#x27;s been made a bit more safe&#x2F;easy&#x2F;fun. You can grow digital vegetables and walk away knowing a bit more about that process than before playing. A game&#x27;s dialogue and story may present philosophical themes that impact your real life, quite similar to reading a book or watching a movie.<p>The digital resources that don&#x27;t cost you money also allow you to build things and think through things you otherwise couldn&#x27;t. This is Minecraft&#x27;s big appeal. You can&#x27;t necessarily cut down the trees in your real yard, build structures without permits, and so on.<p>Games with online social elements also present similar benefits to hanging out with people. If you&#x27;re fighting monsters with a group, you may talk about all sorts of things in your downtime.')
