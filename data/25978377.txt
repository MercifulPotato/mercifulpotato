The rendering engine needs to be able to fill whatever pixel size at whatever scale. If you mean that you can no longer do 2x and scale down at the exact perfect scale then that&#x27;s true, but only a limitation of that way of rendering. It&#x27;s also broken for whole screen scaling, just less noticeable. Firefox and Chrome don&#x27;t have that issue at all for example, and neither does anything that renders fonts and vectors. At a guess this is probably where all this came from. GTK decided integer scaling was all it was going to support and then everything else was decided as if all clients behaved like that. I doubt even that&#x27;s a problem. The differences in scale from doing 2x and scale down per-app instead of per-screen are miniscule.')
