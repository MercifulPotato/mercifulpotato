I stay away from products that are prime but have chinese names and also i tend to look at the bad reviews rather than the good ones.<p>I recently decided to buy a tensiometer and i avoided about 2 bad ones (even if they were overall at 4.8 or so) because of the latest bad reviews indicating that the quality has been worse in the last few years.<p>Imo most of these things could be avoided with a little bit of care. I am not expecting amazon to be able to do that for me. On the other hand, the amount of chinese crappy products is staggering. Just looked for a subwoofer and i had to apply quite a lot of filtering to only get the decent brands up.')
