Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609199316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560190, text='&gt; <i>and a history feature that lacks full-text search of content</i><p>...and a history feature that&#x27;s nearly unusable. I don&#x27;t even trust it anymore - Chrome&#x27;s history UI feels like it&#x27;s losing information, and there&#x27;ve been plenty of times I&#x27;m 99% I visited a page few days or weeks before, but it&#x27;s nowhere to be found in history. And honestly, I don&#x27;t even need full-text search. I need a table with the following columns: page URL, page title, and access time. I need that table to be sortable by these columns, and filterable by their values.<p>In a way, we&#x27;ve regressed from the days of IE 5, back from the time where browser cache was a folder. Because back then, I could open that folder, sort it by date, and guess the sites I visited from the name of the files - that being a much better UX than what I get in Firefox today.')
