No. Most modern languages do the opposite. Usually everything is defined directly in the standard library and syntax is often merely sugar to call specific functions in that standard library or to refer to specific definitions in that standard library. Primitive numeric types like int, short, long are no longer hard coded directly into the compiler. Instead they are defined in the standard library and the compiler is just employing optimizations where possible to make them behave like primitive types.<p>Although Ceylon is dead I like to use it as an example. Almost everything was defined in the standard library. Even keywords in java like public, abstract, static are merely just annotations in Ceylon that were defined in the standard library.')
