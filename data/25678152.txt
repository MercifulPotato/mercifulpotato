There are some apps with good flashcards, but they tend to be expensive. You certainly <i>can</i> make your own, but that&#x27;s really time consuming. That&#x27;s why we decided to build Deckmill, a repository of high quality, but affordable flashcards.<p>For those are interested in the tech, this is how we did it:\n1. Used a mix of ML + hand curation to select 3000 sentences from tatoeba.org (a massive dataset)\n2. Then machine translation to translate the sentences\n3. Then we had native speakers review the translations\n4. Wavenet to generate audio\n5. genanki to put together the cards')
