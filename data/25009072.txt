Lots of people understood the prospects of the &quot;internet&quot; market. The question is who has access to capital and political protection.<p>Amazon could have been shut down when the dotcom bubble burst like so many other companies. How were they able to maintain funding&#x2F;capital for nearly 20 years without making a profit? Amazon could have been shut down in the 90s if they were forced to collect taxes. How were they able to ward off paying taxes for so long? Why was amazon afford such capital&#x2F;political shelter?<p>It&#x27;s a matter of markets and who gets a share of the markets. Historically, it was people with connections. The right school, right family, right race, right nationality, etc. Now I&#x27;d say who has connections to capital though school, family, race, nationality, etc plays a role.')
