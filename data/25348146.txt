Even things like buying land are typically timed leases owned by the government, and you see behavior like the Jack Ma incident where he made a perceived insult to the central bank and was &quot;punished&quot;. Tied into labor programs and social credit, you see patterns that wouldn&#x27;t ever fly in capitalism.<p>Communism doesn&#x27;t mean everyone gets free groceries and doesn&#x27;t have to work. The CCP, for all of their faults, seriously puts a lot of time and thought into the elements of communism and how the Chinese communism compares and evolves on it as a longterm form of government. Just because someone on the internet mistakes utopianism for communism doesn&#x27;t mean Mao&#x27;s party isn&#x27;t communist.')
