This is useful when preparing an articles or books for publication (when the publisher supports or accepts LaTeX)<p>This is the theory, but almost never been my experience. When I wrote for journals, and for my thesis, it was <i>never</i> the case where I could just use their style files and put in the content and the formatting would work out. Not even close.
