Even I, as a highly distractable&#x2F;sensitive introvert have had trouble coping. And I won&#x27;t lie, the bicycle commute to work was great for waking me up and energizing me.<p>That said, I would prefer 100% WFH for the remainder of my career, no contest. There&#x27;s just no getting around the level of control I have over everything from noise, to light, temperature, etc. It helps that I live alone and have a dedicated separate home office. And I can always go for a run, walk, or bicycle ride in place of the commute.')
