This makes programmers sad, because by nature we love to brute force trial-and error our code, and homey don&#x27;t play that game with machine learning.<p>Uh what? You can literally finetune a Fast.ai model overnight to be borderline SOTA on whatever problem you have data for. 0 Math involved, isn&#x27;t that exactly a hacker&#x27;s wet dream?')
