I can see why, given that the target audience is much wider and, as you point out, often has much tighter time constraints. I can&#x27;t even begin to estimate how many hours I spent as a teenager doing world building for our D&amp;D campaign (which started with 1st Edition Advanced D&amp;D), hours I couldn&#x27;t possibly spend today.')
