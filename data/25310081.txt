I would cite various research on studies investigating &quot;fairness&quot; [0] (Citing this one re: corvids since I need to get back to work and this was a quick google, but it chain-cites papers in primates, dogs, humans, found what appears to be a meta-study here [1] as well)<p>Namely, that individuals will decline to participate in exchanges where they would benefit, if another individual would benefit inequitably.  I think you sell short the systemic advantages by framing it as &quot;Feces-hurling&quot;; namely that it may serve as an important societal and evolutionary pressure, for instance, as [1] suggests improved social cooperation.<p>Some of the comments on this thread even touch on this, although I&#x27;d frame it a bit differently, with comments such as &quot;many people find the existence of a billionaire implicitly unfair.&quot; Namely, judgements of morality, economics, society aside, one has to be rather stoic to feel _no_ envy when comparing ones own lot to the life and resources being a billionaire enables, so that it would trigger a &quot;lizard brain&quot; instinct seems entirely natural.  (and again, similar to you, trying to keep this argument-free WRT the contention around that and making a meta-observation, one may disagree as to how justified or sensitive one should be to this feeling, I&#x27;m just pointing out &quot;I can understand it on a very pragmatic level.&quot;)<p>We may be agreeing loudly here, my response is primarily to addressing your stated surprise, as well as try and paint the cause and effect in a more... detached? perspective, to better contemplate its nature and incentives.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0056885" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4451566&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4451566&#x2F;</a>')
