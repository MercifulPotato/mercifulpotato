Far from it. Why does everyone have to politicize everything? I am arguing for the true nature of reality. Don&#x27;t read into this, I&#x27;m not saying anything about those topics or conspiracy theories. I am simply adding an addendum to the post above mine... that IS all.<p>This isn&#x27;t some philosophical conjecture either. There are many examples of my point in science. For example: Newtons laws of motion.<p>Newtons laws of physics are now to our knowledge ultimately wrong. These laws were once fundamental to science and part of our common sense. We now know that these laws were never actually proven to be true. Subsequent observations have verified that Newton was in fact ultimately wrong and that relativity is ultimately the more accurate theory.<p>Yet relativity has not yet been proven to be true. Nor can we ever prove it to be true. It will always be and shall always be open to disproof. Scientists are fully aware of this that&#x27;s why a good number of theoretical physicists are trying to work out an alternative theory.<p>This is literally what the scientific method is, I&#x27;m not pulling this out my ass. How facts like this applies to a conspiracy is not something I remarked about.<p><i>&quot;No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.&quot; -Albert Einstien</i>')
