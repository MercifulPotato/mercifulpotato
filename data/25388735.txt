For my Dell Precision 5510, I was able to patch[1] a missing device back into the DSDT, as well as &#x27;fix&#x27; some thunderbolt port enumeration race condition. The hackintosh community was helpful in providing ACPI dumps from similar enough Dell systems in the same generation that I was able to paste in the missing device to get very consistent S3 performance. Using `acpiexec` was very helpful to simulate invoking sleep&#x2F;suspend and being able to follow the execution path of where it would get stuck.<p>Also want to add that random wakeups can be triggered by interrupts hitting devices in `&#x2F;proc&#x2F;acpi&#x2F;wakeup`. These wakeup sources can be selectively disabled once the problematic ones are identified. I disable XHC (USB ports), because it seems my routine closes the lid to suspend and _then_ remove peripherals.. which can cause a wakeup!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;mailhost&#x2F;d5b27b247fa26d8bdc8a5d2022347306" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;mailhost&#x2F;d5b27b247fa26d8bdc8a5d20223...</a>')
