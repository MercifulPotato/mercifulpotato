We had to incorporate these ultra low power sensor&#x2F;processor things the professor had his name on and he was a big promoter of. At the beginning of the semester his grad assistant presented her invention from a previous year, which she won awards for and had presented and written about and was part of her PhD work. It was a home health monitoring device and she showed plots of a month of data from sampling herself (pointing out she was the only woman on her project). It was very inspiring and I was very impressed by her. Jump to mid-semester, I randomly have a team of MBA students and me; the three of them were going to do all of the writing and I just had to do all of the engineering by myself (yay). I&#x27;m battling in the lab for hours trying to get the damn thing to read a voltage. I keep putting time of the GA&#x27;s calendar for help, and she keeps blowing me off or passing me in the hall and saying &quot;ummm maybe try this?&quot; or she&#x27;d give me another device to see if the last was defective. In principle, she should have been able to point out whatever I was doing wrong in 15minutes or less, but weeks of this avoidance went on. Eventually, after asking everyone in the department where she was and letting people know I was trying to meet with her and just sitting at her desk at our appointed time for over an hour waiting, she caught me in a hall, conspicuously looked both ways to see that nobody was around, and said &quot;look, the things don&#x27;t work. They&#x27;ve never worked. My device never worked. I made up the plots based on what they theoretically should have been if the product worked. I&#x27;m grading the projects. Just focus about the write-up of the business plan.&quot; So my work was done. And at the end of the semester, nobody&#x27;s product worked, but most people acted like theirs did. Ours obviously didn&#x27;t work, but we made up some shit about it being a mock-up because we didn&#x27;t have the budget for some of the components. ...
