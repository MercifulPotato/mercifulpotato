Or maybe they added a phase shift correction factor to the voltage transformer inputs so the relay thought the generator was in sync when it wasn’t. Either way changing some settings that allow a machine to be destroyed is ... not an achievement. Engineers all over the world put great care in to calculating and identifying the relay settings that will protect the machine instead of allowing it to be damaged. Uploading incorrect settings is like intentionally missing a basket in basket ball, it’s not very impressive.<p>I am sure generators have been connected to the grid out of phase and had their shafts broken before. I have seen a colleague accidentally jumper out the entire sync check circuit and we would have closed the generator breaker had the breaker’s close coil not been burnt out (the reason for the errant troubleshooting).<p>It is concerning that destroying this diesel generator was even necessary. Maybe they needed some good video to get some funding.<p>Now on the other hand if they somehow hacked the relay then that’s a problem. Older relays just had serial ports but new ones have Ethernet and you can send settings by ftp, and things I remember from bbs days like Kermit\nOr zmodem or something. Not ssh yet anyway.<p>So yeah it is easy to do damage, you can shoot insulators or transformers with a gun or you could release a thousand squirrels or snakes and that would cause outages too.<p>One power plant was great it just never seemed to have any electrical problems. Someone went to update the relay settings after it has been operating for years and found out no settings had ever been uploaded to the relay!')
