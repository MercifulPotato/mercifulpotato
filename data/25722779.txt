Spam is the original sin of the open internet and the unwillingness to get to grips with this is a big part of why we can&#x27;t have nice things.<p>Context: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Siegel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Sie...</a><p>On Usenet, which ran on NNTP, every user could maintain their own killfile, which would allow people to hide spam. But it wasn&#x27;t easy to share killfiles, and while the more technically capable people would easily filter it out they were also blinding themselves to a problem that eventually choked the life out of the community. Similar observations could be made about advertising on the web, from standardized banners leading towards today&#x27;s web horrible mess.<p>The basic problem is that the costs of spamming and lying are generally a lot lower than the potential profits, so the more opent he system the more spam it tends to attract. Try looking at used car adverts on Craigslist for example, dealers in busy areas tend to run a hundred ads a day with 500 keywords. Some people flag them, of course, but most don&#x27;t bother and the profit in selling a single car is worth the minor downsides.')
