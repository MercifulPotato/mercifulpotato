Too focused on trees of units and factories that existed originally because of singleplayer campaigns and trickling out upgrades.<p>I mean, the current monster of the genre - SC2 - can trace many of its gameplay mechanics and units back to a game that came out in 1994, which was of course primarily designed for single-player gaming.<p>An RTS basically expects a player to learn multiple games with completely little intersectionality between them - an early-game, a mid-game, and a late-game, wherein you use completely different units and strategies.  Given the fact that the designers have to figure out how to make the &quot;core loop&quot; fun in several completely different gameplay modes, and players have to learn all of them, is it any wonder that RTS isn&#x27;t more popular?<p>I love the RTS genre - the combinations of base-building and unit command and creativity and intensity scratches all the right itches for me.  But every RTS game I play feels like it&#x27;s bogged down in far more complexity than the game really needed.  For a while I had a lot of fun playing with the Cambrian explosion of simple RTS games on mobile because they don&#x27;t feel the need to bolt on so many mechanics - they figure out what their core loop is and stick to it... but the mobile gaming world has been ruined by F2P mechanics.<p>I&#x27;ve been enjoying Zero-K lately, which does reduce some of the RPGishness that I think hurts the genre - no upgrading, no teching, no tech trees... you just plop a factory and you start building units.  But its mechanics are still incredibly complicated, grown organically over a decade of experimenting within the genre of Total Annihilation-style RTS play.  But even then, it&#x27;s still very tied to Total Annihilation, another mid-&#x27;90s RTS game.<p>I&#x27;d love to see more first-class attention to the &quot;core loop&quot; of RTS games, but I&#x27;m worried the only people who are truly experimenting with the genre are the mobile developers, and the economy of mobile gaming is an ugly place.')
