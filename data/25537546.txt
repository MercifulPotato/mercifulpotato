Is there anything better for general discussion than the mailing lists?<p>The problem with forums is that you can&#x27;t really trust them. They&#x27;re generally not archived well, UI is poor, editing of old messages can easily get abused (probably the reasons HN removes your ability to edit old messages shortly after posting).<p>Mailing lists are much less prone to censorship, are better for archival and preservation of knowledge (both for your own local archival, as well as the distributed global archiving of complete archives), interoperable, convenient and easy to use.<p>---<p>I mean, just take a look at GitHub issues.  It&#x27;s a total mess.  Things get locked and deleted.  Links get broken.  Attracts thousands of useless comments on popular issues; never any sort of a summary for how the problem is resolved (if at all), the root cause of any issue, or why it won&#x27;t be fixed.  Any time I get a GitHub Issue as a hit, it&#x27;s usually a total waste of time trying to make sense of it; much more so than the mailing list posts, which often have threading, less spam, and are easier to navigate.  Yes, a special interface is a good thing in theory.  But it&#x27;s been a complete mess in practice.')
