Regardless of country, ICUs are not supposed to be run at capacity as a matter of practice - the staffing level in ICUs is on the order of one to three people per patient and it&#x27;s not a resource that can be scaled up or down quickly.<p>For a large metro area like London, you might have some hospitals at high utilization because they&#x27;re very close to other ICUs and can redirect incoming patients. It&#x27;s not supposed to be at high utilization regionally, otherwise a single minor disaster can cause the system to tailspin.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protect-public.hhs.gov&#x2F;pages&#x2F;hospital-capacity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protect-public.hhs.gov&#x2F;pages&#x2F;hospital-capacity</a>')
