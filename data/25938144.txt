Something like the rate on lottery tickets.<p>I agree with your initial point, but I don&#x27;t believe this would actually help. People who are gambling typically don&#x27;t look at the expected outcome and make &quot;rational&quot; decisions. Therefore, taking action that just modifes the expected outcome is unlikely to have any impact on the behaviour. People will still assume&#x2F;hope that they will win, and if they win <i>just a bit less</i>, then so be it.')
