I sold 2020 models of the Intel Air and ThinkPad L14 (Ryzen 7 Pro) to fund the purchase and have no regrets.<p>- Cross-compiling code written in Go (latest beta is native ARM) takes less than 2 seconds (total) even though in that time it is building all 4 platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac ARM, Mac Intel).<p>- VS Code is more responsive than the Ryzen 7 Pro was (obviously subjective). The Insiders build is native ARM.<p>- DotNet 5 (Core, which is Intel only until .Net 6) builds apps as fast as the Ryzen 7, and running my own C# web sites&#x2F;services is indistinguishable from it.<p>- After decades of coding, 2 of them with C#, I&#x27;m fast. So I flip between VS Code, Terminal, and Brave, at a very rapid pace as I iterate code. Not once have I been slowed down on this 8GB machine.<p>- Node and Python are working great. Node via Homebrew is ARM. Python 3.9.1 was already installed (I&#x27;ve not checked if it is ARM as it is behaving perfectly).<p>- Running `npm install` subjectively feels far faster.<p>- The keyboard is very good (not ThinkPad quality, but still better than most). It&#x27;s using the new type that the 2020 Intel Air got, not the one from the last few years with all the issues.<p>- The keyboard backlight keys are no longer there, so unless you open up the preferences pane you have to rely on the auto-ambient-sensing, but that is working perfectly.<p>- Charges off any decent USB-C charger, not just the Apple one it comes with.<p>- Developing for a full day of combined Go and DotNet Core eats about 40% battery. Probably only that much because Core is under Rosetta. Still runs cold though.<p>- It never heats up, except for when using the non-ARM Go in which case it occasionally hangs and if I don&#x27;t kill Terminal it starts eating 1% every few minutes. Nothing else has misbehaved at all.<p>As an aside, and I know you were only asking about dev work but it may help provide context to others, running DiRT 4 (rallying) on it for an hour only used about 4% of battery life, operating at high res high quality with no lag, and the Air never even got warm. The amazing thing about that is that this was running under Rosetta.<p>So this was emulating Intel. Running a game better than the Intel Air 2020 did, whilst under emulation, on the cheapest M1, silent, cold, using only 4% battery for an hour. Almost unbelievable.<p>EDIT:\nIt also plays Monument Valley (iPad or iOS version, not sure which) perfectly, in full screen with mouse support. Bonus.')
