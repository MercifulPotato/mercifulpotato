I feel it&#x27;s very dry and academic.<p>Instead I&#x27;d recommend Tim Roughgarden&#x27;s series of books Algorithms Illuminated for learning about analysis and algorithms. He also has courses on Coursera and Edx to cover the material. It&#x27;s thorough rigorous and shows algorithms that apply to different paradigms - lke divide and conquer, graph theory.<p>Sedgewick and Wayne&#x27;s Algorithms has a companion website with lots of additional material (heavily Java based) - and courses on Coursera too. Again I think it&#x27;s more approachable than CLRS while still being detailed and covering the theory.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;introduction-algorithms-third-edition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;introduction-algorithms-third...</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timroughgarden.org&#x2F;books.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timroughgarden.org&#x2F;books.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;algs4.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;algs4.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;</a>')
