In Mexico every time they locked him up he&#x27;d got out again. Seems a similar problem in the story - you find the killers and they just break out of jail and come for you. Maybe the US could expand its prison for Mexicans service? If they imprisoned fewer Americans there&#x27;d be loads of room.')
