Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=[25659849], score=None, time=1609947604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657556, text='We do use JupyterLab for the notebook experience on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>. I had a chat with one of the core members of the project using real-time-collaboration when they were trying iko.ai. We chatted on the notebook itself.<p>What I explained was that in our experience of many years doing paid machine learning projects for large enterprise, we never thought to ourselves: &quot;Darn, if only Jupyter[Lab] had better stylesheets, this project would go so much faster.&quot; It has never happened. When we started building our platform, we were not in the position of front-end devs trying to make a better notebook, we were in the position of a company with deliverables for yesterday, and we naturally started solving for actual problems doing machine learning for real clients, as opposed to finding windmills to fight.<p>In our experience, projects are slow not for lack of better stylesheets or animations. Therefore, we ignored that and focused on removing frustrations we had in the real world: long-running notebook scheduling, automatic experiment tracking for parameters, metrics, models, and code. Model deployment and monitoring. Real-time editing.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t really follow news about &quot;jupyter-killers&quot;. I kept an eye out of curiosity, but every time one pops out, they solved things that don&#x27;t matter much, or claimed they solved hidden state until you read the article and found they&#x27;re caching results or something like that.')
