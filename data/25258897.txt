Using LPDDR means it&#x27;s definitely not HBM.<p>But you can definitely hit LPDDR4 at 4266 MT&#x2F;s speeds with drop-in RAM. That&#x27;s DDR5, which in the &quot;initial&quot; spec goes all the way to 6400 MT&#x2F;s. More relevantly, DDR5-4800 (so 4800 MT&#x2F;s) modules are among the first to actually be manufactured: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16142&#x2F;ddr5-is-coming-first-64gb-ddr5-4800-modules-from-sk-hynix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16142&#x2F;ddr5-is-coming-first-64...</a>')
