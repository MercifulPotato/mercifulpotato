Item(by='qiqitori', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602863136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801157, text='&gt; I salvaged some 13‚Äù LCD displays from old laptops and found additional matching displays on ebay.<p>The LCDs were taken from old disused equipment.<p>&gt; I happened to have an Nvidia Jetson Nano<p>And the board was disused equipment too, it seems.<p>I find this kind of reuse very inspiring. Once I no longer need my old laptops, I feel like it might be fun to do something similar instead of shipping the whole thing to a recycling plant. You could even use LCDs that have dead pixels or other defects.<p>You could argue that requiring a 35 W LED lamp is wasteful, or the power used by the SoC (10 W max), etc., but together that&#x27;s still about as much as a standard incandescent lamp.')
