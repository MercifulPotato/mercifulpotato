But fundamentally, intellectual property is a form of property that includes <i>intangible</i> things. How can intangible things be owned? Intangible things aren&#x27;t scarce.<p>&gt; Software isn&#x27;t an idea. It required real work of a scarce-ish resource (software dev time) to create that software. You could make the argument that software, unlike a physical good, can be copied at almost no cost after creation<p>It&#x27;s not about the work required to create it or even the work required to copy it. The point is that it&#x27;s not scarce. That is, I can use a copy of the software without inhibiting your simultaneous use of it. This is a fundamental difference from a physical good. My use of a physical good inherently inhibits your use. This creates conflict and property is a vehicle for resolving that conflict peacefully.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d like to put forward the argument that software _patents_ are the IP that most closely resembles the IP the author seems to hate<p>I undoubtedly hate software patents. But I probably hate patents in the healthcare industry even more, because I perceive them as probably causing even more harm than software patents.<p>My article is just biased towards issues in software because that&#x27;s what I have the most experience with.')
