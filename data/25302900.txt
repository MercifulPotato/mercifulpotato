Now it&#x27;s 70k and they&#x27;re asking people what should be done with the space? Interesting idea.<p>I assume most of the streets in Paris were built before cars were a big thing, what was that space used for way back then? Sounds like a silly question, but, did people park horses in the same spaces used for cars now? (I assume you didn&#x27;t &quot;park&quot; your horse, but it seems like more or less the same concept?)')
