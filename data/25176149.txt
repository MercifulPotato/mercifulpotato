I can kinda understand other string instruments where there&#x27;s a lot of technique and nuance involved in plucking the strings, but the whole point of a piano mechanism seems to be the elimination of such nuance. As far as I can tell, playing the piano is a repetitive and mechanical task where you&#x27;re basically acting as a human MIDI controller. I do not understand why anyone would find joy in playing such a dull instrument.')
