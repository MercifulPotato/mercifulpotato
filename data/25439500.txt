I&#x27;m learning Mandarin and find that it feels much closer to a computer language than English or Latin based. Though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d say learning Mandarin (or any language) is anywhere near what it&#x27;s been like learning computer languages. I find mathematical language different from both as well. They do feel like 3 different parts of my brain. Though math I&#x27;m highly visual (not this way in programming or English, but visual in Mandarin).')
