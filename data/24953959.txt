One is a diagnosable narcissist who says he “grabs women by the pussy” and was friends with Jeffrey Epstein. The other is in lots of videos acting apparently creepy and his son is at the very least a total mess. The first of these can barely talk in complete sentences and tweets in all caps. The second can talk, but is not particularly articulate compared to a member of a High School debate club.<p>These two men are candidates for President of the United States.<p>Something is very very wrong.
