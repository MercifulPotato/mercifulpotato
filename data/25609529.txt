I find myself having a Patrick Bateman-esque moment of business-card envy, but for URLs. That domain is just so...good. <i>.com</i> too often implies a business, <i>.org</i> a non-profit, etc but <i>.website</i> is just saying it is a website, not necessarily for anyone or anything (although presumably created by someone). Sadly someone is squatting josh.website or I would own it right now.')
