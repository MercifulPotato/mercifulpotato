There are kids bicycling and playing outside, lots of families with dogs, all enabled because the roads are smaller and we&#x27;re still a walking distance from food, hardware store, etc.<p>Do not confuse the singe-zoned, panopticon-esque tracts of land with nothing around but houses with small yards and not a single shred of grocery stores, points of interest or wildlife-allocated land for dozens of square miles (necessitating car travel) [1] with &quot;living in cities.&quot; Additionally, crime goes down not just with a fewer number of people, but also with people taking ownership over their community – as you&#x27;ll see in loved neighborhoods of bigger cities like New York – rather than barricading themselves inside their house and watching with suspicion any person that walks past their shuttered blinds, because in places so hostile to travel on foot, no one in their right mind walks.<p>In an era of continuously increasing human footprint on the planet, we should not be talking about the (environmentally and fiscally) expensive expansion of humans to the corners of the planet that remain &quot;rural&quot; and a respite for our Earth&#x27;s natural resources.
