Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=[25283234], score=None, time=1606946142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25281956, text='&quot;A gate is core with one arm named $.&quot;<p>&quot;A core is a cell of a battery and a payload.&quot;<p>&quot;A battery is a collection of Hoon expressions and the head of a core.&quot;<p>This is what GP is talking about. Reading through the tutorial, it made some sense. I could probably code in this language with a bit more reading and practice. But the choice of deliberately obfuscating terminology makes it read like a joke or an esoteric language (languages not meant for real use but as puzzles, challenges, maybe for code golfing).<p>I mean, half the time they explain these things with analogies. A gate is a function, they say it nearly every time the term comes up. So why call it a gate?<p>EDIT:<p>When I was at GA Tech (now many years ago) we had access to a set of servers, &quot;acme&quot; (acmex, acmey, and acmez if I recall correctly). Each semester we had a limited amount of access to computational resources on these servers, measured in &quot;bananas&quot;. We had plenty to do things like access mail, newsgroups, maybe do basic programming assignments. But anything resource intensive or really long running ate up your bananas and you&#x27;d have to request more (no cost, it was a limit to keep people from abusing shared resources).<p>This was absolutely fine, and a bit humorous. &quot;I can&#x27;t run that, I don&#x27;t have enough bananas.&quot; But if I were rolling out a product to universities across the country to manage access to their systems I would not use &quot;bananas&quot; as a term. Within the GT community it had a shared meaning, but outside it made us sound like asylum escapees (perhaps an accurate description of us). &quot;bananas&quot; communicates nothing to users on its own, just like &quot;gate&quot; and &quot;battery&quot; communicate nothing to anyone familiar with other programming languages.')
