I could easily afford a house in any other part of the country.]<p>Was this intentional? This is amusing, interesting. I hope you figure it out!<p>You are scratching the surface on the idea that comparing yourself to your musician friends with less marketable skills doesn&#x27;t help you really continue optimizing your own life.<p>Your aspirations are not different than the current crop of transient developers in the bay area (ie. getting tf out of SF before it becomes Detroit West). The only difference from what I can tell is that &quot;career&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing. Big Tech is paying enough for people to do 2-4 year stints and be done with that part of their life. Career and retirement becoming concepts that people aren&#x27;t really banking on at all, but lump sum and leaving definitely being an opportunity people are really looking for.')
