So you let your thoughts move on.<p>If they come back with another hurtfully worded criticism, you look directly into their eyes, raise your eyebrows a little, and say:<p>[2]  I&#x27;m sorry, I didn&#x27;t actually hear all of that.  Could you please repeat that slowly for me?<p>They have to think about what they have said.  90% of the time, they will retract it and apologise, saying they misspoke.<p>If they persist with criticism, you say, quizically:<p>[3]  Oh... are you trying to hurt my feelings?<p>Often they will modify what they say to clear up the misunderstanding, by explaining that they are only trying to help you. Or whatever.<p>Rarely, someone will go on the attack, by saying Yes, and repeating the insult.  If that happens, you say<p>[4]  Well that&#x27;s not going to work because I&#x27;m not going to let that in.<p>And you don&#x27;t let it in.  You recognise that you are in an exchange with someone who has these exchanges with other people often because that is who they are, but it has nothing to do with who you are.<p>If they persist, you say, in a measured, almost academic voice:<p>[5]  Did you know that critical people have the most criticism reserved for themselves?  They don&#x27;t like themselves.  They are expressing outwards their own dissatisfaction.  When you do this you are showing me, and everyone else in the office, that you are your own worst critic.')
