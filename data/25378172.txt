A particular usage making sense or being reasonable isn&#x27;t the same thing as that usage being part of a language.<p>If non-homophobic circles of Russian-speakers actually use &quot;они&quot; as a gender-neutral singular third-person pronoun, that&#x27;s news to me. I wouldn&#x27;t be terribly surprised to find out that&#x27;s true. If it is, I would expect that to be a recent development, as in the last decade or so.<p>But it sounds like you&#x27;re basing what you&#x27;re saying on just mapping the English usage to Russian, or basing it on ground principles about what makes sense or doesn&#x27;t, which is pretty unconvincing. Are you aware of examples of &quot;они&quot; being used this way in the wild by native speakers?<p>Anyway, whether it expresses politeness is a whole other can of worms, and I <i>would</i> be quite surprised to find out that on top of that in these circles &quot;они&quot; is used to express politeness in place of &quot;он&quot; or &quot;она&quot; (or I guess &quot;оно&quot;) the way that &quot;вы&quot; is used to express politeness in place of &quot;ты&quot;.')
