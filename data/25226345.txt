But, most importantly, it can be locked&#x2F;unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.<p>This is the line I am not willing to cross.<p>Do I believe that the security of Home Assistant and the plugins that surface this to web&#x2F;mobile interfaces is such that I&#x27;d risk the physical security of my home and possessions to it?<p>I love the Pi doorbell project, and could eventually be onboard with a home security company producing a smart lock I would consider... but enabling a lock via Home Assistant to grant access to the house, disable alarms, etc (assuming HA scripts like &quot;when the door is unlocked disable alarm to prevent false positive&quot;, etc)... I suspect my insurance company would consider this an act of me leaving the door open and granting access to people who later stole stuff and that they wouldn&#x27;t pay out.')
