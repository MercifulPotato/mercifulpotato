Item(by='cma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611257643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862078, text='&gt; &quot;Let me pay to not see ads&quot;. But it doesn&#x27;t work that way. The value of ads is quantified in aggregate, not on a per-customer basis.<p>The bigger issue is the people that would pay to remove ads have more expensive habits and are worth much more in ads than the average user (though maybe that is somewhat counteracted by being more savvy against scams delivered through ads).')
