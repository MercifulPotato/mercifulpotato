One possible step is to go to your boss and say &quot;I think I&#x27;m ready for a bigger role.  What do you have that you could give me?&quot;  Many bosses do not have a problem with employees wanting to do more.<p>Note, though, that you need to be very careful to clarify that you want <i>harder</i> work, not just <i>more</i> work.  The goal is not to start working 12-hour days; the goal is work that challenges you enough that you&#x27;re not bored.')
