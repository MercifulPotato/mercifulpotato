For eg. Unreal Engine is &quot;open-source&quot; but under strict license. Defold engine is also &quot;open-source&quot; but has a Apache-modified custom licence preventing the commercialization of editor derived work (so no commercial custom editor), etc.<p>There are many degree of openness and Godot goes full MIT so Godot is truely yours (both the editor and the engine)')
