I failed to heed my own warning about the complexity of trying to reverse engineer these numbers.<p>I believe I was thinking - if not typing - that it was anywhere from 10-25% of the average person&#x27;s income tax burden.<p>I found figures similar to the ones you did - around 14% of federal expenditure.   There&#x27;s local, as well as state, health costs, and those are funded via disbursements originating from federal budgets, but not tracked in detail in same.  There&#x27;s also aged care, which will come under this, much of which is semi-funded through ersatz religious groups that have their own tax avoidance schemes in place, and other complexities.<p>But the ~14% figure seems about right -- and reminds me that I also forgot to tie that back to OP&#x27;s figures, which, prima facie, aren&#x27;t <i>too</i> horrendous in light of that figure.<p>However, <i>that</i> assumes those insurance payments cover all (or the vast bulk of) costs for health care ... which they clearly do not within the USA health system &lt;sic&gt;.  Copayments and exclusions appear, from what little I&#x27;ve heard, to be a significant cause for concern even for people with &#x27;good&#x27; insurance coverage.')
