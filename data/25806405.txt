Item(by='astrostl', descendants=None, kids=[25807405], score=None, time=1610838562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799992, text='&gt; People don&#x27;t eat a low carb diet by accident, when they do they often follow the horrible advice given by the many misguided keto diet proponents: eat low carb, high fat, medium protein.<p>This is not <i>remotely</i> my anecdotal experience. The overwhelming majority of those I know that I have dabbled with low carb ran the bunless burger, chicken wings, bacon, and steak game and I would guess that their macro intake was high protein, medium fat (if that), low carb. The textbook versions are high fat, medium protein, low carb. And seemingly pretty hard to pull off without eating a lot of stuff like salads with a cup of olive oil.')
