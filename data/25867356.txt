Some communities adjacent to SSC (and some near HN) have helped me find some amazingly smart and cool people, and I&#x27;m very thankful that they exist (and that Scott can continue blogging as well), and if anything I hope we can encourage significantly <i>more</i> niche community building on the Internet, and with many more modalities than blogs, forums, and comments (which SSC indeed has).<p>His notes about people being afraid to express themselves, have open discussions, be honest, and share with one another are pretty saddening however, and I hope that we can progress towards a better area here, even if progress sometimes seems slow or impossible.')
