I&#x27;ve had some PR&#x27;s that put copious amounts of time in to make them as complete and perfect as I could for the reviewer. Only to get them turned down for style reasons.<p>If style is that important, make sure you document the rules or automate it (3. Automate the easy stuff). So contributors have a chance at figuring this out for themselves, without having to go back and forth. If the style comes down to personal preference you can apply rule 12. Award all ties to your reviewer, in reverse too.<p>Nothing takes my motivation for contributing away as a reviewer that just must find something to complain about the code.')
