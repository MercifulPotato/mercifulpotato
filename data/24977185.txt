This means you can divvy up your income so it’s taxed at each family member’s marginal rate (rather than your own top-line consolidated rate).<p>That might sound reasonable, until you realize that those family members never see that money. The “distribution” is a complete fiction.<p>I’m usually fairly conservative when it comes to taxes, but I’m astonished this is allowed to continue.')
