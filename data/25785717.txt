I lament not knowing most of the stories and people shown in the films. It&#x27;s gotten me thinking about the best way to preserve details of my life for future generations--like what I think my great great great grand kids might be interested in knowing about me if they were doing genealogy research. They probably won&#x27;t care to dig through a hundred photos of each vacation I&#x27;ve ever been on but would like to know some of the highlights.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet built anything, and it might not even be a solvable business problem. Hopefully though I&#x27;ll at least figure out good ways to organize data I want to pass on to my children.')
