There are still some rough edges, but it&#x27;s understandable given the scope of this project. I&#x27;d love to see more focus on TypeScript, integration with something like esbuild or Snowpack or maybe even a Deno version (there&#x27;s already Aleph.js). What may not be obvious at first glance is their dedication to solve those little, often difficult problems on the web. I like their next&#x2F;image component. I was surprised to see AMP support. Their approach for blending frontend with backend is not only interesting, but practical. The future will be interesting for sure.<p>Contrary to other commenters, I find Next.js docs pretty good. You can see there was a lot of effort put into writing their tutorial. Rough edges are mostly related to everything that supplements the framework, i.e. 3rd party libraries. I think eventually they will be expanding to cover these various scenarios.<p>Also, I&#x27;m working on a 12-week video course about React.js &#x2F; Next.js. When I noticed this announcement on HN, I figured it could be a good way to promote it. ;) It&#x27;s not yet ready (early WIP). I plan to finalize details next week.
