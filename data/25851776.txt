And whatever we didn’t grow ourselves we helped relatives or neighbors with and shared in harvest.<p>I personally don’t understand the appeal of going back to that. I’m so glad I can just buy whatever I want at the grocery store these days and don’t need to spend all my free time on harvesting calories.')
