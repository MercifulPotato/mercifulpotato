In contrast, in Lambda&#x27;s slack, every criticism is automatically taken to private PM, to get it out of the way as soon as possible and to immediately shutdown any ensuing conversation. (A few times, when that didn&#x27;t work, they turned off comments altogether.)<p>Lambda&#x27;s strategy is to PRETEND to be responsive to feedback, to say a lot of pretty words and act concerned, while actually ignoring all of it.<p>For example, they created a student survey to see how students felt about removing the majority of paid teachers (team leads) and forcing us to be mentors instead.\nOne of the first questions?<p>&quot;Do you agree that leadership is an important part of being a successful programmer?&quot; (approximately)<p>The rest of the survey was the same. They weren&#x27;t interested in getting feedback. They were interested in pretending to listen to feedback.<p>Austen is minimizing student frustration in this comment, acting like people are grumbling about minor changes.\nHe&#x27;s ignoring the many many people who have written out long, articulate, arguments about how the changes damaged their education and removed the value of Lambda for them.<p>He also acts like he didn&#x27;t delete every post in the Lambda subreddit that offered criticism over the last three months, without any response.<p>False honesty in threads like this is how Lambda gets away with being dishonest.')
