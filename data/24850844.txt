Pretty nice - it can crawl your routers, build up your existing network allocations then help you analyze&#x2F;optimize them.<p>Stupid powerful - we used it mostly for decentralized DNS management (!!) but after a while I finally got the network and security folks to realize what the system could do and the spreadsheets started to finally go away.<p>Speaking of decentralized management it has robust hierarchical role-based security - we had thousands of site admins managing DNS and eventually IP addresses for their individual sites, but also smoothly maintaining overall command-control.  A very cool system.')
