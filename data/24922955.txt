As everyone was a bit dumbfounded by the self-confidency, and also because the whole team was busy doing greenfield groundwork, glad to have someone who takes care of him&#x2F;herself, producing code that appeared to work, we let him&#x2F;her do without interfering much. When there was interference, the reviewer was left with the impression that she&#x2F;he just didn&#x27;t understand the marvels of the code she&#x2F;he just reviewed.\nAfterwards, legitimations included &quot;unit tests are non-clean, they require too much mocking&#x2F;stubbing&quot;, this is an &quot;edge-edge-edge case&quot; and so on (architectural and design deficiencies are routinely defended by statements like this, and in this case, spot on).<p>Since she&#x2F;he was dubbed a star developer for a while (which is quite astounding, since we have quite a high bar for hiring), she&#x2F;he could get away with that. From a certain perspective she&#x2F;he was successful: we launched our project in time, with few bugs, with quite an amazing feature set. Most of the credits go to the not-so-visible, but diligent other team members, but from a management perspective it was quite a success.<p>After rewriting ~30% of her&#x2F;his code, with the prospect of ~70% remaining, the person is not working on the project anymore. But she&#x2F;he is complaining all the time about how much legacy code he&#x2F;she has to maintain in the new role, and how serious her&#x2F;his (from her&#x2F;his perspective non-voluntary removal from the project despite his&#x2F;her indispensability) abilities must be missing from the project team.<p>Extreme case, I know. But it&#x27;s just the most extreme one I saw in my dev career :)<p>Edit: s&#x2F;he -&gt; she&#x2F;he')
