It served as a decent example, and something with which I expected a lot of people being familiar.  Like the British guerilla propaganda posters against the Germans during the First World War.<p>Neither, however, is an attempt to excuse what either the Japanese nor the Germans did in either war.  I am very familiar with the events you describe, but please don&#x27;t read anything broader into my example than merely that; an example of making your enemies cartoonish.')
