Thunderbolt isn&#x27;t a &quot;lossy&quot; channel; the real concern is ultimately what bandwidths you need.  The most difficult factor in this is determining whether your storage is write-heavy, read-heavy or both. (If it&#x27;s a SSD, that is - HDDs don&#x27;t even get remotely near TB bandwidths.)<p>The general rules are:<p><pre><code>  - Displays: output bandwidth, and quite a lot of that\n  - eGFX: mostly output (textures) + a reasonable amount of input\n  - 10G&#x2F;40G NICs: generally input bandwidth, somewhat use case dependent\n  - Storage: no general rule, strongly use case dependent\n</code></pre>\nAlso, the PCIe TB&lt;&gt;CPU connection needs to be considered, particularly in some older laptops it&#x27;s only a PCIe 3.0Ã—2 link, which caps out at 16GT&#x2F;s.<p>If anything, it&#x27;d be nice to get good per-device bandwidth counters somewhere; not sure if the PCIe bridges can provide that data somehow (through QoS&#x2F;AER features maybe?)')
