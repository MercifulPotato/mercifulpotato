And of course, I have never added Ukrainian language in my Chrome settings. And yet it &quot;guessed&quot; that I speak Ukrainian. The key bit here is that browsers may modify the list of languages even after you go to the settings and remove all languages except for English (for the record, Chrome also &quot;forgets&quot; that I told it never to translate Ukrainian after I remove Ukrainian from the Accept-Language settings, which is annoying).<p>So, I guess you are a native English speaker and simply never had any exposure to this &quot;customer journey&quot;. I hope my explanation gives you a glimpse into why an experienced software engineer may be still surprised to see a website detect a language they are not using in the system.')
