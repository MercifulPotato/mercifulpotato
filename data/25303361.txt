Make sure you have solid internet, switch off your video if audio is breaking up. \n2. Invest in a cheap mic (e.g. $20 lavalier) so you can be heard clearly and headphones so you can hear clearly w&#x2F; no echo. \n3. You can’t read the room &#x2F; body language as well so make sure you pause occasionally and ensure you’re answering the question sufficiently. \n4. Like any interview, undertake a calming exercise beforehand (deep breathing etc)')
