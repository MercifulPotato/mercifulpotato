If the server isn&#x27;t there, the code failed gracefully (and immediately).  I&#x27;m sure that race condition has been patched and any similar code now has several new test to their QA suite.  Live and learn.<p>These checks are also anonymized and are also covered in their privacy policy.  As a publicly traded company, making false statements in such a policy would have severe financial implications so anyone implying Apple are lying better have some damn good evidence to back it up.<p>Since these checks are useful in weeding out malicious software once the server was back up I removed the Apple server from my hosts file to let them resume.  If you think Apple is full of crap from a privacy standpoint you can continue to block the certificate server involved in the checks and your Mac still runs just fine.<p>Which is my core problem with crap &quot;articles&quot; like this.  I really like the FSF, but sensationalistic pieces like this DO NOT help their messaging - especially when they are factually inaccurate :(  NOTHING was locked down; it was a security check that failed ungracefully but could be easily bypassed to enable the machine to function normally.  If it was &quot;locked down&quot; there would have been no bypass.')
