For me this is public and collective pump and dump scheme.<p>The narrative of going against current financial establishment is the same one that motivated criminals and drug sellers to embrace Bitcoin because they thought it was meant to be anonymous and anarchist but in reality it was meant to be everything opposite; to establish decentralized trust, transparency, enable micro transactions and to eradicate fraud and financial mischief.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;public-statement&#x2F;joint-statement-ongoing-market-volatility-2021-01-27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;public-statement&#x2F;joint-statement-on...</a>')
