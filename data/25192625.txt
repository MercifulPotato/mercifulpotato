I agree that heroku is an amazing service, a really impressive product.<p>But once you are using a single performance dyno, you are unlikely looking at a bill that&#x27;s only &quot;couple hundred dollars a month&quot;.<p>Thanks for confirming you use performance dynos for user-facing stuff -- I thought I was going insane discovering that it didn&#x27;t look like standard dynos were suitable for that for me -- is &quot;everyone else&quot; using them though? The heroku docs imply they are indeed... standard (that&#x27;s the name), and the performance dynos are for unusual performance needs.<p>Which is not what it was looking like to me.<p>Based on my current investigations, I agree being prepared to spend $1000&#x2F;month is a better back of the napkin to-start-with estimate.<p>Which, sure, is quite possibly still a value compared to the number of hours you&#x27;d be spending setting up and maintaning something else. Quite possibly! But it&#x27;s not &quot;a couple hundred dollars a month&quot;.')
