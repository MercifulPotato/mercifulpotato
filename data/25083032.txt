Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25089030], score=None, time=1605280204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079049, text='&gt; We have laws against violence, and we have a justice system and law enforcement to enforce the laws.<p>We do. That doesn&#x27;t conflict with platforms having standards that prohibit advocacy of violence.<p>&gt; If they believe there is a credible threat, they should investigate, that is their purpose.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a threat, it was advocacy &#x2F;incitement, which is a different thing.<p>&gt; We can hold them accountable via voting and their actions should ideally be transparent to the public.<p>Their actions, by law, are <i>not</i> transparent to the public, and instead are subject to among the broadest exceptions of any  public agencies (beyond defense&#x2F;intelligence) to transparency laws. Not that your fantasies about law enforcement transparency, even if true, have any relevance to Bannon&#x27;s incitement.<p>&gt; If Bannon is part of a real, literal plot to place Fauci&#x27;s head on a pike at the White House, that is the avenue through which it should be prosecuted.<p>A plot&#x2F;conspiracy is a third thing, different from both a threat and incitement.<p>And no one is talking about prosecution.<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t a public utility that is somehow obligated to relay and promote all speech equally without filtering with the only controls being after-the-fact actions by law enforcement. You are free to create a service with those terms of use and try to compete with Facebook, if you wish, but that&#x27;s not what Facebook users have signed up for. And, while I&#x27;ve certainly seen examples of Facebook being overzealous in enforcing their “Community Standards”, this particular case doesn&#x27;t come close to that.')
