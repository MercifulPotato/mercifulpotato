The twist is that I&#x27;m the robot.<p>For the past 2 years, I&#x27;ve been collecting all of the data I could about myself. My system connects to about 50 different data sources, trackers, and environmental sensors. Think of it as 100% automated activity tracking.<p>Now that I have the data, I&#x27;m working on goal setting. It&#x27;s both about implicit goals (physiological goals, local laws, contracts) and explicit goals (&quot;I want to lose 20 pounds&quot;). Future visualization&#x2F;projection + direct manipulation seems like good formal approach to goal setting. Natural language also seems promising, and could be integrated to smart speakers and journaling apps to ease adoption.<p>The following challenge will be to automatically break down goals into a series of steps. I suspect that Control Theory will be useful, but I haven&#x27;t seriously researched the subject yet. It&#x27;s my biggest unknown.<p>Lastly, the system will need to give me instructions. I&#x27;ve been giving myself instructions for the past year using time blocking and Google Calendar. It&#x27;s extremely powerful. My calendar will ontinue to be my main source of instructions, except that the system will populate it automatically. Eventually, AR, environmental cues (changing scene, glowing LEDs, subtle chimes), and wearables will become more ergonomic and seamless sources of instructions. I am already experimenting with the PineTime.<p>By the end of the decade, you&#x27;ll be able to program yourself.')
