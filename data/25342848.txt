Nothing is ever done in isolation in the human body, everything is always interconnected and you cannot predict how this will affect the body many years down the line. Don&#x27;t be suprised if young people will then also start having severe issues all of the sudden that were once reserved only for the crtiticaly ill and very old.]')
