Eventually you reach a point where you also model peer animal entities (&quot;if food falls because fingers relax, that guy will take it&quot;) and from there it&#x27;s only a very small steps to also model a &quot;self&quot; to go with all those &quot;others&quot;. That&#x27;s basic consciousness. At this point you are only a few linguistic principles away from diving into philosophy.')
