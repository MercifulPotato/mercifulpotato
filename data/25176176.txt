Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606037722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175957, text='&gt; I was not referring to the popular vote, by the current vote count Biden wins enough electoral votes to be the next president.<p>Those vote counts are provisional until certified and some are in the process of being challenged based on evidence of fraud. Illegal ballots negate legal votes and so for election integrity it is very important that the government be seen to take matters of election integrity seriously and prevent the addition of illegal ballots from distorting the results.<p>&gt; Curious, conceding also has no constitutional bearing on who the next president is.<p>Concession means that the person with standing to contest the provisional results has accepted them. Therefore the lack of a possibility of meaningful challenge allows the presumptive victor to move forward. In this case that has not happened so there is no reason to jump to conclusions and allow a person who may not have won to begin transitioning to duties he will not carry out.<p>&gt; But, that&#x27;s sufficient to you, as opposed to all of the votes having being counted and it being clear who the winner is.<p>My opinion is not at issue here. I&#x27;m merely explaining the relevant factors that result in the differences from 2016 to 2020 that you were concerned about.<p>&gt; Where is this evidence and why has it not shown up in any of these court cases.<p>You have not seen the sworn affidavits? Below are links so you can inform yourself. How unfortunate that our famously free press has not informed the public of this :(<p>&gt; despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens.<p>I believe the contention of the trump campaign is that those votes were not cast by citizens, or if they were, they were illegally cast. That would mean the negative impact on the citizens would be felt by allowing these votes to be counted.<p>At least we are confident that the Trump administration did a better job preventing the Russians from interfering than did President Obama who famously scolded Mitt Romney for considering the Russians to be a threat to our democracy.<p>&gt; It is not bias to say there&#x27;s no evidence, when time and time again, it&#x27;s shown in court, that there&#x27;s no evidence.<p>You don&#x27;t think sworn witness statements count as evidence? You don&#x27;t think that people risking perjury to testify about violations of election law that they personally witnessed are evidence? Or are you relying on the press to inform you of evidence and taking their statements that there is no evidence at face value? Or are you attempting to verify their statements, but having trouble locating the sworn affidavits because everything that comes up on a search engine when you use terms &quot;trump lawsuit affidavit&quot; is blogspam falsely claiming there is no evidence?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18618673&#x2F;31&#x2F;8&#x2F;donald-j-trump-for-president-inc-v-boockvar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18618673&#x2F;31&#x2F;8&#x2F;donald-j-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18618673&#x2F;31&#x2F;10&#x2F;donald-j-trump-for-president-inc-v-boockvar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18618673&#x2F;31&#x2F;10&#x2F;donald-j...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18618673&#x2F;31&#x2F;9&#x2F;donald-j-trump-for-president-inc-v-boockvar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18618673&#x2F;31&#x2F;9&#x2F;donald-j-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;4f5gvx6oh9zskvf&#x2F;2020-11-17%20TRO%20Motion%20with%20Exhibits.PDF?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;4f5gvx6oh9zskvf&#x2F;2020-11-17%20TRO%2...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gellerreport.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;gov.uscourts.gand_.283580.6.19.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gellerreport.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;gov.usco...</a>')
