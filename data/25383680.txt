Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25389069], score=None, time=1607676202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383612, text='&gt;&gt;Right now, there are relatively few people in the world who would be confronted with that dilemma -- precisely because iPhones don&#x27;t make this easy. Do you agree? Or can you explain why you think it would make our society better to have more people face that?<p>Well, I think you grossly overestimate the impact iphones have on financial security of people world wide. iPhones are a minority of all phones, in some countries less than 1% of all, and yet people aren&#x27;t losing their life savings left and right. Yes it happens, but it also happens to iphone users - they are just targetted in different ways. And I think you are, like many others in this thread, assuming that it&#x27;s all or nothing - android has a reputation for dodgy security, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deserved. No bank app will allow installation on android if you have root enabled. None of them allow screen capture or 3rd party text input while the app is running. And yet, you have the freedom - you can <i>choose</i>(important word here) what you want to do with the product that you own.<p>I just don&#x27;t think this would be anywhere near as large problem as people think, and I would prefer the personal freedom gained by it. Again, on Android, you can flash custom firmware to your phone, yet how many people(outside of HN) ever do it? In cars, you can absolutely reflash the ECU and break every regulation under the sun, and yet how many people(outside of enthusiast&#x2F;modding circles) do you know who do so? There is no regulation there, no big brother stopping you from doing that - and yet 99.9999% of people never do it. And yes, I come from a country that has annual inspections too - that has absolutely nothing to do with fitting your own parts to a car. Even if I don&#x27;t buy the OEM brake pads for my mercedes, it will still pass the annual inspection with flying colours. The whole argument that car manufacturers make of &quot;we seal our parts so we know they are good&quot; has been an utter nonsense repeated for at least 70 years now - most parts are not manufactured by them and can be bought directly(like OEM brake pads for mine are actually made by Brembo, so I can either pay £150 to mercedes for a set, or buy them directly from brembo for £90....exact same product).')
