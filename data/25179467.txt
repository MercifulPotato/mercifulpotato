If you think you&#x27;ve already got use-after-free bugs under control, then more power to you! You absolutely have to concentrate your effort on whatever your biggest problems are.<p>But I&#x27;ll also say that if you don&#x27;t have <i>any</i> use-after-free bugs in the history of a large C codebase... you might not even be on the lookout for them? I still have them sometimes, mainly when it comes to multiple ownership. And those are just the ones I found eventually.<p>So yes, different strokes for different folks, but if you make the effort to incorporate tricks like this into your &quot;unconscious&quot; coding style, the ongoing effort is pretty minimal. Even if you decide this trick isn&#x27;t worth it, there are countless others that you might find worthwhile. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for better ways of doing things.')
