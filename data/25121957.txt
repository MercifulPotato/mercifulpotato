The device can also take into account the influence of the light flashing, or not, on the user&#x27;s decision because it has full information about the state of the universe and the laws of physics. What happens then? Please think about it before reading my solution below, I&#x27;d be interested to see what independent conclusions other people come to.<p>I suspect that in that case, the device wouldn&#x27;t work reliably. There&#x27;s no way for it to influence the person&#x27;s decision to press the button or not simply by choosing to illuminate the light or not even with full information. That&#x27;s simply not a powerful enough input into the person&#x27;s decision making process, even if that decision making process is perfectly deterministic and we ignore things like quantum indeterminacy. However I don&#x27;t know how to prove or test that logically.')
