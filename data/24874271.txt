Item(by='Normille', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603487750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869937, text='One thing that&#x27;s often overlooked when people talk about crypto&#x27;s shady image and lack of real world use cases is the fact that a huge number of world governments and financial institutions are doing everything in their power to hinder its wider adoption and prevent people from using it, without jumping through a ridiculous amount of regulatory hoops which pretty much undermine crypto&#x27;s USP in the first place.<p>Personally I think KYC is one of the most disgusting invasions of privacy that has ever been foisted upon us.  As usual the <i>&quot;Terrorists, Paedos and Drug Dealers&quot; [Ts, Ps &amp; DDs]</i> bogeymen have been trotted out to justify the state&#x27;s self-proclaimed right to know exactly what money you have, where you keep it, who you give it to, what you spend it on and where and who you got it from in the first place [see also the increasing drive for us all to become cashless societies. A further erosion of the right to get and spend without &#x27;The Man&#x27; knowing every detail].<p>The wider adoption of crypto promises to return financial privacy to the individual and this is why governments around the world are so aggressively opposed to it. Crypto allows the anonymity of cash but on a global scale. So, in order to discourage this, there&#x27;s an increasingly impenetrable regulatory wall built around the entire crypto ecosystem. Government and big finance can&#x27;t do much to prevent what happens inside the crypto bubble. But they&#x27;re doing their damnedest to make sure that getting fiat into or out of that ecosystem is made as difficult as possible.<p>One slight aside: Many of you will remember when the Panama Papers [0] scandal broke, a few years back. There were supposedly amongst them documents that showed that the then UK Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s family were involved in moving large amounts of money around undeclared offshore bank accounts.<p>David Cameron was asked about these allegations and, refusing to answer, he said <i>&quot;A family&#x27;s finances are its own private affair&quot;.</i><p>I often bring that quote up when people counter any mention of cryptocurrencies with the tired argument about them being used by &quot;Ts Ps &amp; DDs&quot;. Why is it OK for the rich and the ruling classes to move their money around anonymously in offshore tax havens and numbered Swiss bank accounts, but the ordinary Joe Bloggs in the street is expected to conduct all his financial dealings under the scrutiny of the government? And, if he dares to believe that <i>his</i> finances are &#x27;his own private affair&#x27;, he is practically branded a supporter of &quot;Ts, Ps &amp; DDs&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Panama_Papers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Panama_Papers</a>')
