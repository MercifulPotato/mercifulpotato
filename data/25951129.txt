You being personally affected doesn&#x27;t change that. At least that is what I would argue is required from a consistent moral framework.<p>Don&#x27;t think that says much about my morals, just that I like them to be consistent &#x2F; not myopic.<p>Think about the thread we&#x27;re posting in. This is basically about a company&#x2F;industry that was like &quot;these retail investors don&#x27;t need protecting, they&#x27;re adults and can make their own decisions, even if it means losing money&quot;, until those retails investors started costing <i>them</i> money with their adult decisions, at which point they change their mind and decide &quot;actually they need protecting from themselves&quot;.<p>The way you phrased your comment, it sounded like you did the same, just swap out financial shenanigans for name-calling.')
