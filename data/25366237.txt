This makes it sound like there&#x27;s a date-based kill switch built into their software.<p>I don&#x27;t think I like that. Yes, using Flash in a web browser once it has stopped receiving security updates is a bad idea, but what if you need to view a website in the Wayback Machine which incorporates flash, and you&#x27;ve set up an isolated VM for the purpose? I suppose you could set the VM&#x27;s clock back, but that&#x27;s a major PITA which could potentially cause other issues.<p>The existence of Flash Projector softens the blow significantly, but there will be some content that must be viewed within a web browser. Perhaps an earlier version of Flash Player lacks the kill switch?')
