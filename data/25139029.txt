Yes, the author&#x27;s definition is pretty obviously using a non-standard definition, but the question is whether the concept he&#x27;s talking about is helpful. And I think it is--I would much rather have a language like Go where cross compiling is trivial and I can just send my colleagues (even my non-technical colleagues!) a binary file compared to having them install the right version of the runtime and the right dependencies (and probably a virtualenv so it doesn&#x27;t bungle their system) and then the application code. I don&#x27;t care very much about whether I can run a single set of artifacts on any target if it&#x27;s burdensome to prepare the target platform--I&#x27;d much rather it be trivial to compile a single artifact for the target platform such that it can just run.')
