Bar one: it was not open source.<p>When I made the switch to Firefox in 2012, it was my belief that I would not have been forced to switch browser had Opera originally been open source. I strongly believed in open source at the time; I used Opera in spite of that. When they shut down the Presto project, I lamented the loss due to the inability of the community to fork.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if Firefox went away, would a fork be likely to survive in any impactful way; browsers are massive, complex &amp; enormously expensive to maintain, whether you have rights to the source or not. Maybe open source isn&#x27;t the panacea we thought in this particular context.<p>I&#x27;m still on Firefox as I&#x27;m loathe to support any browsers built on Blink &amp; contribute further to a monoculture, but the Vivaldi project have finally started to achieve similar things to what Opera was doing 8 years ago. It&#x27;s notable that it&#x27;s linked in blue in the section of this article headed &quot;A better browser&quot;.')
