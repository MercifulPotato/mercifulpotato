I saw it more as an anecdote that I think probably a lot of people would, unfortunately, nod in agreement with.<p>To your point, however, I do agree. I think one of the major benefits of physical media (or even digital media as long as it&#x27;s entirely self-hosted) is that you can enjoy it entirely without surveillance, and that it&#x27;s much more resistant to censorship. Being able to read about and understand how people lived, thought, and created in the past is incredibly important, and it&#x27;s something we should preserve for the benefit of future generations, even if they might sometimes contain things that one might not necessarily agree with today.')
