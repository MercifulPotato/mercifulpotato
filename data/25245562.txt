It&#x27;s true that, overall, most slaves (in pre-civil-war US) were owned by a small number of plantations. But in some southern states, nearly half the White families owned at least one slave. In those families, obviously the women and children didn&#x27;t themselves &quot;own&quot; any slaves, but they nevertheless controlled that person&#x27;s labor. Similarly, wealthy plantation owners frequently rented their slaves to poorer whites. So even a relatively unprivileged class of White people benefited from slave labor directly despite themselves getting a raw deal relative to the land owners.<p>But ultimately, the south fought a civil war in order to preserve the institution of slavery because it was the fundamental organization of society on top of which the economy was built, and many non-elite white men nevertheless allied themselves with this effort.<p>As for projecting the past, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s certainly plausible that White people today are still reaping the benefits that were established by slavery and racism in a broad, systemic sense. As far as I know, my relatives didn&#x27;t own slaves, but my relatives did do things like get mortgages that Black people couldn&#x27;t do. That doesn&#x27;t seem fair does it? It&#x27;s a little bit like inheriting stolen property. But if you go back far enough, what <i>isn&#x27;t</i> stolen property?')
