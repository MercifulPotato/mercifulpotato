Not having shit PRs on Github?<p>* Relatedly, the 80 column &quot;rule&quot; is as stupid in code as it would be in prose. Use your aesthetic sense.<p>Yeah okay true<p>* Vim and Emacs both have terrible user interfaces, and are an inferior experience to even a normal text editor let alone a decent IDE. Users have Stockholm Syndrome.<p>Also true<p>* For beginners, BASIC is great and Python is terrible.<p>The language for a beginner is irrelevant, the only metric that matters is: Are you enjoying your coding experience? Keeping students coding is all that matters the language is irrelevant.<p>* There are many languages with a &#x27;mystique&#x27;, like Lisp and APL. The correlation between &#x27;mystique&#x27; and practical utility is inverse.<p>This is almost a tautology, of course mystique will lead to less practical utility because their is simply less interest, less tooling, and less understanding about how to use the tool.<p>* Source code should liberally use Unicode symbols.<p>Someone has never looked at Agda source code before and it shows.<p>* Sigils to indicate variable type are actually pretty great, especially if enforced by the compiler. (See above regarding BASIC)<p>Gross.')
