One can&#x27;t simply expect mass production to switch that fast.<p>UK has already tightened emissions rules on vehicles and VED taxes more polluting cars more heavily. They could, and probably will, ratchet things more.<p>The right response on this policy is to say: great thanks Boris, you can clearly see the potential in green tech, now could you do X, Y, and Z too?<p>Yes, the government expects people to lap this up. Which is a reason <i>why</i> they do it. If they see electric cars both piss off the Daily Mail camp and yet are <i>still</i> criticised as worthless by environmentalists then we&#x27;re not giving them the right incentives to take further measures.')
