For the cost of precisely 1 engineer fully loaded, I can have 500TB of bandwidth per month, every month. Guess what, it isn&#x27;t going to take just 1 engineer to maintain your homegrown worldwide CDN.<p>Does it make sense for FAANG to run their own datacenters? Yes of course. Does it make sense for you? No. This is what I don&#x27;t get about arguments for running a bunch of VPSs-- for literally any environment that isn&#x27;t thousands of engineers, it is more cost effective to let someone manage your underlying infrastructure for you, and any workload at that scale, you aren&#x27;t contracting with some random bare metal hosting shop.')
