I run a small software business that involves a few moderately-sized databases.\nThe day I moved from a fully managed hosting to a Linux VPS, I have a script like this crontabbed to run several times a day:<p><pre><code>    for db in `mysql [...] | grep [...]`\n    do\n        mysqldump [...] &gt; $db.sql\n    done\n    \n    git commit -a -m &quot;Automatic backup&quot;\n    git push [backup server #1]\n    git push [backup server #2]\n    git push [backup server #3]\n    git gc\n</code></pre>\nThe remote git repos are configured with <i>denyNonFastForwards</i> and <i>denyDeletes</i>, so regardless of what happens to the server, I have a full history of what happened to the databases, and can reliably go back in time.<p>I also have a single-entry-point script that turns a blank Linux VM into a production&#x2F;staging server. If your business is more than a hobby project and you&#x27;re not doing something similar, you are sitting on a ticking time bomb.')
