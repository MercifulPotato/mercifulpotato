IBM makes tons of money off of Linux, for example. iXsystems profits off of FreeBSD. Facebook profits off of their wildly popular C++ libraries.<p>I think we really need to divorce &quot;profit&quot; from &quot;open source&quot;. OSS is great because we can contribute our own ideas to it, because we can learn from it, because we can form communities around it. It&#x27;s also useful because it&#x27;s a vector for entrepreneurship. Edit: why should these be mutually exclusive properties?<p>It&#x27;s fair to point out that it can be a vector for exploiting unpaid labor. But that&#x27;s an accessibility issue that exists already. For example, it&#x27;s easy to tell folks interested in the field to &quot;do open source work&quot; if they want to get a job in the field. If you&#x27;re a low-income single parent, this doesn&#x27;t make CS more accessible, it&#x27;s a sick joke. Even without profit, open source isn&#x27;t this bastion of opportunity that we sometimes like to think it is.<p>You make an excellent point that it&#x27;s hard to learn large new systems. But it&#x27;s not impossible. Indeed, it&#x27;s possible to make super meaningful contributions to the system in &quot;limited time&quot;, starting with net zero knowledge: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.quarkslab.com&#x2F;playing-around-with-the-fuchsia-operating-system.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.quarkslab.com&#x2F;playing-around-with-the-fuchsia-o...</a>. To that end, I have to disagree that we&#x27;re the kind of project that outsiders can&#x27;t meaningfully contribute to.<p>I&#x27;ve addressed the point of community consensus elsewhere. All I can say here is that I personally owe my career to open source, and I&#x27;m therefore committed to helping others do the same. We opened the project to communicate with people. My personal goal is to do this and help as many people as possible succeed professionally through this vector.')
