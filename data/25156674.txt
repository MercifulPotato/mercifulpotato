Defining the types is another story.<p>Editors give great autocomplete suggestions (usually covers it for properties and return values). Documenting with examples is often helpful. If all else fails, cast.<p>Without advanced types, code needs documentation to prevent invalidity. With advanced types, code gets logical guarantees, but it often requires the same documentation. It&#x27;s not necessary for everyone on a team to have cutting edge knowledge when there&#x27;s sensible documentation.<p>Types create a synergy with documentation. Provable(ish) guarantees with good documentation is the best of both worlds.')
