You don&#x27;t knock a star off a product because they didn&#x27;t ship the product in time. You knock stars off the <i>SELLER</i>. There&#x27;s literally a whole system in place to review the seller.<p>And if the seller is Amazon, it&#x27;s even worse. Why would I care about whether or not Amazon was able to ship your product in time 3 months ago?')
