Maybe you should consider that decline they experience a little more thoughtfully.<p>I observed that the suggested <i>solution</i> to the decline in standard of living <i>would not have the desired effect</i>. At no point have you challenged this observation, which suggests that you have no reason to dispute it. Several times now, you have displayed a poor attitude, which is well within your rights as a human being but suggests you don&#x27;t have anything to offer to move the discussion forward.<p>&gt; Maybe you should consider that decline they experience a little more thoughtfully.<p>Sure, why don&#x27;t you do the same? I suggest reflecting on the economic realities of scarcity and the labor-multiplying effect of capital.')
