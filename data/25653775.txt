A lot of the references in the book were completely mysterious to me (but would not have been had I read Book of the New Sun and Book of the Long Sun.<p>But I loved it.<p>And I didn&#x27;t mind that the references were mysterious to me. It added to the feeling of the book, actually, which is very melancholic, and sort of follows the Odysseus template.<p>Couldn&#x27;t recommend the book more.')
