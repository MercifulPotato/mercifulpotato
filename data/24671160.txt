Glad I&#x27;m not the only one.<p>Did you also note the author&#x27;s take on that?<p>&gt;If the journal were published by nature.com but just called Communications, I’d agree with you. But they put Nature right in the name. In the GM example, it would be as if Chevys were named Cadillac Chevys. If GM made Cadillacs and Cadillac Chevys, and I bought a Cadillac Chevy which had a rattling engine and wasn’t powerful enough to climb a hill, then, yeah, I’d be ok saying, “My new Cadillac couldn’t climb the hill.” And then if someone said, “Don’t call it a Cadillac; call it a Cadillac Chevy, man,” I’d reply: “GM made the decision to give that car the Cadillac name, not me.”<p>&gt;Similarly, nature.com made the decision to give this journal the Nature name. If they wanted to avoid confusion, they easily could’ve done so. But my guess is that a big reason they chose this name was to play both sides of the street: the journal gets the Nature name so that authors are motivated to publish there, as the word Nature looks good on the C.V. etc., but then they have plausible deniability when they publish something bad, as it’s not “really” Nature. I don’t want to give them this deniability.<p>&gt;In short, I’m calling it Nature because it’s the name of the journal, not because it’s the name of the publisher.<p>&gt;Just by analogy: the American Statistical Association (ASA) publishes many journals. The flagship is the Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA). Then they publish other journals. The other journals have different names. The American Statistician is not called JASA Teaching. Statistics and Public Policy is not called JASA Policy. Etc. That’s fair enough. When I publish in those lesser journals, my papers don’t get that JASA sheen. And JASA doesn’t get tarnished by bad papers published in those lesser journals.')
