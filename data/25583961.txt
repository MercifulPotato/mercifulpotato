(You can get to it from the Actions keyboard shortcut.) You can nudge it back up, including for whatever big file -- when needed.<p>- Install the plug-in &quot;Automatic Power Saver,&quot; which does that automatically upon loss of focus. (Well, maybe down two notches?) I do notice the switch&#x2F;transition sometimes but it makes my overall session so much smoother (mainly because browser and IDE aren&#x27;t being slower than their combined slowness)<p>p.s. I&#x27;ve been dealing with JetBrains IDEs&#x27; slowness for 5+ years, have done the same workarounds you mentioned etc. I always have another fast editor set up, lately VS Code. For quick edits etc. I had a coworker who would use their JetBrains IDE only for the last stretch of their branch or ticket -- to get the inspections and other tools. I supposed I picked this up from them.')
