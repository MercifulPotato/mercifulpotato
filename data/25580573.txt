Present arguments please.<p>The progress of the vaccine has been incredible compared to usual, but that doesn&#x27;t mean more could have been done. Every death is a tragedy.<p>People are constantly used as guinea pigs... as long as there is informed consent as per the Nuremberg code it&#x27;s fine. Not suggesting anybody would be forced or ill-informed.<p>So back to my argument - you can make a reasonable guess at estimating P(death|vaccine) vs. P(death|covid) and set a big margin, then offer people to VOLUNTARILY agree to take it who are most at risk of dying.<p>The average age of death in the UK is 82 mostly with co-morbidities. I am sure many of these dead would have been happy to take the chance.<p>And in the case of the mRNA vaccines this not some trivial difference - some were developed within weeks&#x2F;months, but took nearly a year longer to pass all testing.<p>It&#x27;s really obvious that pandemics need different handling than the &#x27;lock down and loads of people die anyway, both from the virus and the consequences of lockdown while ruining the economy + wait 2yrs for a vaccine to be fully distributed&#x27; approach we&#x27;ve got.<p>I hope lessons are learned from covid (I&#x27;m actually optimistic they will be, in countries other than the one where the virus emerged anyway).')
