For most companies, when they IPO, they have the cash on hand from going public. The stock price doesn&#x27;t really matter anymore for day to day running of the company. Sure a lower stock price long term means that they need to up RSU compensation or won&#x27;t be able to raise money again, but do those really kill a company?<p>I IPO for 20 million, giving me 18 months of runway. My stock instantly gets shorted a ton, then what? How does that impact me? How does that put someone out of business? If someone thinks that a company is profitable, they can always invest AND that investment is cheaper because of the &#x27;excess&#x27; selling of the shorts.<p>I don&#x27;t follow how shorts kill companies.')
