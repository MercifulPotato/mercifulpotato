I suppose if it couldn&#x27;t have been anticipated, then maybe you did.<p>I think you&#x27;re understating it; this seems to be a major point of stoicism, that you shouldn&#x27;t be sad if your favourite pot was broken or your wife died or your fellow citizens denounce you and exile you, so long as you acted virtuously. You should only worry about what you can control, your own actions, not what you can&#x27;t control.<p>All the stoic writings I&#x27;ve read seemed to take it as a given that you already knew what was virtuous. So if what&#x27;s virtuous is solely a function of what&#x27;s in your own head, then the whole thing seems solipsistic. If you define virtuous actions in terms of their results and their effects on other people then it wouldn&#x27;t be solipsistic, but in that case stoicism seems to tell you very little about how to live; judging which actions are virtuous doesn&#x27;t seem any easier than just judging what you should do in the first place.')
