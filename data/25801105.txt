Item(by='superdisk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610788183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799368, text='An interesting case of this is the localization of the original Pokémon games. Before they were released officially in North America by Nintendo, a group of Chinese software pirates &quot;translated&quot; them into English first and sold them. The official translation came out later. Needless to say the unofficial translation is totally screwy in a hilarious way. What&#x27;s even more interesting though is that it&#x27;s a hyper-literal translation, so things that were localized out in Nintendo&#x27;s translation (alcohol, death, gambling) are presented in full glory. Team Rocket is known as &quot;The Regiment of the Guided Missile&quot; and the Pokédex is known as &quot;the illustrated handbook of PET,&quot; spelled out fully every time. Pokémon are referred to as PETs in general. There&#x27;s an item called sulfuric acid.<p>I had a great time playing it and noting the differences&#x2F;absurd translations with my friends.')
