In particular to make your motorization system hook to them (the native Lego system is pretty limited)<p>It depends on where you live, but the main cost of a 3D printer for me would be less the machine itself than the space and ventilation needed.<p>Friends who made the jump basically dedicated a room to making stuff so they can run prints overnight while ventilating (setting up a fume extractor is another option, it’s just a bit more investment in the “hobby”)<p>I see all of it as totally doable, but needs a serious level of dedication, time, space and money.')
