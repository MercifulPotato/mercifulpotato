The author here was lucky the commit history was in a good shape. The size of the offending commit was reasonable too, so any trivial commits had been squashed away here.<p>My personal issue with this particular commit is the useless commit message. &quot;Extract CreateTokenValidationParameters method&quot;. Well, obviously. But why? What was this intended to result in? Why was particular change made and not something else?<p>A more suitable commit message would have included something along the lines of &quot;JwtSecurityTokenHandler methods belong conceptually with other code that configures JWT parameters. Break them out to CreateTokenValidationParameters because ..&quot;, that would have make much more sense and made the change easier to understand for someone else!<p>After all, this is how the author describes the patch, when taking the time to do so in order to write a blog post. It isn&#x27;t that hard.')
