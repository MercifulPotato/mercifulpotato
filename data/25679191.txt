SBCL did on call to MERGE-PATHNAME a runtime type check. It knows the expected types for the arguments.<p>SBCL told you that the call to MERGE-PATHNAME is already wrong. A backtrace then will only show higher up code from the environment and the call to MERGE-PATHNAME.<p>Your Python code went into the routine...<p>Often the Python backtrace will be easier to understand, since it is source&#x2F;line oriented, since Python code usually does not have extensive code transformations (-&gt; Lisp macros) and using an optimizing compiler like SBCL may make the code less debuggable (for example when using tail call optimization).')
