Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=[25676493], score=None, time=1610049416, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25675766, text='&gt; Here at Nieman Lab, weâ€™re long-time fans of the work being done at First Draft, which is working to protect communities around the world from harmful information<p>Imagine being such a weak-minded person that you believe in the existence of &quot;harmful information&quot;. It&#x27;s not even necessarily untrue or wrong, it&#x27;s just &quot;harmful&quot;. Harmful to whom? The people who own the media? Propagandists? This redefinition of the word &quot;harm&quot; is typical Newspeak bullshit.<p>Here&#x27;s some harmful information for you: you&#x27;re going to lose this war, because you&#x27;re trying to impose censorship on people, and we hate it. We hate your patronizing attitude, your view that people are dumb and can&#x27;t handle contrasting opinions about the world. People will build systems to route around this, to escape from your walled garden of comfortable verified propaganda.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, but not a surprise, that COVID is being used as an excuse to shove all this control down people&#x27;s throats. 9&#x2F;11 was used as an excuse to shove the Patriot Act and other freedom-resticting laws into place that did not prevent any terrorism or make anything better (except for people with make-work TSA jobs). I get the feeling that Nieman Lab&#x27;s members like many others were just waiting for some excuse to push even more draconian censorship mechanisms onto social media. 20 years from now, no doubt, some other big catastrophe will be used as an excuse to restrict things further.<p>You think you&#x27;re doing a good thing, but you&#x27;re just an apparatchik, just an agent of propagandists and moneyed interests, and it&#x27;s obvious.')
