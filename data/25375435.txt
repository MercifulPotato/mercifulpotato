Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607618090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373272, text='&gt; Any directive telling human beings how they have to reproduce is eugenics by definition.<p>It could be dysgenics, depending on what the instructions are. :-P How about private charities that provide voluntary incentives for some people to self-sterilize and others to have more kids?  How about private charities that subsidize birth control and abortions?  How about friends and family encouraging people to marry someone smart, or telling people with genetic disorders that they should adopt?  Do you draw a line somewhere in the above between &quot;eugenics&quot; and &quot;not eugenics&quot;?  I think your line would be far from universal.  dictionary.com says &quot;the study of or belief in the possibility of improving the qualities of the human species or a human population&quot;, which would indeed encompass all of the above.  I&#x27;m afraid the word &quot;eugenics&quot;, like &quot;fascism&quot;, has been corrupted into &quot;something whose exact definition is unclear, but it&#x27;s definitely a bad thing&quot;.<p>&gt; Any law that tells human beings how many children they are allowed to have is fascism, yes.<p>So what is there to prevent some people from having 10 children, every generation, until the system collapses under their weight?  If you say &quot;it&#x27;s the parents&#x27; responsibility to provide for the kids, and if they don&#x27;t manage to do so from their own resources or persuade anyone else, then the kids may starve and that will limit the process&quot;, then, fine, that would work; though many people think the state should always prevent kids (or perhaps people generally) from starving, and I think policies with that effect have been enacted even in the U.S., and I doubt they will get repealed anytime soon.<p>You say that people with increased access to education and health and such naturally reduce their birth rates.  That may be.  But I think it would be only a matter of time before they got selected for impulsivity, high libido, inclination to adhere to the parents&#x27; religion that says to maximize children, or whatever other traits would lead to a bunch of people actually having tons of kids they can&#x27;t support.  (Perhaps the singularity and&#x2F;or genetic engineering and&#x2F;or other stuff will happen and make that irrelevant long before it becomes an issue.)  Maybe those traits would also lead to doing things that land them in jail for years, getting a reproductive penalty that way; I dunno if that would be enough.')
