That&#x27;s not an inherent limitation. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;apelife&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;apelife&#x2F;index.html</a> for an example of a GUI + TUI that&#x27;s built using Cosmopolitan. The reason why I said what you quoted, is I&#x27;m simply trying to calibrate expectations. I don&#x27;t view desktop GUIs as a productive area of focus, because there&#x27;s such a lack of consensus surrounding the APIs that requires, and web browsers do a great job.<p>As for sizeof(long) it&#x27;s 64-bit with Cosmopolitan, which uses an LP64 data model. That hasn&#x27;t impacted its ability to use the WIN32 API. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jart&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;libc&#x2F;nt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jart&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;libc&#x2F;nt</a> where WIN32 API functions are declared using uint32_t, int64_t, etc. It works great. I compile my Windows apps on Linux and it feels wonderful to not have to touch MSVC. Cosmopolitan even takes care of the chore of translating your UTF-8 strings into UTF-16 when polyfilling functions like open() which delegates to CreateFile() on Windows.')
