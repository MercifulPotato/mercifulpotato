We abandoned our considerable efforts to move to Stripe&#x27;s new API during its catastrophic phase, for reasons I&#x27;ve mentioned in past HN discussions and won&#x27;t rehash here. The bottom line is that anything that required 3D Secure would presumably now fail for us. However, as a UK business with customers in several other EU member states as well, we have yet to notice any significant failure rate when signing up new customers. This may be because we charge relatively low subscription fees and qualify for one or more of the exemptions most or all of the time. In any case, we keep being told it will change one of these days but so far the sky has not fallen and we&#x27;re still using Stripe when taking card payments.')
