CDPR built such high expectations from the game that it was ridiculous. And they were in high-estee, W3 was amazing so people thought that such a gamer-centric company will keep their word.<p>Of course everyone with half a brain knew that a lot of these were infeasible in such a depth as they advertised but on the other hand, the game was in dev for 8 years, so why not?<p>Then the game came out and people (like me) waiting for it for 7 years got half-baked game that had so many things obviously cut really late that is painfully obvious. Features sitting there, teasing something you were promised but don&#x27;t get.<p>Adding this to the debacle of last gen consoles issues, and  ridiculous AI, zero replayability and you get a lot of angry gamers. And I believe rightfully so.')
