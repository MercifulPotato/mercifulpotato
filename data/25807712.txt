No written terms of service needed. Just threatening the bartender might be enough.<p>People might be deplatformed, but they can still write, publish anywhere that will accept their writing, call people on the phone... do anything they could do in the year 1999, 207 years after the Constitution was established.<p>Shunning might be just fine in society, it always has been accepted. Look at the racial history of Chicago in 1919 and early 1950’s. Shunning after norms have been breached AGAINST STATED MORALS has been perfectly fine. We’re not talking races or creeds being deplatformed here. It took a lot of provocation.<p>Maybe we’re being inconsistent and expedient. Soul-searching is called for. I support the ACLU and admire their consistency, they’ve supported the truly reprehensible. Not sure if they’ve ever been called on to defend the deepest taboos, but they’ve gone deep enough. Yet it would be interesting to work through them defending the speech that, for example, exhorted people to kill ACLU attorneys.

Let’s see the deplatformed show themselves worthy of redemption.<p>And there need to be some well-thought-out movements to address aome of the causes that get folks to go so over the edge. There are many causes, economic, educational, societal. Flat-out bigoted neighborhoods are more likely to crank out flat-out bigoted generations, that’ll be a hard one for a long time. But less “us” v “them” could be accomplished.')
