The issue is with the site&#x27;s email provider. If the email server sending out the one time links is under heavy load or for some reason has a backlog, it may take a while for the links to actually get to the user.<p>This usually happens because whatever service the site is using to handle sending out emails is under heavy load, having issues, or is rate limiting the site due to a sudden spike in logins.<p>If this happens for any reason, it failure cascades because the more people try to log in, the longer it will take for everyone to get a valid link.<p>At least with a standard TOTP token or the like, if the service is under load it will eventually work if you keep trying (versus not working for longer the more people try).<p>Hell this method also runs into the issue of getting flagged as spam or getting blacklisted due to ~~the algorithm~~ for one reason or another. This is doubly likely if a sudden burst of traffic to a site results in them sending out a mass wave of near identical emails.<p>Now non-tech users can&#x27;t log in at all since they &quot;never get the email at all&quot;.<p>Email is a wonderful thing but it is painfully fragile and doesn&#x27;t handle time sensitive stuff well at scale (due to queuing, routing issues, and spam filters).')
