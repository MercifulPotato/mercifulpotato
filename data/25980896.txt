It retained its old Seattle credentials until the mid 2000s and then it started a rapid change politically, maybe due to a tipping point in terms of California transplants or some other such trend. Now it is a one party city with extreme (far left) politics being normalized. The effects of that are apparent daily - despite ever increasing city and state budgets, urban blight is everywhere in all the same forms as SF. The homelessness and drug abuse issues have been induced by a soft on crime local government that takes no responsibility for anything but instead uses these permanent “crises” as political leverage. The spiral of echo chamber politics dooms the city to this direction.')
