But I would tell family&#x2F;friends to get at least 16GB. With 32GB, I rarely have to think about RAM. But I&#x27;m probably 85%+ utilization all the time. I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m a &quot;power user&quot;, but my wife has a fairly new laptop with 8GB and it fills up FAST, even when doing nothing serious. It&#x27;s at 81% right now with just Firefox, Word, and Evernote.<p>If I were going for a desktop it&#x27;d be at least 64GB.')
