Linus is one of the most Rational, Direct, No-Nonsense, Get Things Done Leader there is. Whenever i hear some self-appointed &quot;expert&quot; pontificate on Leadership&#x2F;Management&#x2F;etc. i always think of what Linus would say&#x2F;do in that situation. People only think of him as a &quot;Technical Guy&quot; but his Leadership&#x2F;Management of something so vital, so huge, so distributed, with so many &quot;employees&quot; and with so few resources, so many stakeholders is what is amazing to me. Nobody comes close.<p>You really need to take back the &quot;uncontrolled lunatic&quot; phrase.')
