If you go to your local supermarket, you&#x27;ll see tons of people shopping for fresh produce and meat, not frozen or flavorless or expired (???).<p>You&#x27;re inventing a total straw man. Yes <i>some</i> people work 12 hour days and eat frozen food but it&#x27;s a small minority.<p>If spending lots of time at markets is what you enjoy, that do that. That&#x27;s what farmer&#x27;s markets in the US are for. But lots of people prefer to spend their free time doing other things they enjoy. Farmer&#x27;s markets can get old very quickly too. Sometimes people want to spend just 5 minutes grabbing some ingredients and checking out to make a quick dinner, not 30 minutes visiting different stalls, waiting for the three people ahead of you at each one, and then haggling over prices.')
