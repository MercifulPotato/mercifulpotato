It was a very successful but niche approach that eventually got traction as a concept and alternative to SQL when tools like Linq arrived. But Progress devs had had that ease of data access in their programs for years, under the cover of the unfashionable 4GL label.<p>I agree with you on it&#x27;s general awkwardness wrt industry trends, and obscure pricing and marketing strategies.')
