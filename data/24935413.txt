They are considered as utilities when it comes to bear the consequences of what they publish but as a publication when it comes to their ability to decide what they publish and what not.<p>I think that there should be a distinction between a forum like HN, which should be able to curate their content without being considered a publication because it deals with a specific subject and community, to a general platform like facebook or twitter which should be considered as a utility not different to a phone or electric company.')
