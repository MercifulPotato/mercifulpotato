Interest rates then vs today would make for the same monthly payment in actual dollars of around $500&#x2F;month. $500&#x2F;month in 1981 is like $1400 today. This would mean the house should be worth around $300k today at today’s interest rates.<p>Of course the location may be more or less in demand which greatly influences price.<p>Where I grew up the houses are more expensive than in the 80’s but the location isn’t in demand so the inflation and interest adjusted cost is well below the cost back then.')
