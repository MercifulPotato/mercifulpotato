The idea instead is to do the work <i>that you would have done anyway</i> because somebody else paid you or because you did it for fun, and then you publish it to use the community to help you fix issues. A philantropic motivation is nice but not necessary and just a minor side effect. And just as you don&#x27;t have an obligation to help does nobody have an obligation to help you either.<p>That&#x27;s why I like the term &quot;open source&quot; better than the original &quot;free software&quot;. If you get the root motivation that RMS had for the &quot;freedom&quot; aspect of it, then that&#x27;s the same thing, but too many people read it as &quot;for free&quot;. Like apparently the author of this article. And that&#x27;s just wrong.')
