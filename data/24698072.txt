Other infections can cause long term problems, and it&#x27;s still super early for COVID to talk about long term effects. I remember getting pneumonia in my twenties and it taking 3 months for my lungs to fully recover.<p>We still don&#x27;t understand exactly what happens with Lymes Disease. Is the immune system left in a state where it&#x27;s continually fighting&#x2F;reacting to an infection that&#x27;s no longer present?<p>The 1976 swine flu vaccine also may have cause neurological issues for up to 4,000 of the millions who received it[1]. Would they have had the same symptoms from an actual infection from the flu? Potentially. It&#x27;d difficult to know, but people do have long term issues from other viruses, especially if they&#x27;re older or have other underlying health conditions.
