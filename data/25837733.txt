It is too bad they couldn&#x27;t have satisfactory financial success building on open source and it is their right and perfectly fine to switch to a different model, but their justification as well as the SSPL dual licensing muddle the water unnecessarily.<p>At least the blogpost clearly states it is no longer open source, but then it goes &quot;it&#x27;s just definition, we&#x27;re actually totally free and open, just, you know, not OSI free and open&quot;.\nSSPL software is not free software, it is not FOSS. Calling it &quot;free and open software&quot; is misleading at best.')
