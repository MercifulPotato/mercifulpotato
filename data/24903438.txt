The cause of the issues can be high latency, low latency, high bandwidth, low bandwidth... <i>whatever</i>. If you&#x27;re in the 1%, YouTube has optimised you out in order to save 1% in hosting costs somewhere. It&#x27;s a type of over-fitting that results in a fragile system.<p>Engineers at Google get bonuses for shaving 0.1% off of something, because at their scale that could be millions of dollars saved.<p>Hence protocols like HTTP&#x2F;3, which exist almost entirely to optimise some Google backend by single-digit percentage points.<p>YouTube has had every last percent of &quot;inefficiency&quot; squeezed out of it, to the point where lots of users have a degraded experience.<p>Google famously doesn&#x27;t care about user experience at all. They care about costs and their own internal KPIs, which are all tied to advertising revenue, not &quot;video playback smoothness&quot;.<p>This is why Firefox was 5x slower on YouTube for years. This is why Google famously has next to zero &quot;customer support&quot;, <i>even if you pay them</i>. They don&#x27;t view you as a customer. You&#x27;re the <i>product.</i><p>Firefox users click on ads less. Firefox users tend to have adblock. They&#x27;re <i>not good products</i>.<p>Similarly, Google is fighting a turf war with the likes of NetFlix and Apple for advertising eyeballs, so they do <i>not</i> want to ensure that Apple TV can play back YouTube in the best possible quality. They optimise for Chrome and Chromecast first, everything else a distant second. Got to build that walled garden!<p>I pay NetFlix the same amount monthly as I pay for YouTube Premium. NetFlix provides support, YouTube doesn&#x27;t. NetFlix works flawlessly on every device I have, YouTube doesn&#x27;t.<p>YouTube doesn&#x27;t play 4K on my Apple TV 4K! It doesn&#x27;t play 4K on my <i>flagship</i> Samsung TV! It downgrades my iPhone for 480p <i>even on WiFi!</i><p>This kind of anti-consumer (anti-product?) bullshit is why Google needs to be broken up.<p>The vendor that makes the device, the browser, the search engine, the network protocol, and the advertising platform shouldn&#x27;t also be <i>television</i> for half the world.<p>They shouldn&#x27;t get to degrade the experience to benefit their browser team. They shouldn&#x27;t get to slow down the experience for a competing browser. They shouldn&#x27;t get to simply <i>ignore</i> customer complaints. Television broadcasters in most countries have to answer to an ombudsman. YouTube doesn&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s too much control that invites anti-competitive, anti-human behaviour. The incentives are all wrong.')
