Item(by='lucideer', descendants=None, kids=[25894630, 25894880], score=None, time=1611511684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891435, text='This list is a good idea for the reason stated in a sibling comment: it could highlight gotchas for people learning CSS.<p>However it fails to do so. The list is mostly subjective preferences, and as such is far too long, leaving the actual universally-accepted gotchas to get completely lost among the rest.<p>Even some of the points that most would agree on are still such minor gripes as to be almost irrelevant, so listing them just detracts from the significance of some of the very large actual mistakes in CSS.<p>Here&#x27;s a few choice subjective examples:<p>&gt; <i>Table layout should be sane.</i><p>This is not a helpful bullet point without expanding further.<p>&gt; <i>The 4-value shorthands like margin should go counter-clockwise (so that the inline-start value is before the block-start value).</i><p>This would make sense for an implementer and make resulting CSS more terse for common use cases but it would be less intuitive for people newly learning CSS.<p>&gt; <i>z-index should be called z-order or depth and should Just Work on all elements (like it does on flex items).</i><p>This would have caused a lot of arms race z-indices, particularly in sites loading widgets generated by third party scripts. It would make z-index less confusing but without scoped CSS this change could get quite problematic.<p>&gt; <i>The top and bottom margins of a single box should never have been allowed to collapse together automatically as this is the root of all margin-collapsing evil.</i><p>I 100% agree but I acknowledge that many don&#x27;t, so I don&#x27;t think this belongs here. This is basically like the tabs and spaces debate.<p>&gt; <i>descendant combinator should have been » and indirect sibling combinator should have been ++, so there&#x27;s some logical relationships among the selectors&#x27; ascii art</i><p>wat<p>&gt; <i>:empty should have been :void, and :empty should select items that contain only white space FIXED in the spec, waiting for implementations to check for Web-compat…</i><p>This is BAD. Whitespace isn&#x27;t empty (nor does it display as such, it collapses to one space, not zero), so that change is incredibly unintuitive. :empty should stay as currently, :blank might fit the new use case.')
