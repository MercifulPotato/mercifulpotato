That comment was downvoted by folks that presumably don&#x27;t understand the problem at hand.<p>In that pre-announce video Apple dared to insinuate that attestation by current devices is de-anonymizing, when that isn&#x27;t universally the case. And that <i>their</i> flavor of such would be &quot;actually&quot; privacy preserving. At the time, I figured this (a remote service) would be how they would address it, as the secure hardware probably doesn&#x27;t have the burned in capability. Largely due to Apple needing to do it their own way.<p>Now of course, like the &quot;normal&quot; U2F attestation, this is private between the client and the service. But in Apple&#x27;s case, like DOH, it is not private between client and Apple. IOW, a decrease in privacy, but marketed as an increase! LOL, classic Apple!<p>They go even further in their blind denial by stating:<p>&gt; this approach avoids the security pitfall of Basic Attestation that the compromising of a single device results in revoking certificates from all devices with the same attestation certificate.<p>without recognizing or acknowledging that there is <i>still</i> a single point of compromise, but now it&#x27;s a cloud service which many engineers have access to and presumably isn&#x27;t 100% impervious to outsider attack either. So yes, it may avoid the single device security pitfall (resulting in a largish group of devices requireing to be revoked), but it trades it for an even bigger pitfall of all devices everywhere needing to be revoked!<p>It&#x27;s sad that the reality distortion field has to be extended to privacy and security. Apple could easily just present their take on it without confusing the issues for the sake of marketing.<p>Further, it&#x27;s up <i>to the site</i> to decide whether to use an anonymous attestation or not. The user will not be informed either way. With &quot;standard&quot; attestation, it&#x27;s up to the user in their decision of what token (security key) to buy, and is always in effect. That said, a non-attested enrollment, if done correctly on the client side, doesn&#x27;t give up privacy; just security.<p>To answer your question, it depends what you mean by &quot;taking on&quot;. Yes, Apple is assuming some risk. They are not taking on any liability in the legal sense.')
