I understand that polling definitely missed big in some areas, but isn&#x27;t that normal? Polling is really hard. You have to make a lot of assumptions, adjust for demographics, predict whether a voter will turn out, while using a sample of usually ~1000 people. Of course some polls are going to be wrong. I don&#x27;t think the polling was generally wrong though. Polling averages had Biden +8 or so, when all votes are counted he&#x27;ll likely be +5, which is within margin of error. Polls were extremely accurate in Georgia, where conventional wisdom would say Biden shouldn&#x27;t win.<p>I get that most of the polling error benefited Trump, and the industry needs to reflect on why that happened and how to prevent underestimating republicans again in the future, but I don&#x27;t yet buy the narratives that &quot;the polls got it wrong.&quot;')
