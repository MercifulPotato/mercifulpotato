As far as I understand, this was always <i>the</i> definition. In fact, calling it the speed of light was always a bit misleading, since, first off, actual speed of light depends on environment, and second, there is nothing really special about light. It&#x27;s just under ideal circumstances it can propagate with the maximum possible speed, i.e. the speed of causality. Light isn&#x27;t fundamental for the laws of physics, causality is.')
