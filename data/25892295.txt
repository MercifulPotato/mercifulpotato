If anyone told them they needed to fill in forms, “tell them to ring up the PM and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin.””<p>I understand the downvotes, some people think of politics like sports, they pick a team and they support it and they don’t like it when someone trash talks their team.<p>#End Edit<p>The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is a lying idiot who’s popularity appears to stem from being a bit funny when he appeared on a TV quiz show 10 years ago and his cabinet are either corrupt or unbelievably incompetent. They’ve completely screwed up Brexit, COVID and who knows what else in the year they’ve been in power. The one thing that a British private school education excels at above all else is giving its students absolute confidence in themselves, which seems to have led to a kind of Dunning-Kruger perfect storm at the heart of government.<p>Here’s one example: Every ministerial position Grant Shapps has had has involved him getting ‘swindled’ out of hundreds of millions of taxpayers money, or completely screwing up something important like the train timetables for the whole of Britain.<p>If its not incompetence then it’s corruption, which is something we like to pretend doesn’t happen in Britain, but maybe we need to take another look at ourselves. Continuing to hold the idea that as a nation we somehow are immune from it is ridiculously naive at this point.')
