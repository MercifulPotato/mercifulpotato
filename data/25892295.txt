They’ve completely screwed up Brexit, COVID and who knows what else in the year they’ve been in power. The one thing that a British private school education excels at above all else is giving its students absolute confidence in themselves, which seems to have led to a kind of Dunning-Kruger perfect storm at the heart of government.<p>Here’s one example: Every ministerial position Grant Shapps has had has involved him getting ‘swindled’ out of hundreds of millions of taxpayers money, or completely screwing up something important like the train timetables for the whole of Britain.<p>If its not incompetence then its corruption, which is something we like to pretend doesn’t happen in Britain, but maybe we need to take another look at ourselves. Continuing to hold the idea that as a nation we somehow are immune from it is ridiculously naive at this point.')
