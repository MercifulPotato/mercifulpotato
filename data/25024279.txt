But how many undiscovered columns are in this table?<p>My top level comment seems unpopular, so for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ll clarify that I definitely agree that there are fewer knobs for the non-cryptographer implementer to get wrong with ECC. But that&#x27;s because the <i>only way</i> to implement an ECC system exactly as specified by the cryptographers. That&#x27;s clearly an improvement over RSA, but I remain unconvinced that the cryptographers designing the curves are infallible. There <i>are</i> curves and curve parameters that, for various reasons, are bad.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a proof that it&#x27;s impossible to do better than Curve25519, but if there is, I haven&#x27;t seen it, and tptacek would rather be snarky than provide a reference. <i>Is it</i> impossible for more columns to show up in that safecurves table? If so, prove it. Otherwise, I think my top level suspicion is reasonable.')
