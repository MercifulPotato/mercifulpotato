I would have ignored the original title.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why dang and other mods justify their gatekeeping when they edit the title to use &#x27;expensive words&#x27;, like they did here. It makes me feel so frustrated. Stop with the academia-industrial-complex and let people link to articles&#x2F;papers how they want to. Stop with the PR already (removing &#x27;iPhone&#x27;).')
