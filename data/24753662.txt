AMA..?<p>10x does stellar work - as Max said, standing by me, enabling my career, and helping many people along the way.<p>10x also runs <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;10xascend.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;10xascend.com&#x2F;</a> , a salary negotiation article, which has been discussed on HN before: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16494677" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16494677</a><p>The “10x” topic usually brings up a number of arguments (do they exist &#x2F; does anyone need them &#x2F; etc.) :) but I do want to highlight at least one small thing: having a professional business negotiator working for you is life &amp; career changing.<p>It’s very easy for my technical enthusiasm to get ahead of my interests (“I just want to build the thing!”), and that’s not usually a problem when working for myself on an art or side project or helping friends. But some businesses will 100% take advantage — if given the chance — of this maker spirit that’s not uncommonly seen in developers. 10x has always been there to remind me that it’s ok to both love doing the work and setting clear boundaries (and they will then help enforce them).<p>Others here might have an easier time setting boundaries than me, and that’s great! But considering it’s been something I’ve consistently struggled with, I’m deeply grateful for Michael, Rishon and all of their colleagues’ work.')
