I do believe that the act of breaking down tasks helps clarify assumptions and helps paint a more accurate picture of what needs to be accomplished for a particular task. Can breaking down the task into small bite-size chunks be a little demoralizing? Maybe. But I don&#x27;t necessarily view it that way, assuming that the person owning the task is part of the initial conversation.<p>In short, the breaking up of tasks should be a conversation, not some top down mandate.')
