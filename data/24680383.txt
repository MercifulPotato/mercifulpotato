I&#x27;ve rarely found in-person conversations to be as helpful as asynchronous conversations over a chat medium (or PR comments, etc). I think the main reason is that during in-person conversations, people don&#x27;t leave lengthy gaps to think before speaking. So for technical subjects, asynchronous communication is much better suited.')
