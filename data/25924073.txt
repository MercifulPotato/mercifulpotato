Go Beavs! ;-)<p>Ha!  This is a silly novelty &quot;Beaver Baseball Cap&quot; I was given during my internship in 1988 at Hewlett-Packard in Corvallis: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;G0rPHGP.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;G0rPHGP.jpg</a>  For 32 years it has sat on my computer monitor or on a shelf nearby.  Nobody really asks about it anymore.<p>I got pretty lucky on timing at OSU. The year before I was there they taught beginning programming on punch cards on a mainframe computer called a &quot;CDC Cyber&quot;.  In my freshman year I took Pascal on the brand new 1984 Macintoshes in the Computer Science department, while the engineering students still learned Fortran on the mainframe my freshman year.<p>In 1992 I got a job as a Software Engineer at Apple in Cupertino, and you can trace that straight back to my blind luck of starting my programming education at OSU on the Mac in the exact correct year.  Well, I&#x27;d rather be lucky than good.<p>And I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been lucky in my career.')
