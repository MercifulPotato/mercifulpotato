If you program the switch, you can specify if it will trigger the relay, or just send z-wave commands. There&#x27;s even a physical override switch you can pull out to cut power in case you have it programmed in &quot;soft&quot; mode.<p>The &quot;red&quot; product line doesn&#x27;t require a neutral, either.<p>Works great for smart bulbs as long as you can set the hub up to do the control.<p>If you have z-wave bulbs (harder to find than zigbee, due to licensing), you can set up the z-wave pairing so that the switch controls the bulbs directly, so theoretically no hub required.')
