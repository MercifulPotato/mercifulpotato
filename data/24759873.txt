It seems like it is a different situation from continental travel, since like many island nations, they shut down visitor arrivals and thus airline travel with the 14-day quarantine you mention. You can&#x27;t do that at Tahoe or Mammoth. It seems like each island has different requirements now, or at least each island wants a stricter 3-day negative retesting protocol.<p>And the locals were really vigilant, they were reporting any quarantine breakers on Facebook and to local authorities. In some cases, people who refused to cooperate got flown back off the islands.<p>And from what I read, even though the local economies are decimated by the lack of tourist dollars, a lot of locals are really happy to not be overrun with tourists at their favorite beaches. There is also talk of less tourist numbers, to be made up for with higher value tourists--less budget options. I wonder if things will ever go back to what they were before, because a lot of people didn&#x27;t like it before.')
