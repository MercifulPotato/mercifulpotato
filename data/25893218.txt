No government agency can mention or ask about ethnicity - in particular, our national statistics agency, the INSEE. Private organizations can, but this is not often seen.<p>I think its an heritage from WWII, in particular the &quot;yellow star&quot;.<p>France refuses to consider racial differences (and religious differences too), it seeks unity in everything, to the point that it almost drove local languages to extinction.<p>&gt; Ethnicity is an extremely important identity category, and if you want to manage that diversity you need information.<p>As a french person I object to this. It&#x27;s all about culture, not face features. If you want to study &quot;communities&quot;, don&#x27;t  look at the face, look inside the head. And the idea that a government would &quot;manage&quot; ethnicity is exactly the kind of thing that repulses us.')
