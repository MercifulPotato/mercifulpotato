I tend towards silver age sci-fi and fantasy, but I also dig a good whodunit.  I think the main reason why we see less of them these days is because of the lack of popular serial format magazines.<p>Some favorites that come to mind at the moment:<p>&quot;Goodnight Mr. James&quot; in &#x27;All the traps of Earth&#x27; by Clifford Simak<p>&quot;Neutron Star&quot; and &quot;What good is a glass dagger?&quot; by Larry Niven<p>&quot;Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn&quot; by various authors<p>The Fafhrd and Grey Mouser series by Fritz Leiber (successive short stories)<p>&quot;If all men were brothers, would you let one marry your sister?&quot; and &quot;The world well lost&quot; by Ted Sturgeon<p>&quot;The Tactful Saboteur&quot; by Frank Herbert<p>&quot;The Gold at the end of the Starbow&quot; and &quot;The Engineer&quot; by Frederick Pohl<p>It seems to me that the best aspect of a short story is that the story can present an idea or twist without long characterization and world building, so that you get the idea in a purer form.')
