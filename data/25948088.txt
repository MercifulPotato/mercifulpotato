Yes, accepting PRs from the broader community and spending time on them has a good chance of making the product superior over time. But just like how it is probably good for me to understand the impact of my purchasing choices on the environment, I can&#x27;t listen to it <i>all the time</i>. I don&#x27;t think it is unreasonable to say &quot;in this context, I do not have the bandwidth to manage unsolicited advice from others&quot;. That isn&#x27;t &quot;being close minded&quot;.
