Is it possible you haven&#x27;t tried those other services?<p>It&#x27;s just your personal experience that is different. Same for the other guy, same for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been on a paid accounts for Apple Music, Google Music, Yandex Music and even Youtube&#x27;s adhoc solution for music. At least 1 year each (almost for entire time since the launch of Yandex music).<p>Spotify beats them all. Both recommendations and content (though we have to agree that content part can vary based on your location). Never had a chance to try Rhapsody.<p>&gt;that when I pick some electro swing band it recommends death metal<p>That&#x27;s how Google Music worked for me though, not Spotify.<p>Yandex had best UI but worst recommendation system (and lack of content).<p>Apple&#x27;s recommendations are about as bad as Google&#x27;s. Better UI but again - did not have music I wanted.')
