Never mind even more sites Google will show you.<p>Some of it dumbed down, but lots of it is from professionals and lecturers for actual medical students. I won&#x27;t post examples because there really is <i>so much</i> that it&#x27;s useless for me to do so, apart from pointing out the sites I used myself.<p>On another note, I continue to be amazed by the fact that so often I see people asking in forums instead of Google. It shows how important humans are to humans, no matter what service machines will offer, or how great recorded content is, live content from&#x2F;with an actual human will be preferred to a large degree.<p>Just yesterday in some forum somebody asked a question to find a certain novel. I copy-pasted his exact question into Google and found the novel immediately. This is quite common. Is this a topic of discussion at companies like Google? No matter the automation, <i>a lot</i> of humans are very reluctant to interact with the machine(s). It seems to me this is quite an obstacle for companies on the business of putting machines in front of customers instead of humans.')
