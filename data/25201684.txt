The only time I&#x27;ve had a true marketing title was when I ran marketing at MongoDB), but I don&#x27;t think some of the other criticism sticks. We&#x27;ve been contributing to Apache Lucene and Solr (which feed into Elasticsearch), as well as Elasticsearch, for a long time. See, eg, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;opensource&#x2F;amazon-giving-back-apache-lucene&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;opensource&#x2F;amazon-giving-back-a...</a>.<p>As for Headless Recorder, we&#x27;re working with Tim now. That was a miss on our part, one that I (and the team involved) regret. But I don&#x27;t regret you and others calling us out when you feel we&#x27;ve done wrong. AWS is not a perfect company, but I&#x27;ve been gratified that people here (in my experience) want to do the right thing. Sometimes we need help figuring out what&#x27;s right in a given situation (or, rather, what&#x27;s the right way to help customers. Increasingly you&#x27;ll see teams understanding that more upstream contributions might be the best way to help customers in the medium- and long-term, even when it&#x27;s not necessarily the obvious way to help them in the short-term). So please keep helping us do better.')
