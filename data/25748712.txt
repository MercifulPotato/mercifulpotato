Item(by='eugenekolo', descendants=None, kids=[25750652, 25750513], score=None, time=1610467648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748592, text='It&#x27;s true that property taxes are based on the assessment of a home, but it&#x27;s also not necessarily true that the assessment does a good enough approximation to consider that any house within 1mi of the train is worth 20% more than one 1.5mi away. From my hobby of looking at home appraisals in Boston towns it seems the biggest factor in most towns is square footage.<p>Another point to consider is that most towns in Massachusetts seem to use replacement cost as the main method of appraisal versus potential income&#x2F;value. Meaning, 2 families appraise for nearly the same as a single family when they are in reality worth 1.5-2x more in potential income via rent or selling.')
