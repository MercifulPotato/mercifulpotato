I&#x27;d rather have a sturdier device with 2-3x the battery capacity any day<p>Is that still the case though? I&#x27;m not sure about the Android world, but the last several iPhones have been getting thicker and heavier with bigger batteries, to the point that I would say the iPhone 11 is heavier than I&#x27;d like.<p>Fragility I agree with, but I think it&#x27;s less the thinness and more that every high-end phone now has a glass back for wireless charging. I tend not to use cases and I&#x27;ve never once charged my phone wirelessly (and really don&#x27;t care about it), so I wish there was an option for an aluminium back.')
