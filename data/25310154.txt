In most states it is illegal for the major companies (Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, etc) to sell direct to the public,  once they start a dealer network that is how it has to be for all time.  Tesla got around that because they were a new company with no dealer network, even then in some states laws were &quot;updated&quot; to prohibit direct sales.')
