I see it almost every time I visit HN. I&#x27;ve encountered many people with a slightly warped sense of reality but none more so that on this website.<p>There are two broad patterns I often see:<p>The first is where they think everyone on the planet is somewhat like them. You&#x27;ll see comments like &quot;everyone should be able to program&quot; or even &quot;everyone should program&quot;. I&#x27;ve even seen people claim that ability to program should be considered a fundamental life skill. In general it&#x27;s hugely overestimating not only the IQ but the interests and mindset of the general public. The comment I replied to here is an example of this type.<p>The other one is where their perception of a baseline standard of living is far higher than that of average people even within their own country. It&#x27;s usually that they think some luxury item is absolutely essential despite people around the world living healthy and happy lives without it. They seem to be completely unaware that these other people exist.<p>My theory is that these people have been fed through schools in affluent areas, through university and straight into ridiculously high paying jobs and have simply never had (and probably never will have) any contact with people from other walks of life.')
