I don&#x27;t really get the idea: what problem does this solve that Slack&#x2F;Zoom&#x2F;etc don&#x27;t? The whiteboard seems OK but no software can solve the problem that drawing with a touchpad sucks. Am I going to have to schedule meeting rooms again? Forget finding the right Zoom link, I now have to find the right room too? Stand around the water cooler when I&#x27;m on a break, except that then I won&#x27;t be at my computer and so I can&#x27;t actually use that? It&#x27;s easy to talk to coworkers, but Slack is even easier. It&#x27;s easy to start a meeting, but Zoom is no harder - and easier for people outside your organization. &quot;How&#x27;s the cafeteria?&quot; is what one of my coworkers asked, jokingly, but I think that captures my feeling of it. Sure it&#x27;s got a cafeteria, but that cafeteria doesn&#x27;t solve any of the problems that a real cafeteria solves.<p>Then again, I&#x27;m also of the opinion that video calls provide little value beyond phone calls, so maybe I&#x27;m just a grump.')
