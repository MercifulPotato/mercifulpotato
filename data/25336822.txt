Zen is still competitive at ~7nm&#x2F;12nm with separate corelets, so if they can match 5nm on a single chip, things will be back to normal.<p>M1 has 16B transistors on 1 &quot;chip&quot;, a 3950X has fewer than 10B across 3.  What else would you expect, for now?<p>[1]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transistor_count" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transistor_count</a>')
