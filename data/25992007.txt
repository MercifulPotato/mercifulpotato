This means by definition &quot;Best Practices&quot; will tend towards &quot;Average Practices&quot; as the number of contexts they are used in grows to infinity.<p>This is what people have to realize, when you put in place &quot;Best Practices&quot; you&#x27;re doing something that is &quot;average&quot;.<p>To do something &quot;better&quot; than that, you need to specialize your practice for your given context. Unless you happen to have the exact same context from which the &quot;best practice&quot; originates from, chances are it is not optimized to your context. And even if you have the same context, time has probably gone by and more &quot;practices&quot; might have developed since that are even better to that context.<p>Like the article says, you can only optimize to your context if you understand the pros&#x2F;cons of each practice, so you can customize to your needs.<p>I have definitely seen situations where developers push for &quot;best practices&quot; when the current practices are already specialized to the context, but because they are not the &quot;best practices&quot; from some internet blog, or famous book, the developers think the practices must not be the &quot;best&quot;, in reality they are pushing for worse practices as they are pushing to de-optimize the practices from one context to some other context, bringing the team back to the &quot;average&quot;. They lack the understanding and rationale to asses what is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; for their context, and that&#x27;s why this happens, as they cannot reason about comparing their current practices against the &quot;best practice&quot; ones, thus simply believing in the social trends and norms over whatever the team had worked to specialize into.<p>Now many times, a team will have below average practices in place, and that&#x27;s when putting in place some &quot;best practices&quot; will help, as it drives the team processes up towards the &quot;average&quot; or better (given how similar or not the team&#x27;s context is to the best practice).')
