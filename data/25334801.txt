That &#x2F;is&#x2F; part of the impressive part. The CPU and Rosetta2 are obviously designed to complement each other and the results speak for themselves on day one.<p>The fact that little more than a recompile is needed to make native binaries (obviously lots of exceptions to that) is also impressive and a testament to the work done until now on iOS&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad ecosystem. Of course, some minor complaints that old 32-bit apps don&#x27;t work, even on intel systems.<p>Meanwhile we&#x27;re on year 8 of false starts for Windows on ARM. In contrast to apple, a 10 year old 32-bit x86 app might work, but a recent app probably won&#x27;t.')
