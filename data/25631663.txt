So if your current employer says no, you can go to another.  Which is how I&#x27;ve seen quite a few promotions.  The latter of switching employers is far easier, since life changing benefits (medical&#x2F;retirement) aren&#x27;t tied to employers.  (Considering SV workers get their &quot;share&quot; by switching employers every few years, that would be a nightmare scenario for big tech as well.  Since it further reduces employee stickiness, if SV unions decided to offer benefits).')
