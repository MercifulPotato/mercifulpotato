In a way now it seems egoistic to have tried grasping a lot of stuff to then just doing nothing with it.<p>My big thoughts are mostly the same, moving in the same rate when I&#x27;m cooking them up by myself but now in social situations I feel like I can crack some great jokes and mental maneuvers in trying to translate my philosophies to others.<p>I think being a true loner brings peace in that you don&#x27;t need to think much about social pressures and such, on another hand though, it can feel a bit like you&#x27;re some virtual computing machine entity isolated from everything else. Now I&#x27;m sort of looking at mental &amp; physical exertion as a way to distract me from the boredom of &#x27;not existing&#x27;, maybe it was always that and I&#x27;ve been good at it, took skateboarding at 27, practicing by myself like some crazy  person 6 years already, and now I started working on a game project too.. It&#x27;s just weird to me how self-exertion and &#x27;social fasting&#x27; go together. But anyway, I&#x27;ve exhausted so many interests already that I sort of crave of breaking off of it, I&#x27;d just take some 5 or 6 projects with me and that&#x27;s it.')
