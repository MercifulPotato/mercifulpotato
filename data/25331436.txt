But are you sure every programmer on Chromium is a genius? Google has a hard Interview process, but does it filter out every bad engineer?<p>And if Google&#x27;s &quot;probably better than other company&#x27;s&quot; engineers can&#x27;t do it? How can we expect other companies to deal with C?<p>&gt;I&#x27;d rather avionics code be written in verified SPARK than in Rust, but if they can build a rock-solid Rust compiler it would be good to have it compete in that space. I imagine it could be a nice alternative to MISRA C++, for instance.<p>Right now SPARK would definitely be favorable. But I think even current Rust would be much safer than MISRA C++.')
