Myself personally, I have been programming for decades as well and struggle with the curse of knowledge.<p>Curious what other people do and what struggles they have had.<p>Having spent time studying Category Theory I see a lot of value to using it in my code but it is not common knowledge and often confuses others when you start throwing around terms like functor, monoid, monad, etc.<p>At the same time I don&#x27;t want to write code that isn&#x27;t as reusable or to that isn&#x27;t as maintainable.<p>Are we as an industry limiting our own potential by deliberately not using knowledge when it is beneficial for the sake of greater communication?<p>My personal philosophy when working with teams is to exclude some of that stuff but slowly introduce it and train junior developers on some of the concepts in the hope that I can push that knowledge forward.<p>Curious what others think of this dilemma and how they address it.')
