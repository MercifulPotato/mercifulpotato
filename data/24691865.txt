One of these involved, you guessed it, a spreadsheet (we used a number of other development tools for much of our work), in this case Excel. Again, numerous errors which substantively changed the outcome of the analysis. One of the walkthrough leader&#x27;s observations was that you could replace all of the in-cell coding with a VBA macro making debugging far easier (all the code and data are separated and in one place each).<p>The particular analyst whose project this was: he insisted to the very end that this &quot;wasn&#x27;t a program&quot; and he &quot;wasn&#x27;t a programmer&quot; and that the walkthrough didn&#x27;t apply to his situation. Despite the errors found and corrections made.<p>At the time (mid 1990s) the walkthrough lead turned up a paper from a researcher in Hawaii on the topic. I&#x27;m not certain it was Raymond Panko, but his 2008 paper (a revise of a 1998 work) discusses the matter in depth:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070617041554&#x2F;panko.shidler.hawaii.edu&#x2F;SSR&#x2F;Mypapers&#x2F;whatknow.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070617041554&#x2F;panko.shidler.haw...</a>')
