America is notably hostile to attorney fee shifting, to the point where we literally call it the French Rule. If you&#x27;re sued for something baseless you&#x27;re expected to have the money to defend yourself. Copyright is unique in that fee shifting is regularly granted in the US, but even then it&#x27;s limited to specific amounts of hours billed at a reasonable rate as determined by a court. You don&#x27;t get to just hire the most expensive attorney with the expectation that they can make the nuisance suit go away and then collect from the plaintiff rather than the defendant.')
