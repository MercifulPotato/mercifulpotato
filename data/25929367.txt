Item(by='kreeben', descendants=None, kids=[25929504], score=None, time=1611761407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928927, text='&gt;&gt; Social media damages everyone&#x27;s mental health<p>It may seem that way but don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 100% accurate.<p>Mental pressure built up within yourself, whatever is their cause, get somewhat released after a good cry. Afterwards you feel a little bit refreshed. You feel a little bit less sad. The anger within you is not as prominent.<p>Lashing out on people, starting flame wars in your favorite online forum, screaming, yelling and DEMANDING to be heard, shouldn&#x27;t that also release some of the tensions we all carry around with us from time to time? Wouldn&#x27;t that leave us a little less motivated to go out IRL and actually hurt someone physically, a little less motivated to sit down and furiously start on the next evil manifesto?<p>My own brain, though, is not built for social media. I need to see the nervous twitch in your eye, your conniving smile or the loving wink of your eye in order to fully understand you and I think oftentimes when you misunderstand me it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t see my eye twitching or my mouth smiling. But I&#x27;ve heard other people being absolutely in love with it. It can&#x27;t be all bad.')
