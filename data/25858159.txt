The Maoris still suffer from systemic oppression here.<p>The cultural whitewashing is something that has always been operating at the intellectual echelons of &#x27;European&#x2F;white supremacy&#x27;, they usually move into the scene to carry their jobs, after the military&#x2F;warlords&#x2F;mercenaries have cleared the scene.<p>And trust me, I do get the point you are trying to make, but that doesn&#x27;t apply here. Nor I am saying that ideas from other cultures shouldn&#x27;t be subjected to valid criticism or that Europeans should bear the brunt for it.<p>And if you do study history of other colonies a bit, you will find that police in colonies like India was created to instil the fear and British dominance in locals, with guns and batons.<p>The police there hasn&#x27;t been reformed even now and is still brutal, following the same standards set by the British.<p>So there is a degree of truth in that congresswomen&#x27;s words.')
