Approval sounds like somebody&#x27;s mistake maybe, not awaiting for review feedback for submission and submitting - feels strange. Especially when followed by threat of leaving company if identities of people consulted in review process is not revealed, at the same time being involved in litigation against G while on G&#x27;s payroll etc.<p>It&#x27;s like you have good Silicon Valley espisode just from that, I&#x27;m not sure if I buy total innocence here.')
