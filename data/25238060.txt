I think it&#x27;s a failing of our current public view (daily news cycle perhaps?) of politics where politicians always have to be seen &#x27;doing things&#x27; about all this evil lurking about, and if they aren&#x27;t, then should anything happen, the blame lies squarely in their lap.<p>This, I&#x27;d argue, leads to it always being essentially career-wise risk-free to be more tough&#x2F;stringent&#x2F;et c. on &lt;evil thing du jour&gt;. And why not? There&#x27;s hardly any downside. It&#x27;s all unfortunately about optics.<p>EDIT: re-reading your comment, I realize I&#x27;m just stating in more words your salient point. It is, however, a particularly difficult hole to dig ourselves up from though.')
