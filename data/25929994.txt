On pornhub, there are many couples making videos of themselves and getting millions of views, making a living off of this. What these people make is obviously still probably setting high expectations (good lighting, edited to cut out the awkward parts, etc), but IMO, there is a lot more amateur and realistic content out there, and it&#x27;s what many people want to see. I think in the 70s, 80s and 90s porn used to be a lot more studio, and now the general trend is for more natural, less processed.<p>I first got access to porn when I was 12, but I heard the disclaimer, everyone told me it wasn&#x27;t realistic, and I don&#x27;t think it skewed my expectations too much. IMO humans learn and adapt. I don&#x27;t think that porn is a threat, but I do wish there was more sex education, and maybe relationship coaching for teenagers... Teenagers need to be taught early to have realistic relationship expectations in general, how to approach someone respectfully and accept &quot;no&quot; for an answer, consent, etc.')
