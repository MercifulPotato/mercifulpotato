Does this mean that the tool knows things like race, gender, religion, etc. about the user?<p>If a user has willingly shared such information with the tool, I don&#x27;t see a problem. I&#x27;m not sure how Facebook would even have any standing in a legal case. But the article does  seem to contradict itself about user privacy.')
