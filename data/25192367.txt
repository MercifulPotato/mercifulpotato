That certainly does not make him a pedophile.  It is, however, pretty off putting.<p>All this makes me feel very much like the Hans Reiser case.  I was internet active at the time and remember all of his fans swear up and down about how innocent he was and how much he was a victim of the corrupt judicial system.  Then that fateful day happened when Reiser was convicted and basically said &quot;Ok, if you&#x27;ll give me a lighter sentence I&#x27;ll show you where the body is&quot;.<p>Stallman did a lot of good for the opensource community, which makes him a hero to many.  I think, however, it&#x27;s unhealthy to try and justify his statements on pedophilia.  It&#x27;s ok to talk about the nuance of the laws (Certainly there are major issues with the way CP laws work.  It&#x27;s a bit crazy that teens are getting convicted of it over normal teen behavior).  Stallman has been really icky here.  He talks not about age difference but instead how &quot;voluntary&quot; the acts are.  Trying to read in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; scenarios when he himself doesn&#x27;t even mention that is trying to paint a more rosy picture of what stallman wrote.<p>All of this, frankly, can also be cleared up by clarifications from Stallman (which he&#x27;s not published).  He could say pretty much exactly what you&#x27;ve said here &quot;When I was talking about X, this is what I meant&quot;.  He&#x27;s not done that and I think that&#x27;s really telling.  Maybe someone told him to STFU, but then again, he&#x27;s not really been silent on his positions on sex throughout the years, so why start now?')
