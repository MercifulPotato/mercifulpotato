I keep using Windows (hardened and almost isolated Parallels instance of Windows 7), because Linux has serious lack of software I need.<p>I need fully functional MS Office, including API bindings for data import to Excel, and no, Libre Office Calc does not have even 20% of features I need. Of course, I need 3rd party addons, like Grammarly for MS Office.<p>I need Enterprise Architect, modeling software of that class simply does not exist on Linux.<p>I need Photoshop (I have one since old good times when Adobe offered lifetime license), I use it occasionally and not 100% effective, but nope, there are no functional open-source alternatives for Linux with the same comfort of use.<p>People don&#x27;t use Linux not because it is not pre-installed, they don&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s a totally foreign ecosystem. Doing a fully functional ports of software people use under Windows would&#x27;ve probably moved 1% share of Linux on desktops, but it does not happen, partly because open-sourse software designers do not recognize the problem, partly because it&#x27;s an immense amount of work, impossible without huge financial and human investments with unclear outcome.<p>I don&#x27;t even say about technical issues, like total lack of backward compatibility, it&#x27;s mostly a headache for techies like us.')
