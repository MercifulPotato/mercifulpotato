It allows anyone to train effectively any animal to perform any task that helps them with any disability they (or someone else) may have. It&#x27;s ultimately these tasks and abilities that make an animal a service animal, not a registration or tag that needs to be kept up to date and costs money.<p>To be clear I&#x27;m talking about any registration that certifies an animal is a service animal, to my knowledge all service animals still have to have all other forms of legal registrations and tags.<p>It&#x27;s really about the spirit of the ADA which tries to make sure that there are as few barriers as possible for people with disabilities in society. Someone else made a comment that describes how low the rates are for people with disabilities to have normal forms of ID for themselves, let alone their animals. For someone with a disability even the smallest of barriers can sometimes be insurmountable.')
