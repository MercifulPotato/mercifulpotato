We know that hygiene works. We don&#x27;t yet know whether masks work or not, but we do struggle to find benefit when research is done (and this includes for source control -- there&#x27;s plenty of research on that).<p>When scientists claim &quot;masks work, we know they work, and we know they work well&quot; they risk feeding a narrative that we can go about our normal day to day life so long as we wear a mask. That&#x27;s untrue. We still need to distance, we still need scrupulous hygiene routines.<p>They also feed into a narrative that people not wearing masks are causing harm, which leaves those people open to harassment and attack.')
