When my blood pressure is measured it drops so fast the standard device starts beeping and fails to get a fix. Last few times the doctor had to use the hand pump to get a good measurement.<p>It&#x27;s probably not super common and obviously psychosomatic, I doubt my blood pressure would drop if I were unconscious, but I imagine if I can make my blood pressure go down that fast, other people might do it less extreme and fool the device.<p>Anyway I&#x27;d be happy to use a less invasive device for sure.')
