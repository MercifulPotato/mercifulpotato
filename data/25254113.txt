Item(by='espadrine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606747011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253780, text='&gt; &gt; <i>This claim is incorrect and does not take into account the spike in raw death count from all causes compared to previous years.</i><p>&gt; <i>Am I the only person confused with the language here? What is the difference between &quot;Total deaths per age category&quot; and &quot;total raw death count&quot;?</i><p>The article has multiple items of incorrect analysis.<p>One is that having constant percentages of deaths per age category, does not show that the death count is itself constant.<p>A separate one is that the claim that “total death numbers are not above normal death numbers” is factually incorrect.<p>While reading the link, and before reading the retractation, I made myself these exact remarks. One thing I saw in the article, which the retractation implies, but does not emphasize, is that this assertion:<p>&gt; <i>Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of\ndeaths was normal long before COVID-19</i><p>… is a non-sequitur. The fact that a large number of deaths has been reached in the past, does not imply that it being reached with COVID-19 is normal.')
