Item(by='dragonsh', descendants=None, kids=[25272843], score=None, time=1606873413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25268376, text='&gt; It&#x27;s freedom.<p>AWS or any cloud service is anything but freedom. So please use the word freedom judiciously. If you are working with AWS your application and your whole organization is at the whims of Amazon. You will not even be able to migrate if you are tied into those API&#x27;s and services because they are not same across cloud providers. You don&#x27;t even own the data or compute resource hosted on such cloud services because just by a single notice from a government agency your account will be blocked without access to your own data or compute resources. It has happened and will continue to happen because for government approaching single cloud provider is much easier than going over the process of getting it for company or an individual (more costly and difficult given different jurisdiction across country and state lines).<p>In terms of technical freedom you will have less of it and will be tied into proprietary extensions, API and services offered by those cloud providers.<p>On the other hand for self-hosted infrastructure government notice will not block access to resources owned by you and data in those resources. You can respond to notice and continue using those resources until court rules. So it is more freedom than a cloud can offer.<p>In our organization we need to go extra mile and put extra engineering efforts to make sure our apps can work on different clouds with different services (e.g. using apache libcloud, avoiding proprietary API&#x27;s).')
