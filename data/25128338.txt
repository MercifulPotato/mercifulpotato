For me, personally, computer fan noise is uniquely aggravating. I wanted to buy the 2015 Macbook specifically because it was fanless, but decided against it because a x86 CPU trying to run in that fanless form factor essentially made it a $1K netbook. Now that we&#x27;re seeing the M1 MacBook Air rival the 16-inch MacBook Pro from last year in an extended CineBench test (even through Rosetta!), it&#x27;s a different story entirely.<p>I&#x27;m not saying active cooling doesn&#x27;t help, obviously the Air is going to thermal throttle in cases the Pro wouldn&#x27;t. But I am saying that the new chipset needs active cooling a lot less than the old one did; not just cause it&#x27;s RISC vs CISC but its also &#x27;cause it&#x27;s TSMC&#x27;s 5nm process vs Intel&#x27;s 14nm one.<p>Also, I&#x27;d give up on the hope that they&#x27;d get rid of their stupid meme bar on the Pro. They seem committed to it.')
