Depending on the pickup shortfall, I could easily see the need for multiple trucks needing to go to each carrier&#x27;s facility.<p>You&#x27;re also going to multiple employees per truck, with at least one being more senior since there could be tens of thousands of dollars in merchandise.<p>They&#x27;ll need to get to the carrier facility and make sure the boxes are scanned, because they are now a variable in the transport, and it would look bad if a box went missing and supposedly never made it to the carrier. At the warehouse we have cameras that make it unnecessary to watch the boxes being scanned. Not to mention customers check tracking like hawks and would call and take up support resources wondering about their box that &quot;shipped&quot; but the tracking page says &quot;Fedex is waiting on your box to arrive&quot;.<p>On top of this, carrier pickups are typically scheduled as late as possible. We lobbied heavily for our UPS &#x2F; Fedex pickups to be 6pm (or later during peak). So you&#x27;re going to need to send employees to the carrier at 6:30pm or later, dropping the truck off at the warehouse at 7:30 (at the earliest) after loading&#x2F;unloading&#x2F;scanning (It was a 15 min drive to the carrier center).<p>So they&#x27;re getting home at 8pm, and need to be back at the warehouse at 7am to pick all the orders for the next day.')
