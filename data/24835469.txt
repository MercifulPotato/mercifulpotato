It&#x27;s a company, a government offered it free money for no real commitments (as a fairly nakedly obvious political ploy), it took it. That&#x27;s what companies do; if it hadn&#x27;t been Foxconn it&#x27;d have been someone else. Most of the blame lies with the government.<p>This is really a story of failure upon failure; the political ploy didn&#x27;t work out for Walker, either. No-one&#x27;s happy, in the end.')
