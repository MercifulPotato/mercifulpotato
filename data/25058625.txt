He is referred to in French as &quot;Le Roi Soleil&quot; - The &quot;Sun King&quot;? I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d translate it. Anyways, this name highlights how he was supposed to be the only form of power but also the entity who you had to trust and listen to - he censored people he disagreed with.<p>- This period that followed was the Enlightenment - &quot;Les Lumi√®res&quot; in French which means &quot;The Lights&quot;. Instead of this form of one focal point for broadcasting, the right to broadcast was spread to many philosophers who voiced their ideas and suggestions for a new system. This was a renewal. Still, a select amount of people could broadcast because it required time and effort, not to mention someone who would publish you.<p>- Now, this &quot;bar to broadcast&quot; is almost non-existent. People can instantly share with the world without having to take a moment to reflect and think about what they&#x27;re doing. This is the problem that the author refers to. In a way, we&#x27;re in a period of &quot;fireflies&quot;. Sparks of information and broadcasting everywhere, but in the same way a firefly is fragile and its light is weak, quality information is diluted and the signal to noise ratio is low.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this, because it is important that the voice of everyone be heard, but I think some form of forcing people to reflect and think about what they&#x27;re broadcasting would be nice.')
