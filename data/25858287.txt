By the exact same logic, any activity you have, you could have spend that time by advocacy for good cause. Whoever works on own side project or plays board games afternoon could have instead be activist for better healthcare and is now starwing oxygen to those causes.<p>Plus, quite honestly, if I would seen advocates for better healthcare or better affordable school system complaining about the other issues being distracting to them, then it would sound like a good faith argument.<p>But, I have seen this opportunity cost argument being done by those who oppose one advocacy and don&#x27;t practically care about the other. I mean, I am not doing anything activisty&#x2F;charitable either, but I am not claiming it is because another cause starwed the oxygen or what not.')
