A land value tax also has progressive tax effects.  Advocates of\n    land value taxes argue that they would reduce economic inequality, increase\n    economic efficiency, *remove incentives to underutilize urban land* and\n    reduce property speculation.\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately most Americans have not heard of it, and it would probably be labeled socialism by elites if it was brought up seriously.')
