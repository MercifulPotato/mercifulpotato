The majority of CMS code is C++, which you can check for yourself at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cms-sw&#x2F;cmssw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cms-sw&#x2F;cmssw</a> (yes, much&#x2F;most? of the code is open source). What I worked on specifically was prototyped in Python, then ported to C++ and plugged into the massive data processing pipeline where performance is critical due to the sheer amount of data. So I probably wouldn’t put C++ in parentheses.')
