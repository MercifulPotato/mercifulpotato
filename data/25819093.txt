It&#x27;s my understanding that certbot is going to be migrated out of universe soon and into the main Ubuntu archive.  That will cause it to gain full support from Canonical.  Either way, we will continue to support certbot in Debian (upstream of Ubuntu, if downstream from &#x2F;actual&#x2F; upstream) indefinitely.  The Ubuntu maintainers and I work closely on packaging.')
