Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609208978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563793, text='&gt; Here is a list of the top 10 selling games from 2018. Nearly all of them used in-house engines:<p>Sure - those are the AAA games we&#x27;re talking about (and even then, a lot of those are long-running franchises that reuse a significant chunk of engine code between multiple installments). The biggest sales numbers will keep coming from that segment for a long time. But it&#x27;s a shrinking segment in terms of overall revenue (much of which is no longer up-front sales), and even more so if you look at profit; each year the line where it makes sense to use a custom engine gets higher, and a bigger share of money coming in is from games built on commodity engines.')
