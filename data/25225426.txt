Both of these can be found in normal first aid kits, so I would bet that you can legally use it at home.<p>Even in the hospital, this work was probably done by a nurse with a 2 year degree. You can go to any clinic and have it done. If the kid were at summer camp, they would have probably had the staff nurse do it.<p>Emergency rooms are both overkill for this, and happily overcharge as well.<p>We are all talking as if the hospitals performed a dangerous complex procedure and saved the kids life.
