When I was 16 I wasn&#x27;t able to &quot;get funding&quot; for a lab bench power supply.<p>I resorted to building one off an used ATX computer power supply, but voltages fluctuated a lot and also it was pretty high and non-regulable in current output. That was a recipe for troubles. Indeed, when one of the first boards I was learning on caught fire (mis-configured potentiometer + non-limited current dwaw) I didn&#x27;t feel safe anymore to continue and basically stopped doing that kind of stuff.<p>So yeah, extremely impressive achievement for a 13 years old student, not downplaying his achievement, but it&#x27;s wrong to understate the role that his parents and their funding had.')
