The point is that your argument that we ought to condemn the actions of the trump supporters <i>because</i> the rest of society has done so is not a rational argument.<p>I don’t think breaking into Congress is always bad. I support people’s right to peaceful protest. The Trump supporters by and large did not initiate violence, the violence was initiated on them by the police. If there was evidence that the trump supporters actually were initiating mass violence against people in the capitol that would be a different story, but with 4 unarmed protestors dead, they were the only ones who suffered casualties. That’s simply a fact.<p>You’re drawing a line that <i>any</i> protest which occupies the capitol is immoral.
