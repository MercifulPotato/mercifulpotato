I think your right. Apple and Microsoft aren&#x27;t as innovative anymore. It&#x27;s sad. But I do think Microsoft is leading this front between the two. Some of their acquisitions of SAS products have grown and improved, where Apple isn&#x27;t doing something significant to improve the lives of it&#x27;s users. Does a photo really add that much value? Or an emoji? Whereas many of the SAS products Microsoft has is a business model that is to speed up it&#x27;s users productivity.<p>As for losing out on programmers which (my words) essentially reduce the exponential behavior that tech was experiencing. I&#x27;ll say this. It is sad. Rent seeking is a typical behavior of any company that gets large.<p>I&#x27;m actually now wondering if something is preventing these companies from growing very fast, like a national actor.<p>If you look at Amazon, they are in numerous industries and have a little market share of them and are trying to innovate in them. Amazon isn&#x27;t slowing down either. I find it an interesting case study. Only AWS is helping programmers, many other products are actually against user&#x27;s interests.<p>Another case study would be Tesla. They are emerging as a most likely monopoly due to their relentless innovation. But they don&#x27;t harness community programmers either. I believe this will change overtime, since Musk has said this for many years but I doubt there will be a lot of freedom in their system either.<p>I want to see a company that is innovative and allowing others to innovate on their platform. It would be very valuable to society if we do this.')
