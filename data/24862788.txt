Instead of sharing snippets of code on forum posts, they could simply add the right crates.<p>That’s not a very compelling value proposition. You don’t need to switch languages to use a package manager.<p>Plus, not all engines have the same data layout, so an “effect crate” would either require your engine to work a very specific way, or would require integration work that would probably defeat the purpose of using a package manager in the first place.<p>And what does Rust itself add that GLSL&#x2F;HLSL don’t offer? It can’t be worth the headaches, especially when you consider how a TON of devices still only support OpenGL, which not only requires runtime compilation of shaders (so only GLSL unless your app ships a cross compiler), but different drivers behave differently, requiring ugly hacks for the sack of performance in some cases.')
