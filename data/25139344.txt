Couple questions:<p>1.) How do you discourage companies from intentionally using these fellows to do &quot;grunt&quot; work? Given that these are only 4 week projects, for a lot of complex projects, that isn&#x27;t enough time to ramp up even a senior engineer to deliver a finished working product in that time.<p>2.) One of the huge barriers to this kind of &quot;contract&quot; work is the potential for a whole bunch of unmaintained code to be written. A big reason that smaller companies don&#x27;t have interns is because of the time suck in terms of ramp up and long term maintainability of the code. How will this program deal with these issues?')
