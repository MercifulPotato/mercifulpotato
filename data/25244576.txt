You really ought to distinguish for everyone here instead of trashing the whole culture. You&#x27;re not talking about the same thing others are talking about. Taarof&#x27;ing (pretty literally: &quot;offering&quot;) can mean multiple things, and it&#x27;s <i>critical</i> to distinguish them:<p>1. Offering things <i>expecting you to refuse them</i>. You know, like you go to pay for a purchase and a shop owner pretends to refuse the payment. In such cases, <i>they</i> would be offended if you accept their offer.<p>2. Offering things in general (generally food...) because they&#x27;ve just been trained to by the culture. In this case, they&#x27;re &quot;worried&quot; something negative might happen on <i>your</i> end if they you don&#x27;t take their offer. (<i>You</i> might be offended, go hungry, not have a place to sleep, etc.)<p>Foreigners talk about #1, but you&#x27;re talking about #2.<p>And these are VERY different things.<p>Your mom making you sandwiches (effectively forcing you to eat them) is NOT #1. She is NOT offering it to you expecting you to refuse it. (At least not due to taarof; if she might have some other beef with you that&#x27;s another matter.) If it&#x27;s either of these, it&#x27;s #2. And in all likelihood, it would be only partially #2—a lot of it is just her being your mom and being overly enthusiastic (obviously some cultural part to this too) about making sure you&#x27;re well-fed.<p>However, foreigners care about #1—about <i>offending the person making the offer by accepting the offer</i>. Your mom is emphatically NOT going to be offended if you take the sandwich. Like the native making a sandwich for the person you replied to, she is much <i>wants</i> you to take it and is 100% sincere in that. Heck, she&#x27;ll be offended if you refuse it!!! Unless I guess, you know, she&#x27;s doing this for the 500th time and she&#x27;s hoping you might finally start making the sandwiches yourself, but again, that&#x27;s only because you&#x27;re her kid and she wants to see you improve in her eyes, not because of the taarof tradition...')
