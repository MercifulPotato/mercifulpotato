I learned it well enough to build a decent UI toolkit (draggable modals, collapsible, etc.)<p>I hate how CSS tries to mix layout and style. A million articles about not using tables for layout, and it took 20+ years to get a grid. I tried to do some fancy text and element alignment with CSS, and it was not having it (and, yes, I know about display: table). In the end I reverted to a table. It worked, and I moved on with life.<p>It is ridiculously hard to draw things in absolute positions. In many cases, it is easier to do a tiny bit of math and compute the positions of objects, rather than have to define parent&#x2F;child relationships. But for true absolute positioning, you have to throw divs into a &quot;portal&quot; of some sort, and move that object into the root element. This makes doing things like pretty drag and drop extremely painful.<p>Browsers are buggy as hell, and often something works on everything but [insert your most hated browser]. That&#x27;s a hint that the spec is too complicated.<p>I agree with your assessment, in that if you try to construct the world from scratch, you&#x27;ll be &quot;fighting the beast the whole way.&quot; I disagree that this is positive quality of the thing.')
