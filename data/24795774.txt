Item(by='hintymad', descendants=None, kids=[24796766], score=None, time=1602805778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24795665, text='&gt; What is being said is that the police shouldn&#x27;t be the instance to handle incidents where what is really needed is counseling, or social working. We&#x27;re talking about shifting funds to those and let police do what they have been trained for.<p>I wish that&#x27;s the discussion, but I failed to see that&#x27;s what actually happened. I&#x27;m aware that many people argue that &quot;defund police&quot; means allocating fund for better use, but it sounds revisionism. The word &quot;defund&quot; means stop funding, simple and clear. BLM&#x2F;ANTIFA&#x27;s demand is clear too: abolish police. The word &quot;abolish&quot; does not mean restructuring, nor does it mean improving. The Minneapolis council woman was specifically asked for her view about &quot;dismantling police&quot;, and I don&#x27;t see how the word &quot;dismantling&quot; can be interpreted as routing fund to a better org.<p>So, no, the left populists did ask for reallocating funds to &quot;handle incidents where what is really needed is counseling&quot;. They were asking for dismantling police. People may take &quot;defund&quot; as &quot;reallocate fund&quot;, but that&#x27;s interpretation that is not supported by facts.')
