This is about corporate-controlled machines. Engineering teams didn&#x27;t install this AV on their own machines. The point is they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> install it; it&#x27;s a company-mandated install. So no, there&#x27;s no presumption that they want the AV to scan anything.<p>&gt; <i>if you don&#x27;t believe&#x2F;trust in the efficacy of antivirus software, then there&#x27;s no point taking half measures and excluding some things from its scans</i><p>I 100% agree. Half measures &#x2F; excluding some things IS pointless. But as I said in my above comment, that pointless half-measure may just have been  the only compromise management would agree to.<p>&gt; <i>why use it at all?</i><p>Because it&#x27;s mandated by company policy...')
