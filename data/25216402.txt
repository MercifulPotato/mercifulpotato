Item(by='JshWright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606358802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25216343, text='I don&#x27;t have a choice about whether I use an ePCR or not, New York State (and, AFAIK, most other states) mandates it.<p>The only place where PCR errors matter is on the witness stand... The PCR is certainly important, but any critical information is conveyed in a number of redundant ways, and I would be very surprised if there&#x27;s been a single incidence of a PCR error resulting in a patient&#x27;s death.<p>PCRs are not treated with a great deal of trust, nor should they be (I say this as someone who has written thousands of them). We&#x27;re dealing with incomplete and conflicting information, patients that actively lie (or, more charitably, forget) about their medical history, and in the case of critically sick patients (the ones that are at risk of dying in the first place) I am more focused on the acute management of their condition. No one expects a PCR to be accurate in every detail. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless, but it also means the system expects there to be errors and has redundancies in place to account for that.')
