It&#x27;s closer to Python&#x27;s type system (i.e. unityping - &quot;static type system&quot; is a tautology, the things that Python calls types are not types) than it is to a post-ML type system. Judging the limits of type systems based on Go is like judging the limits of VR based on the Virtual Boy.')
