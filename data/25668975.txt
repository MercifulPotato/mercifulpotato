The script is designed to run on BOTH a CI system and a standalone dev box (real or virtual), giving the same deterministic, stable environment so that everyone is always on the same page (Honestly I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t done more often).<p>As a developer, you run the script once on your fresh Windows dev box, and then you can develop, run unit tests, or even run the CI script locally to have confidence that it will actually pass CI when you check your code in (and not overload the server with bad builds). In fact, I did all of my dev work in a VM because it&#x27;s super easy to tear down and rebuild if I break the OS somehow or introduce an unexpected dependency (&quot;it works on my machine&quot; syndrome).<p>As an admin, you only have to include this one script onto a fresh Windows image, then run it and save the resulting VM image for the CI server to run (instead of installing everything on every run as part of the build script like they were doing).<p>The original issue was that everyone was using the CI server AS a dev environment because they couldn&#x27;t get the project to build on a standalone box (it was tricky to set up, and undocumented, and the build scripts assumed a complicated CI environment). And management wasn&#x27;t even raising a stink about this, despite the HUGE cost (in a large corporation I can understand this sort of thing falling through the cracks sometimes, but not in a small startup!). I&#x27;m actually not a sysadmin (I&#x27;m a developer), but I do hate inefficiencies like this enough to do something about it.')
