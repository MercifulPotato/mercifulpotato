Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[24713539], score=None, time=1602104572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712257, text='&gt;<i>If i am born into a life with zero political agency</i><p>Genuinely curious, what would you cite as evidence of &quot;zero political agency&quot;? If it&#x27;s the de facto sense of it being prohibitively hard for one person&#x2F;group than another as you allude to in your previous posts, this is a very different thing than zero agency. Again, I think it&#x27;s dangerous to conflate <i>hard</i> with <i>impossible</i>.<p>The $400 buffer hurdle is a loaded topic that would be difficult to get into without being drawn into more walls of text, but I think this is often an artifact of poorly aligned priorities and choices. I actually tend think the counter is true; lower economic strata tend to have <i>more</i> free time than higher strata, etc. But I&#x27;m afraid this would turn into a long digression to get into.<p>I can agree that a government deserves it&#x27;s constituency. However, I think can be true without negating the previous statement about a populace deserving it&#x27;s government as well. It&#x27;s hard to be both an advocate for empowerment while also absolving oneself of responsibility.<p>I do appreciate you taking the time to elaborate, but a common thread seems to be an almost infantilizing of a constituency. While I can empathize with the marginalized, I don&#x27;t think it does any pragmatic good if it just stops at hand-wringing. If we resign ourselves to a lack of agency, ironically it&#x27;s a good way to guarantee not to get it. It&#x27;s a personal viewpoint, but I think those who will take ownership of these problems are in a much better position to affect change than those who constantly say it&#x27;s out of their control.')
