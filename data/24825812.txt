I&#x27;ve spent all of my 30+ years living with Ikea furniture. I&#x27;m writing this from an Ikea kitchen cart that has become my primary workspace. I remodeled my kitchen last fall with Ikea cabinets -- and was able to do almost the entire installation myself.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a serious problem with anything from them. The same cannot be said most of the furniture we&#x27;ve gotten from other places. The expensive, fancy-shmancy reclaimed wood dresser and nightstand my wife bought from some other chic retailer has been repaired about 4000 times.')
