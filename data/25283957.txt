Reputation, artisan skill-based product, mechanically induced scarce resource (ala Bitcoin), etc<p>You’ll just be paid low wages in the new resource.<p>But regardless, we’re still far and away from “let everyone do only what they wish”; sure everyone might survive (due to presumed abundance of survival resources ), but to do as you wish for any job reliant on others, you’ll need to coerce others to do things they don’t strictly <i>want</i> to do.<p>And so we have scarcity, and politic.<p>The resource-abundance means the janitor can also optionally do nothing — he doesn’t necessarily need to janitor against his will — but it doesn’t mean he can become a dancer (that anyone will watch). He can become a dancer only so far as one might do alone, in their room, but to be trained, or to do it in the professional arenas, or to be watched, etc requires the coercion of others, with requires him to be sufficiently wealthy in something valuable, which must be scarce, and naturally unevenly distributed.<p>And he might janitor to save up to be a dancer.<p>Of course, you could always <i>pretend</i> to have an audience in a VR simulation, or an army of robots, but that’s perhaps a fairly pathetic fulfillment of his dream.')
