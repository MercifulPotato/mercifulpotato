You don&#x27;t burn resources in efforts that exist just to harm your competitor. You get all of the economies of scale of sharing information, expertise, and technology.<p>But competition <i>incentivizes</i> greater efficiency. A monoculture can stagnate because there is less risk from failure, less urgency to grow and improve.<p>I think the point of maximum efficiency is somewhere in the middle where there&#x27;s enough scale that you don&#x27;t have the economic equivalent of millions of subsistance farmers each using hand tools to hoe their own patch, but where there are enough independent players to create some urgency and make regulatory capture harder.<p>The hard part is that there is no stable equilibrium near that regionn of efficiency. Businesses naturally consolidate and form cabals and capture regulation, so you have to constantly push against that.')
