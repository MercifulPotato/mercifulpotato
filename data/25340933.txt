Nobody with a conscience should recommend closed systems with less and less options for us consumers. The biggest advantage that AMD and Intel have over ARM is the software support they have and that means more freedom and choice for us than any similar ARM system. I&#x27;ve said it before - I bought an Intel Mac only because it gave me the option to not be trapped in Apple&#x27;s clutches. And I certainly won&#x27;t buy an Apple computer anymore unless I know for sure that it doesn&#x27;t restricting my computing freedom anymore. (But there is no indication to that as Big Sur shows, Apple has tightened its control on macOS by preventing application firewalls from blocking Apple apps - an indication of how it further moves to turn macOS to a closed system like the ios.)<p>And it is precisely for this reason that I don&#x27;t see Intel or AMD dying out anytime soon.')
