This is why out-of-platform fame is such an important way to discover people there. The platform itself offers few and weak tools to discover interesting feeds to follow. Basically you might notice someone&#x27;s interesting reply in a random thread, and want to check the user&#x27;s feed.<p>Facebook is great at discovering people I might already know. Maybe it&#x27;s important to reunite with old friends, etc, but it&#x27;s not really important to me. Facebook does a seriously better job presenting communities I may be interested in; there I could encounter interesting people. It also helpfully shows posts <i>liked</i> by people I follow, which is the best form of curated discovery I&#x27;ve encountered so far.<p>Personally back in the day I joined Google Plus (remember that social network?) mostly because Linus Torvalds and Rob Pike were already there, and wrote something interesting. So I think having luminaries on your network is helpful. Having one&#x27;s friends is also helpful;  often a loose cluster of friends migrates to your platform because it helps them communicate the way they prefer.')
