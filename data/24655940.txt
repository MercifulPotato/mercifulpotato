The house breakers are sized for the wires in the wall, not the device plugged in.  Those should have their own internal fuses to protect themselves.<p>Most lamp cords are only sized 100ish Watts or ~ 1A with the bulb being the only fuse.  If these somehow pulled 15A for any amount of time the wire would quickly get smoking hot but you still plug them into a 15A plug.<p>Devices are supposed to protect themselves. Most 15A devices will cause fires if they actually pull 15A for any amount of time.  If you try to use a a small extension cord on your space heater, you will soon be smelling burnt plastic while never getting over 15A draw. That is part of why these are such a fire hazard.<p>Alos in the US a 20A socket is designed to allow a 15A plug to work in it, But not the opposite way as that would cause issues in the wall.')
