Though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely like that today, we can&#x27;t say there isn&#x27;t some of that going on.<p>Literally Emamnuel Macron and Angela Merkel have spoken out about the arbitrary &#x27;banning&#x27; of groups and individuals, and because there is an &#x27;imminent consideration over here in the US&#x27; doesn&#x27;t abnegate our broader concerns about arbitrary banning.<p>The EU will likely be acting on it.<p>Banning the KKK is not something anyone is worried about.<p>Banning some app because we don&#x27;t like the extent to which they have moderated their discussions, is a much more slippery slope. Especially in light of other institutions that don&#x27;t moderate very well either.<p>If the case could rationally be made that FB and Twitter are in the end, equally problematic in their moderation ... then it&#x27;s likely they would not get banned from various places - they have money, power, influence and possibly friendly relations with other platforms.<p>It&#x27;s a dangerous precedent and the EU leaders are essentially correct to speak out and even more so to act.')
