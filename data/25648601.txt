The old editor was morally obsolete.<p>It is like driving Tesla and complaining that the charging infrastructure is not as good as it could be yet. Then wait some years, but you know that everyone will want to switch eventually.<p>I really like how Gutenberg functions and it certainly was the right call to make and it proved to me that they are not stuck in the past. If they hadn&#x27;t implemented it, they would probably start losing a lot more users to other platforms with more modern tools.')
