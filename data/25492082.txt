Item(by='axiolite', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608524185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490958, text='&gt; Both MPEG-1&#x2F;2 were unsuited for streaming as they didn&#x27;t support variable frame rates and handled low dial-up bitrates poorly at best<p>Nonsense.  Variable frame rate is nothing but a very minor bandwidth saver. MPEG-1&#x2F;2 have a tremendous amount in common with MPEG-4 ASP video and can perform almost as well in most scenarios you can draw up.  MPEG-1&#x2F;2 were mostly hobbled by the use of old, basic encoding hardware and the constrained parameters commonly used (GOP sizes of 12-15) to be compatible with old, basic decoding hardware.  Even today you can use ffmpeg to encode MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 (ASP) video from the same inputs using the same parameters and see very close to equivalent quality at a given bitrate.  FFMpeg  unfortunately changes it&#x27;s defaults like resolution, GOP size, etc., to what it thinks you likely want, so you must watch and control for that.')
