Item(by='stevenwoo', descendants=None, kids=[25339159], score=None, time=1607381771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338074, text='The Walking Dead has a bicycle for I think two initial episodes but bicycles would run out of consumables (tires&#x2F;inner tubes&#x2F;chains&#x2F;cables) though it might be better situation than automobiles running out of non spoiled gasoline in a year once industrialized manufacturing stops. The rubber in tires&#x2F;tubes can rot&#x2F;degrade with uv exposure and cables rust. Different use case from post apocalypse but I have to replace multiple chains&#x2F;cables&#x2F;tires per year on multiple bikes.')
