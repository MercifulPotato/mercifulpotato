White collar criminals dilapidate enormous amounts of money but street criminals could directly be violent towards whom they rob. (and being robbed, asides from the financial loss, it often leaves some psychological scars).<p>I see your point and it&#x27;s hard to imagine that a person stealing say, some food, because they&#x27;re starving may do time in prison and yet the author of a multimillion shenanigan goes scot-free, yes that&#x27;s not fair at all, but lowering the punishment for street crime  will make us average people even more miserable. The only rational thing to do is start punishing white crime seriously so it is a huge deterrent. Currently white criminals who get convicted stay in prisons whose conditions are better than the situation of a lot of struggling full time working Americans. I find that appalling')
