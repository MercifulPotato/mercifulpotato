We need some sort of e2e tests, and all e2e test frameworks are terrible in one way or another. Cypress is okay. I would prefer to only run it on production or the dev server and have alarms go off when they fail, but either the requirement is, or other developers have decided that it&#x27;s necessary to pass all e2e tests before a feature branch can be merged into the master branch.<p>And I get the reason for it; you don&#x27;t want to accidentally merge breaking changes. But it does make our build pipelines very slow and unreliable.<p>So are they worth it? I don&#x27;t know. If I had my way, we&#x27;d only run them on master, and not make it a requirement for feature branches to pass them. Because if you fix one tiny thing, you now have to wait 15 minutes <i>again</i> for the Cypress tests to run. I think they&#x27;d be better in a different setup than what we&#x27;re doing.')
