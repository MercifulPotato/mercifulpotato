One point on the page that I saw and liked is this:<p>&gt; Make it easy for consumers to buy every day, high-quality household goods that are made of the most sustainable materials and in an environmentally conscious way.<p>I think one of the aspects of &quot;high-quality&quot; goods that should be considered is durability and repairability. The end-of-life treatment of goods is a big problem in our society. I would encourage repairability to be a factor in considering what goods are carried. And beyond that, perhaps something could be done to encourage the repair or reclamation of old products that are no longer wanted, but still have value â€” though perhaps that would be out of the scope of this project.<p>Another aspect in which I think you could really improve on is in the area of returns. Where Amazon has been known to destroy, trash, or recycle perfectly good items that are returned, I think having some good, transparent practices here would an important aspect of meeting the goal of sustainability.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how things progress!')
