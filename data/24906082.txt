Item(by='thu2111', descendants=None, kids=[24907817], score=None, time=1603795157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897141, text='I think you need to re-read your own post.<p><i>you need to provide some very strong evidence &quot;they [the left] do not believe non-leftists should be allowed to exist.&quot;</i><p>You literally start by saying:<p><i>The legitimacy of the right in the U.S. is an open question</i><p>Perhaps you&#x27;re using an odd definition of legitimate, but generally for a political movement to be recognised as legitimate means it is allowed to take part in the political process, to be supported by people without suppression and so on. Terrorist groups are not politically legitimate, political parties with voters are. It gets tricky in the unusual cases where political parties and terror groups become closely related, as was seen with Sinn Fein and the IRA.<p>You yourself are now arguing that maybe the right isn&#x27;t legitimate because of a bog-standard list of leftist talking points, none of which are obvious or uncontroversial, for example what you call &quot;voter suppression&quot; is more obviously interpreted as enforcing existing laws that define who can vote; calling this &quot;suppression&quot; implies that no such laws do or should exist. But nobody is arguing that, are they?<p><i>But you need to provide some very strong evidence &quot;they [the left] do not believe non-leftists should be allowed to exist.&quot;</i><p>This thread is literally about Twitter shutting down a conservative newspaper that has reported news relevant to an election in which conservatives are competing. The NY Post and the story it reported no longer exists on Twitter. How much clearer a piece of evidence do you want?<p>And again - hold a mirror up and look at the reflection. Your post ends by saying that I should not be given &quot;equal footing in debate&quot; i.e. that people with those views should be (debate-wise) wiped out, not allowed to exist at all. You are the embodiment of what I&#x27;m talking about.')
