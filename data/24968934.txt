Anyone nearby just had to go to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quack.space" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quack.space</a> -- no funny long URLs.<p>I never monetized it, but it got quite a few users and I definitely could have started a path to monetization. I had ideas, such as incorporating location-based ads.<p>Unfortunately Chrome decided at one point it was malware for some reason. I have no idea why. On the backend I had a 1-hour time limit on files and didn&#x27;t store either files or location data beyond that. Chrome would throw up a malware warning whenever someone visited the page, and that was pretty much the end of the project.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating that they play gatekeepers to the internet, and they don&#x27;t even have a fair arbitration process.
