But what if we remove that constraint? What if increased salary means a higher quality of developer takes the position? Wouldn&#x27;t this mean higher productivity?<p>Bit of a cold scenario, but one way to game it out is hypothetically removing the current dev and then hiring someone better at double the pay.<p>Or, less unfair seeming, double the pay by hiring a second dev. That might not double productivity ... depending on the situation it might 1.5x it, or just as easily 4x it.')
