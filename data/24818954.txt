But where institutions and governments intervene, they can encourage competition, and so <i>improve</i> the state of the lesser player, in addition to potentially crippling that of the dominant one.<p>An example to which I could relate in terms of this line of thinking is plane vs. train travel. Were subsidies to flow towards the train rather than the plane, it would make it more affordable for me to the environmentally better thing. However, as things stand, I frequently find it hard <i>individually</i> to justify the often much higher cost AND longer duration of the train over the plane.')
