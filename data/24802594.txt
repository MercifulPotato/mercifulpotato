Unfortunately it will probably not run on FreeBSD ... and even if then my graphics card would not like it that much :)<p>I also read some good things about Divinity Original Sin, thanks for adding another small part to making me finally play this game sometime.<p>I will check other Zachtronics games as per your recommendation.<p>I played Age of Wonders about 17-18 years ago and I liked some of their concepts, I also liked Disciples 1 and 2 games. Also quite similar to Heroes of Might and Magic.<p>From the &#x27;Tycoons&#x27; I played Transport Tycoon and Airline Tycoon. Also liked the first Theme Part and Theme Hospital.<p>Also first Portal was really nice.<p>Regards.')
