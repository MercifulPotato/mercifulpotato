And FAIR seems to be missing that both earnings _and expenses growth_ have been growing very fast for those in cities.<p>Progressive taxation of someone earning $100k per year in San Francisco or NYC is hardly fair. At least prior to covid19 causing a crash in the rental market one could expect to pay ~$2500 a month to share a 2bedroom place. That&#x27;s spending 42% of take home pay to have roommates! Not to mention everything else costs more, a meal out, riding the bus, getting your bicycle repaired, clothing etc.<p>$400k per year is about what it takes to run a middle class family w&#x2F; 2 kids in such a city. -- They&#x27;re already paying $162,121 in taxes annually.<p>When we progressively tax those who actually have less than the median after CoL, we&#x27;re being unfair (IMO)')
