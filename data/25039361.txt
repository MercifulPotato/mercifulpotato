Violations of the honor system -- cheating, plagiarism, etc. could be reported by students or faculty and would be investigated by the Honor Board with disciplinary sanctions for violators.<p>One upside to this was unproctored exams -- although if cheating became widespread, the Honor Board would threaten to bring proctors back! The idea in general was that students were expected to become professional engineers, who are expected to have integrity enough when working in the field not to deliver&#x2F;sign off on stolen or slipshod work. Proctored exams keep everybody honest while the proctor is watching, but do not address the concerns of personal integrity when you might believe you can get away with cheating.')
