Hell, I doubt many US companies even meet this requirement (nb, that&#x27;s why a lot of smaller ecommerce stores don&#x27;t collect tax). That would be a minimum of $5,000,000 in yearly revenue from the US alone - more than enough to assume that they have at least one accountant on payroll to deal with this.')
