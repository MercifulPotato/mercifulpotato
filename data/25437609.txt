In some sense all the ads blend into one meta-ad, an implicit one, that teaches us what to value in life. I mean something of the same nature which used to be the &quot;picket fence suburb house, 2 kids and a dog&quot;, but is something else today.<p>Slavoj Zizek (controversial I know) has good observations about this, that ideology is precisely the whole framing, which is invisible from the inside. You don&#x27;t notice it as something &quot;sold to you&quot;, it&#x27;s deeper than that, it&#x27;s something that informs what you should strive for.<p>Ideas like &quot;if only you could afford XYZ, things would become so much more $positive_adjective&quot;. But not explicitly. Through implication, stories, association. That you need to work more, build a career, buy better things, or become free, express your inner authentic self through self-expression using this and that brand, this and that political slogan etc.<p>I anticipate that this is already too much of a cliche for some people, while for others it&#x27;s just a strange way to look at things...')
