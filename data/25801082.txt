It went from 372 to 12999.<p>For Berkshire I get a 13.96% ROI over the last 30 years. It went from 6750 to 343525.<p>So around 1.5% more for Buffet. Still a close call, when you think about that he is the symbol for a great investor and put his whole life into valuation research.<p>Even if the average investor could reproduce this performance ... do they have the funds to make it worthwhile?<p>The lesson might still be: Don&#x27;t try to valuate stocks. It is not worth the time.')
