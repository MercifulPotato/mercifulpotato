Nowadays we have tons of flexible and temporary contracts. These people have just about the right to do as they are told. If you have a contract for a fixed number of hours and unlimited duration that doesn&#x27;t mean the employer has to stick to the rules. It really doesn&#x27;t matter what laws or contracts there are. In some companies (hard to tell how many) it&#x27;s a game of looking what they can get away with. For a union there is prestige in court over [say] a 30 euro pay cut or a few unpaid hours.')
