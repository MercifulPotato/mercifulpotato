We really got into using it during the start of the current pandemic, but almost 100% for video meetings.<p>Teams&#x27; &quot;Teams&quot; feature isn&#x27;t a place to chat freely, it&#x27;s more like a Yammer (something like MS&#x27;s workplace Twitter) with its posts and comments. This works decently well to keep topic separate.<p>What&#x27;s weird to me is that that feature is entirely separate from &quot;chats&quot;, which is entirely separate from &quot;calls&quot; (which I&#x27;ve only had to open to answer a missed call; why not put it into the chat?).<p>Since a major use of Teams are meetings via calendar events it&#x27;d be great to be able to see all my events within Teams ... but nope, got to start up the Outlook app for that.<p>Integration is still a bit of a pain point with Teams (or MS stuff in general). What you can grant them is that at least most of the time thing at least kind of work (audio quality is fine, can always log in - looks like they hyper focused on removing blockers before anything else, which is a decent strategy. I just hope they&#x27;ll polish the UX a lot in the coming years. I&#x27;ve never used slack, but from what I&#x27;ve heard it seems to be like Teams has already eclipsed it a bit and I think it&#x27;s going to continue to do so.')
