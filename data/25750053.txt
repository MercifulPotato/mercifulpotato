I also have its successor, T490s, which is much worse (e.g., no full ethernet port).<p>That being said, my T480s had to go into warranty aleady, three times total if you count the TB3 docking station (which to me counts as one system I use together all the time): the motherboard was fried on the T480s. And since everything is one block of silicon, they had to switch out the entire thing, except for the hard drive.<p>The TB3 dock gen1 is the single worst bit of technology I ever had the displeasure of owning and using. Next to countless incompatibilities and instabilities, it just died a sudden death on me recently. Still a couple months within the 3-year warranty.<p>That&#x27;s a serious engineering flaw on Lenovo&#x27;s side. A better manufacturer would&#x27;ve made sure it died outside of warranty. They&#x27;re really dropping the ball, you can tell by that.')
