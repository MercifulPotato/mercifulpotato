A DMV insider has disclosed to me that the DMV has made a formal request to a federal agency to rule if my Beetle constitutes a threat to national security based on what could happen if it got into the wrong hands.  This raises three questions in my mind: #1 Does this mean Iâ€™m the right hands?  #2 If someone with the name &quot;b_laden13&quot; is the highest eBay bidder for my Beetle can I refuse his offer even if he has the prestigious eBay Red Shooting Star feedback rating (the highest)?  #3 Would this affect my eBay rating?')
