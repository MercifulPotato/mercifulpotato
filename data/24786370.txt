Before it became a criticism of arguments &quot;A will lead to B and so on&quot; it was a term used to signify a &quot;slippery slope&quot;, that is, something that has the potential to snowball to something much worse.<p>The name as a &quot;criticism of the fallacy&quot; resulted from the term being used as an argument -- not the other way around.')
