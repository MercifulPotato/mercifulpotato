It deals exclusively with countries, and serves as the lender of last resort to nations denied by the private markets, or who want better rates in exchange for structural adjustment.<p>There are no &#x27;students&#x27; at the IMF, and their &#x27;colleagues&#x27; (e.g. the World Bank staff) similarly do not deal with the internal policies of first world nations.<p>Simply put, this isn&#x27;t a slippery slope to anywhere, its just a research paper.')
