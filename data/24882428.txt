Auditors trust <i>any</i> hash they see which is signed by a monitor. If they see two ledgers where one is not a subset of the other, they trust all the data in both ledgers. If this persists, they have cryptographic proof that the monitor is trying to not include some record it previously included.<p>Git does this. Each commit object has the hash of the parent commit objects. You can walk through a commit object and see what the ancestry is. If you push to a server, it can make sure that your new history includes all the old history, and similarly, if you pull from a server, you can do the same check.')
