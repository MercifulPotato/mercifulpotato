I&#x27;ve written only a little bit using GTK, starting over this past month, and it has been very pleasant. The real issue I have is not knowing what documentation to use, or being a bit confused by the tooling. The existing open source projects using GTK I&#x27;ve been poking at over the last month written using JavaScript, Python, or C are all pretty (relatively) easy to grok and start working on. I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more... FWIW- I do tend to learn by reading code; so for me, jumping into something totally foreign or unknown is pretty normal.<p>2.) I&#x27;d highly recommend trying Flutter+Dart for cross platform desktop applications. I&#x27;ve been writing my first, for about a month now, on Linux, and it has been fucking great mostly because it works. It uses Skia under the hood so rendering is fast and applications aren&#x27;t totally bloated. I can speak nothing to building Flutter projects for the mobile or web variants but it seems neat in theory.<p>I&#x27;d definitely prefer to not write Dart, but I also accepted long ago, when you want to write GUI you pretty much have to learn a new language. It&#x27;s close enough to JavaScript and&#x2F;or Java learning it is pretty much just figuring out &quot;WTF? Is X called?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s also a lot nicer, IMHO, than things like Electron because there&#x27;s an actually useful SDK [1]. Electron, like the web, will require to you DIY a lot of really boring shit like wiring up list views to only use&#x2F;reuse the displayed elements. Flutter, like most desktop GUI SDKs, brings a useful set of widgets to the table you can easily customize.<p>[1] No hate on Electron here; there&#x27;s zero fault to be had for the web SDKs lacking useful APIs for making web apps... but that&#x27;s a wholly different conversation I&#x27;d rather not have right meow.')
