You see they all operated off of a shared relay which died while I was leaving a toll booth during a bad rainfall in the summer.  Lucky for me the rain stopped 15min later and I had a soldering iron at my destination. (The solder did not hold and failed during the return trip but it was a nice day for the trip)')
