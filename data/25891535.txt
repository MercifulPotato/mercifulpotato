If you&#x27;re failure mode is &quot;there might be fatalities&quot; over &quot;the app crashes&quot;, this becomes really valuable.<p>Code quality is already quite nice, and metrics like e.g. MISRA are supported by many analyzers; but proving(!) the absence if various error classes can be handy as well.<p>(Disclaimer: I work on the binary analyses, not on the source code analyses; so my detail knowledge on that front is not too deep).<p>+1 for linting. If the code looks &quot;the same&quot; I find reviews much easier since I can focus in what it actually does (or fails to do), not on &quot;decoding&quot; it. Though nobody should freak out on minor variations.')
