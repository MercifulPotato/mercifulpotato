Item(by='chroma', descendants=None, kids=[25270738], score=None, time=1606859029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270038, text='&gt; Comparing oranges to oranges, if SARS-CoV-2 had spread in 1918, it&#x27;s likely COVID would have been a bigger killer than the Spanish Flu.<p>The lower bound on Spanish flu&#x27;s IFR is 3%. Covid&#x27;s IFR is around 1%, and almost all of that is in old and sick people. Spanish flu killed far more at far younger ages. Had covid hit a century ago, its IFR would likely be lower because those hit worst by the covid (the old and sick) would have already died of something else.<p>Again, Spanish flu infected 1&#x2F;3rd of the world and killed at least 1% of the world population. It was the last time in history that human population declined over a year. Even in 3rd world countries, covid can&#x27;t approach that level of lethality.')
