While the OPsâ€™ argument is technical in nature, a better comparison would be your frequent flyer number. You can register for a new frequent flyer relatively easily, but IDFA can be reset at will or turned off completely. Good luck turning off your SSN or any government issued ID.<p>Even store loyalty cards are not a good example as they link to your actual phone number in the US.')
