I think that PyMC4 will also. The Stan team wrote everything from scratch in C++ including their own autodiff code which many regard as quite a stretch in terms of long term maintenance. Since TFP executes on top of Tensorflow things like autodiff and many of the other performance concerns that take up so much Stan-dev time are already taken care of.')
