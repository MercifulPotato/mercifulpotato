(The other 10 percent being where it makes sense to build something more custom).<p>Reminds me of the classic HN post when Dropbox had just launched where the user exclaimed “this is just a mounted blah blah using subversion blah anyone can do it” (paraphrased)<p>That old Dropbox post summarizes this mindset quite well.<p>And if being practical with your head not in the clouds making sane business AND technical decisions is what the 90s were like, man I missed out.<p>I guess at the end of the day we’re arguing over where you draw the line regarding when to stop using excel and graduate to something different, a blurry line that at the end of the day is a judgement call.<p>Oh and for the record I wasn’t even arguing against or for this particular use case in this post - speaking more in general terms.')
