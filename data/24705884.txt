Political will has been a big problem; both parties have campaigned on comprehensive immigration reform, but nothing has materialized.  Corporations with political influence love the status quo as it allows them to import workers for similar or lower wages who can&#x27;t quit or do anything that would risk them losing their job without being sent home.')
