Couldn&#x27;t click a link without some cutesy little flash something-or-other popping up.<p>My memories may be tainted by time, but I&#x27;m hesitant to say that modern web apps have surpassed flash yet. A web browser simply isn&#x27;t up to the challenge of creating a nice interface for an app and I got the impression Flash&#x27;s tooling was a long way ahead of the game. But Flash stands as a soon-forgotten internet monument of closed source winning battles and open source winning wars.')
