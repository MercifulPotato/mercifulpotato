[1]<p>Good. This is fine.<p>So we strike various other non-sequitors from your original reply:<p>&gt; Not even attempts at communism have survived removing dynamic markets.<p>Free markets, profit making, private property, incorporation for making profit (by providing goods and services) are all entirely orthogonal to the very specific &#x27;debt instrument&#x27; of &quot;lending money at interest&quot;. Even the broad concept of &#x27;debt&#x27; itself is not limited to a specialized form of debt that involves usury.<p>The solution space of financilizing an economic system is not limited to interest bearing debt instruments. And to insist that any alternative is &quot;communism&quot; does not bear scrutiny.<p>&gt; Historically, even societies that disallowed usary still needed financiers - they would just hunt them down and kill them when it came time to pay the piper.<p>I assume you refer to the stormy relations between medieval European kings and their bankers. A gentle reminder that European history is not the entirety of human history. (Just as an aside, who besides the Templars got killed over defaulted debt?)<p>You mentioned &quot;markets&quot; also known as &quot;bazaars&quot;. Did you know that while European kings were allegedly killing their bankers there was an entire thriving civilization next door that disallowed interest bearing debt instruments?<p>-<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;3632489" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;3632489</a><p>There have been suggestions that usury was instrumental in the social dislocation that significantly contributed to the collapse of food supplies in Mesopotamia. (I can&#x27;t find the link atm). Regardless, it is an intriguing fact that the 3 Semitic religions that arose in succession in the same &quot;cradle of civilization&quot; after the demise of Mesopotamia and neighboring bronze age civilizations -- that is Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- all felt it necessary to put the injunction against usury in the proverbial mouth of God in primary scripture. Rather curious, don&#x27;t you think?')
