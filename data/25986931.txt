They’re T + 1 and heading towards real-time settlement.<p>For equities, however, there really aren’t many downsides to T + 2. At the same time, there are many advantages. On the balance, most people who have an idea about clearing are fine with T + 2, though it’s heading towards #\nT + 1.<p>As for market makers, we have similar evidence for market made markets being more stable in crisis than order book markets. Cryptos don’t need this. They have never marketed themselves as being stable, and don’t do anything that requires price stability.')
