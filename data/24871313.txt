So affirmative action was put in place, so non-Asians who performed worse academically got admitted over Asians who performed better. Even with this race-based discriminatory policy, about half of the student body consisted of Chinese-Americans and the percentage continued to increase.<p>Now, the SFUSD school board has voted to change the admissions process to a lottery. They have effectively made it clear that academic achievement has no merit. They are prioritizing racial identity over education, and even have the audacity to claim that anyone who opposes this decision is racist[2].<p>So, yes, politics has indeed gotten very extreme in academia.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;article&#x2F;Lowell-High-School-will-use-lottery-admission-15662977.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;article&#x2F;Lowell-High-Sc...</a>\n2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;article&#x2F;Chaos-and-a-hot-mic-moment-S-F-school-board-15645962.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;article&#x2F;Chaos-and-a-ho...</a>')
