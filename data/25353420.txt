It&#x27;s from a result that predates the paper, due to Fisher (using butterflies, not code bugs).<p>The actual guarantee from the result is not that the <i>number</i> of unobserved &quot;species&quot; is small, but that the <i>total population of all unobserved species</i> is small. If you go back to the birds example, then you could say something like &quot;at most 0.1% of all birds are from species that we haven&#x27;t identified&quot; but maybe those 0.1% of birds are from a million different species each with incredibly tiny populations. In the code bug example, the very rare species would be the bugs that are very unlikely to be found, i.e. it&#x27;s more about estimating how many more bugs you will find if you continue to analyze it than how many are really there.')
