Perhaps not &quot;normal people&quot;, but it is a Pro device. And bear in mind, due to the UMA, that 16GB is shared between GPU and CPU.<p>I have 74GB on my system (10GB of which is GPU) so I can run my dev env (Kubernetes, PGSQL, Visual Studio), data science, machine learning and do 6K video editing. But then, there&#x27;s also zero chance that I would consider doing this on a laptop.')
