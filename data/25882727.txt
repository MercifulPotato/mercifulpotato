It was expensive, slow and yielded very little benefit when the process is well controlled. An &#x27;out of box audit&#x27; on the shipping dock could catch rare problems in process. Then the issue could be traced back to the step that introduced the failure, and the process corrected. E.g. a change in a part vendor that sometimes didn&#x27;t meet spec could be caught very quickly before it got to (many) customer(s). And it&#x27;s cheap to do it this way.<p>Perhaps this computational model is useful if step-by-step testing is automated, cheap and quick.')
