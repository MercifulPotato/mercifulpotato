It will come back down.<p>Short squeezes are short, temporary events. Even with borrow fees in the range of 30-50% (per year), it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a short-term play. It&#x27;s not realistic to expect the general public to continue pouring money into Gamestop stock to keep the price propped up.<p>Keep in mind that shorts can also exit and re-enter their short positions with high frequency. Not all of the shorting activity is long-term shorting that started &lt;$10<p>And of course, the original Melvin Capital claims to have exited their original short position. WSB wants us to believe they&#x27;re lying, but I&#x27;m inclined to believe them.')
