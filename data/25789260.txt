That&#x27;s done by declaring a null hypothesis and the intended stats analysis to be done before doing the experiment and collecting the data, because otherwise you can just compare arbitrary things until you find that some of them are correlated in the set you have. There&#x27;s no numerical post-hoc analysis that would be able to prove that.')
