I don&#x27;t care what side of the fence you&#x27;re on when it comes to censorship - allowing corporations to wield power previously solely held by the government is a step in a dangerous direction.<p>What to do about it? This is very tricky. The best solution I have been able to think of, is inline with &quot;anti-discrimination&quot; laws that exist with hiring. Corporations should not be able to discriminate in terms of what information is spread via their platform. If the government can enforce that law when it comes to hiring (even if that restricts a private company&#x27;s &quot;freedom&quot;) then they can certainly do it for information.')
