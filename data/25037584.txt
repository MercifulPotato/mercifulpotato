Start at step 1 and talk us through it: what does the &quot;thousand ballot mail-in attack&quot; look like? Bear in mind voters are registered with ID and proof of address into every state&#x27;s voter rolls, states have records of when people die, and every election authority watches for duplicate votes; those are the table stakes mitigations you need to get past.
