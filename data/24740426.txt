Several years ago, I had a 5-series Ublox get a signal when, as a joke, I soldered a trimmed stub of paperclip to its antenna pin. No tuned patch antenna, no polarization sensitivity, no preamp, no SAW filter, just a piece of wire that I eyeballed to be roughly probably something like a quarter-wave at 1.5GHz. Ish.<p>It got a fix in about 3 minutes, indoors, on a workbench, under 2 shelves of equipment and parts, in a part of a building with a double roof.<p>And that was the 5th generation chipset. We&#x27;re on the 9th now, and they&#x27;re much, much, much more sensitive.<p>All the habits and assumptions I learned with my 2002-era Garmin eTrex no longer apply.')
