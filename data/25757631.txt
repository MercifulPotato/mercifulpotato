That&#x27;s it.<p>And it applies to you and me and Hacker News and fuckfacebook.pro and Twitter and your github repo, your favorite twitch channel and any other internet user or resource when more than one person can share bits.<p>If there was no section 230, it would <i>destroy</i> free speech on the Internet.<p>Let&#x27;s take HackerNews as an example.  Without Section 230, if the owners of HackerNews continued to allow up&#x2F;downvotes&#x2F;flags, they would be liable to be sued for <i>any</i> content they did not delete that <i>anyone</i> chose to sue over.<p>Given that they almost certainly can&#x27;t afford that sort of liability, they would have three choices:<p>1. Do not allow <i>any</i> third-party content (user submissions, user comments), which would pretty much defeat the whole purpose of the site except as a place to drop PR pieces for YC companies;<p>2.  Do not perform <i>any</i> moderation at all.  Which would include spam, porn and all other manner of ridiculous, offensive and&#x2F;or irrelevant material, or;<p>3.  Shut down the site.<p>And that would be true for all sites (including github repos, mailing lists, mastodon instances, most web sites, etc., etc., etc) except those with deep enough pockets to be able to fight the innumerable lawsuits.<p>Who would that be?  Facebook, Twitter and Google.  The very people you decry would be the only ones who could afford the liability in a world without Section 230.<p>That is, exactly, what you&#x27;re wrong about.')
