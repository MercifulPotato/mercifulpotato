Item(by='reificator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604702352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011748, text='&gt; <i>(a) you can&#x27;t go back to previous levels, you can only explore the current map</i><p>a. While this is common in roguelikes I&#x27;d <i>never</i> pick it out of a list of defining traits of a roguelike.  It&#x27;s like defining first person shooters by whether they have keys that open doors.  Sure it&#x27;s common but I&#x27;m not playing Doom to find red keycards, I&#x27;m playing to shoot things.  The keys just help direct the experience and there are plenty of mechanics that could fill that same gap.<p>&gt; <i>(b) you&#x27;re forced to progress to the next level on a timer</i><p>b. There is a timer that prevents you from <i>leaving</i> before it&#x27;s up (engine charging), and there is escalation of force the longer you stay in a sector (rebel controlled beacons) but neither of those design decisions strike me as incompatible with the roguelike formula.')
