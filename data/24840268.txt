Now they are so focused on that ad money (mostly from big corporations), that so many small businesses are getting squeezed out. Rather than helping small businesses grow, that keep taking parts of the market small businesses previously made some or all of there revenue from. And of course Google gets tax breaks that are not available to small businesses because they can do accounting tricks. It&#x27;s just not a level playing field anymore.')
