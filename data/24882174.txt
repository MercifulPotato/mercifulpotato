It&#x27;s still fair use, (and it would not be possible to have these events without someone first acquiring a digital copy for archival.) You&#x27;re arguing that they could broadcast the video with commentary but they can&#x27;t make (or take) a copy? This is prerequisite to the activity! And many of these publishers may no longer exist, as not everyone agrees these movies are classics.<p>Also section 117 of Copyright Act explicitly calls out the making of a copy for archival as an allowable exception.')
