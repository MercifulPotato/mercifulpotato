Item(by='xyzzy_plugh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602021953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702750, text='&gt; Blanket requiring additional pay for H-1Bs seems fine, but leaves startups in a difficult spot where they&#x27;re unable to bring in the same level of foreign talent that bigger companies are, as, of course these rules do not take into account equity based compensation.<p>That&#x27;s fine by me. For the vast majority of startups, the equity compensation should be considered worthless anyways.<p>&gt; As it stands, 4 out of 5 H-1B holders make more than average Americans.<p>The average American doesn&#x27;t work in a job for which an H-1B would even be permitted, so I&#x27;m not sure what this point means? I&#x27;d expect everyone in an H-1B position to be making more than the <i>average</i> American.<p>&gt; The process of bringing in H-1Bs is already so expensive, arduous and wasteful that companies aren&#x27;t going to be bringing in huge quantities of &quot;US replacement&quot; labor. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t if I were in charge of hiring.<p>It&#x27;s expensive, yes, but it&#x27;s still a very small amount compared to their overall compensation and benefits. If your entire staff is on visas maybe you&#x27;d have a bad time, sure, but otherwise it&#x27;s usually a drop in the bucket.<p>The real joke is that H-1B is still a lottery, and in the time it takes people to get theirs, they might reconsider living somewhere else, like Canada.')
