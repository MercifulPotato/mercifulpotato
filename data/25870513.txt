The general theory of relativity isn&#x27;t just some unmeasurable difference in the margins of the calculations. There are _real_ situations (e.g. near a black hole) where the predicted properties of relativity totally overwhelm the predicted movements under newtonian physics.<p>It&#x27;s not insane to think that there equally are not-yet-predicted situations in which FTL speed is possible, under conditions that have never been possible in the natural universe but are possible with human intervention.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe that humans are capable of achieving such situations, look simply at our creation of anti-matter despite ~essentially being unable to find~ rarely finding any in the natural universe.')
