Item(by='wwosik', descendants=None, kids=[24894100, 24895454], score=None, time=1603701991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892297, text='I don&#x27;t think I like it. I find it hard to quickly skim and find out what each of the elements is, since it can be anything.<p>The example amounts to:<p><pre><code>  function drawTriangle(left, top, right, color) {\n    drawLine(left, top, color);\n    drawLine(left, right, color);\n    drawLine(top, right, color);  \n  }\n\n  drawTriangle({ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 3, y: 3 }, { x: 6, y: 0 }, &quot;blue&quot; );\n  drawTriangle({ x: 6, y: 6 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 6, y: 16 }, &quot;purple&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nMaybe it&#x27;s a case of getting used to it, but with my version I can very quickly <i>ignore</i> parts of code, which are not relevant to the thing I&#x27;m looking for.')
