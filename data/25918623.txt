There is even evidence on its side.<p>But one reason for the downvotes may be that it might be too narrow-minded. For one thing, it completely neglects to consider the relative difficulty of treating symptoms versus being fully curative. Secondly, it half undermines itself by lumping vaccines into the same bucket as symptomatic treatment. Clearly the economic incentives for vaccine, versus symptom management, versus cure depends on the disease being treated.<p>Finally, while it carefully uses the word &quot;incentive&quot; instead of talking in black and whites, it doesn&#x27;t explain why &quot;big pharma&quot; makes cures at all. A lot of the the supporting material for &quot;pharma makes more money on symptom treatment&quot; references Gilead&#x27;s experience with Hep C. But the economics of how that drug would have worked was clear as day before Gilead spent resources of it. So why would Gilead have gone to market with a cure at all?')
