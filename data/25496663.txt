Also with a 1&quot; sensor but in a compact body.  Even without flexible lenses, I agree with all your points.  I make sure to bring it on trips where I expect to be taking lots of pictures.  The cellphone is great in the sense that I always have it on me, and the best camera is always the one you have.  But the comparative quality is not even close.<p>But, I mean, it better not be considering both were about the same price!')
