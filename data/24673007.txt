Most of my current work involves recursive data structures (trees&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;linked lists).<p>I don&#x27;t mind the callout that you need to use unsafe for recursive structures, but it would be useful to acknowledge that as part of the language design in the rust book.  As a beginner you can easily pick up a simple LeeCode problem to learn the syntax and accidentally pick an impossible problem.')
