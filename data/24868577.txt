What you&#x27;re describing here might be a good example of something that should be or continue to be regulated at the federal level, but keep in mind that we do have &quot;tax dodging&quot; scenarios to this day if you move to different states with different rules. (you can also apply this globally as well, tax havens, etc.)<p>Over time I&#x27;ve become more interested in the loose confederation of states and decentralization of power over consolidation of power at the hands of the federal government. I think the US has too large of a population with an increasing amount of differences to really effectively govern. If parents want to teach kids that the earth was created 6,000 years ago in their state, who am I to say otherwise? Vote with your feet and $$. If I don&#x27;t like how California handles businesses like Uber and Lyft, same thing. At least at the state level though you right now have some reasonable measure of involvement. I can email my state representative and actually get a response. My federal one? Not a chance.')
