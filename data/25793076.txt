From top of my head I could easily gather &gt; 30 things at my house with the plain old USB A connector (several flash drives, keyboards, mouses, Bluetooth and WiFi adapters, smart card reader, external hdd enclosures, a stack of old laptops, r-pi, headphones, routers, playstation, tv, car diagnostics cables and probably several other things I can&#x27;t remember). There are USB A connectors in all 3 cars in my family. And probably a dozen more devices with mini&#x2F;micro USB - dslr camera, couple of tablets and older phones, dashcams, thermal imaging camera, powerbank...<p>Meanwhile there are exactly 3 devices with usb-c ports - 2 phones and one of several laptops (which also has several usb a ports). The only regular use of USB C for me is charging my phone. Everything else is on USB A or micro USB.')
