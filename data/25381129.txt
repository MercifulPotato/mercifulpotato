Sure, you can download a gigabit per second, but your connection chokes when uploading a file like a video to YouTube or trying to share large documents over a private network (such as a remote-work VPN to your office LAN).<p>The slow upstream also makes it really hard for people to set up private networks between themselves, and the cable companies ALWAYS block port 80 and port 443.<p>Why? Because, for some reason, they don&#x27;t want people hosting web servers on their own computers. That just can&#x27;t be allowed, for some reason.<p>But why? Why can&#x27;t I have gigabit upstream on my connection, and why the fuck shouldn&#x27;t I be able to host a public web site from my own computer, on my own internet connection?<p>These policies and restrictions really hurt the idea of a free and decentralized internet. Just imagine how different things could be and what all people would use their internet connections for if this wasn&#x27;t the case...')
