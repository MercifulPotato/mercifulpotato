Item(by='ntsplnkv2', descendants=None, kids=[25233939], score=None, time=1606519140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232628, text='It didn&#x27;t come across as dishonest at all, but your post did.<p>&gt; The article implies that a number of the Black people who left did so because the compliance division was relocated and they didn&#x27;t want to relocate with it. It doesn&#x27;t say how many people&#x27;s decisions were influenced by annoying work crap that they interpreted as discrimination.<p>And mentions the one white person was allowed to stay remote. Pretty dishonest to leave that detail out, no?<p>&gt; This is a really dishonest article. It tries to lead one to believe things (e.g. that 15 Black people left Coinbase because they were belittled in meetings) without stating it outright or making a case for it. Just insinuation spun up from a few concrete situations that themselves are mostly vague or not obviously discrimination (the gun and drugs thing being the obvious exception).<p>After reading it it seems a lot left because of constant issues of discrimination - being told to be in meetings in front of cameras to pretend to be diverse, but being ignored in meetings of consequence. Being told to relocate, but applied unequally. Having meetings about BLM and a month later the boss says &quot;leave it at the door.&quot; The guns and drugs comment, the black inferiority comment, those are absolutely damning.<p>This is how racism&#x2F;discrimination thrive - by playing in the margins, doing things that aren&#x27;t provable (they never have an email that says &quot;we&#x27;re discriminating against you!&quot; so therefore it didn&#x27;t happen or other arguments of that type), giving bad performance reviews after complaints are made, etc. Much like saying &quot;oh it was a joke!&quot;<p>And finally the icing on the cake:<p>&gt; Ms. Sawyerr said she had talked with four other Black employees about bringing a discrimination lawsuit against Coinbase, but the others backed out after being offered hefty severance payments in exchange for confidentiality agreements.<p>These are multiple people&#x27;s experience with this company - and there are clearly others who were paid not to say anything.<p>The article clearly does what it set out to do - show the experiences of people who lived in what they believed to be a toxic work culture. I&#x27;m inclined to believe them.')
