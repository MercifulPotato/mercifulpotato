When hearing Americans talk or in American media its not &#x27;raw raw nationalism&#x27; its more like &#x27;the army is really good and you should always honer and support them even when shitty politicians give them shitty jobs&#x27;.<p>The amount of deference to veterans and how they are all heroes is not about nationalism or chauvinism, its about the genuine believe that everybody who served in the military has served the country. Saying anything against the military is often interpreted as a direct attack on veterans and soldiers. Giving out metal before ever sports match is not exactly normal in most of the Western world.<p>The people in the US have a incredible deference to military, they trust it more then almost anybody else. The military as a institution specifically, not the nation. This is true even for people who have no trust in the presidency, congress or literally any other federal institution. Consistently the military is the most trusted institution.<p>Even people who are not very nationalistic or chauvinistic almost universally support the military, are happy with or want to increase military spending. Decreasing military spending in US politics basically gets you labeled as a traitor and despite people voting for anti-war candidates, they don&#x27;t vote for &#x27;reduce military spending candidates&#x27;.<p>All this without people even having the slightest understanding of what the military does and why. This goes even for politicians, most couldn&#x27;t tell you the difference between Sunni and Shia or point out Afghanistan on a map. That of course doesn&#x27;t matter, all that matter is that we are supporting the bois, a couple 10s of billions for new &lt;thingding&gt; that help even 1 solider is worth the cost. Just never ever question why any of this is done in the first place, those boring details don&#x27;t matter.<p>Something actual military history could help people understand, but that is besides the point.')
