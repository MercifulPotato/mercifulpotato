But finding that section of the book as a kid was a real imagination kickstarter. Having it in there was just <i>fun</i>, even if the actual rule was clumsy and would’ve been better as a fleshed out supplement.<p>I really am a fan of 5e, and have been having a lot of fun running it. I wouldn’t go back to 3e (or AD&amp;D for that matter, which was a little bit before my time), but the kitchen sink approach in 3e had a kind of charm that I could see people missing in the new, more coherent material.')
