If, like me, you have the superpower of another language, which is spoken by a few millions so that enough websites exists in it, yet it is such a minuscule market compared to the popular languages you get to enjoy some of the remains of the older internet where search engines weren’t gamed as aggressively.<p>Though I’m sure things will get worse for these languages as well.<p>In a way, any ranking of value invites people to attack it constantly. The harder it is to attack it, the more value one gets from succeeding. Until the market incentives changes (and how could they? I would love to know), things will stay as bad as they are or worsen.')
