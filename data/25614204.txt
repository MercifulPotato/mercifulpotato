Ive always wanted to ask this to someone in the us. I am from India and here the government department that manages companies has rules put in where all companies necessarily put all directorships as public info. Same for an interesting idea. You cannot have more than two layers of companies. A bunch of people cannot form a company and then buy&#x2F;setup a subsidiary below it beyond 2 levels. Same for each human director lists all directorships in all companies.<p>What benefit does anonymity provide ? Its not like your phone&#x2F;address has to be made public. Just a name&#x2F;id. This transparent system is working here without any issues, why cant it work with you guys?')
