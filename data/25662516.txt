It&#x27;s faster to drive 20 miles in Cincinnati than to travel four miles from the Haight to SOMA in San Francisco. Sure, there is sometimes traffic in Cincinnati, but there just isn&#x27;t as much as the more densely populated cities. I think so much of the population lives further out near I-275, it doesn&#x27;t make as much sense to build public transportation there.')
