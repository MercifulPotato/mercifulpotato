The point was that between humans and chimps (our closest DNA relatives) we’re 99% same to them. So high order intelligence that gives rise to written language and tool building is somewhere in that 700MB of DNA code. And 1% of that (just 7MB) is responsible for creating the smartest intelligence we know (humans).<p>In that sense intelligence artchitecture isn’t very complicated. The uniformity of isocortex which we have the most relative to our brain size compared to any animal says we ought to replicate its behavior in a machine.<p>The isocortex&#x2F;neocortex is where the gold is. It’s very uniform when seen under microscopes. Brain cells from one region can be put in another region and they work just fine. All of ^ says intelligence is some recursive architecture of information processing. That’s why I’m optimistic we’ll crack it.')
