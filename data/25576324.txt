The cost was mostly paid using user data and advertising. As a matter of fact, the API is still free on smartphone ;). They just realized that it wasn&#x27;t worth it to get that data on the web and thus increased the cost to the true price. The fact that there was already some competition to Google Maps which was much more expensive tells a lot.<p>That&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s going to happen on the cloud though. You pay the real cost, they aren&#x27;t monetizing it from a side channel (though they may profit a tiny bit on the side by lowering their infrastructure cost, it&#x27;s not the goal and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they didn&#x27;t used their own cloud offering that much). The profit come from the price, not the user data.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea for them to increased theses prices, as competition exist&#x2F;can exist, and they would just hurt themselves on the long term.')
