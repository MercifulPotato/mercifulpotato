Item(by='yyyk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607445545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345830, text='Judging by the FAQ, there&#x27;s no commitment to &#x27;evolve new features&#x27; or even &#x27;receive fixes&#x27; in the licence. So the frying pan analogy is more accurate - one could end up paying again and again for no service at all.<p>While the FAQ says &#x27;Maintenance is included&#x27;, they phrase that as &#x27;access to the latest version&#x27; and &#x27;support&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t place any legal obligation on Qt to fix bugs.<p>Qt can leave Qt6 to rot, never update, and still get money from subscriptions. Or Qt could be busy with Qt7, and in order to receive said fixes one has to significantly invest and port the application.<p>Access to support means even less - they could automatically close all tickets and still techinically comply.')
