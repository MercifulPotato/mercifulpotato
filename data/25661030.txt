All we have is chrome creating standards by monopoly.<p>Maybe I have a older mindset aswell. My training in in Civil Engineering and I have my expectations for standards bodies set pretty high because of it.<p>The code is so high level now, going through algo and data structures I see the benefit of that fundamental knowledge, but also see that you can be a very valuable engineer to a company without it(thanks to the rich developer ecosystem for that)<p>If we think about the maturity of software like a biological ecosystem, maybe the zen garden built by past engineers has overgrown into a dense and varietal forrest. Im not sure if its bad or good, maybe there are more niches to move into.')
