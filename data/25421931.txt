Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=[25423719], score=None, time=1607973770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421059, text='&gt; with hardware that&#x27;s available today<p>I&#x27;m not sure the 5900x or 5950x qualify as &quot;available today&quot;. Orderable today for delivery in 2-3 months, maybe.<p>That said, I do agree, the 5900x looks to be about 15-20% faster on single&#x2F;few core tasks than the 3900x from benchmarks I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Also worth mentioning is that the M1 is one process node head of the 3900x&#x2F;5900x (TSMC 5nm vs TSMC 7nm). There&#x27;s a much slower rate of process shrinks these days, so I&#x27;d imagine 5nm will be available to AMD before Apple jumps to the next node.')
