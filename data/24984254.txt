By applying differential thrust on different propellers it executes commands from operator to tilt and rotate. If the computer fails, operator, even with a direct control of the propellers, will not be able to maintain a stable flight.<p>From aerodynamic standpoint planes are much easier to pilot (all but military, same story with computers for better maneuverability) since they are designed to be inherently stable. So if all power is lost and you still have control of aerodynamic surfaces, there is not problem to land a plane after planning for some tens or even hundreds of kilometers (depends on initial altitude). This is obviously not the case with quadropters, loss of a single propeller leads to complete loss of control.')
