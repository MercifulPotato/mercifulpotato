This will ensure you won&#x27;t get woken at odd hours but then the massive upfront cost is something most business won&#x27;t pay<p>You can sling code without tests and fix it in prod, hoping speed will help you find product market fit.<p>Pretty much everyone sits somewhere between the two.  This article just describes one point onthe spectrum where the author feels is best practise - but to be honest the trade offs vary across this spectrum.<p>Probably the right way to think of this is &quot;the total cost of making this software NASA level is 10X, and the revenue from such perfect working software would be 20X (with no loss due to downtime)<p>As such of you ask me to not code to NASA standards, I and my team will incur a personal cost of 5X in being woken up, stressful release days etc.<p>Therefore you will compensate me with payments of 5-10X.<p>This discussion is much easier with a Union involved')
