Allow access to third-party cookies, but shove garbage back at the server. Allow access to the camera and microphone but play a specified pre-recorded video back for both.<p>This helps get past websites that evilly require access to these permissions to function.<p>It also would help in the case of e.g. store websites that want your location permission to give you the closest store website, and in which I am okay with giving them a city-level accuracy (because I&#x27;d be entering the city name anyway in a manual search) but don&#x27;t want my exact coordinates going to them.')
