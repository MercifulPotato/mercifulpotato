However, since the &quot;flat&quot; redesign I have felt iOS is on a downhill slope. Apps are increasingly crashy, I even had a scare with the Google Authenticator last week. I can sacrifice some freedom and money for convenience and looks, but if one side keeps altering the deal I have to question whether the bargain is still worth it.')
