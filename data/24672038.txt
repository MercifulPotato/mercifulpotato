Assuming it&#x27;s always checked out for two weeks, that&#x27;s 26 readers a year who benefit, at a cost of less than $1 per reader per year.<p>But in a typical library, most books in the catalog are checked out infrequently.  It might not make financial sense to purchase those books outright.  But if a library can pay a licensing fee on a per-checkout basis, then it can expand its offerings.')
