A functional alcoholics dream, no smell, no bloat, fuck - no calories. Wish it wasnâ€™t addictive.<p>Definitely think this needs more exploration. Could we just make better drugs already. Give me the pill or vape, why must I drink 700 calories and smell like it? Oh, and could I buy it at the grocery store and not have to goto a doctor (dealer) too? Promise to be responsible.')
