The fifth dimension is supposed to be a very small circle. There are some experimental implications, but the circle is so small that we can&#x27;t detect them (it&#x27;s similar with string theories).<p>String theory tries to do the same thing with other forces; so it&#x27;s not clear whether there&#x27;s such a transformation.\nForces are technically simpler than embedding extra dimensions that there are no evidence for.')
