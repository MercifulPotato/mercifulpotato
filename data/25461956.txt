Of course with a substantial account you can ask any of them to match IBKR margin rates and they likely will.<p>I sell a lot of margin-secured put options for passive income, and having a 15% portfolio margin maintenance requirement gives me a lot of headroom -- not that I&#x27;d ever max it out, I just don&#x27;t want to be <i>anywhere</i> close. Further the margin impact of out of the money options is also calculated generously.<p>They also offer access to basically any product in any market anywhere in the world. I sell index futures options in the US for instance, but if you want to trade on Canadian, European, Australian or Asian exchanges, it&#x27;s just a button click away.<p>You can also practice tax-aware borrowing and use their debit card to make purchases against your margin, and also, they offer bill pay which works against your margin balance too. My personal economy involves holding a 6-month cash buffer in my bank account, and investing anything that comes in - and borrowing against it to pay bills. Then, I use the proceeds from my short-term options trades, and dividends from my longer-term positions, to pay them off.')
