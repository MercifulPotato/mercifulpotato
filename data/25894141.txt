It would be a dream come true if Indian law-makers start doing things in the public, allowing public to comment&#x2F;vet their ideas&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;plans on upcoming legislations.\nI&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re aware: currently the farmers in India&#x27;s capital are protesting against the farm acts the Govt. introduced.
