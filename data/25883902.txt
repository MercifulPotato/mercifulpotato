The paradox is asking &quot;if intelligent life is common, and intelligent species invented space travel billions of years ago, wouldn&#x27;t we have seen some evidence of them?&quot;<p>It seems like you may disagree with the premise that it&#x27;s likely we&#x27;d see evidence of them in any case. And that may be so. It&#x27;s completely reasonable to say the Fermi paradox is invalid, for this or many other reasons. I don&#x27;t think it was all that serious to begin with.<p>My objection isn&#x27;t to dismissing the question, it&#x27;s to the author presenting it as though it was fundamentally about human or Earth exceptionalism. I see no reason to assume that&#x27;s the case.<p>As an illustration, does it change the nature of the question to remove Earth entirely and ask &quot;given the age of the universe, etc., why haven&#x27;t we seen evidence of alien civilizations visiting Mars? Or Titan? Or Kepler-16b?&quot; I think it&#x27;s the same paradox, it&#x27;s just harder to make the point that way, since we&#x27;ve never been there ourselves. Asking it about Earth doesn&#x27;t necessarily presume Earth is special, as the linked article suggests.')
