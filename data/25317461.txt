I made a decision to stop smoking and switched to using a vaporizer. That satisfied the oral fixation and I felt better, physically, rather quickly. I then tapered off the nicotine (pretty quickly, compared to most people).  Within a few months I was using zero nicotine mixes. After that, the next step was to limit it to home and bars, still with no nicotine. That was seven or eight years ago. I&#x27;ve had two cigarettes since and both tasted abysmal. No interest any more. My vaporizer hasn&#x27;t left my desk in years. Occasionally I&#x27;ll puff on it when I&#x27;m really stressed but it&#x27;s a placebo and a habit of over decade of smoking. Changing rituals and eventually getting rid of all the nicotine was my path to success.')
