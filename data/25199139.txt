I hope you don&#x27;t mind if I quibble with them a little.<p>Firstly, I tried to fact check your &quot;~49 Gigatons&quot; figure and came up with this quote: &quot;Emissions are currently expected to reach 42.4 gigatons annually in 2020, rise to an estimated 49.4 gigatons per year in 2030&quot; from [0].<p>Your figure of &quot;$250&#x2F;Ton of C02 Captured and Sequestered&quot; is probably correct, but it&#x27;s worth comparing that to this statement: &quot;Table 1 summarizes the projected energy and dollar costs of air capture processes that have appeared in recently published technical analyses. The projected dollar costs are in the range of $100–$200∕tCO2&quot; from a research paper [1] which may not include sequestration costs.<p>To present an optimistic scenario then, suppose that by 2030 we managed to reduce annual CO2 emissions to 40 gigatons and could capture and sequester CO2 at $100 per ton.  That would make the cost $4 trillion per year.  For comparison, the IMF projected Gross World Product to be $90 trillion in 2020, according to [2].  We would expect GWP to grow over the course of this decade, so the annual investment starting in 2030 should be less than 4.4%, although I wouldn&#x27;t like to say what sort of effect that would have on the global economy, even if there were somehow a global agreement to spend that kind of money.<p>In conclusion, I agree with your assessment, and only ask that you take extra care to use the letter &quot;O&quot; in &quot;CO2&quot; and not the digit &quot;0&quot;.  It&#x27;s not so important on a discussion site, but your linked article looks much less convincing due to that typo appearing eight times.  (For extra presentational value, you could use a subscript character, i.e. &quot;CO₂&quot;).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalcitizen.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;content&#x2F;what-does-a-carbon-budget-mean&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalcitizen.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;content&#x2F;what-does-a-carbon-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sequestration.mit.edu&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1012253108full.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sequestration.mit.edu&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1012253108full.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;statisticstimes.com&#x2F;economy&#x2F;gross-world-product.php" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;statisticstimes.com&#x2F;economy&#x2F;gross-world-product.php</a>')
