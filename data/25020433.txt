YC has already started chipping away but cannot break this ridiculous standard on its own.<p>many elements of the VC-founder dynamic are broken today. it will be interesting to see which investors risk crafting a more balanced  environment for startups. the downside is alienating their peers and jeopardizing peer-based deal flow, but the upside is attracting more founders and generating goodwill.')
