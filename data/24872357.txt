This seems like a tool and thus doesn&#x27;y need a login.<p>Which makes me ask... what&#x27;s the pricing? When I do &quot;sign up&quot; do I only get one video? one minute? a limit of some type?<p>Also, what&#x27;s the legal? Do you own the video? Can I monetize it?<p>An FAQ can probably help answer the above.')
