In theory they have the range of ICBMs, though can only attack coastal targets and are obviously orders of magnitude slower.  They&#x27;ve spent a whole hell of a lot of money on these, including building the world&#x27;s longest submarine (the K-329 Belgorod, which seems to be an Oscar-II given the stretch limo treatment) to carry these torpedoes.  They may also be planning on creating &#x27;silos&#x27; for these torpedoes on the floor of the Arctic Ocean.')
