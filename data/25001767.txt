I often find myself putting in placeholder names for variables&#x2F;functions because I&#x27;m really not sure what it&#x27;s going to encompass by the time everything is finished. \n IDE refactoring makes it easy to clean up names after spending some time with the feature and better understanding what the scope of each function is going to be.<p>It&#x27;s great to pause and come up with meaningful names and I agree more developers should do it, but refactoring is a normal part of coding and I&#x27;d rather have an easy way of renaming things as the code evolves.')
