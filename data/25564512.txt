The tech seems to be there. Ocr, shape recognition, pen technology is all there. New devices increasingly have the ML hardware to support it.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it here yet?

I can see it, but it just isn&#x27;t there yet.<p>p.s: I have spent days finding a good app. (onenote is my begrudging compromise for now). Send me a good one if you can.
