It serves a specific purpose (and shoehorning it into email isn&#x27;t that) and for that purpose I (and other competent professionals) still use and trust it for that purpose.<p>I am also excited about new tools (like age, which will also never have hundreds of millions of users) along these lines.<p>I think some similar criticisms could be levied against, say, Adobe Premiere, even though it has an order of magnitude or two more users than PGP (although perhaps not when you consider every apt user in Debian and Debianlikes such as Ubuntu).  Industrial software for trained professionals has a lot of sharp corners and footguns. Not all software is (or should be) Instagram.<p>He&#x27;s 100% right that GPG email sucks, though. Don&#x27;t use GPG for email except when attaching secrets.')
