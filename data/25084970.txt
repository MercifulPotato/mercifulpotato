Also, yeah, things like choosing to eat, just choose not to go get food and you&#x27;re good, right?<p>Jeez, what a short-sighted, selfish, impatient, and entitled point of view. I&#x27;m guessing you haven&#x27;t spent much time living anywhere that&#x27;s actually dangerous?<p>A large percentage of people in the world have live their lives cautiously, because where they live is really dangerous. There are places that have to deal with ebola still, there are places where not being deferential to the right person means that you and your family are hunted and killed. Most of these places are what we call third-world countries, and being in danger, having your family in danger, is a staple of living in them. If they&#x27;ve been dangerous for a long time, then ALL of the people living there live cautiously, defensively, because everyone who wasn&#x27;t genetically predisposed to this behavior was killed by their environment long ago.<p>In most first world countries, and the USA in particular, a vast majority of the population has no clue what it&#x27;s like to live under these types of conditions, where you actually have to try to take steps to protect yourself. Until this year, the most danger the average American was in was during our morning commutes, where being actively defensive means &quot;Try not to look at your phone too much while driving&quot;. Now we&#x27;re just experiencing a taste of how it is to live in many of the third world countries.<p>What is absolutely insane though, is not that we are too stupid to figure out how to live cautiously and defensively (we&#x27;re not used to having this burden, so it&#x27;s somewhat understandable that we don&#x27;t know how to handle it), it&#x27;s that even when we&#x27;re told common sense procedures to act defensively, we actively fight against them. Taking precautions that are stupid simple, that are common sense, that are EASY, and that will preserve our lives, the lives of our family and friends, and the lives in our communities, we reject those because we can&#x27;t get past the delusional narcissism that we should never have to sacrifice anything.<p>And that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve had 240 thousand deaths due to covid since March. Cause we, as a nation, responded as entitled yuppy assholes, instead of taking some basic, easy, mature steps to protect ourselves.')
