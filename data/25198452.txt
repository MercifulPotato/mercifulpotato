If your recipient is a business person, you should communicate in business terms. No-one really cares what things you are trying out, issues you have et.c. - only the consequences for them &#x2F; the business. It may seem like this is just two sides of the same coin (and it is) - but which side you approach it from makes a massive differences in the communication.<p>A startup cares about business traction, functionality that helps existing or getting new customers. So a status update should be on how one is now closer to (or unexpectedly further away from) that.\nNote also that in a startup vision of the product, usage scenarios, user groups and business model often tend to evolve over time. You must make sure that you are up to date with the latest learnings, and that your development plans are inline with these.\nIf you don&#x27;t make sure to do this, your work may be perceived as (and&#x2F;or be) irrelevant to the company success.')
