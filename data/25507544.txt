I live in New Jersey where apartments cost no less than $1,200 in my area.<p>Simple calculation says I saved about $40,000 so far while living in a better environment and space. Buying a house in this area costs no less than $200,000 and land taxes come out to ~$500&#x2F;month anyway.<p>I highly recommend mobile home living for just-married couples.<p>ps - our community does not allow people to rent their homes out, so everyone who lives here takes care of the property well. I suspect this may be an important feature for better quality of life in such a community. And there are no trailers -- all homes are stationary.')
