Some things are knowable in principle but not in practice because of technological or economic constraints, like whether or not there are life-supporting planets in the Andromeda galaxy.  But <i>in principle</i>, if you could build a big enough telescope, you could know.  Quantum experiments are not predictable <i>even in principle</i>.  Even with arbitrarily advanced technology and unlimited resources, you can never know the outcome of a quantum experiment (assuming QM is correct, of course).  That is an operational <i>definition</i> of the idea that the information required to predict a quantum experiment does not exist in our universe.')
