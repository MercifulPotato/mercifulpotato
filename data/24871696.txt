The numbers of voters who vote flippantly, or vote on false premises, have never been quantified, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they were significant given the amount of times the electorate has directly voted against their own self interest (like banning subway construction in LA from the 90s to the 2010s, and paying for it now with higher construction costs three decades later).')
