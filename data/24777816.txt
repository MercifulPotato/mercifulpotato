Because SF (until recently) has disproportionately been a sellers market, leases are written such that they benefit the landlord.<p>Right, which is why it makes sense that landlords would allow tenants to break leases for a fee.  The landlord gets two&#x2F;three months of rent from the current tenant, plus they have a waiting list of people and will have the unit moved into within a few days paying higher rent.<p>So the benefits to the landlord is more money.  They get to legally double-charge for rent and raise rent prices on an accelerated schedule at the cost of one or two days of lost occupancy.<p>The only time this doesn&#x27;t benefit the landlords is when rent prices collapse.  But considering SF rent prices have been inflating at a double digit annual clip for a decade or more now, I doubt any landlord considered a drop in rent prices to be possible.')
