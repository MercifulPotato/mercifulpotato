Hopefully with this event making the news, doctors at least in the same specialty will hear about it and do something.  Unencrypted offline records physically secured in the office building seems more than adaquate in all but the most exceptional scenarios though.  Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be good enough for doctors of high-value targets (celebrities, politicians, etc.)  Burglars targetting medical records seems uncommon.<p>Harsh fines are probably the best way to make doctors care though.  If they know they risk financial ruin for not securing their records, they&#x27;ll have a strong personal incentive to remediate their ignorance.')
