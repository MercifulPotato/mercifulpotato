Generally speaking BlobBackup will create slightly more files in your destination than your original source.<p>With object storage like s3, b2, azure, wasabi etc, this just isn&#x27;t a problem since you can effectively have as many objects in one &quot;directory&quot; as you want.<p>With local, nas or hard drive storage, you&#x27;d be limited by the number of files per directory the file system allows (4.2 billion for NTFS for example). So you&#x27;re probably fine here too.<p>Google drive (which isn&#x27;t recommended for large backups with BlobBackup) has much stricter restrictions on files per directory. So really it depends on the backend but for most use cases it isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>BlobBackup has been tested on millions of files backed up to NTFS  and object storage yes.')
