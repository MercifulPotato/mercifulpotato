Even with publishing full page ads. It is just a big waste of money. I have had so many of my relatives and friends move to Signal already. Big Tech companies haven&#x27;t yet understood Indian psyche. If we make a move it will be en masse. So never antagonise Indians. Just see what happened to Tik Tok.
