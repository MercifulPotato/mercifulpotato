Item(by='stevenwoo', descendants=None, kids=[25347893], score=None, time=1607386850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339159, text='My bicycle tires cost almost as much as car tires and last 20-30 times less miles than car tires (2000-3000 versus 60000 or so). Run of the mill bicycles rely pretty heavily on industrialized production. It&#x27;s all speculative but regularly used bicycles would be fairly useless after a few years due to wear and tear and lack of replacement parts - the specialized parts could not be cobbled together from scrap (unless one lived in Japan next to an old Shimano factory or Italy next to Campagnolo). If only used sparingly, yes, then the bicycles would last a long time unlike gasoline, but if one has to restrict one&#x27;s use, might as well go back to using horses.')
