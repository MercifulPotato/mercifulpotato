Services like GoDaddy already try to do this, but in hiding functionality or renaming key terms to dumb them down, they confuse things further for anyone using mainstream materials to reference or learn from. TTL is often dumbed down to an &quot;auto&quot; setting - fair enough, but beyond that how much more can you simplify within the existing technology frameworks? (Admittedly all the verification and security records are getting a bit out of hand, but they aren&#x27;t compulsory.)<p>Anecdata: I had a colleague think they were helping with something because they saw &quot;domain forwarding&quot; turned off for a domain that was used as a secondary domain for an existing site. It was all working absolutely fine, using server config and DNS. They turned it on and behind the scenes the &quot;friendly&quot;, &quot;easy to use&quot; provider removed the custom nameservers and cleared the DNS records. When I initially turned the forwarding off again, it added some records to forward to its domain parking service. All of this was obscured and presumably done in the name of helping users.')
