Invest some of the money in US stock, and some in stocks in other parts of the world: China, Vietnam etc. Put 1% of that in Bitcoin&#x2F;other cryptos.<p>Wait until it&#x27;s 2 or 3m, then live frugally. There is no clear indication on the future value of the dollar or other currencies for that matter.<p>Save and spend as little as possible. If you don&#x27;t have a kids and wife, don&#x27;t spend on useless things. You don&#x27;t have any responsibilities so just be happy.')
