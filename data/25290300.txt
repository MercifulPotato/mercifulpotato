A lot of people died of covid yesterday, and a lot of people will die of covid today, but not 3,100 people.<p>We have a significant number of people in this country (including the person you replied to) who sincerely believe that covid is overblown. Obviously incorrect statements like &quot;3100 people died in a single day&quot; reinforce those beliefs and are counterproductive.')
