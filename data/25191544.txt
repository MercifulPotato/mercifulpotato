Item(by='rekado', descendants=None, kids=[25191614], score=None, time=1606164121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191466, text='&gt; Guix started as a fork of Nix<p>This is repeated often but it is an unfortunate misunderstanding.  One self-contained component of Nix was used unaltered in Guix: the nix-daemon.  <i>Everything</i> else but the daemon (and that&#x27;s a <i>lot</i>) is a completely independent implementation of the same principles that were first demonstrated in Nix: functional package management.<p>Why reuse the daemon?  Because it could be done.  The daemon takes very low level build instructions (&quot;derivations&quot;) and arranges for them to be executed in an isolated environment.  In Guix derivations are generated through compilation of higher level concepts that as such have no correspondence in Nix.<p>The common ground is the format of the derivation, which has only been modified occasionally to better suit our differing needs.')
