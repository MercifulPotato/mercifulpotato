Depending on your scene this may or may not be an issue.  Some engines will do this behind the scenes or use indirect rendering (which gives the speed benefit of combining meshes without you manually combining).<p>You should also be careful of monolithic Uber shaders especially if they branch as shader divergence can really kill gpu performance on some hardware.\nThere is no one solution, just the one that best fits your usecase, hardware and coding time budget.')
