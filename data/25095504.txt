In the context of your background - &quot;Having worked on building up a lot of infrastructure stuff from the ground up,&quot; it&#x27;s important that you chose numbers that are level appropriate for someone of your capabilities. if the feedback was &quot; how accurately can &quot;decreased load time by 75%&quot; actually capture the scope of your work if it&#x27;s a 5 minute change&quot;, then that indicates that you may have been showing numbers that weren&#x27;t truly indicative of your skills and talents.<p>And I don&#x27;t agree that picking up tasks that are low impact IRL will help.  Ultimately, hiring managers aren&#x27;t easy to fool, and low-impact metrics make a small impact on resume readers.')
