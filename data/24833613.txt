Matrix IDs themselves are federated just like email addresses (@cyphar:cyphar.com is mine, and it&#x27;s hosted on my own homeserver at cyphar.com).<p>If you don&#x27;t register your phone number or email address (which last I checked is not part of the default account creation flow) then it really makes no difference. I agree they should be federated (and they have been working on that among many other things) but it&#x27;s not like every user&#x27;s identity is centralised.')
