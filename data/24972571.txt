The company was founded by a group of people who are passionate about building video games and supporting both each other and the community.<p>A few highlights of roles:<p>Junior Systems Administrator: We are in the process of completely rebuilding our infrastructure. New hardware, new domain controllers, all the things. It is a great time to get in and gets hands on experience building lots of this stuff from the ground up. This will involve helpdesk support, but our userbase is generally more technical so there will be lots of hands on server admin work as well.<p>Frontend Web Developer: We are hiring our first in house web developer. Initial work will involve building some themes for WordPress and our new forums. The hope is to find someone that can help us figure out where we should be spending our effort with web development, potentially grow the web team, and help build frontends for new internal tools.<p>DevOps Engineer: We are growing the number of tools we build and deploy internally and we are looking for someone to help build a platform that our developers can deploy to easily. The focus of this role is making the developers lives easier. That includes building new tools, working on CI pipelines, and also educating game devs on devops practices.<p>A note regarding COVID: Our desire is to have people work from the office in person. During COVID everyone is working remote. Instead of going month to month telling everyone we don&#x27;t know when the office will open we have said the office will not open any earlier than September 2021. Until then everyone is working remote. So remote to start will be a thing, but it will be expected that you are working from the office when we do open back up.<p>For a full listing of positions and job descriptions see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.offworldindustries.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.offworldindustries.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a><p>If you apply online please note &quot;regnerba on Hacker News&quot; as your referral (simply so we know how well this posting does).')
