I think the gold standard would have been for Fortnite to simply increase the prices of IAP purchases on iOS devices to pass the 30% on to consumers who choose to use iOS IAP.<p>I can&#x27;t seem to find a rule that says pricing must be the same for IAP as elsewhere in current guidelines:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;review&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;#subscriptions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;review&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;#sub...</a><p>That seems like the best of both worlds in the sense that as a user you can choose to purchase in iOS for convenience or go to Fortnite elsewhere and purchase there for cheaper.  This move just seems like Epic wanted to pick a fight, they weren&#x27;t actually interested in offsetting the Apple cut.')
