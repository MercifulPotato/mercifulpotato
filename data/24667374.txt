At least that&#x27;s my impression -- though US courts, especially in states that have UCITA or similar, are more likely to consider this a contract.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve found two jurisdictions, and both of them require proof of actual economic harm for standing (among many other things). I&#x27;ll wait for more specific details about Facebook&#x27;s approache.....')
