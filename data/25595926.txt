Item(by='SamReidHughes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609441579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594975, text='&gt; There&#x27;s a pop theory &#x2F; crackpot idea that men tend to be on average &quot;dumber&quot; than women, but with a higher standard distribution, so they will have more &quot;geniuses&quot;.<p>The current understanding is that the average is generally similar, and males have greater variability. So yes, vastly more male geniuses.  But men have larger brains for a reason, so it might be we&#x27;re biased against measuring anything men are better at.<p>&gt; If true, the disposable male theory might explain aspects of that<p>It doesn&#x27;t. The main reason is because female mammals have duplicate sex chromosomes, and the effects get combined together.  In some other kinds of animals (such as birds) females tend to have greater variability.  So it&#x27;s a haphazard consequence of some evolutionary split way back when.  (Who knows, maybe the causation of disposable males is there, but in the other direction.)')
