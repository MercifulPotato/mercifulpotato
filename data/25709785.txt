If adtech had to make do with opt-in, it would starve to death for lack of data because most people make do with the default option and—as you pointed out—most people don&#x27;t want to be stalked or to have their data rented out to every corporation that wants to send them an unsolicited sales pitch.<p>Also, opt-in is the advertising equivalent of self-reporting in polling. You&#x27;re not getting a representative sample of the population.')
