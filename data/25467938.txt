I was a serial startup entrepreneur who kept trying, wouldn&#x27;t give up and eventually got good at it and then was profitably acquired into a big public tech company. Initially, I didn&#x27;t especially like it and I also pretty much sucked at &quot;doing BigCo&quot; well. Fortunately, my acquirer was one of the better examples of the BigCo breed. Generally, well-run, ethical and at least trying to do the right thing. Despite this, I found the patterns that had worked for me as a tech startup founder, didn&#x27;t work nearly as well in the context of a tech BigCo. I say &quot;context&quot; because the actual activities my job entailed were remarkably similar but the &#x27;system&#x27; was quite different.<p>I decided it wasn&#x27;t really working and that they were probably going to figure out that my way of thinking wasn&#x27;t a good fit for their context and we&#x27;d part ways on good terms. Instead of just waiting around for this, I decided I would try to use my remaining time and &#x27;rope&#x27; to try to learn as much as I could about <i>why</i> my previously successful patterns didn&#x27;t work in this context. So, I essentially stopped trying to do what I was &#x27;supposed&#x27; to do and instead looked at the organization&#x27;s objectives behind my tasking - and try to actually help deliver what they really wanted. Technically, this could be considered insubordination but I tried to be as subtle about it as I could while still being effective. I figured I might get myself fired faster but instead, I was actually partially successful in getting &quot;good things&quot; happening. So, I doubled down on this approach and escalated. I got reprimanded by my direct manager (a very senior exec) for not following specific orders but no one was too upset because it was clear I was trying to act in the best interests of the company. Those of you with relevant experience can probably guess what happened next. I got promoted because leadership decided I was just &quot;difficult but getting stuff done&quot;. This led to nearly a decade of my constantly escalating my efforts to &quot;do the right thing&quot;, even if it wasn&#x27;t exactly in the order or approach I was instructed to take. I managed to continuing to deliver enough success (along with some failures in-between) to not get sacked. Eventually, I escalated my &quot;do the right thing&quot; so far, we did end up parting ways but it was mutual and they were very nice about it (by this time I&#x27;d pretty much told everyone around me what my approach was). I&#x27;m happy I stayed and did it this way. In the end, I worked my ass off, delivered good value for the company, made really good money and when we parted ways both the leadership and I felt the net of my service at the company had been a success.<p>In short, I think the OP could have possibly stayed around to figure out the &quot;meta&quot; game of that BigCo. Maybe a good mentor would have helped. Alternatively, maybe it was just a lousy company or a &#x27;broken&#x27; group within the company.')
