When I add up all the streaming services I pay for, it&#x27;s still lower than what I was paying for DirecTV, and there&#x27;s much better content now.<p>I also regularly rotate services. For example, Amazon Prime is how I&#x27;m getting my HBO. I&#x27;m ready to remove that channel for a few months until the shows I watch return. I&#x27;ve done that with Acorn (UK programming) and with Showtime.<p>Looking at the proliferation of silos (Peacock, AppleTV+, Disney, Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, etc.), it&#x27;s going to get harder to have a decent all-in-one place to go for content. But this is what a lot of cord cutters insisted that they wanted (&quot;Why do I have to pay for ESPN if I don&#x27;t watch it?&quot;). Turns out it might not be cheaper after all? That is unless you&#x27;re willing to put a little effort into rotating active services.')
