Item(by='abernard1', descendants=None, kids=[25677010], score=None, time=1610050854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676668, text='&gt; do you think they should be forced to sell items on their platform that they don&#x27;t want to sell?<p>Yes.  They&#x27;re not doing the selling, the merchant is.  Shopify sells software, not things.<p>Toyota doesn&#x27;t refuse to sell me cars because they don&#x27;t like where I might drive.  HP doesn&#x27;t refuse to sell me laptops because they don&#x27;t like what I might write on it.<p>Shopify&#x27;s actions are just as ludicrous as the two I just mentioned above.  The virtue signalling corporate nonsense (and that&#x27;s what this is) will eventually backfire')
