Item(by='stiray', descendants=None, kids=[25496855], score=None, time=1608568508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493346, text='I must say that this blog made me sad.<p>It is exactly due to such thinking code becomes bloated, full of frameworks, zillion of 3rd party libraries for something that could be implemented with bearable codebase by just having a little more experienced crew that is not afraid to &quot;just do it&quot;.<p>Yes, people described are hard to manage but this doesn&#x27;t mean that there is something wrong with them. It means that they need competent managers that they will respect (Oh and they are there - I had a PM once and we were late on project and people were working into the night, he came to the dev. team, pulled the code and started debugging the issues, testing,... It was not his job (anyway, quite frankly, how many PMs you know that are able to fully use&#x2F;test the product if you ignore the coding&#x2F;debugging part). But he never had any issues with engineers ever. This action echoed for a years and he had an endless respect from anyone technical around. But people like this are not found by looking at nice graphs of jira tickets and burndown charts)<p>As far as I am concerned the whole post comes down to: &quot;B people hire C people, C people hire D people,...&quot;. And if what you have are D people (not only engineering), you cant hire A people. They prove D people cant work with them. Or vice versa.<p>An advice:<p>Find company with A people. Ignore the rest. And they are there, just not advertised as aiblockchainnosqlserverlessiot (pun intended) companies.<p>George Bernard Shaw: “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”<p>So just be crazy and if you love to code, dont care for the money. It is not the money that makes you happy, it makes happy someone else. Find the company with the code and people that will make YOU happy. And dont crave for social respect from people who dont understand what you are doing by allowing them to drag you to their level and compete with you on &quot;I have a better car&quot; (or &quot;we make loads of money&quot;) basis. That is their play and you dont need to play along.')
