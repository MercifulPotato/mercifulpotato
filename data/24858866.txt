It was a mix of breathing from the bottom of your chest, strong posture with shoulders up &amp; a little back, not forcing your ribs up, but feeling them move out horizontally.<p>The biggest part for becoming a confident public speaker was the psychological side (aside from all the usual stuff about slowing down mentally). Becoming conscious of breathing for just a few seconds before starting works wonders, as does carefully timing awkward to produce sounds&#x2F;syllables on different parts of the breathing downstroke.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for 30yrs (i wrote 20 initially ... forgot i&#x27;m old :) now, slow breathing is the norm at the desk &amp; before speaking to an audience&#x2F;hosting meetings etc I still have to follow the same steps every time otherwise I start tripping over my tongue.')
