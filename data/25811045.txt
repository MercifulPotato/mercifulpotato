He&#x27;s not a bad interviewer, but having Jim Keller&#x27;s once in a blue moon interview done by someone who doesn&#x27;t even know what branch prediction is a loss.<p>I have no reason to believe he isn&#x27;t a good AI researcher, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to know much about programming - that a branch predictor that just predicts what happened last time next time gets it right about 80% of the time is pretty obvious if you imagine that 90% or more of instructions executed happen in loops.')
