Fortunately, this is the most common type of breakage or mess - one that only affects the developer locally, because we protect the master branch on our server and use pull requests.<p>In VS Code I only have to know `Ctrl+Shift+P` to use their git &quot;GUI&quot; (if you can even call it that). One thing I like about it that you don&#x27;t get with the cli (out of the box) is an instant overview of all the available commands without having to type much or switch views.<p>The juniors where I work have also been brainwashed to use Macs which they struggle with; mostly due to the bad window management, non-discoverable features and their lack of will to spend any time learning their tools deeply or customizing them. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve been using Linux since the start of my career in the late 90s, I learned the basic Git flow over 10 years ago and have almost never had to use the git cli in that entire time while churning out hundreds of project.')
