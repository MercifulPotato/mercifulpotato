There is $14.17B of value locked in DeFi, so it&#x27;s clearly useful to someone(and scams don&#x27;t account for the majority of it).<p>2. USD is not my primary currency, I&#x27;m fortunate my employer agrees to pay me in USDC. The fees are usually around $1.5, previously when I used PayPal fees used to be 5.5% deducted from my side.<p>3. I keep most of my money in USD, which earns interest around 8% APY monthly on yearn.finance&#x2F;earn. Contrast with the savings account on my bank which gives me 3%.<p>I don&#x27;t trade, I don&#x27;t speculate. I own a small amount of ETH to pay for fees. If you are from TradeFi you will find it much more useful!')
