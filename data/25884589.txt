But we don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable about that fact.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered about that, is it strictly true? Aren&#x27;t there heavy metals and other elements that are accumulated in the body over time? Or at least, they are eliminated so slowly that you&#x27;d never rid yourself of them completely before dying. I guess bones replace themselves every 10 years so any incorporated metals would have a chance to be eliminated on that timescale. But what&#x27;s to stop a few of those elements making their way back into another structure after being ejected into the blood stream? Maybe we&#x27;ve all got a few persistent cadmium or lead atoms hanging out in our bodies from birth to death. Ship of Theseus crisis averted!')
