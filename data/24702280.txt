You learn English as a foreign language at school. You do a PhD and move for a postdoc to another country, say, Austria, because that&#x27;s how academics do it. You work there, though you are not very motivated to learn German, as you know that it is unlikely to get tenure there. In the end, you learn German.<p>You apply for tenure-track and tenure everywhere, because that is how academics do it. In the end, you get a tenure in France -- they have plenty of permanent jobs. Now you start learning French. You are motivated to learn the language. But having learned two foreign languages already, you see that it will take you 3-5 years to learn it. All public services in France require French beyond advanced, as you have to remind the officials about every single application ten times, before you get anything. Want to have fun? Try to rent an apartment and open a bank account in France, not being a French resident.<p>I am not the blog author, but I had a similar academic trajectory. Before judging people, try it yourself.')
