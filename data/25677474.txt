Because the exit is the whole point of embarking on making the business in the first place.’<p>I agree that this is essentially a failure.<p>However, for many years they provided exactly the service they said they were going to provide.<p>As for ‘the exit is the point’.  Maybe for those who controlled the stock, but definitely not for everyone involved.<p>And even for the founders, do you think this was the exit they planned on?  I very much doubt that.<p>The end result is a bad one, but I don’t think you’ve made a case for being cynical in some broader sense.')
