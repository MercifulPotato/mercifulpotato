Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609176682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560316, text='&gt; More apartments built will not help make housing more affordable for normal people.<p>Pre-covid, I knew engineers making $100k+ living with four roommates in a somewhat run-down apartment. Sure, $100k isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> much, but it&#x27;s enough that they should be living somewhere nicer without the roommates. People who should be in high-end apartments are living in low-end apartments, displacing &quot;normal&quot; people who would normally live there. If you build only mid-high-end apartments, the priced will come down to the point that the average tech worker can afford them, and they&#x27;ll move out of their four roommate situation. That will free up inventory at the lower end, and prices will drop.<p>This really is just supply and demand. It does funny things at times (see the backward bending supply curve of labor), but until there&#x27;s a surplus of housing, this isn&#x27;t one of them.')
