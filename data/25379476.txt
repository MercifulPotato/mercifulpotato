More often, fulltime jobs (especially in tech) are ~40% work, 60% absolute garbage timewasting. Sitting through meetings that don&#x27;t need to happen, to satisfy an insecurity or requirement that someone above has, without actually solving any real problems or creating any change.<p>Some people do exactly as much is required at their actual job (so a generous 40% of their available capacity) and then spend their nights, weekends and freetime pouring themselves into other things. Startups, personal projects, hobbies, families, etc.<p>Fulltime jobs are almost never rewarding or exciting. A startup may start exciting&#x2F;fulfilling, but eventually corporate garbage sets in and you&#x27;re on the same treadmill of meetings to talk about prospective work&#x2F;how much work there is, fitting actual fulfillment of tasks in between.')
