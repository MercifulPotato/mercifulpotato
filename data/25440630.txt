It makes some sense - the valve lets a lot of droplets out, but the rest of the N95 mask is probably a far better filter than a cotton mask.<p>It doesn&#x27;t contradict the claim in this article, but it&#x27;s an interesting thing to ponder about the risk of the general public having seemingly all standardized on cotton masks.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advances.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;6&#x2F;36&#x2F;eabd3083" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advances.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;6&#x2F;36&#x2F;eabd3083</a>')
