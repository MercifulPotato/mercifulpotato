He negotiated middle east peace agreements between Israel and 4 or 5 other nations. He created Opportunity Zones for tax-incentivized investments in poor (often minority) neighborhoods. He increased funding to historically black colleges. He instituted prison reform to shorten sentences for non-violent offenders. If anything, people have been angry at him for not being enough of a medical dictator with the covid situation, meanwhile a lot of Democrat governors seem to have a predilection for banning churches, arresting small business owners, and instituting lockdowns. Left-wing social media has instituted strict anti-conservative censorship and deplatforming, in an attempt to influence the election. There&#x27;s been no censorship from Trump. He&#x27;s a blowhard, and sometimes an asshole, but he doesn&#x27;t try to silence anyone. He&#x27;s not locking people up in their houses. He&#x27;s not un-personing anyone.')
