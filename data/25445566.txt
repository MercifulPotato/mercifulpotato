But I&#x27;ve never worked for a company that didn&#x27;t provide coverage for that as well. My current plan provides $1500&#x2F;yr for routine dental coverage, $15k for dental emergencies and accidents. $30k&#x2F;yr prescription coverage. Massage, chiro, accupuncture up to $1k&#x2F;yr. Counseling for up to 6 sessions free, then 50% coverage. This is not an unusual benefits package as far as I can tell. My last company even provided a $400 wellness spending account on top of all that. Anything I could justify as &#x27;wellness&#x27; was covered to that amount. Running shoes, ski passes, recreational classes. This isn&#x27;t some special package for high value employees. This is standard for any FT employee.<p>My out of pocket expenses this year for all health related stuff is around $100. That is made up mostly of prescription dispensing fees ($10 for a 3 month supply), and massage fees that were over the per visit limit (they only cover the first $100&#x2F;hour. My massage therapist is $115&#x2F;hr)<p>Benefits in Canada blew my mind when I moved up here.<p>The downside is that I make $80k ($62kUSD) as a mid level web dev, and that is not really considered low for the position.')
