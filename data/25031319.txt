I don&#x27;t see this as a bad thing.<p>&gt; On top of that, the electoral college enables the &quot;faithless elector&quot; scenario, in which chosen electors who cast the legally-binding vote for president opt to either vote against the wishes of the electorate or to abstain entirely[0].<p>Yes I agree entirely this needs to be fixed.')
