As such, France was the only major League of Nations (might have been a different group) power to vote against Esperanto being pushed for international communications at that time. The USA was supportive at the time. Now the tables are turned and native English speakers have a significant advantage on the world stage, so the US and UK would not benefit as much.<p>In recent years, Esperanto has pushed itself as more of an international auxiliary language. If it&#x27;s much easier to learn than English, than everyone can continue speaking their national language and use Esperanto as an intermediary language. It&#x27;s an interesting idea, but I figure we&#x27;ll just move towards fewer and fewer major languages until only 5-10 are widely spoken (Ex: english, spanish, mandarin, Hindi...etc).')
