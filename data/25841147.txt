In particular, <i>Common Lisp</i> has many semantic features such as dynamic variables and the function–value dichotomy that do not exist in, say <i>Scheme</i>, or really any other commonly used programming language. And Scheme, yet again, has many rather esoteric operations, such as continuation capturing, that exists nowhere else as well.<p>The three most popular <i>Lisp</i>s today are <i>C.L.</i>, <i>Clojure</i>, and <i>Scheme</i>, and I don&#x27;t see these three having unified semantics at all and they are often further from each other than they are to many other languages.')
