What makes the Mellanox NIC perform better?<p>I.e.: Why does memory bandwidth matter to TLS? Aren&#x27;t you encrypting data &quot;on the fly&quot;, while it is still resident in the CPU caches?<p>&gt;  We&#x27;re working with the hardware vendors to try to figure it out. We should be getting about 390Gb&#x2F;s<p>Something I explained to a colleague recently is that a modern CPU gains or loses more computer power from a 1Â° C temperature difference in the room&#x27;s air than my first four computers had combined.<p>You&#x27;re basically complaining that you&#x27;re unable to get a mere 10% of the expected throughput. But put in absolute terms, that&#x27;s 40 Gbps, which is about 10x more than what a typical server in 2020 can put out on the network. (Just because you have 10 Gbps NICs doesn&#x27;t mean you can get 10 Gbps! Try iperf3 and you&#x27;ll be shocked that you&#x27;re lucky if you can crack 5 Gbps in practice)')
