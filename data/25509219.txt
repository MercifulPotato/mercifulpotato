Very few people will admit &quot;I pirated this because I didn&#x27;t feel like paying for it like I normally would.&quot; People always find ways to justify their actions, so every response would just be some variation of &quot;I pirated this because the legal options are too inconvenient that I normally wouldn&#x27;t bother so I didn&#x27;t hurt anyone.&quot;<p>And you never will be able to totally eliminate piracy nor will you be able to definitively attribute gains or losses to changes in piracy.
