You are many orders of magnitude more likely to lose your data due to a code bug or unstable network than deplatforming.<p>I looked into setting up something of the sort for myself a little while ago, but unfortunately the pricing just isn&#x27;t feasible if you have a large amount of data (say a few hundred GBs). You could easily end up paying more than $100&#x2F;mo for storage + compute + bandwidth, while Dropbox and others charge ~$6-$10&#x2F;mo for like 2TB.')
