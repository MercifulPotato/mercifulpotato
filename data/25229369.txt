Positive comments get upvoted and praised, negative experiences get dismissed with a mix of victim blaming (usually &quot;set and setting&quot; comments) or explained away as exacerbating pre-existing underlying conditions.&quot;</i><p>What you describe is pretty much the <i>opposite</i> of what this thread was like.<p>Negative comments (including your own) got upvoted, and there are hardly any positive comments in this thread at all.<p>Yes, there were some who talked of negative experiences being due to set and setting or exacerbating pre-existing underlying conditions, but plenty of other comments did not.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that those explanations are wrong.<p>You say explaining negative experiences as being the result of set and setting is &quot;victim blaming&quot;.  Do you deny the enormous role that set and setting play in what experiences one has on psychedelics?  If so, you&#x27;re flying in the face of pretty much all research done on psychedelics for many decades -- which is huge amount of research, especially in the early years, before they were made illegal, and the more recent research supports it.<p>If you take psychedelics with the wrong set and setting you are pretty much guaranteeing you&#x27;ll have a bad experience.  That is as close to an incontrovertible fact as anything we know about psychedelics.<p>Educating people on the role of set and setting should be encouraged, because it can help lead to better outcomes.  Trying to silence it by branding simple education &quot;victim blaming&quot; would just lead to more people having negative experiences due to ignorance, which we really don&#x27;t need any more of.')
