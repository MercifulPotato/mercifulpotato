It&#x27;s really an amazing language if it weren&#x27;t for the god awful IDE.<p>If you&#x27;re happen to still work on Delphi enterprise software I&#x27;d highly recommend to have a look at OmniPascal (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omnipascal.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omnipascal.com&#x2F;</a>), a very smart VisualStudio code plugin. It&#x27;s a gem that provides JetBrains-like quality completions&#x2F;refactorings for Delphi&#x2F;Pascal.')
