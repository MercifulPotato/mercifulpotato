Template engine is very bad. Hard to write reusable small functions (string manipulation, array manipulation, data extraction, mapping one form of data to other, filtering etc.). The fact that statements can’t be multiline is ridiculous.<p>Coming from Hakyll which just gives you all the power of Pandoc and a programming language, it was really a chore to work with Hugo. I’ll never use it again.')
