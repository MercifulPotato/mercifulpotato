Item(by='complex_stdnt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604120122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945323, text='So in integer factorization there are two different quantities that one might naturally want to denote by N: the number you want to factor and the number of bits required to specify that number (i.e, the input length).<p>The convention is to let N be the number to be factored, in which case log_2(N) is the input length. Hence, an algorithm that runs in time &quot;polynomial (in the input length)&quot; would have to run in time log(N)^k for some k.')
