Item(by='aw1621107', descendants=None, kids=[25079139, 25081625], score=None, time=1605241045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078273, text='&gt; It makes me wonder how a statement like this can be proved.<p>&gt;&gt; There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised<p>I suppose it might depend on how you read that statement. One person might read it as &quot;There is no evidence (that exists&#x2F;that will exist) that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised&quot;, in which case some backing would be desirable. Another person might read it more like &quot;There is no evidence (that we&#x27;re aware of) that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised&quot;, in which case proof <i>technically</i> doesn&#x27;t need to be provided, as one can truthfully state that they are not aware of evidence of an event independently of whether that event occurred or not.')
