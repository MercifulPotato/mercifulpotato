As other commenters have noted it appears that there just wasn&#x27;t a working backup. If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s more of an organizational failing in my view: no-one cared enough to make a working backup.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the &#x27;IT error&#x27; in our test and trace system recently, where thousands of positive covid test results were uncounted because Excel truncated the file after a certain number of rows. In my view, it&#x27;s not really the tech at fault, it&#x27;s that the organization was using Excel because they didn&#x27;t care enough to do it properly.<p>Calling it a &#x27;technical issue&#x27; puts the blame on a malfunction, making it seem unfortunate but unavoidable, and absolving the organization that actually caused the issue.')
