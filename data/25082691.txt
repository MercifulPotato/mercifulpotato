People should be allowed to make their own choices in what they believe to be their best interests and they should be allowed to get things wrong.“<p>I am not making any argument that can be construed as this.  You are misreading me if you think I am.  I agree that people should be allowed to make their own choices which is why I strongly oppose government regulation of software distribution.  It’s also why I support people’s right to choose platforms like iOS.<p>“Something has to change.  We are sliding back into the 1980s where all the computer hardware was incompatible with one another.”<p>I’m not sure freedom and compatibility always go hand in hand, but I agree that something has to change.<p>As to the tinkerers and people building their own rigs - the idea that there is a large spectrum.  I potentially agree.<p>Serving those people well is a hugely untapped potential.  I used to believe that Apple would see this, but I no longer do.  I suspect that Jobs would have done.<p>I would like to think the open source community and commercial ecosystem outside of Apple and Microsoft <i>can</i> seize the opportunity.<p>We won’t if we spend our time feeling victimized by corporations doing what corporations do.')
