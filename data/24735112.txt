If you don&#x27;t pay, they add you to a blacklist.  It&#x27;s feasible, router has a blacklist,  Cisco checks if you make money, if you do, they shake you down, if you don&#x27;t pay, they add you to the blacklist and router downloads and refuses to route your IP addresses.  Sounds ridiculous, but it&#x27;s doable.  After all they are facilitating the transaction.')
