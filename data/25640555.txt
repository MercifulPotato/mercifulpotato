They simply do not care at all what&#x27;s being done to them.<p>I&#x27;m not really an Apple <i>fan</i>, per se, but I do own a macbook and the reason is this: It&#x27;s not worth my time to switch to Linux. I have a core i7 Thinkpad that I also run Debian+KDE on, and the user experience is much worse, to say nothing of track pad quality and battery life.<p>I&#x27;m a parent and I&#x27;m not a software developer in my professional life, which means every minute spent figuring out why Linux won&#x27;t do $thing properly is a minute not spent on more important things.<p>The opportunity cost of using free software is just too high for my use case.')
