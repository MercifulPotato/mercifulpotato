Interoperability, law enforcement use, fair use, accessing public domain material which is distributed using the same technological measures, whatever.<p>You create and distribute a piece of software to interface with the material for those purposes.<p>It&#x27;s the same piece of software as one designed for any other purposes, because the software has no knowledge of your intent and your intent has no technical effect on its operation.<p>If that is allowed, doesn&#x27;t that make 1201 a dead letter? If you make the tool available for non-infringing uses, the tool is available.<p>But if that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> allowed, doesn&#x27;t that make 1201 a contemptible offense against all of those important interests? And possibly unconstitutional as a result?')
