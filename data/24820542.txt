I eventually realized the same - you need to find an instance with people&#x2F;content that you like&#x2F;relate to.<p>The thing is: Do I really want another time sink? I&#x27;ve been on the Internet for over 20 years, and I think whatever gains I could have gotten from online forums&#x2F;discussions have been attained. Time is a premium, and I&#x27;m actively trying to quash sites where I just browse for new content.
