I can vouch for its excellence, but I don&#x27;t recall him discussing jubilees much.<p>A cursory search isn&#x27;t turning up much, do you have any reading material for the Geiger counter idea? Or is that something you&#x27;re spit-balling just now? :)<p>Agreed on UBI, etc. One thing I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about is the Ultimatum Game [1], and what it would look like to scale up that concept to a society. In a sense, that&#x27;s the <i>realpolitik</i> of every state: if the peasants are sufficiently unhappy, they show up with torches and pitchforks, even at the cost of their short-term interests. The modern peaceful version is &quot;vote the bums out&quot;, but that&#x27;s always been of dubious efficacy; and it feels especially toothless today, given the scope of regulatory capture and &quot;manufactured consent&quot; in the two-party system. The next closest thing (without resorting to violence) probably looks like a General Strike, but that&#x27;s one hell of a coordination problem.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Debt:_The_First_5000_Years" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Debt:_The_First_5000_Years</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ultimatum_game" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ultimatum_game</a>')
