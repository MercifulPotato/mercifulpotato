It seems clear you all like making assumptions and treating them as unshakeable truth.<p>Can you explain, then, why 1) your original post was devoid of any such language, and 2) you dismissed my suggestion, which added some, as being likely to cynically have the opposite effect of what was intended?<p>I get what you&#x27;re saying.
