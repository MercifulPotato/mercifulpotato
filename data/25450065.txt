It fits 4x8 sheets of plywood in the back perfectly (it was designed this way), all of the seats fold down into the floor, which is awesome, and it can tow a trailer.<p>We actually got it because it meant we could more easily pack more things to burning man every year.  Since then we&#x27;ve done tons of road trips all over the country, and build the back of the van into a bed.<p>Love that car.  Hoping to upgrade to a hybrid with the comma.ai autopilot eventually.')
