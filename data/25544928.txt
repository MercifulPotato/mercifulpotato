Item(by='cjgustafson22', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1609004412, title='Cancellation Policy as a Competitive Advantage?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Me and my wife run a last minute tour and activity marketplace called Bubba Booking that allows in-destination consumers to find things to do either today, tomorrow or this week. Our tours are listed based on the user&#x27;s exact location and party size. We started the company after going on our honeymoon and discovering that finding tours nearby the day of is almost impossible.<p>2 years later and we have 15K live tours and activities...and we finally made our first real sale this week!<p>We are now trying to determine how to use cancellation policies to differentiate us from our competitors.<p>For context, we are contractually obligated to adopt each tour partner&#x27;s cancellation policy (some have 24 hours, some have 48 hours, some have 7 days, some have no refunds at all). Here are our options to choose from: (keep in mind that we only book up to seven days out)<p>1. Follow each partner&#x27;s policy: No competitive advantage and operationally difficult to track\n2. No cancellations...period: Less consumer friendly, but since we are already last minute in nature, we think that most people are committed to going at the time of booking anyway; plus, it&#x27;s easy to operationalize with a small staff\n3. Free Cancellations...always: Makes us extremely consumer friendly. But we would be on the hook to pay 100% of any missed revenue. So if we make 10% commission on each tour, we&#x27;d need 9 successful bookings of the same amount to break even on the 1 missed tour. This could sink us pretty quick if the people cancelling for frivolous reasons outweighed the incremental bookings we&#x27;d get from a lax policy<p>In the absence of enough real data, what do you guys think?')
