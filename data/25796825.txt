Miners spending more on hardware &amp; energy won&#x27;t produce more bitcoins (it just means the difficulty will increase and more CO2 will be released).<p>I&#x27;m saying the fact that you have to waste $10,000 worth of electricity calculating redundant hashes in order to make a bitcoin doesn&#x27;t mean that bitcoin somehow contains $10k worth of &quot;value&quot; or that the cost of production sets a floor on the price.<p>People sometimes get confused about this, perhaps reasoning by way of analogy with real-world goods that will (typically) never be sold for less than the cost of their inputs, or they imagine some computerized form of the labor theory of value applies[0], but this is not true. The only factors determining the price of bitcoin are supply (fixed) and demand (driven by speculation).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_theory_of_value" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_theory_of_value</a>')
