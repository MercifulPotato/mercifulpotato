Why would Hunter Biden, whose dad is running for President, leave his laptop at a Trump-supporting discount computer repair shop without paying with (supposedly) incriminating emails on it? It’s so convoluted... it only makes sense if you wanted to fabricate cover for illegally hacking someone’s data (or more likely, modified and&#x2F;or falsified data) and releasing it. As it is, the computer repair shop doesn’t own copyright of the PII and has no right to release it.')
