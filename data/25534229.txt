I know an Indian guy who was doing residency in the US. Got married in India, his wife got him arrested under 498a. He spent 10 months in jail! Ridiculous.<p>I&#x27;m lucky my turn came after the supreme Court ruling you mentioned. Me or my family was not arrested, but we still had to shell up about 30,000 USD to my in laws, which was money will spent to be honest (as they agreed to give me full custody of my daughter).<p>I could have prevented all this my bugging my ex&#x27;s phone. Why? Because it all happened so suddenly. Everything came down raining without even a hint from my ex. If I had a little bit intelligence of what she was cooking up, I could have even saved the marriage.')
