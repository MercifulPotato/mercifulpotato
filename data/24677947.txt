I used to be a full on Win&#x2F;Mac user in various phases.<p>I had a coworker who was a contributor and we&#x27;d have healthy debates (promise!) about our choice of OS.  I decided I&#x27;d one-up him, by learning all the finer points about the 3rd remaining OS well, I&#x27;d be able to render him speechless! So I installed Linux on a computer and started using it, settings up my dev environment, applications etc.  It didn&#x27;t take long for me to forgot about the original reason for doing it.  I only remembered years later and I didn&#x27;t forget to thank him sincerely for sending me down this path.<p>I never thought about OSS, freedom, etc, mainly because a premise of being in those closed ecosystems is to be brand loyal.  But now it&#x27;s become very important to me.')
