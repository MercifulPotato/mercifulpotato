My 2015 macbook is about ~120ms for the terminal app.<p>That leaves 70ms latency budget to play with which can accommodate the  the RDP overhead (~50ms) and the network hop (~10ms for me).<p>This whole journey started with me wondering if I should pay a small fortune for a better network connection, before I realised that most of the latency was in my keyboard and monitor!<p>I even built a Arduino Leonardo gadget to measure the lag systematically and some pcap software to spot the RDP packets on the wire. The code&#x27;s pretty shoddy but it does the trick!  You can see it and an example result with RDP here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;willmuldrew&#x2F;lagmeter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;willmuldrew&#x2F;lagmeter</a><p>Another big factor in the experience is jitter - so it&#x27;s a good idea to ensure everything is plugged in if you can.  Mice, keyboards and ethernet.<p>In essence, even if you have to RDP&#x2F;remote into work, potentially you can still make it feel pretty local - don&#x27;t give up hope!')
