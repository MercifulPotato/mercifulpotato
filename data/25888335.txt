But like every agile software idea they often become a big-A &quot;Agile&quot; thing that&#x27;s done, often with little consideration if it&#x27;s done in a useful way, but just because it&#x27;s the thing that&#x27;s to be done and gets overloaded with stuff someone wants to do. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s both yes, you&#x27;ve had &quot;bad luck&quot; in a way, but at the same time that&#x27;s kinda the norm in many places.')
