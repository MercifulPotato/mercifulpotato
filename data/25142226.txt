Colocation datacenters have existed for several decades and remote hands working there would probably not see much difference between getting a call&#x2F;fax&#x2F;email&#x2F;app telling them to do a break fix order. Having worked in dozens of datacenters over the past two decades is that there will always be newer semi-technical workers there doing break fix. A lot of those people would consider those jobs dead ends too and so this cloud datacenter thing is nothing new, its just on a much larger scale. The datacenter operators don&#x27;t have to keep working there to level up their careers but working in a datacenter gives familiarity and the confidence to try more technical roles later.')
