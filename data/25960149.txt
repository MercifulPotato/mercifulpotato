As you mention, it&#x27;s a way to keep using older fabs, but that&#x27;s not the only reason.<p>40nm offers tons of performance for microcontrollers and the die area can still be reasonably small.  You tend to want to have lots of variants of microcontrollers for different applications, so mask costs matter.  And you tend not to want exotic, very low core voltages and <i>do</i> want high voltage tolerances and strong drivers on the IOs, which mean relatively big geometry-- no matter what your minimum feature size is.<p>Also, sleep power consumption is important, so low leakage is nice, which is easier to get on large geometry.')
