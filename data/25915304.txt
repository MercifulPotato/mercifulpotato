A couple efforts used SPARQLX, something I created that was a binary form of SPARQL+SPARQLUpdate+StoredProcedures+Macros encoded using Variable Message Format. This was about 18 years ago, before SPARQL and SPARQL update merged, and before FLWOR. One of these days I&#x27;ll recreate it again. The original work is not available, and I was not allowed to publish.<p>Oh, and I forgot two things, SPARQLX had triggers, was customized for OWL DLP, and had commands for custom import and export using N3 (I was a big fan of the cwm software).')
