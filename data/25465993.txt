Think of objects being used  analog to network servers. The internet doesn&#x27;t go down because someone&#x27;s server changes (the BEAM VM probably comes closest as far as languages are concerned).<p>Objects communicate messages and status and when something crashes it&#x27;s up to the object to do something, often restart, but either way it&#x27;s a matter of interpretation.<p>It&#x27;s the static typing that couples because it introduces global behaviour through its types, which impose meaning from the top. In a truly dynamic system, nobody <i>needs to</i> understand the entire system.<p>I admit it&#x27;s a fairly theoritcal point because I don&#x27;t think many people even embrace this paradigm any more, and ironically if they do it&#x27;s in functional languages. But to say it&#x27;s failed I think is not right, because nowadays people write dynamic languages basically like they&#x27;d write Java, they don&#x27;t embrace the dynamic aspects.')
