And that&#x27;s fine! Not everyone needs to be that sort of person; you should be able to have a reasonably comfortable career even if you aren&#x27;t.<p>But the world is set up right now such that, without a university degree, you fall through the cracks and it&#x27;s game over. In lots of high-earning jobs, a degree is either <i>de jure</i> required (law, medicine), or <i>de facto</i> required as most major employers won&#x27;t look at you without one (finance, most tech stuff). So universities become degree mills because that&#x27;s what the market demands, and students are only there so they can get a job afterward.<p>To fix the universities, you have to fix the incentives.')
