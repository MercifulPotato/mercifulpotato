Real journalism should be helping the reader by adding context.  Has something like this happened before?  How many people has this impacted?  Do they have a history of making these kinds of apologies and then sneaking in the problematic feature bit by bit over time?  Maybe point out the persuasion technique being used by MSFT PR in the language they chose to talk about this issue.')
