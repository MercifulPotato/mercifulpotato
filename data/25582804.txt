[...] This release makes the IDE so incredibly fast! Indexing dependencies happens magnitudes faster than Intel version.</i><p>These must be macOS issues or problems with the limited thermal envelopes ofIntel Macs. I have noticed the same issue with my Intel MacBooks, it&#x27;s slow and the fans spin loudly.<p>I never had that issue on Linux with a Ryzen CPU (3700X) though. The JetBrains IDEs are lightning-fast, including indexing. My only gripe is that they do not have native Wayland support and as a result the IDEs are blurry with GNOME fractional scaling.<p>There are some issues about this in their bug tracker, but the JetBrains personnel either do not seem to understand how the Linux graphics stack works (and come with non-solutions) or say that it is low on their priority list.<p>I have a ToolBox subscription (among other reasons because IntelliJ is still the best Java IDE). But with the progress that Visual Studio Code makes with e.g. Rust support and JetBrains&#x27; slow progress on many issues, I will probably switch to VS Code at some point.')
