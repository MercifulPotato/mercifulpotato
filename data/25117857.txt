One of the things driving the &#x27;investments&#x27; in those style of games(MMO&#x27;s) is that you get this feeling of progress and can compare your progress to your friends &#x27;skills&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been writing alot in my personal journal on how to turn runescape skills into real life skills with achievements.<p>Ruby on rails would be a &#x27;skill&#x27; and based on time spent doing pomodoros to earn xp for a &#x27;Ruby on Rails&#x27; Skill, combined with certain projects awarding XP and achievements would turn real life into a game. Think like a self defined &#x27;Khan Academy meets Facebook&#x27;.<p>You could see your friends skills and see what they are working on. Maybe a bulletin board&#x2F;  social media style GUI that would say &#x27; x just completed a pomodoro in Piano&#x27;. You could post to your linkedin account all the &#x27;skills&#x27; you&#x27;ve obtained to show your various interests.')
