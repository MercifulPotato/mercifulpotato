Given the haphazard nature of contact tracing (in the U.S. at least) it is quite plausible that large-scale transmission events on airplanes are happening but simply aren&#x27;t being noticed because we&#x27;re not looking for them.<p>That said, the ventilation in planes is pretty good, and if everyone is wearing a mask it&#x27;s equally plausible that air travel is relatively safe.')
