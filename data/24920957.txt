I find it generally confusing, if two different languages have similar syntax (why did Java have to look a bit like C?).  I guess, I need a visual hint reminding me of the expected semantic.<p>Anyhow, even if the original JavaScript (perhaps &quot;ScriptingScheme&quot; or &quot;WebScheme&quot;?) would have more resembled Scheme, I doubt it would have used S-expr for long.  Over the years I developed the needed parenthesis-blindness, but can&#x27;t imagine most Web developers having that patience.')
