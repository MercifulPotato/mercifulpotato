They aren&#x27;t. Your statements don&#x27;t talk about how the risk change with vaccination - and change even more when more folks are vaccinated.<p>If you are vaccinated, you are <i>vastly</i> less likely to get the infection you are vaccinated against. It is kind of like car accidents - you are vastly less likely to be in any sort of car accident if you are walking (vaccinated) than if you are driving a car (unvaccinated).  Most folks will be protected.<p>Since most folks will be protected and won&#x27;t get the disease, it means that - with enough vaccinations - the risk  for those who don&#x27;t get the vaccine or who are unlucky enough not to have full effectiveness are more protected as well. This situation is more akin to most folks taking public transport instead of driving cars: Since there are fewer cars on the roads, everyone&#x27;s risk of getting into a car accident drops significantly.')
