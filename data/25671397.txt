It seems like you couldn&#x27;t find a way to actually reject its obvious relevancy, so you chose just not to do it by using a word that seemed like it should be enough to shut down discussion, and leave it at that.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m not entirely sure how the other person was &quot;pretending to know less&quot; by bringing up how SSC had to be taken down because in today&#x27;s climate, what what was almost done to the author would have threatened his livelihood. It&#x27;s a quite apt counterpoint to your notion that owning your own domain is some sort of magical protection against censorship.')
