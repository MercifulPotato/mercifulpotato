I found the work very interesting and intellectually rewarding.<p>Unfortunately, IME, the effort vs financial reward ratio is completely blown out of the water by general software. I make &gt;3x what the postdocs were making with less experience, less education, and (speaking generally) less intelligence.<p>Obviously there are industry positions that pay better, but the general trend is you will be compensated far less than you could doing general software development.')
