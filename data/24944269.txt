Item(by='notacoward', descendants=None, kids=[24945683], score=None, time=1604077072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942383, text='&gt; History shows limited liability spurred economic growth<p>Not even all forms of limited liability are equal, let alone all forms of corporate structure of which limited liability is only a part. To argue that <i>all</i> of the extensions to corporate personhood over the last 200 years are justified because of economic growth over the same time is not only to conflate different things but to confuse correlation with causation. That&#x27;s where this discussion started - not with limited liability alone, but with corporate personhood in general, so I guess we can add the fallacy of composition to your trifecta. I refuse to engage with more such sophistry.')
