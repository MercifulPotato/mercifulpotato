I never knew it had a particular name for the style. I just assumed it was functional-style programming.<p>This allows me to build ever greater programs, that does very complicated things, and has thousands of lines of code and logic, but everything gets boiled down to small bite-sized pieces.<p>Itâ€™s a more data oriented approach. And it seems to follow an assembly line model.<p>I liken it to building code pyramids. Where I keep stacking and chaining one function to another, to build even bigger pyramids.<p>At the end, all the code is heavily unit tested, and I have a high degree of trust in the fidelity of the codebase.')
