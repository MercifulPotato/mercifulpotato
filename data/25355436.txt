I was in a headphone shop because my old $200 Seinnheiser headphones had fallen apart after many years of use.<p>I got to compare many different headphones from different manufacturers back-to-back, using my own music that I was familiar with.<p>Under $200 = garbage.<p>$200 - $500 = generally good and largely indistinguishable apart from the comfort of the headband and the padding.<p>I was about to buy a pair of HD600 headphones when for a lark I decided to try the &quot;out of my budget&quot; HD800 headphones. They were $1,500 at the time.<p>It was like night &amp; day. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. All other headphones rendered the sound of a double bass in a classical piece as a monotonal &quot;thrum-thrum-thrum&quot;. With the HD800 it was like you were standing next to the thing. Every note, even the lowest, clearly distinct. You could hear the scrape of the bow across the strings. In orchestral pieces you could hear every intake of breath and every ruffled page.<p>Head drooping in defeat, I handed over my credit card and bought it right there. I was ruined. There is no going back.<p>I ended up re-listening to my entire music collection and re-watching every movie that had decent sound mastering. Some songs made the <i>hair stand up on my arms</i>, they gave me a sense of tingly pleasure they never had before.<p>Totally worth it, at least for me.')
