We were never very big, but I assumed it was the bare minimum of what was needed in order to pass and the manufacturers wouldn&#x27;t give out exceptions that easily, if at all.<p>That&#x27;s pretty annoying that they secured a pass but then didn&#x27;t do as they promised (I realize it&#x27;s not always that easy when it comes to programming, but still). I&#x27;m glad CDPR are getting punished for their rash decision in the marketplace and their stock price, at least, even though they&#x27;re still probably going to end up making a ton of money off the game and their developers are still going to be crunched to death for little reward.<p>I think it reflects badly on Sony as well, but less so.')
