My tactic was to look at the profile of anyone who was boosted onto my timeline a couple times and to be very liberal with follows... and then to unfollow anyone whose posts ended up being more annoying than valuable. It&#x27;s not as a big deal because you will only see that person&#x27;s content; if you end up following someone you don&#x27;t like, it won&#x27;t &quot;pollute your recommendations&quot; or whatever.')
