Given that this is supposedly a <i>security</i> feature - no. Nope. Not at all: what is the state of the data line(s), and how do you know that it matches whatever indicator the cable uses? (There&#x27;s no way to tell, and you don&#x27;t - if software is involved, securing stuff becomes HARD, and proving security even harder.)<p>OTOH, a USB Y-cable physically <i>has</i> no data lines connected on the extra USB-A male connector; it thus provides a far stronger guarantee that there is no data travelling across them. (Not foolproof, but <i>safer</i> than a software-controlled  switch.)')
