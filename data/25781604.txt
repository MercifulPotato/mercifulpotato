Their party has been yelling about getting off fossil fuels for the last 20 years.<p>Obama encouraged organizations that were re-training coal miners and others in dead industries to join the digital workforce.<p>It&#x27;s the alt-right who have been promising to go back to &#x27;normal&#x27; and that coal is the future. The economics aren&#x27;t there, fossil fuels is a dying industry. Even if we aren&#x27;t elimiating fossil fuels tomorrow, we don&#x27;t need 2,000 men underground digging, we have machines, automation and different mining methods now.<p>Any one who perpetuates this idea that we can get through this without radical change is fooling themselves.<p>Is Biden going to lead us into the future? Unlikely, but he is not going to perpetuate a lie. Coal is not coming back, drivers are on the way out, the economy is going to be turned upsides down in the next decade and we need to admit that fact.')
