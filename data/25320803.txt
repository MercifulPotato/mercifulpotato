However, Google made a change to AOSP that requires third-party location services to now be installed as a system app, not a regular app. (Only a tiny amount of people will have the skills to use the Android shell to move the package to the right place.) It is hard to not see this as a way for Google to lock Android users into using only its service and giving it all their location data.')
