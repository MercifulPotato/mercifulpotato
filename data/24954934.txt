Person A writes code under GPL. Person B extends that code significantly, also under GPL. Person A relicenses his code to a closed source.<p>Now person B, of course, is the rightful owner of his own extensions, but they don&#x27;t make sense without person A&#x27;s code. So suddenly person B&#x27;s work greatly decreases in value.<p>I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s not as simple as just relicensing one&#x27;s own code; other contributions, depending on that, should be taken into account. Or you can&#x27;t just relicense.')
