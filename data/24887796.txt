Checking if a value implements an interface is a way of writing surprising bugs. The standard library uses both of these features extensively, to give users bugs and prevent itself from being composable.<p>Checking that the user uses all values bound to variables but letting them discard errors by not binding them to a variable is a weird choice. Channels panicking instead of returning an error is a weird choice.<p>It&#x27;s ok and I would like to to use it instead of Java.')
