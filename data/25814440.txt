My daily driver is linux as I hate the lack of control I have and the insecurity (i feel that microsoft does whatever behind the scenes) i get on windows. For example after an update windows shoves me an edge icon on the desktop. I removed all the bloatware on the laptop and multiple times things are re-enabled after an update. I also cannot turn off updates if i want to. There are a few services for which I as an admin have no way of turning off or even change any settings. Wtf!\nI was able to gain some control of my machine with some registry settings but at the next update everything was overwritten. F that, i donâ€™t wanna play whack-a-mole anymore. If i need to use some windows software i boot the windows partition, then when done boot up on linux. Ubuntu these days is low friction, most Hw works out of box, etc.')
