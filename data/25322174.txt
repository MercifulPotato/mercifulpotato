User inputs a int64_t? Great the type intmax_t on that system is at least int64_t wide by definition. System doesn&#x27;t have a int64_t ? Great the user can at best use a int32_t, which intmax_t would once again support.<p>&gt; intmax_t doesn&#x27;t define an upper limit either, as TFA explains<p>Yeah, it would almost be sad that C++ is getting bitten by Cs lack of name mangling. Almost because it is kinda pointless to define a maximum integer in a language where any programmer can add their own fixed sized integer types, so a generic library supporting arbitrary sized integers would have to take template parameters anyway.')
