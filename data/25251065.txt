Now that I have no tolerance, having one coffee at any point during the day will completely ruin my sleep for that night (from ~7h down to ~4h with lots of awake time).<p>I&#x27;m at a point now where I don&#x27;t think coffee is for me - I love the taste and the effect but not at the expense of a good night&#x27;s sleep!')
