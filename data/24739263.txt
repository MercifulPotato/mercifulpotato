Using that binding and having a GUI or CLI program continue hanging because the dev screwed up the cleanup is a real pain. And someone writing a Bash script is highly likely for doing something &quot;very clever&quot; with that signal to make my life harder.<p>Or if you&#x27;re going to do something with it, at least make it clear you&#x27;re trolling me. Show me a text add that forces me to choose my favorite Korean boy band before I can exit, or something in that vein.')
