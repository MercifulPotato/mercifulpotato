God, what you have done in World War II, you must do again, this is what we ask for in our prayers to you: Justice, justice, justice!”” Pastor Tupirani da Hora Lores shouted at dozens of congregants earlier this month at his Geracao Jesus Cristo church&quot;</i><p>Have you got news of something like that in Berlin?<p>Did Bolsonaro said something about it?<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t idea about the CSU&#x2F;CDU parties (party from Germany) in Germany. But again, no reference, just the socket puppet in the internet saying.<p>I sure have, I&#x27;m Italian, part of my family moved to Germany soon after the war and lived in Berlin myself.<p>Frau Merkel surely didn&#x27;t ever support anti-semitic or anti democratic groups or movements.<p>Anyway CSU and CDU are two very different beasts, just putting them together shows that you are just trying to spew propaganda.<p>&gt; You are trolling with a lot of &quot;factoids&quot; to support your agenda<p>I have no agenda other than stopping your BS about Bolsonaro the great democratic president.<p>He is not.<p>He is a dangerous man.<p>With dangerous ideas.<p>&gt; What make you angry are stuff like:<p>LOL<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t.<p>North Korea style propaganda doesn&#x27;t affect me, sorry.')
