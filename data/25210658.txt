Of course they are trying to follow their own CoC on their own properties, especially when it comes to copyright infringement. As a US company, they&#x27;re bound to follow US law. Hardly surprising.<p>What does that have to do with the network? Again, the network nor the protocol currently has nothing in place that describes a &quot;attitude&quot; of being against copyright infringement.<p>I remember that we (I&#x27;m a ex-Protocol Labs employee) used to have plenty of discussions about adding allow&#x2F;blocklists to the protocol that people could opt-in to, but don&#x27;t think that was never added (yet?). If it was, I&#x27;d understand where you&#x27;re coming from.')
