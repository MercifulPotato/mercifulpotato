Though of course members of both groups also join the ACLU to (attempt to) influence it. Contrast with the days when &quot;freedom of expression&quot; was relevant (of conversations about gay rights, abortion, uncomfortable fiction, outsider ideas) and &quot;right&quot; meant &quot;moral majority&quot; is very educational.<p>(Of course the left proper has never cared much for actual communists and anarchists either, except as linguistic props. I suppose deciding to fully embrace that shouldn&#x27;t be surprising.)<p>I see no hope of rights-oriented politics surviving except as some side&#x27;s puppet - we have reached our stop, and must get off - so which dynamic will win out?<p>(Though I doubt the idea that the ACLU isn&#x27;t intentionally fascist will persist. &quot;If three people sit down at the table with a Nazi, you have four Nazis sitting at the table&quot; after all.)')
