If it is someone who composed a song or wrote a book, that word makes sense; without them the song or book would not exist. (Ironically, copyrights for songs are often not owned by the people who composed them, because contracts with publishers often require selling the copyright to them. At the end, you may be forbidden to sing your own song without paying.)<p>But in patents, sometimes it is just a person who noticed that existing technologies X and Y could be used together, and filed the patent first. If not them, someone else would have noticed it somewhat later. Even worse, someone else may get the idea independently a few weeks later... and then be sued for using it. Actually, if you invent something, it is always risky to use it, because you can never be sure whether someone else didn&#x27;t patent it before you. (Did you do an expensive research of existing patents? Maybe you used a wrong keyword.) (By the way, patents also sometimes do not belong to people who had the idea.)')
