These cannot be installed outside of the App Store at all, even self-built ones.<p>There is also the issue of surveillance. Apple processed warrantless FISA surveillance orders for 30,000 users last year, per their own transparency report.<p>It&#x27;s possible that people don&#x27;t want Apple (and by extension the FBI and US military, with no probable cause or warrant required) knowing the apps they purchase and use, or when, or on which devices.<p>Being App Store only prohibits that, and requires that your users be subject to this surveillance.<p>It&#x27;s the same issue with posting to Instagram, for example: deciding to donate free content to Facebook there makes the product more attractive to Facebook&#x27;s users and makes it harder for small businesses to opt out of using Facebook&#x27;s ad business.  Decisions like this make the whole world worse.')
