Running a 3 phase VFD on single phase (tieing all 3 phases together) works if you derate the VFD&#x2F;inverter. An inverter designed for this application should already be rated correctly.<p>There is no derating the motor when running on a 3 phase VFD&#x2F;inverter if you have the correct specs for everything. If you are trying to run a bigger motor than any link in the chain it might work so long as you don&#x27;t try to draw more power from the motor than the weakest link in the chain.<p>There is a static phase converter which does derate the motor.  They are the cheapest way to run 3 phase from single phase, but otherwise don&#x27;t have much to recommend them.  They are NOT inverters.')
