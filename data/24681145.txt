The CWEB sources themselves might be good and all, but most examples of literate programming I&#x27;ve looked at, including (and especially) the infamous article opposite McIlroy, don&#x27;t really do anything for me.  I checked around, thinking that surely someone realized this and that it must exist, but I didn&#x27;t turn up anything.  It&#x27;s the same today, as far as I know.  (I did find a DEFLATE implementation in JS run through one of those documentation tools that purports to produce a literate program, but it&#x27;s not a literate program in the sense that Knuth uses the term.)')
