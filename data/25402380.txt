Front-loading risk is a basic project management strategy, and one that is really difficult to get right with software. The framework presented is way too complicated, and touches a lot of engineering dogma that will make it hard to sell, especially to teams using any variation of agile. If this were a simpler way to teach my teams to take stuff that is high-risk, isolate it, and do the risky part first, I&#x27;d love it. (yes, sometimes isolating is impossible, and sometimes something is risky that you think is a sure thing)')
