When you do not have a hypothesis, the first thing you want to do is get one :). It&#x27;s like in research: the greatest problem you can have is not having a problem.<p>Now, how do you get a hypothesis?<p>You can start from some generic visualizations. The goal here is not to gain understanding, but to poke at finding interesting initial questions.<p>But, you actually always know something. You likely know the domain. Or you know the last tickets that are in the work. Even listening in the casual conversations is a good starting point.<p>When we train people, we literally start from the very issue they work on. Within 15 minutes, we typically find an interesting hypothesis to check for. For example, a dialog could go like this:<p>A: What do you work on?<p>B: A UI refreshing bug.<p>A: What do you think happens?<p>B: I do not know.<p>A: Why are you looking at this specific screen? (this is a key question. people often do not know why this screen and not another. If you have a 250000LOC system, you likely have some 5000 other screens you could potentially look at. Not knowing why this one is potentially interesting is not a good thing)<p>B: Because I think maybe it&#x27;s related to how we subscribe to events.<p>A: How do you expect the event subscription to be like?<p>B: It should always happen in a method called xyz that is provided by the framework.<p>A: In all classes?<p>B: A, no. Just in components.<p>A: Ok, so you want to know the event handling that are not defined in xyz in subclasses of the component superclass.<p>B: A, right.<p>It&#x27;s actually remarkably straightforward. Just try it.')
