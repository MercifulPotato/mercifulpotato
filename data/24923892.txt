Sidetrack and distract to draw eyes to your product, and with smart glasses you always have that opportunity to introduce an advertisement or track gaze on advertisements (&quot;please watch the ad to continue playing the video!&quot; and pausing the ad when you look away is incoming, I assure you).<p>Personally that sort of stuff is where I draw the line, since it&#x27;s a redundant consumer product with things I already own. Technology in recent decades has shown that the only utility it provides is analogous to something that already exists and works fine, because companies would rather ship something fast and &#x27;new&#x27; than something clever that took time to think about. Like the smartwatch: $300 to poorly replicate half the things your phone in your pocket can already do, oh and you have to charge it every day unlike your automatic watch that was powered by your moving wrist alone. Or smart glasses, which would only serve to distract me in the middle of whatever I was doing at the time (probably with increasingly intrusive advertising like we see in every piece of technology in recent decades), and once again, is entirely redundant with 1&#x2F;10th of the functionality that my phone in my pocket can do (including AR).')
