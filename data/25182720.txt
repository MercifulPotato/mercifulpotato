All government business is done in English. Of course you know this, but are merely stating this as some kind of &quot;gotcha&quot;. There is no reason for the US to take anyone who doesn&#x27;t speak English in this day and age, not with a massive backlog of educated, English-speaking, law-abiding people waiting in the queue.<p>&gt; They only harm themselves by not knowing English and usually they try very hard to learn so as to not be at a disadvantage.<p>If only they put as much effort into following the laws of this country.<p>&gt; If they use someone else&#x27;s SSN, the payroll taxes are still being paid, so the taxpayer isn&#x27;t losing out. In fact, it&#x27;s free money for the SSA because they&#x27;ll never have to pay out benefits to most of these people later. (Would you take the risk of claiming Social Security if you were here illegally?)<p>They are criminals committing fraud. It&#x27;s not a victimless crime. What do you think happens to the people who have their SSNs used?<p>&gt; If they get paid cash under the table, there are two parties acting illegally - the employer is also to blame (and possibly, laundering money, which is an additional crime). I don&#x27;t see much vitriol directed against employers though.<p>Then you may hear it right now, businesses that knowingly employ illegal aliens should be prosecuted for breaking the law.<p>&gt; I hear &quot;Build the wall&quot; but never &quot;Shut them down&quot; (for employers who illegally employ undocumented workers).<p>Unfortunately in our current two-party system, the options are &quot;Build the wall&quot; or &quot;Give them all free health care, and a path to citizenship&quot;.')
