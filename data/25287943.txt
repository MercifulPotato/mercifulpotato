They handily destroy biodiversity and emit enormous amounts of carbon at once.<p>We are reforesting land and grow our own veggies. We compost as much of our own waste as possible.<p>We drive a 49 MPG 11 year old vehicle about 6000 miles a year between the four of us.<p>And my neighbours enjoy their free turf, subsidized roads, big-ass Land Rovers, ecological desert lawns, and as an added benefit climate and the connection to their actions _doesn&#x27;t even cross their minds_ while I&#x27;m sitting here agonizing over accidentally introducing plastics to the compost and its impact on earthworms.<p>I&#x27;m tired of being a chump. We need governments to make it more expensive to kill the planet than to not kill it. Unti then every liter of fuel I save is just more for my neighbour&#x27;s second Land Rover.')
