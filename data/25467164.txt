One thing in particular that I learned:<p>&gt;Gliadin epitopes from wheat gluten and related prolamins from other gluten-containing cereal grains, including rye and barley, can trigger celiac disease (CD) in genetically susceptible people<p>It never dawned on me that CD is something that develops with time, and not something that victims are born with.  I.e., if someone who is genetically susceptible to gluten, never consumes gluten during the course of their childhood, they might not ever develop CD.  That&#x27;s fascinating...and it also might explain why cultures that consume rice as a staple grain have lower rates of CD (Asia: .6%).')
