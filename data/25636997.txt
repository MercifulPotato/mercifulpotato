I still use it. It’s still terrible, just slightly less terrible. And, no, messages don’t consistently send in 100ms on the default home server; there are regularly disruptions that cause significant delays, sometimes as much as 10-20sec. That’s a big problem for a federated chat platform.<p>Edit 1: I <i>want</i> to love it; the design is everything I could ever hope for in a chat platform. I even tried to contribute to Vector, but it was such a mess that I eventually gave up.<p>Edit 2:<p>&gt; That said, Element could certainly use less RAM, irrespective of Electron - and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydrogen.element.io" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydrogen.element.io</a> is our project to experiment with minimum-footprint Matrix clients (it uses ~100x less RAM than Element).<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this is a priority.  Techies complain about RAM usage a lot, but if we have to choose between performance+power and a small memory footprint, we&#x27;re going to choose the former almost every time.  Take Telegram, for example: they have a bunch of native clients that perform amazingly well, although they do gobble RAM.  Most of my technical friends use it as their primary social platform.  It&#x27;s not without issues, but it&#x27;s really hard to go from something like Telegram Desktop or the Swift-based macOS Telegram client to Vector.  And those clients aren&#x27;t made by large teams--most (all?) first-party Telegram clients are each maintained by a single developer, if I&#x27;m not mistaken.')
