A billboard can only show one ad at a time with no real targeting. A digital ad can use your browsing history to guess your preferences and show different ads to different users.<p>Digital ads are also right there in front of you, and you can go from ad impression --&gt; sale right there on the screen. If your billboard is on the side of your building, located in some remote office park, well, the reach isn&#x27;t as good.')
