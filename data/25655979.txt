I had a US friend who was a low digits millionaire and a renal failure. He ended up losing all the money for medication and eventually his life. Now compare that to a low or no income person. Medical aid should not be granted put of pity or mercy in this age.<p>sickness and death is&#x2F;are terrible but for much of human history we have had to accept them. now people can live but then have to repay the advanced technology medical complex that saved them with corresponding functional labor and you think it&#x27;s a bug? its measured in tens of thousands of dollars but maybe 1) its worth that much or 2) it costs that much because of all the freeloaders (not sure what value-neutral term you want me to use for people who consume healthcare but don&#x27;t pay for it) that have to be paid for. likely both are somewhat true. I&#x27;m sorry your friend died. Do you think his loss would be any less traumatic if he had been provided a government healthcare system access where one day he just wasn&#x27;t &quot;worth&quot; the medicine it would take to treat him? Surely you understand that all systems involve rationing scarce resources and its reasonable for at least some people to use markets because of their proven success at rewarding commodification of value.<p>&gt; All the capitalism and its ceremony is fine, but without a healthy body or society, who will generate that wealth?<p>Our perspective is that capitalism is the medicine that society needs and has not tried. Surely you agree that regulations proliferate and people are fat, sick, unhealthy, and exploited.')
