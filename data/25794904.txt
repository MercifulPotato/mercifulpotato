Nobody can cross the street in 2 seconds.  So if there isn&#x27;t enough margin of safety to be sure it is safe with the lag, then there wasn&#x27;t enough without it too.<p>Most likely the help was just help find the button and then tell the blind person when the walk light lit up. Most busy intersections have a light for pedestrians, but many do not have any help for the blind. This is very much region specific - when I was in Germany all lights had a beep (in that one city).  I&#x27;ve never heard such beeps elsewhere, but things can and do change faster than I travel to other cities.')
