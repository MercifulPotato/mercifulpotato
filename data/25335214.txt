While most folks would not think of Centos as a desktop OS, we end up using it for our dev workstations as it matches up nicely with production servers.  Christmas time last year, ended up having a bunch of vacation time to burn through and set out on a quest to get a game running on my work rig.<p>The planets aligned with Centos 8, Steam, and AMD drivers somewhere around late January. Things went from crazy difficult to just working.<p>Over the Spring&#x2F;Summer&#x2F;Fall I&#x27;ve seen significant progress on what worked on Windows vs Proton vs native Linux.  A significant chunk of my Steam library now plays on my primary box.  When the day comes where I actually get my hands on a new CPU&#x2F;video card... those will actually go into my workstation.')
