I came to USA on my own, with $700 in my pocket and a partial athletic scholarship (played a D1 team sport). After I finished my undergrad and the sports were gone (in an organized form at least) I also struggled a bit. Unlike you, I made that step and got into grad school. That was probably one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made (even though it didn&#x27;t feel like at the moment). The main reason I&#x27;ve managed to accomplish everything in my life was primarily because of being involved in sports and being competitive in anything that I do, whether it is sports, academia, work or anything else. I believe that a healthy dose of competitive drive is what makes you a better self as you always strive for improvements. It certainly made me a better athlete and a better student.<p>Another thing that you mentioned is that you fell off the track a bit and you are never going to be in the shape you were in college. Trust me on this one, you&#x27;ll hit your prime between 28 and 32 years old. That&#x27;s when you could potentially be your strongest and fastest. And staying in shape is a lot easier than getting in shape. I was lucky that my grad school allowed me a lot of flexibility and I was still able to play my sport on a semi-professional level even after college. Try to find a group&#x2F;community of like-minded people who share your passion for running. That will be your &quot;hobby&quot; and will fulfill multiple things that you are missing in life at the moment (e.g. staying in shape and competing).<p>Having said that, my &quot;quarter life crisis&quot; (or one third life crisis if you will) is kicking-in harder this this time around as I am in my mid 30s and my athleticism is slowly going away. Being in the middle of pandemic is not helping either. I used to be extremely agile, with a 40&quot; vertical jump but this has been on a steady decline due to age and mileage and all the restrictions imposed on sports and gatherings. Still learning how to deal with it.')
