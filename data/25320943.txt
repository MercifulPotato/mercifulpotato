Haskell people will recognize them as akin to what they call type classes.<p>Thus, in P2187 <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wg21.link&#x2F;p2187" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wg21.link&#x2F;p2187</a> we have conditional swap that, for any small- and simple-enough type, is swapped using CMOV instructions instead of a probably badly-predicted branch. This mechanism works in released Gcc-10 today. (Note that what goes into the Standard Library will probably differ, in details, substantially from P2187R5.)')
