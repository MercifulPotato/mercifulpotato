Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603670582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886809, text='IMHO the research community in general is definitely not <i>ignoring</i> intellectual property rights - for natural language processing, there are papers and publication tracks in major conferences specifically about the legal issues of corpora; many researchers are quite painfully aware of all the various legal restrictions that exist.<p>However, the legal environment is very different than in the commercial world or consumer piracy, as it generally involves various legal exemptions (differing between locales) that do allow such usage. For example, I work in NLP research on aspects that involve handling large corpora of copyrighted text. It&#x27;s easier to do it with cooperation of the publishers for various practical reasons, however, we still can and do use also the works of the publishers who would refuse to grant any permission, because local copyright law has specific exceptions that allows the usage these works for noncommercial research purposes. Doing so is not ignoring their rights, their rights are not violated but rather they are limited; their exclusivity right (privilege would be a more appropriate word) to make copies is not absolute. There are even some countries with explicit legal duty for the publishers to provide digital versions of their works to national corpora where they will be used for (among other things) machine learning models.<p>The specific consequence, however, is that we can&#x27;t legally share the full datasets which we are using with the public, like it was done in the original post with this particular dataset, as that <i>would</i> be a violation of the publishers&#x27; commercial rights; we can provide them to specific researchers for limited noncommercial purposes only.  But I <i>can</i> download this dataset or one like this and use it my research legally; just as I can rip up a physical book, scan it, make a digital copy and OCR it, and use it in a research corpus (with copies distributed to other researchers) even if the publisher disapproves.')
