Seems to me you&#x27;re advocating feelings matter more than facts. I believe it would be more accurate to say &quot;police in the United States are killing people for stupid reasons, which is true.&quot; while keeping in mind that those incidents are the exception, not the norm. The police shot 28 unarmed people in 2019. On a population of 320 million.<p>&gt;This paper explores racial differences in police use of force. On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities. <i>On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;fryer&#x2F;files&#x2F;empirical_analysis_tables_figures.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;fryer&#x2F;files&#x2F;empirical_anal...</a><p>&gt;We create a comprehensive database of officers involved in fatal shootings during 2015 and predict victim race from civilian, officer, and county characteristics. We find no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers. Instead, race-specific crime strongly predicts civilian race. This suggests that increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Xppla" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Xppla</a><p>&gt;In 2019 police officers fatally shot 1,004 people, most of whom were armed or otherwise dangerous. African-Americans were about a quarter of those killed by cops last year (235), a ratio that has remained stable since 2015. That share of black victims is less than what the black crime rate would predict, since police shootings are a function of how often officers encounter armed and violent suspects. In 2018, the latest year for which such data have been published, African-Americans made up 53% of known homicide offenders in the U.S. and commit about 60% of robberies, though they are 13% of the population.\nThe police fatally shot nine unarmed blacks and 19 unarmed whites in 2019, according to a Washington Post database, down from 38 and 32, respectively, in 2015. The Post defines “unarmed” broadly to include such cases as a suspect in Newark, N.J., who had a loaded handgun in his car during a police chase. In 2018 there were 7,407 black homicide victims. Assuming a comparable number of victims last year, those nine unarmed black victims of police shootings represent 0.1% of all African-Americans killed in 2019. By contrast, a police officer is 18½ times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;MIoYJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;MIoYJ</a>')
