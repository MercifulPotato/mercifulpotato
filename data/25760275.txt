If you think &quot;aliens!&quot; before &quot;probably a planet&#x2F;bird&#x2F;plane&quot;, you&#x27;re going to forget or ignore lights, squawking, the sound of an engine and so on.  Observer bias.<p>Just look at the Ancient Aliens guy, if you take him at face value, everything is an alien, including piles of rocks on other rocks.<p>Then look at James Randi.<p>And it&#x27;s 2020, everyone has a better camera in their pocket than at any time in history.  Where&#x27;s the evidence?  The &#x27;gimbal&#x27; video has been plausibly debunked.<p>UFOs as alien spacecraft do not exist.  Sorry.<p>We don&#x27;t live in Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy where it&#x27;s full of &#x27;teasers&#x27; that torment some random guy on a farm in the middle of nowhere having flown light-years to get here.<p>UFOs as mis-identified natural or man made phenomena <i>do</i> exist.')
