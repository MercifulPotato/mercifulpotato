I have to say one of the big reasons why Indian men leave behind families at home back in India, is because some of these struggles just can&#x27;t be expected to be shared by their families. It just gets too much after a while, and after that you just have to keep up with it on sheer will power.<p>It takes a toll both on your body and mind.<p>I realize that in order to undergo some struggle analogous to this the American citizens have to undergo Navy Seals training or something. Or they run Ultramarathons just to create the human yearning for struggle and story :) And the attrition rate there is quite high.')
