I&#x27;ve been told I look like a murderer in a professional setting. So to calibrate your expectations.<p>I&#x27;ve only ever been hired by immigrants. Full stop. A good old white person has NEVER hired me directly. In fact, my main experience with white people in a company hierarchy is trying to get me out or take away my just reward.<p>I cannot understand this. I just want to do a good job with people I like to work with. I&#x27;ve never been convicted of a crime, I was in the top 5% of a top ten school, yet I have felt discriminated against my entire career.<p>In 2015 I got sick of it and left.<p>In January, I made 100k off my own endeavours.<p>My suggestion to other ((ethnic)) people is just leave the bubble and make your own way. They will never let you gain a foothold for too long.<p>This is just my experience and likely does not transfer for most. But I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong.')
