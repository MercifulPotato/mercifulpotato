Just a hunch. But also looking at trends on IPv4Auctions.com (now auctions.ip4.global), a few years ago blocks would go for $7&#x2F;address, now they&#x27;re $25&#x2F;address - and as demand for IPv4 addresses won&#x27;t be going away[1] and supply will only decrease (barring rare gluts of supply like AMPRnet&#x27;s when a major &#x2F;21 or &#x2F;16 is broken down into smaller blocks to auction off).<p>I think $100&#x2F;address would be an upper-bound though, because at that point it&#x27;s likely cheaper to finally invest in IPv6 deployment, including issuing new CPE than it costs to retain IPv4.<p>[1] If an ISP could have deployed IPv6 by now then they would have done 5+ years ago. Any ISPs that haven&#x27;t already deployed IPv6 by now (or even 5 years ago) must be facing some massive internal hurdles, such as incompetent management who see it as a massive and unnecessary technical expense when CG-NAT is good-enough for the majority of their customers - or have a hetereogenous network that would be a nightmare to bring up-to-code on any reasonable timescale). The only way these ISPs will upgrade is when the cost of operating an IPv4 network becomes unbearable - hence why I want to see IPv4 address costs skyrocket :)')
