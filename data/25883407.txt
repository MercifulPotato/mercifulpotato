Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611418978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882095, text='The increase in Labour membership was significantly higher than the number of SWP members, and I would guess the number of ex-SWP members as well.  So I don&#x27;t think ex-SWP people were driving that.<p>I saw a lot of pro-Corbyn comments on my Facebook feed a few years ago and they were from comfortably middle-class people.  Lefty and green tendencies, centre-left (not hard-left) types.  Some of them previously Lib Dem supporters.<p>The gist was &quot;at last an honest politician!&quot; and &quot;for the first time in a long time, we have a chance at real socially progressive policies, this one is worth voting for&quot;.<p>In other words Corbyn seemed <i>different</i> somehow, and in a good way.<p>Corbyn gave many people a feeling of hope for a few years, especially young people but including all ages, against an establishment regarded as cruel.  That hopefulness grew into a mass movement to join Labour specifically tied to Corbyn and his policies.  Labour&#x27;s manifesto policies under Corbyn were generally popular, even though it fell apart in 2019 over Brexit and painting Corbyn as a terrorist sympathiser.<p>Now that Corbyn is out of the picture, Labour looks like Tory-lite again, and there&#x27;s not much enthusiasm for current Labour from those who enthusiastically switched to it a few years ago.  It&#x27;s not surprising after the landslide loss in 2019 that the party would change to accommodate what it thinks the electorate will vote for (on balance), and the swell of membership under Corbyn would not like the changed party.')
