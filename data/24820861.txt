If someone rapes you, you are victim of rape. If your collegues assume you are not skilled cause something about your look, you are victim of bias. If your partner is verbaly abusing you, you are victim of that.<p>Thinking you are victim in those situations is using right words instead of building taboos.<p>The moment you admit yourself you was victim of something, you can act on it. If you don&#x27;t, you end up like one of those victims that will ratilnalize their abusers behavior.\nThere is no shortage of women who instead of admitting they are victims and admitting partner is abuser, just don&#x27;t want to be those girls. And they will excuse and rationalize and keep appearances.')
