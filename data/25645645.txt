It doesn&#x27;t in itself incentivize further work (a lot of the music I still regularly pay for was recorded by dead artists in defunct studios, so no incentive short of Frankenstein will compel them to make more) and it may or may not cover the investment the artist&#x2F;studio made in terms of actual work and equipment costs.<p>The up front costs is in creating and recording the music, which consumers could pay for instead of copies. A lot of creative artists are already taking this approach with crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Patreon.<p>Even now, it&#x27;s probably true for most musicians that sales of copies isn&#x27;t particularly lucrative compared to concerts&#x2F;work for hire&#x2F;project contracts, while recordings have an ever increasing number of pockets to line before the artists get their take. It&#x27;s a potentially infinite revenue source, so why not?')
