In practice, Apple&#x27;s closed, walled-garden business model has produced outcomes that I really like. All manner of more open and competition-friendly business models have produced outcomes I find extremely unappealing.<p>My intuition is that many of the things I like about Apple products come from their unique, closed business model. Is something better theoretically possible? Of course. Do I want to risk screwing up one of the few tech giants whose products I can actually stomach by having the government strong-arm them into using a new business model? Not a chance.<p>&gt; You have been presented a single option, and find that you like some aspects of the outcome.<p>No, I have been presented with several options: iOS on an iPhone, Android on phones of all shapes and sizes, and (over the years) various other configurations like webOS, windows phone, and so on.<p>&gt; Right now you seem to have what you consider a benevolent dictator. What happens when the dictates are not as benevolent?<p>Then I&#x27;ll have to switch to a different phone maker.<p>&gt; You desires matter less to Apple than they do to organizations that actually have to worry about users users leaving more. That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s so much you give up if you leave. How long until this is abused? Also, what of those that are already abused because of Apple&#x27;s power? Where Apple makes arbitrary decisions dictated not by the rules they&#x27;ve put forth but by internal business decisions and the desire to prop up their own offerings?<p>These are all trade-offs caused by Apple having total control over the system, and I&#x27;m ok with it.<p>&gt; What about a world where Apple was a clearinghouse for what was allowed on the phone, but followed a very clear set of rules that dictated what was allowed and not, and took a well defined fee to review apps, and allowed App stored to be registered and submit apps for review and apply their own additional rules on top? Wouldn&#x27;t you get most the benefits you like out of that? Wouldn&#x27;t that provide both competition and provide a similar level of security?<p>As above, all of this sounds nice in theory. Maybe it would be great. But I am not interested in forcing Apple to make a change, because I like what I have now and the law of unintended consequences will certainly apply.')
