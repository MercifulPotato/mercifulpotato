By living longer (eg. slowing down aging) it usually means we somehow avoid and&#x2F;slow down the occurrence of these deceases. On a high level this isn&#x27;t something new (eg. working out, not smoking etc), but on a medicine level slowing&#x2F;stopping&#x2F;reversing aging isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s very researched and have just recently started to get some kind of traction.<p>So you&#x27;re correct in your thinking, we don&#x27;t want to increase the duration of life without also increasing the duration of healthy life.<p>Edit: see my other comment with some resources you might find useful&#x2F;informative.')
