But it&#x27;s not such an easy problem.<p>You&#x27;d have to start categorizing apps by how fast they should be (e.g. calendars should start in &lt; 0.5 seconds and use at most 3% CPU on average). Then you may be able to align incentives this way. However then the problem becomes categorizing your apps and having useful categories for everything. Then maybe somebody has an idea for an AI calendar that needs more CPU, but is a lot more useful, because it can predict a host of events. Now they can&#x27;t upload that to the app store.')
