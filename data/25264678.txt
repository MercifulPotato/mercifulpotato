It was not about cheating and getting unfair advantage at all.<p>It was about stopping infinite debate about &quot;what is fair&quot; and &quot;what are ideals rules&quot; just so that one kid can get better grade. E.g. the claim that it is unfair was already motivated reasoning and your teacher perceived&#x2F;treated it that way.<p>I am from former soviet blog and really, what teacher said is normal way to shut up bullshit complains. And yes, there is way more cheating in schools too amd bad teacher can get away with more.<p>But, the notion of fairness is important to both students and teachers.')
