Not too expensive. Very simple walk-in procedure, don&#x27;t need consults. Zero effort. Not permanent (both a con and a pro), but some say their problem doesn&#x27;t come back even after it wears off.<p>Pretty much all other interventions (besides self-awareness&#x2F;lifestyle) are way more involved and don&#x27;t have a great record either way. Nothing is proven about botox either, but seems like the best thing to try first.')
