As of recent fiber connections are getting good in rural areas as well, so people are switching to fiber (40 euros for 100&#x2F;100Mbps, 60 euros for 1000&#x2F;1000Mbps). People who have both 4G router + fiber are quite rare.<p>In my experience some channels on 4G are quite ossified and during peak times you might even get a better throughput on 3G.')
