It&#x27;ll be cheaper and faster, but keeps us dependent on others&quot; or &quot;Do we build our own? It&#x27;ll be slower and more expensive, but we won&#x27;t be dependent on others, and we may be able to compete and recoup our expenses.&quot;<p>Most managers prefer to buy-built wherever they can. It&#x27;s more efficient. But they are happy to &#x27;Build our own&quot; whenever forced to, as they will get the advantages further down the track.<p>The US complains that China doesn&#x27;t buy enough US exports from them, but bans the Chinese from buying the stuff that they actually want. That&#x27;s short-term thinking.<p>China would be quite happy to keep buying cheap US semiconductors, US semiconductor companies would be very happy selling billions of dollars worth of chips to China. WIN-WIN.<p>China is now forced to &#x27;Build Their Own&#x27;. They will do that. Their fabs will be newer. They will cover their own requirements first, then compete with the US chip manufacturers who previously held a monopoly.<p>And the net result? US semiconductor chip manufacturing will go the way of US auto manufacturing, US textile manufacturing, US paper manufacturing, US steel manufacturing, etc.')
