It&#x27;s at least somewhat productive to society. Not hugely, but that&#x27;s academia for you. Even batting 50% is great compared to 0%.<p>These kinds of woke gender studies, socialist, racist, fields etc are a joke. I don&#x27;t accept your implication that only someone inside the nut house are credentialed to evaluate it - if anything those seem like the people least likely to be able to make a clear judgment. These kinds of people are dangerous - they advocate for tearing down the system we have that works pretty well - with no coherent idea of what to replace it with. If they ever got into power we&#x27;d all be screwed.<p>It&#x27;s my opinion that these fields are a net negative to society as a whole, having nothing to do with science or any kind of semi-scientific discipline, and should not receive public funding. They are merely thinly disguised political ideologies. It&#x27;s sad what academia has come to.')
