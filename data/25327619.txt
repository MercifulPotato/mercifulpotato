The first 2 motherboard replacements seemed odd, but I was given a completely new laptop from Apple on the 3rd failure. Just like before, the screen was pure black after clicking the power button and there was a slight fan sound. The only other indication that anything was alive was that the machine would still make an audible chime when plugging in power and the capslock key light could be toggled off and on. So after losing about 2 weeks of my time, &gt;$10,000 in Apple warranty repairs (2 logic boards, new cables, and a complete replacement of a &gt;$7000 computer), troubleshooting input from several Apple Geniuses, level 1 and 2 tech support from Apple Corporate, diagnostic tests at the Apple Store, and diagnostic tests twice at Apple’s repair facility in Texas; what was the root issue?<p>&gt; The screen brightness was turned all the way down (not merely dim, but off).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;macbook-pro-problem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;macbook-pro-problem&#x2F;</a>')
