I have not acted in such a manner, and please cite evidence as to where I am acting that way if you believe otherwise. Basically all I&#x27;m saying is that people should stop turning every freaking conversation about real demographic differences into an ideological witch hunt. It&#x27;s completely off topic and nobody is thinking about such things yet there always has to be some social justice warrior pointing out some &quot;infraction&quot; whoops did I say women are physically weaker than men even though it&#x27;s generally the truth? My bad for being a heathen sexist.<p>&gt;Rather than assume that the balance of demographics in the photos were waited towards that game&#x27;s premise, 50&#x2F;50 split.<p>I assumed the balance was not weighted towards sex. I assumed he picked random set of people where the sex and race were random and only whether or not they were language developers&#x2F;serial killers was the heuristic. It was a mistaken assumption because if the picks were truly random, it is highly unlikely for women to appear in the question set at all (assuming women are unlikely to be serial killers as stated by some people in this thread). Obviously, because two women appeared in the question set, the heuristic is biased for other attributes as the test maker deliberately made sure the question set included two women.<p>Frankly, the test actually masks reality as we know it. Programmers, Language creators and serial killers are highly, highly unlikely to be women.')
