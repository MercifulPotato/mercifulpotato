It was an aesthetic and security disaster but it was also AMAZING.<p>People who wouldn&#x27;t know what HTML meant if their lives depended on it were willing to learn the basics in order to personalize their profiles. Then facebook happened.<p>Even facebook at first was receptive to the idea of some degree of personalizing with facebook apps, but as they grew bigger and powerful it became obvious that total control was the best for their bottom line.<p>Now people have full blown computers in their pockets all the time and all they can think of doing with them is scrolling down and clicking &quot;like&quot; button. This is great for our &quot;AI&quot; revolution because user interaction&#x2F;engagement with computers has been dumbed down to its stupidest form thus by comparison the &quot;AI&quot; seems very smart.')
