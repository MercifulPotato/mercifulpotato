You know this is a gross overuse of the service which was intended for normal users to fill a drink a few times.<p>I think its a little less clear for ISPs where large amounts of data usage is normal for average users but in the case of storage, people dumping petabytes of data they don&#x27;t even care about is clearly misuse. If the drink place stepped in to stop you after 5 drinks that would probably be false advertising.<p>Yes maybe Google was wrong about calling it unlimited and now they are fixing that by making it not unlimited. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that people were actually misusing it')
