There are too many places where the hierarchy isn&#x27;t uniform and there are a bunch of special monads like IO and List. It leads to the same ambiguous &quot;is a&quot; problem of complicated OO hierarchies and is one of the reasons they don&#x27;t compose well.<p>The ironic thing is that these algabraic effect systems have a feel&#x2F;control flow pattern that&#x27;s quite similar to exception handling from the OO languages or interrupt handlers in low-level code.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to just say &quot;this piece of code is impure, it may do X, Y, and Z and if so then ...&quot; than to try and shove everything ad-hoc into the abstract math tree. But then you lose the purity of your language and it&#x27;s really awkward in a language whose primary concern is purity. That may be a reason why algebraic effects seem a bit more natural in OCaml.')
