Going to your own link, Newsweek did not call &quot;GME investors &quot;far-right extremists&quot;&quot;. The article clearly states that far-right extremists were instead using the &quot;stick-it-to-the-man&quot; ethos driving a lot of the GME investor chatter to recruit. There is a huge difference.<p>The point of the article is to associate WSB with far-right extremists. It&#x27;s a common manipulation tactic, they&#x27;re making them seem guilty by association.<p>&gt;As other&#x27;s have pointed out, WaPo published an Op Ed, this was not something under their Editorial Board or a news article. Saying &quot;The Washington Post is comparing the situation to the Capitol riots&quot; is deliberately misleading.<p>People often say that &quot;op-eds don&#x27;t represent the official opinion of the paper&quot;, but it&#x27;s provably false.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of people who are willing to write pro-Trump op-eds, after all, almost half of the country voted for him. How come they aren&#x27;t getting published in NYT, WaPo etc.? Because publishing an op-ed is a soft endorsement. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that they 100% agree with it, but it definitely means that they consider the opinion &quot;acceptable&quot;.')
