Opposed to the popular narrative, the apparent view from people into the social sciences seem to believe it&#x27;s a problem with social technologies, rather than it being the inferior North American cultures bleeding out and corrupting our pure untouched global cultures.<p>I have to agree with the other view that all of us on this planet we are barely evolved hairless tribal monkeys using technology that makes us more anxious instead of secure - and all of these problems are actually pretty predictable from this perspective.  It&#x27;s not Americanification, we just naturally start acting like this when we start using things that make us anxious for clicks.')
