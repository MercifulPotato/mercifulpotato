The most vivid demonstration of this was Wired running two articles within months of each other, one before Trump won insisting that rigging an election that way was impossible and there were endless safeguards protecting against it, and one after he won claiming there were no safeguard and electronic voting machine hacks could easily rig an election, each backed by copious expert opinions, despite no new evidence appearing between the two. More subtly, remember how before Trump the last time electronic voting security was a major mainstream issue with Defcon events etc was when Bush won in 2004, it suddenly returned to prominence with Trump&#x27;s 2016 victory, and now it looks like it&#x27;s becoming a non-issue again.')
