There&#x27;s maybe a little bit of anxiety (what if there&#x27;s an emergency and someone tries to call?) But then of course, they <i>can&#x27;t</i> call because my phone is off and whatever the crisis is it will still be there in the morning.<p>When I wake up and have that urge to check my phone &quot;real quick&quot; to answer some insane question in the middle of the night, I remember that I have to wait while the thing boots up first, so I grumble, roll over, and go back to sleep.')
