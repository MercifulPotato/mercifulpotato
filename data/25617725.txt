Yes hardware is hard!<p>AirGradient focuses on monitoring indoor air quality in schools and offices and operates with a hardware as a service model, i.e. you do not have upfront costs for buying expensive sensor but you get the sensors provided for the duration of the service.<p>I am also running a blog on AirQuality. I created detailed build instructions to build your own powerful air quality monitor (PM, CO2, Temperature and Humidity) which is fully open source and open hardware and I am more than happy to send you PCBs if you want to build it [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;schools&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;schools&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;the-airgradient-diy-sensor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;the-airgradient-...</a>')
