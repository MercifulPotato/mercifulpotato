Some years ago, Nvidia was your only chance to have accelerated graphics on Linux. ATI&#x2F;AMD didn&#x27;t care about it at all, and Intel cards were not for gaming. So Nvidia made it possible to do things in Linux when nobody else allowed you to... how&#x27;s that hindering the progress of anything? Specially when nobody forces you to get an Nvidia card.<p>&gt; And what about AMD bug tracker? It&#x27;s open, so you can see the bugs. That&#x27;s a plus, not a minus. Nvidia blob has all the bugs hidden somewhere, so you don&#x27;t see them. It doesn&#x27;t mean the blob doesn&#x27;t have them.<p>Yes, I didn&#x27;t say Nvidia was bug free. I just said AMD drivers for Linux are, at the moment, far from perfect, despite being opensource. I&#x27;d say, for newer cards, they&#x27;re worse than Nvidia&#x27;s. I value opensource, but if I have to choose between having an opensource desktop crashing twice a day, vs. the Nvidia blob, of course I&#x27;d go for the latter, as much as I&#x27;d love to have a fully opensource OS.')
