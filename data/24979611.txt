If there is any money printing it is immediately can be discerned in high inflation. Which we don&#x27;t have and therefore no money printing is occurring.<p>Flipside, bond rates serve 2 purposes. First, it&#x27;s what the government borrows money at; the second is what everyone else borrows at. These are counter points, if the economy needs boosting you lower rates but at some point the giant pension funds stop buying. This almost always occurs right around where bonds real yields are negative or 0. That is to say the Inflation target of 2% is higher than the bond yields.<p>When those big funds stop buying, like they mostly have at the moment. The central bank is the last place for the government to fund itself. This is a strong sign the country has become bankrupt. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;central-bank-balance-sheet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;central-bank-bala...</a><p>The US government is obviously bankrupt.<p>Inflation is a hidden tax on savings.
