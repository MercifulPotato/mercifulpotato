Either be an impartial host (other than legal requirements) or be a publisher with all the trappings that come with that.<p>No. That is not how 230 works at all. 230 does not add any requirements for web hosts. They don&#x27;t have to conform to some &quot;impartial host&quot; or &quot;publisher&quot; distinction. It just means that websites cannot be sued for illegal content on their platforms, regardless of whether they attempt to remove other similar illegal content.')
