I don&#x27;t know of any other environment that does that.<p>That&#x27;s because no other environment needs to. No other environment eager loads a quarter gig of ram to say hello world. The fact that you need to know at least 16 flags for the JVM with obscure syntaxes to get a basically stable Tomcat server (not Tomcat flags, those are another nightmare) is precisely the problem with Java.<p>&gt; This is a non-issue for backend systems. Barely anyone uses Java for browser-side rendering anymore<p>You&#x27;ve got to be trolling on this one. I&#x27;m definitely not talking about browser-side rendering. Weak backend systems are exactly how Fortune 500 systems get breached over and over and over. This was exactly the cause of the Equifax breach and so many others. You should never think that is ok.')
