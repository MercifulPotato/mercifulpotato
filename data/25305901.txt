This is partially due to not seeing their mouths move but also because their speech seems to be muffled by the mask.<p>I have not had my hearing tested as before face masks were being worn, this issue had not presented itself.<p>I think this might be a common problem and was wondering if anyone is working on a solution or has any ideas of how to resolve this.<p>I am also concerned about what I may be missing in real life conversations due to mask wearing.')
