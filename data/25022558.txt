No one gets or delivers anything they campaign on. This is by design. However, I&#x27;m still in your camp as well. I can&#x27;t understand it at all. He didn&#x27;t get off the first week of his campaign before I was dead refusing to vote for him.<p>However, I couldn&#x27;t vote for his opponents either, which is where I think a lot of people get caught out, and where I think we have a real weakness in our system. That someone like him even got to that point is a testament that apparently anyone can do it. Just be a bull headed, pathologically lying charlatan and find a way to insert yourself in the nations political apparatus when the time is right.')
