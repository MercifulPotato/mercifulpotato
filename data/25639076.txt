In cyber, there are no borders. If something is vulnerable, it&#x27;s vulnerable. You don&#x27;t need the prerequisite of APTs or &#x27;sophisticated nation state cyber threat actors&#x27; or whatever. Attribution is boring these days and so much emphasis on Russia as if we don&#x27;t know already they have their fingers in so many American pies.')
