Supposedly replacing it with one that is more well made or applying some high-voltage silicone putty to it should prevent the sound.<p>Of course, this  DIY solution does not scale well, so it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily help with a room full of CRTs with bad flyback transformers.<p>EDIT: the voltages involved are potentially lethal')
