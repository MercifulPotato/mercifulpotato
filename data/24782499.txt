I only really have a few artists I may listen to on a more frequent basis, but other than that I am usually just using random playlists from Spotify that fit my mood rather than spending time making my own.<p>However I have been having a couple issues. Everything was working fine, but then I started using Spotify at the gym almost daily for workout music. The music genres I like to listen to while working out are <i>vastly</i> different from what I listen to at home. To further compound this problem I often listen to podcasts in the car and don&#x27;t listen to Spotify much at home. So a good chunk of my usage of Spotify is listening to music at the gym. As such my recommendations are complete garbage. I don&#x27;t care to be suggested music related to gym music as I just pull up random playlists anyway. But what I do want is suggestions for what to listen to when I am at home. Problem is that Spotify has no incognito mode or any way to tell it to &quot;ignore this from recommendations&quot;.<p>That was actually one of the biggest draws for me was using stuff like &quot;Discover Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Made for you&quot; stuff. But now it is essentially useless for me. Now I have been trying to transition to Plexamp as I already use Plex. My problem is that now I have zero suggestions of what new songs to acquire and I feel stuck.')
