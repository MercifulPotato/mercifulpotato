If you already have a compatible one, you can use it at no additional cost. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll have to pay for the IdP.<p>This setup allows you to offload MFA handling to your main IdP with the added bonus of using the same method of authentication, possibly integrated into your OS (for example if using Windows Hello &#x2F; AzureAD).<p>At work, we use Azure AD as the IdP for AWS SSO and it works fairly well, aside from Azure&#x27;s crappy (inexistent) support of security keys outside of Windows.<p>There is one gotcha with an easy workaround: the SDKs don&#x27;t usually support the login part of the SSO flow, and sometimes don&#x27;t support it at all (terraform comes to mind). To work around this, I&#x27;m aware of two tools you can use:<p>* aws-vault [1], which I personally use and works great for setting the required environment variables, no need to actually have it handle any sort of key<p>* aws-sso-util [2], which I&#x27;ve seen recommended but never tried<p>---<p>[0] It may be an issue if you need to use the managed ActiveDirectory service, which needs to be in the same region<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;99designs&#x2F;aws-vault" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;99designs&#x2F;aws-vault</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benkehoe&#x2F;aws-sso-util" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benkehoe&#x2F;aws-sso-util</a>')
