Next, the ballot reader machine reads the QR code, not the human readable portion.<p>Assuming this is true, it would be simple to modify the printing software such that the QR code vote is different from the human readable vote.<p>A recount, by running the paper ballots through the machine again, would come up with the same result as the first time.<p>The only way to catch it would be to hand-count the paper ballots and compare the results to the machine counted votes.<p>Really though, the QR code should be eliminated, so that the voter is able to personally verify what the machine will actually read.')
