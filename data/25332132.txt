Dell sells just a few more. I don&#x27;t know that I would say they are dominant, after a release of a single low power, high performing part.<p>What many in the Apple ecosystem are missing is the steady, rapid improvement in performance and efficiency coming from AMD, who apparently few have heard of, because only Intel CPUs were found in Apple for 14 years (and we&#x27;re not all gamers!)<p>In early 2020, AMD released massively dominate laptop CPUs, but OEMs have only tepidly adopted them. It looks like about 20% of notebooks are now being sold with AMD, and that number is going to grow in 2021, as  the lead time for new designs using AMD will have elapsed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3569437&#x2F;amds-notebook-pc-share-climbs-to-an-all-time-high-of-nearly-20-percent.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3569437&#x2F;amds-notebook-pc-sha...</a><p>I&#x27;m not saying these AMD chips are better than Apples - the battery life is at best half!<p>Although, I can&#x27;t help but read your comment as satire! &quot;What if PC components were modular!&quot; I also enjoy building sets from LEGO bricks, and putting together my computer from parts!')
