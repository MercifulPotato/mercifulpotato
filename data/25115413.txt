Looking through a dozen restaurant&#x27;s websites to hunt down all that info (and hoping it&#x27;s current) is a pretty miserable experience. Yelp makes it trivial to filter on a map.<p>Restaurants have two SEO problems: their particular restaurant and the generically hungry searcher. Yelp and co only have the latter. They are, as you say, outclassed.')
