This isn&#x27;t a UI team where people are just changing the format willy nilly, they are making these changes for legitimate reasons. Sometimes the &quot;simpler&quot; solution isn&#x27;t as simple and reliable as one would think from just guessing. They actually test this stuff and seek more reliable solutions.
