(Usually TCP&#x2F;IP itself is 10k LOC so this is pretty impressive.)<p>The basic idea that Alan Kay has presented in his many similar YouTube presentations (most of which run with that office application) is what we call today domain-specific languages, you write the rules for antialiasing a pixel in whatever the ideal language would be for those rules: you just imagine that you have a dream language and &quot;wishful think&quot; the solution: then you go and you reimplement that DSL in another language that you are wishfully conjuring, a language-language, and that final one can become self-describing and can compile and optimize itself.<p>This is also a method of programming advocated in MIT&#x27;s old SICP lectures, which will also cover the implementation of Lisp in itself, which is sort of a prerequisite for it.<p>That all said, I would love to read the source code someday but I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere, the software product may be the KSWorld that was described in [1].<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vpri.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;tr2013002_KSonward.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vpri.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;tr2013002_KSonward.pdf</a>')
