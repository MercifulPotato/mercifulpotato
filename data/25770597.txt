Item(by='ekianjo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610587877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752660, text='&gt; where the goal was to overturn the results of an election<p>If that was really the goal you&#x27;d think they would have gunned up a little more than they did. Instead, very few people were actually armed, so that seems rather disorganized for an actual coup.<p>&gt; A lot of people supported BLMs pre-violence protests because they wanted police held accountable.<p>So protesting for police violence makes it OK to loot stores and burn cars that have nothing to do with it? How is that EVER ok? If you condemn violence you need to condemn violence no matter who instigates it, not only when it&#x27;s very convenient for one to do so. because this is exactly what was happening 6 months ago, people cheer-leading the violence on Twitter if it was BLM related.')
