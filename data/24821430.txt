In places like Thailand they try to identify the infected and then put them in separate quarantine facilities rather than making them stay home where they can infect others. The local transmission there and places like Vietnam with similar policies is now basically zero. There&#x27;s a bit of an imposition on your freedom if you get quarantined - I did there but it&#x27;s only 2-4 weeks and only like 0.01% of the population so overall it&#x27;s probably less of an imposition than the half arsed mess we have in England where I now am. Also the deaths have been like 1000x less.')
