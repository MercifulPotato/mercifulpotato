Any ideas?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='As the title suggests, my outlook.com account has been suspended due to violations. However, I can&#x27;t find any reference in their terms and conditions to my specific violation.<p>The reason is that I use NordVPN to connect to the internet.<p>Any ideas? I can&#x27;t do anything without that account as changing my email on many services requires access to my old email.<p>Over the years I have read many stories on here of this happening to people, mainly on Google services, and it pretty much stops them dead in their tracks... well, now it&#x27;s happened to me.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it over the last several days and, legitimately, the only possible recourse is to run your own email server. Now this has it&#x27;s own issues but it means I have (almost) total control over my data.<p>Anyway, as the title suggests, any ideas? I just need to get it reinstated so I can move all my email away from it now.')
