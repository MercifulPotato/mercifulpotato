What we need right now is a test to determine who that sub-10% are below the age of 60 that will get severe symptoms or worse, and isolate them as well.<p>We have no idea how successful a vaccine will be. If it&#x27;s 50% successful, that means that people will be getting Covid-19 regardless, so it seems we might as well front load the infections now.<p>In addition, recently they found a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 with a mutation in the spike protein. If the spike protein mutates enough such that the vaccine no longer works, then we really have no choice but to reach herd immunity.')
