Adobe wanted (and tried hard for a while) to make PDF the defacto way to use the web.  Instead of authoring HTML you&#x27;d publish PDFs.  Links would take you to other PDFs within Acrobat Reader.  Acrobat Reader was the browser they wanted people to use, before anyone knew what a browser was.  So, they had to have Acrobat Reader support all of those content types.<p>For Adobe I give full marks for cajo√±es and long term thinking, but I&#x27;m gonna have to deduct points for the closed nature of it all.')
