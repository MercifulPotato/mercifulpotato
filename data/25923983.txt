I also was diagnosed with multiple types of arrhythmia.<p>If it were not for the US government, I would not be alive. I am a dual US|EU citizen, and while being American is naturally a huge part of my identity, I would not be afraid to renounce my US citizenship. The only reason why I do not is because the US literally saved my life and others with the disease I have, worldwide.')
