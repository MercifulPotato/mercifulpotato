But it&#x27;s also important to have a good API for managing a domain&#x27;s delegation and ownership information, so that you can ensure all your domains are managed consistently. Just pointing the DNS for a domain at a good DNS provider doesn&#x27;t help with managing its delegation if the registrar is crappy.')
