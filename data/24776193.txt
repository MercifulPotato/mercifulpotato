Fixtures trump mocks and fakes.<p>Having multiple tests fail for the same reason is a waste of effort, either now or in the future (when new features are added or the constraints otherwise change).<p>Sometimes you have to depend on transitive properties to keep your test sizes down. If a function received the data, and the function has been tested thoroughly, why test it again while testing the callers?')
