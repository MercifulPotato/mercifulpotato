After that it&#x27;s a matter of synchronizing things on the bluetooth GUI and if you don&#x27;t want the obvious setup, deciding where the sound goes to on the mixer GUI.<p>But well, when I brought my current earplugs the mic didn&#x27;t look like it was working on my (Android) phone and searched the web for it, I discovered that many lines of JBL plugs aren&#x27;t supported on Windows by default. There are devices that only fail to work on Teams, or Skype, some only work on those applications, some reproduce anything except audio from videos (all issues confirmed by the manufacturer).')
