This kind of &quot;war with words&quot; scares away a whole other world of speech that could never happen in it&#x27;s wake.<p>There are many games people play in conversation.  Nothing about preventing &quot;tough arguing&quot; actually gives way for &quot;principled actor[s] in the discussion.&quot;<p>In fact, &quot;tough arguing&quot; is probably the MOST-desirable game, because it&#x27;s the least disingenuous.  The value of conversations can go negative when someone is using socially-acceptable bullying or just plain lying and manipulating.  And the people using those tactics will leverage the norms of polite conversation to outright avoid&#x2F;dodge being called out.')
