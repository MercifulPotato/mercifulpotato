It&#x27;s silent, it accelerates instantly, it&#x27;s cheaper to operate because electricity is cheaper than gas, and I never have to waste my time going to the gas station. Can&#x27;t travel cross country, but I haven&#x27;t done that in a decade and I&#x27;d want to rent a larger car for a road trip anyway.')
