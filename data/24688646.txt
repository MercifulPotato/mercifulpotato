You can&#x27;t just stick a mute button on a smart speaker and say it&#x27;s the same UX as phones now.<p>&gt; How many people that refuse to have a smart speaker also refuse to have a smart phone?<p>If somebody is avoiding a smart speaker out of privacy concerns, but they have an always-on voice assistant on their phone, the correct response to their concerns is not to tell them to stop worrying about smart speakers. The correct response is to educate them about their phone settings so they can change them and exercise more agency over their lives.')
