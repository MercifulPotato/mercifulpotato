Every entry on your list has it, so it will arrange itself into a column across all entries.<p>Edit #1 - in fact, I&#x27;d drop media&#x2F;github account names and format the account info in a table. [icon count] [icon count] [icon count]. If there&#x27;s no, say, Twitter account, then show [icon -], both in gray. This will make the info easier to scan and digest.<p>Edit #2 - in the Filters popup, if I understand it correctly, one is expected to click on the label to enable a filter. I&#x27;d add at least an &quot;:hover&quot; state to labels then, because right now they do not look actionable at all. Also the popup jerks left-right when toggling the first filter. It&#x27;s a minor thing, but still a bit annoying.')
