Your complaints have nothing to do with what the author offered:<p>&quot;Many people who don&#x27;t really enjoy cars are now...&quot;<p>&quot;Even those who enjoy driving should not be allowed to have too much fun and take risks on public roads&quot;<p>You&#x27;ve conflated the author&#x27;s story into something entirely different in order to complain about something that has nothing at all to to with what the author was sharing.<p>You know, if you look for something to complain about everywhere you look you will always find something to complain about. That is one of the easiest things ever to do.<p>I think you should re-read that article with the intent to learn and feel and experience what they&#x27;re sharing because it&#x27;s not about you, and you completely missed what it is about.')
