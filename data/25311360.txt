On the contrary, without those jobs, the situation of those families would be even more perilous.<p>Well maybe if the parents would be paid a bit more these kids would be given a chance to fair better in life by going to school. What is that comment? demand for lower priced clothes, &quot;infinite growth&quot; and investors always demanding higher returns absolutely causes all that child exploitation.<p>Your comment is either ignorant or downright dismissive of a problem directly caused by us, western consumers.<p>It&#x27;s akin to saying &quot;at least the slave is fed&quot;, exact same puritan mindset.')
