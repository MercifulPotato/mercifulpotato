Republican leaders and officials have jumped on the misinformation train and are now peddling unfounded claims of election and voter fraud. Twitter keeps suppressing those tweets and tagging them as fake, this in turn makes the Republicans mad because they can&#x27;t spread what they see as reality.<p>Ignoring the fact that Republicans are the source of most of the misinformation you see online right now might make it seem like they are being censored, but in reality it&#x27;s just cleaning up what can only be described as dishonest, anti-democratic and delusional lying.')
