Item(by='ryanmercer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611885782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950415, text='&gt;Silver has been shorted and held low<p>As recently as 2011 spot was as high as $56.28, it&#x27;s $26.29 right now and was $14.28 last March.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with that statement.<p>&gt;Why are you afraid if Silver goes higher?<p>Never said I was. &#x2F;r&#x2F;silverbugs is for stacking, it&#x27;s a hobby for the vast majority of us, we hold physical silver. So hundreds of people trying to get rich quick day trading after seeing articles about GameStop flooding the sub to tell us to buy SLV has nothing to do with our community and, in fact, most people in our community swear by &quot;if you don&#x27;t hold it, you don&#x27;t own it&quot;, so it actually goes against our communities general beliefs.<p>Reminds me of the schmucks that seemed to pop up in every forum on the internet 15ish years ago saying to buy the Iraqi Dinar. Oh, and you know, the idiots that push penny stocks to make a quick buck off of uneducated people that have fallen for the FOMO crap that is spread by the people trying to make a quick buck.')
