It&#x27;s the same problem that has been going on for non-captioned videos for years.\nIf a captioning service is going to be exclusive to only Google Meet or Teams, then by definition, it&#x27;s not inclusive.<p>So when we come on Zoom with my parents, they use Ava <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ava.me" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ava.me</a> to caption what I say with their speakers on. \nIt looks like a caption bar, floating on top of the screen, so when I share my screen they can still see captions.<p>My dad started using Ava at work where they use GoToMeeting. They just won&#x27;t move to Zoom easily so he gets access without having to shift the whole company on it.<p>The software also separates who says what neatly if you share a link in the chat and people connect to it. Also voices out what&#x27;s typed on the other end.')
