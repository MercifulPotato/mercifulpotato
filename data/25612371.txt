Don&#x27;t hire at the same time. Easy.<p>This is not realistic and quite frankly bad suggestion.<p>&quot;Yeah, we would hire you next week, but since manager is on vacation we can hire you only in three weeks.&quot; Said no-one ever.<p>And what&#x27;s the problem in taking those first two weeks to just slowly get to know the code and get to know your workmates? If I had a situation like that I would be thankful that I don&#x27;t get shoved into work immediately and can take my time.')
