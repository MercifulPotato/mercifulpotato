I&#x27;ve lived in Bulgaria for most of my life(with the exception of around 4-5 years during university). Back in the day when I was a kid and teenager(think 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s) gypsies were a big problem. I remember one summer when everyone went away for a holiday and there was just me and my mum in a 300 meter radius for around two weeks. A house was getting robbed every night during those two weeks. And we are talking pretty much the center of the capital.<p>That said, at some point(not sure when or how) that all changed. Now in the day-to-day life, gypsies cause no harm whatsoever. They are a minority and as such I have very little interaction with them but in the few instances I&#x27;ve had, they&#x27;ve always been very warm and kind and the once I&#x27;ve worked with have been incredibly hard working and devoted.<p>But even though I see a huge improvement, we need to look back a bit to see the root cause: I had the chance to meet some of my grand-grand parents and they all had roma friends when they were young in the early 20-th century. However there have been huge political campaigns against them(both socially and economically) between 1944 and 1989(even though those were flowered up as &quot;integration&quot; programs). I think what we see now is one of the many scars the regime left behind.')
