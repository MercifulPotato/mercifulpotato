The source code is still open source, but you should pay for re-selling or providing hosting services around it. They have salaries to pay. Period.<p>Too many open source &quot;believers&quot; find themselves out of pocket, taking time away from their families and lives, only for companies like Amazaon and other WAANKs out there to make billions in profit. Time for this to stop. Starve them of your hard work and make them pay if they want to use your software. For sharing knowledge, code can still be freely readable, but should not be free of charge.')
