It&#x27;s incredibly apparent from just outside the bubble (or half-in it like in Canada).<p>Every country with a heavily controlled media, with a people indoctrinated with a nationalistic fairy tale is having the same problems with the internet breaking down the old singular media narrative. The heavier the controls were, the larger the societal shock now.<p>It&#x27;s ... touchy. We have all learned in the last couple years how to empathize with our American friends who just learned about Tucson or the MOVE bombing or something we learned in school that they just learned about from a superhero show or an apology. It&#x27;s fine to blame it on your schools, it is definitely a bad move to mention the actual cause.')
