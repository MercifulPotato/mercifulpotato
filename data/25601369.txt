The one thing that&#x27;s frustrated me is the relative black box that my browser represents, and writing a shim between my WM and browser tabs has been on my TODO list for a long, long time (through a couple of aborted attempts due to a combination of Chrome&#x27;s at-the-time obsolete documentation and probably-necessary security model).<p>I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic that this is going to represent a dramatic step function in ease-of-use of my OS, in the same way that i3 was.<p>EDIT: I should clarify that I did read the author&#x27;s note that this is experimental, not secure, etc. I&#x27;m mainly just excited about having a jumping-off point to play around with and possibly hack on a little.')
