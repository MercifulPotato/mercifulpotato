I love the traditional cooking AND American-style &quot;Chinese&quot; food. I have never had problems with the MSG in these, but I have had headaches after downing too much brewer&#x27;s yeast and a broth made with a philipinno soup packet one time. Do you know what both of these have in common? It&#x27;s Glutamate, which is an excitotoxin in excess amounts. Too much of that stuff absolutely will hurt your head.')
