They will not be translated, at least not initially.<p>But that&#x27;s the easiest part! I understand the part about translations becoming stale, and how it&#x27;s hard to manage, but honestly, translating a UI isn&#x27;t that hard.<p>I think a good recipe to get better translations is:<p>- Don&#x27;t treat it as an aftertought. Co-locate the en-US assets with the translated versions, that way your contributors <i></i>actually see<i></i> that there are other languages to support. Each page on the MDN website should be a folder containing a file for each language.<p>- If a translation is out-of-date, link to these more recent languages, and offer an auto-translated version in the meantime. Importantly, <i></i>let the user switch between the automatic translation and the manual one<i></i>. Also, make it obvious how they can contribute.')
