Like... we can&#x27;t re-engineer our power systems to resist being taken out by this, can we? Likely wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective, I imagine.<p>BTW, its not mentioned in the article, but are the effects temporary or permanant? I imagine the GPS errors are temporary but it also mentions that it can take out power grids... will it just be a short, forced shutdown for a few hours (rimworld players: I&#x27;m wondering if its just like the &quot;solar flare&quot; event).')
