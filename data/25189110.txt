What I read somewhere is that the early Unix team (some of whom had just come off the Multics project) got the full use of a spare minicomputer that was in the Labs, to build an early protototype of Unix (may or not be the first one), only by promising their manager that they would build text processing software on top of it that would be useful for the Labs&#x27; patent and other text processing work. And they delivered. Some of that work became a software suite  called Writer&#x27;s Workbench, IIRC, and some of it became the powerful Unix command line filters and such that we still love and use today, such as cut, paste, join, diff, tr and more - &quot;more&quot; as in &quot;etc.&quot;, not the pager tool, although maybe that one too, ha ha.')
