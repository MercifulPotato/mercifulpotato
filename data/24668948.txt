Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601691363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664348, text='&gt; For at least one instant, in the hypothetical we had $1,000,000 in ill-gotten gains.<p>Highly debatable. What does it mean to &quot;have&quot; $1,000,000? Is there even such a thing as instantaneous net worth? Being a millionaire for a brief instant with no ability to use the money seems a lot like having $0.<p>Regardless, this just demonstrates that the bank robbery analogy is flawed. It&#x27;s not illegal for the president to access the classified national security information. How he uses that information is where the crime may have occurred.<p>So perhaps a better analogy is armored car drivers transporting the money. They&#x27;re allowed to possess the money. They&#x27;re not allowed to do whatever they want with it, like, say, lend it out for profit.')
