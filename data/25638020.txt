Printing money without increasing value will not last. It has already damaged our economy and made us dependent on states that have not shutdown (some with terrible human rights violations like the CCP government).<p>It should be clear it&#x27;s a means of control, used as an excuse by World Economics Form to continue with their plans for debt reset (only for certain people of course; Bezos and Gates won&#x27;t have their wealth affected to devalued, just everyone under a certain income range).<p>I agree. This is insane and it bothers me few people on HN see it as such. There is no room for discussion on this forum for the true weight and reality of what we are seeing unfold.')
