Short-term rates in Denmark are -0.6%. Couldn&#x27;t banks just borrow short, write mortgages at 0% and pocket 60 basis points?<p>It&#x27;s a little screwy, because you&#x27;re getting paid the lenders instead of the borrowers. But it&#x27;s still fundamentally no different than a bank that borrows at 2.5% and writes mortgages at 3% APR.')
