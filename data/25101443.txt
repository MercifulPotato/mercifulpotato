Now I only interact with Reddit through Apollo (iOS app) which allows me to add heavy filters, removing most subreddits and removing posts containing certain keywords. Anytime I see any FUD content on a subreddit I block it, which includes all political subreddits and almost all big subreddits. In addition I have a time limit set on my phone to avoid looking at it too frequently, and because of all the filters almost all FUD content is blocked and what remains is mostly hobbyist stuff and cute animal pictures. I have blocked it on my laptop using the hosts file to avoid even opening it there.<p>It&#x27;s a sad state but I feel that <i>heavy</i> filters are essentially required for healthy social media&#x2F;internet consumption nowadays. The amount of FUD is out of control, and directly responsible for a ton of social unrest and depression in many people.')
