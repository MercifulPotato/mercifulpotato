They team add a lot of good ideas IMHO, even though the game suffers from micro transactions (good luck to newcomers).\nIn particular:\n* they have a soft population limit with a cooldown increasing with the number of units on the map. This make it harder to snowball, and make it easier to punish people spamming a unit. Also it keeps the number of units to micro manageable.<p>* economy is auto-ramping. You  only chose the number of collector. I think this could use some balancing and more experimentations. But it changes the dynamic of the game over time from money being the limiting factor to pop cap. Even if the two players play very aggressively.<p>* Also the game is not about destroying opponent base (you cam still win this way) but about controlling some map zones. Controlling the &quot;pads&quot; charges a nuke missile, but the missile can flip hand 1 second before firing. This builds up a lot of intensity and makes timing very important in the gameplay. Knowing when you should stale the charging or fasten it, and how much you should pay for this is hard to master.')
