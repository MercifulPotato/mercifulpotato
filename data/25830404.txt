(and I have for a while argued that we should give every person without a residence one so they have access to basic digital services). It&#x27;s for sure easier than to bring bank services to them. Also, stealing digital money is much harder than stealing cash, which is very easy to steal.<p>There&#x27;s obviously problems with this, mostly revolving around identity, but that&#x27;s true for all forms of banking. But getting someone a phone and an account and being able to trivially send them money is pretty safe and realistic to set up.')
