There is a bit of once burnt, twice shy. I learned when first moving out to go to the dollar store to fill my apartment; bathroom trash can, shower curtain rings, kitchen cups&#x2F;plates, toilet brush. Then upgrade what doesn&#x27;t work (paper-thin shower curtains will billow with the steam and stick to you). It wasn&#x27;t as wasteful as I had expected and I saved a lot of money compared to just buying everything from the average retail store.<p>Even Wal-Mart plays on this by stocking name brands here and there.')
