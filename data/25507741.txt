Item(by='credit_guy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608653624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506737, text='&gt; I think 50% workers around do not negotiate.<p>That&#x27;s probably correct. And lest anyone reading this makes the rash decision to &quot;negotiate&quot; for a higher salary next time they have a meeting with their boss: negotiation without alternatives is just begging. If you tell your boss give me more money because I&#x27;m such a great guy and I work so hard, he&#x27;ll just say he&#x27;d love to, but it&#x27;s not up to him, etc. If you tell him that you have another job offer, and you are seriously inclined to leave, then you&#x27;re actually talking serious negotiation.<p>Morale of the story: best way to prepare for negotiation is to prepare for interviews.')
