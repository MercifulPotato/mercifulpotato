And just as you claim you can&#x27;t soley consider the cost of a plant, you can&#x27;t solely consider the smokestack emissions of a plant without consider the mining, enrichment, handling, and disposal of nuclear.<p>Germany has a large CO2 output because they have a large manufacturing industry, and for policy reasons technically decoupled from their investment in solar, they also maintain production capacity of a dirty type of coal as power source because they have it in abundance within their own borders, its a security interest.<p>If you think your armchair analysis has outsmarted the energy industry then go ahead and invest in fossil and nuclear i guess.')
