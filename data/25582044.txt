Thank you for putting that into words!<p>I am amazed that there&#x27;s so much hypocrisy around different <i>categories</i> of violence in fiction. It&#x27;s even worse than other manifestations of hypocrisy, because this one seems completely invisible to people — I don&#x27;t recall having seen this discussed anywhere until I read your comment today.<p>Case in point: when <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_Serbian_Film" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_Serbian_Film</a> came out, there was so much talk about it being immoral and&#x2F;or illegal, and so many (eventually successful) calls to boycott, censor and ban. I have <i>not</i> watched the film, and I do <i>not</i> think I&#x27;ll ever watch it, because judging by what I read about it, it seems utterly disgusting and horrifying. Disgusting to the level of scenes depicting the raping of a newborn, and the most imaginative mix of necrophilia, torture, rape, and gore. I think I could not stand it, and if I forced myself to watch it, I suspect I&#x27;d have nightmares (literally). So what follows is by no means a defence of this particular work, nor an endorsement of gloating over the most extreme and shocking forms of violence an artist&#x2F;performer can conceive.<p>At the same time, there are <i>so</i> many depictions of violence in mainstream film, games, TV and literature. By far, most of that violence is done <i>to</i> male characters (and incidentally, also <i>by</i> male characters). That violence is usually <i>not</i> sexual in nature.<p>As Vladimir Nabokov put it, art <i>has</i> to be transgressive and shocking.<p>One more idea to consider: violence (as most things) comes in gradations. Murder &gt; torture &gt; punch &gt; pinch. Rape &gt; harassment. Actual violence &gt; threat of violence. Violence to several people &gt; violence to one. Sadistic violence &gt; plain violence &gt; violence as self-defence &gt; physically restraining an aggressor. Violence committed taking advantage of physical superiority &gt; violence among equals. Etc. There is no gradation, however, contingent on the sex of the victim nor on the sex of the perpetrator: violence towards men ≡ violence towards women.<p>Why then, it is so controversial to depict rape or sexual abuse, but so commonplace to rejoice in depictions of murder, torture and physical aggression?')
