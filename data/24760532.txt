I get plenty of spam calls from entities I&#x27;m in a relationship with - like my mobile operator or my bank[0]. It&#x27;s one of the reasons my phone is on silent during the day[1]. The problem with those is the usual fake &quot;market choice&quot;: every mobile operator and bank is pulling this crap, so I don&#x27;t abandon mine, because alternatives are no better.<p>Then there are occasional random scams calling in - most common recently is &quot;your number has been randomly selected as a winner and you&#x27;re eligible for ${insert useless reward that&#x27;s just a bait for scam here}&quot;. But none of them, ever, tried to call late at night. If they did, I&#x27;d file a complaint.<p>--<p>[0] - The most annoying spam call from a bank was an upsell that happened last year. I was doing the usual checkup on my account balances via their web page, and out of curiosity decided to check out what they have on the &quot;offers&quot; tab. I clicked to the tab, skimmed the list of loan and investment offers, and got back to managing my money. The next day, a marketer calls, trying to upsell me some credit. When pressed, he straight up admitted that I got flagged in the system because I clicked on the &quot;offers&quot; tab and didn&#x27;t buy anything. As you can imagine, the next time the bank called to take a &quot;quality of service&quot; survey, I said a lot of words about what I don&#x27;t like about their service.<p>[1] - I have a smartwatch that vibrates when I get a call, giving me an unobtrusive way to look at the number and reject it without taking the phone out.')
