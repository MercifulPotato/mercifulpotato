I start most of my apps when I boot my machine and I rarely if ever close any of them or turn my machine off.<p>I care about how fast said applications do their job, that they remain responsive and don&#x27;t suffer from instability.<p>Maybe I am just old&#x2F;desktop user. My machine is a 9900K + 32GB RAM which is definitely fast but it&#x27;s not absurd. With this amount of RAM I never feel the need to close anything other than to tidy up my list of open tabs so I can see the icons without scrolling again.')
