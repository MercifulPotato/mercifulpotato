Item(by='shawxe', descendants=None, kids=[25080032], score=None, time=1605248974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079399, text='&gt; To be fair, if this was truly a big deal, it would be a political issue with bipartisan support and taken care of short order.<p>Are you serious?  Since you&#x27;re using the term bipartisan, I&#x27;m going to assume you&#x27;re also from the US.  Have you been following the news&#x2F;current events recently (and by recently, really I mean any time at all over the course of the past forty or fifty years)?  Almost nothing actually gets &quot;bipartisan&quot; support these days.  Our government is in a constant state of gridlock and it is next to impossible to get anything done.<p>&gt; In times of strife, at least there&#x27;s one thing you can always count on: Democracy. It never fails. If you can just remember that one thing, you should be able to sleep soundly at night. (It works for me at least, I used to be a constant worrywart until I learned this trick from my therapist, and I&#x27;ve been golden ever since.)<p>I&#x27;m really having a hard time telling if this comment is sarcastic.  I&#x27;m not trying to cause you to lose sleep or anything, and honestly, I commend your optimism if you&#x27;re serious, but the fact is that democracy is an abstract concept that is almost never put into practice perfectly.  Even if democracy&#x27;s promise of &quot;most people being happy&quot; meaning 51 people are happy while 49 people are not is actually sufficient, even that idealized version is very far from our actually political system in the United States.<p>I think one thing most Americans actually would agree with is that the way we do things here, right now, in terms of government, doesn&#x27;t work so well.  I think there is a lot of disagreement about what should change, and how, but it seems like very few people are satisfied with the current state of affairs.  The more I think about it, the more I think this comment just has to be sarcastic, so this reply is probably a waste of everyone&#x27;s time, but in any case, wow.  I wish what you were saying here were actually true.  That would be a nicer world to live in than this one (although, frustrating as it might be at times, this one is also not so bad).')
