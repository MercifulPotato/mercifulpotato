Indeed, what makes Google’s contention that “The competition is only a click away” so infuriating is the fact it is true.<p>&gt; What matters more is the context laid out by Letwin: there is a strain of political thought in America, independent of political party (although traditionally associated with Democrats), that is inherently <i>allergic to concentrated power — monopoly in the populist sense, if not the legal one.</i><p>&gt; <i>Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits</i> and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.<p>&gt; <i>In other words, this subcommittee report is simply a new expression of an old idea; the details matter less than the fact it exists.</i><p>I think this reflects a lot of discourse I&#x27;ve seen on HN -- one commenter condemning Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;etc. for being a monopoly, and a second commenter observing the company doesn&#x27;t meet the legal standard of a monopoly, but it&#x27;s like both sides are talking past each other.<p>It&#x27;s because most people don&#x27;t actually care about the meaningful technical definition of a monopoly -- they just don&#x27;t like it when companies get too big, period. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s something inherently satisfying when the big guy gets knocked down, the idea that being big is bad <i>in and of itself</i>.<p>I think that&#x27;s a really valuable observation that Stratechery makes.')
