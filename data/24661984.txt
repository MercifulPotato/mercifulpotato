The murder of effective discussion and thought.<p>I agree that it is a big problem. In some ways we are the most educated civilizations in the history of mankind and yet public discourse is the stupidest it has ever been. I think this happens also [1] because everything we said is taken out of context, therefore only the simplest ideas can travel among the public.  Imagine that you are a politician that want to disagree with their own party, what do you think people will hear more probably:\n1) they are a traitor\n2) they fully support our cause, however they disagree with this particular course of action because X<p>Without spaces and community in which we can discuss freely and with trust, complex opinions are difficult to form and defend.
