I’m not aware of any.</i><p>I feel that argument does not hold water.  Nobody says “second month” or “month two” in English, everyone says “February”.  So it sometimes happens that a number is assigned to something, but nobody uses the number in regular speech.<p>I feel that the ground floor is similar: it&#x27;s got a number assigned to it, but everybody uses a different word, instead (parterre in French, Erdgeschoss in German, ...).<p>In Germany at least, it is common to find negative floor numbers, denoting floors that are below ground.  For example, an elevator might have these buttons (top to bottom):<p>6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2<p>But it is also common to find some other letters on the buttons, instead of the numbers.  E.g.:<p>P2, P1, 4, 3, 2, 1, E, U1, U2<p>P2 and P1 would be the car park, E would be Erdgeschoss = parterre = ground floor, U1 and U2 would be “underground” (below ground).')
