In fact I think most people would agree there&#x27;s lots of movies from 10 years ago with better CGI than many movies from last year. Better tools don&#x27;t make up for rushing CGI through during post-production.<p>At some point we certainly get to completely photo realistic CGI where things don&#x27;t become dated unless the viewing experience significantly changes in an incompatible way. Like the majority of movies becoming VR experiences but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on a shift like that anytime in the next decade or two.')
