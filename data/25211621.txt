Imagine you had to use StringBuilder every time you wanted to manipulate a String?<p>Just make all fields final and combine the builder and &#x27;working&#x27; class into a single immutable object. Like String.<p>`build()` everywhere is syntactic noise, and you either lose immutable safety (by passing around builders everywhere, as in the examples) or composability (by passing around the &#x27;sealed&#x27; objects). Builders are an antipattern that should only be used in cases where extreme performance is required.')
