They&#x27;re loyal, brilliant and quick. Startups that we celebrate on this forum exude this from all their pores.<p>When you start from scratch it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to create such an environment. You don&#x27;t have random people going off and doing random things. Everyone is pointed, focused and hungry to get to the same goal.<p>If you don&#x27;t, you run the risk of becoming lazy or hamstrung by politics and red-tape of people who want their rubber stamp to &quot;show something for it&quot;. That&#x27;s Intel vs ARM at the moment.<p>It&#x27;s a fine balance. Obviously you don&#x27;t want &quot;yes men&quot; but you want people who are willing to move as a unit.<p>I also agree it&#x27;s terrible. Whole units are ousted because there&#x27;s a new guy on top. People that gave sometimes decades to the company.<p>All I&#x27;m trying to say is - it&#x27;s not so clear cut.')
