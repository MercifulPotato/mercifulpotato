But I&#x27;ve never really played with 16 bit before.<p>I guess I was confusing it with BSD -- on at least NetBSD and I think OpenBSD, there&#x27;s an in-kernel (16 bit) x86 emulator used for certain ACPI functions, like calling VGA BIOS code (option ROMs?) when waking from suspend-to-RAM.<p>There&#x27;s also an option to just use native real mode, but the man page says &quot;this may result in direct reboots&quot;.')
