Sure, those examples you gave sound like virtue signaling. I dislike that sort of people probably more than you. Maybe it was his italicized “terrified” comment. I guess you were thinking “Seriously? This terrifies you?”<p>But GP is talking about something more serious. Maybe read their comment again. He literally said he saw someone die due to a similar situation.<p>Your OSHA comment sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder about something.<p>If it helps you process things better or at least put things in a different perspective, how would you feel if someone said they were _terrified_ that the kids weren’t wearing seatbelts? Would your response be slightly different?')
