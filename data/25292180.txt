At least offer it as a service for mental health issues rather than drown people in SSRIs and every anti-depressent known to man.<p>Denver, Oakland, and Oregon now are the only ones where its not met with extremely harsh punishments. And taxes from Cannabis is actually helping create the infrastructure for drug abuse treatment and mental illness in OR, something that Portugal had done much earlier when it decriminalized all drugs.')
