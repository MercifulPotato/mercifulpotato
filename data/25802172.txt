However that particular perception, that english learners tend to translate what sounds natural in their language to an English equivalent, is a bit of a mystery to me.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound bragging, but I never translate languages in my head. If I do that it will feel like the equivalent of database searching with a query, I feel exhausted if I have to look for something phrase by phrase (or matching). I admit that when I&#x27;m writing or organising thoughts I have to go over words so searching does happen.<p>Obviously it is down to personal experiences...')
