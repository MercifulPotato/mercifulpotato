Everything you say is reasonable and not at all an example of the effect I was talking about.<p>It&#x27;s totally fine to say &quot;hey it looks like the CFR&#x2F;IFR is declining because we have better treatment methods&quot;. This is a good-faith point, backed up by some easily observable data, and something that can evolve into a discussion about how to effectively manage the disease. It&#x27;s not a point that I&#x27;ve heard any rational person object to.<p>It is worth noting though â€“ the UK, as an example, currently already has about 30% of the cases in hospital versus the peak in late April, and about 15% of the deaths. This is much better, but those numbers are increasing pretty rapidly and without careful management risks getting out of control.')
