You&#x27;re correct about InfluxDB having HA and clustering under a closed source enterprise license. If you read the post, I even mention this as a shortcoming of the project. One which we&#x27;re hoping to rectify with InfluxDB IOx.<p>So some parts of Timescale are under actual Apache 2 and some parts are under a proprietary source available license. I&#x27;m not sure what the LOC of which is which, or how it&#x27;s actually organized in your repo. I&#x27;ll leave it up to your potential users to try to figure out which and disentangle what parts are actually open.<p>As I recall, AWS very publicly forked Elastic because of this very same type of confusion. The difference is that if AWS were going to fork your project, they&#x27;d just fork Postgres, which is the real open source software that you&#x27;re benefitting from.<p>If I were building an developer focused analytics, monitoring, or data analysis product, I wouldn&#x27;t do it on top of Timescale because some parts of your codebase most definitely prevent that through your license. But that&#x27;s me.')
