Only then do people search for active camera&#x27;s and hope it was pointing the right way in daylight or good enough infra. China esp will boast camera&#x27;s everywhere as its a dictatorship but with thousands of camera&#x27;s that may or may not work its like finding a needle in a haystack. Every country has a different reason for camera&#x27;s and china especially has a different purpose in mind. Its not like their courts or policeforces are working on the basis of innocent until proven guilty.  Being surveilled isn&#x27;t the goal here, its instilling fear of possibly being surveilled (Which is highly likely). Once you&#x27;ve fooled the population into thinking everything they do will seen by the highest authority, that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re closer to the holy grail of true power.')
