This is not an ad hominem, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re part of the 1%, but 99% of newsletters I receive are spam that I never wanted in the first place.<p>Companies employ a tremendous range of dark patterns to get my consent for email, then flood me with spam. Time after time I have unsubscribed from the &quot;best products of the week&quot;-newsletter, just to receive a &quot;weekly product highlights&quot;-newsletter the next day. According to the logic of the sending company, this is a completely different newsletter that I also have to unsubscribe from.<p>I mark all of them as spam. I&#x27;m sorry the 99% make life more challenging for you.')
