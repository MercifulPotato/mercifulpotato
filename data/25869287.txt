There is absolutely no reason for you to feel the need to justify building a business off of your software product, but I can completely understand why you do.<p>Our &quot;group&quot; spends so much time and effort indoctrinating its members on this idea that profiting from your skills is a bad thing, and that the only true way to be a developer is to give your work away for free as Open Source.  Even silly things like negotiating for a market rate salary from your employer are frowned upon as caring only for money.<p>But that&#x27;s all backwards.  There are good reasons to release your work product as Open Source, and those all share the quality that they give you or your business some tangible benefit.  So it&#x27;s simple:  do the benefits of open sourcing your thing outweigh the downside?  If yes, go for it.  If no, don&#x27;t.  But don&#x27;t spend even a second worrying about whether it&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do for silly moral reasons.<p>If there was one thing I could change about our industry, it would be to remove the 5 year Open Source Indoctrination brainwashing session you need to go through at University before entering it.  Because we&#x27;d spend a lot less time being taken advantage of later in life.')
