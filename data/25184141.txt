They were not competitive with Chinese government sponsored steel, that much is true. It’s extremely nice for me that they came back online; they order out of production precision parts from me for their heavy equipment. I’m located just across the river from St. Louis. This is middle America.<p>Most of my consumer products are sold directly, online, but I also sell titanium weed pipes to a local chain. COVID definitely slowed retail sales. I looked into getting my motorcycle parts onto big corporate retail shelves, but the margins are tight. I’m working on that. Business has been good, so I can afford to try new things. Cutting blanks with plasma rather than waterjet and milling steel with air blast rather than coolant, together, might make big box retail rational, for me.<p>The economics of manufacturing: extremely multi-faceted. There is a tendency for successful manufacturers to allow costs to escalate until flexibility is gone. Their employees unionize. Management borrows against the future. Then, the market changes.<p>It’s a rough game. I chuckle when people talk about the right to a job. Sure; that can work if I have a right to sales.')
