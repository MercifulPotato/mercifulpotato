(I especially feel this way based on the author&#x27;s blog, and their activity on Twitter! They create a lot of kind, supportive, educational material.) I _don&#x27;t_ see this as a prescriptive piece trying to impose constraints on other people&#x27;s behavior. If the specific advice doesn&#x27;t resonate with you, then that&#x27;s okay!')
