JSX felt wrong (at first) due to co-mingling HTML and JS, however, I realized that&#x27;s the wrong application of concerns because 1.

Could anyone evaluate if these are analogous &#x27;separation of concerns&#x27; (SoC) fallacies?<p>I will admit, I think I never fully appreciated the intent of SoC.')
