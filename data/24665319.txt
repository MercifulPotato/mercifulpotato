At first glance shapes look similar to what have become launch dimensions. I think it&#x27;d be pretty interesting to hear a comparison from someone who&#x27;s used both C-star and CUDA, about the plusses and minuses of each... have you used both?<p>&gt; Very limited compared to modern GPUs<p>Yeah, I&#x27;d expect the real true differences between CM5 SIMD and Pascal SIMT is just buried in the subtleties of those limitations compared to today&#x27;s hardware, and that fundamentally they aren&#x27;t super different ideas. In my mind, that doesn&#x27;t mean that SIMT is meaningless or the same thing as SIMD.<p>&gt; NVidia was calling SIMT back in 2010, long before per-thread instruction counters were available in Pascal (GTX 10xx series of GPUs)<p>Right; I&#x27;m saying the &quot;SIMT&quot; of 10 years ago has to do with masking and maybe other per-thread control (even though the Connection Machines might have had it as well), and that per-thread counters are now going beyond what we used to know as SIMT, perhaps deserving of some other acronym. Or maybe SIMT is becoming more appropriate and more differentiated from SIMD over time? Is it possible that CM5 should be called SIMT and we simply didn&#x27;t have that acronym at the time?')
