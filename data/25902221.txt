I know, Blazor is a new technology so that might already provide an answer. But I would like to hear some first-hand experiences.<p>New devs in my startup want to use it. My app, built by another dev uses razor pages, typescript, bootstrap and jQuery.<p>There is an overhaul in frontend we need to do, and I would like to make a right decision.<p>My old dev said to me &quot;good luck finding developers for boring technology&quot; and I did find new devs because I said they could do it in Blazor.')
