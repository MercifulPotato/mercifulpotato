It&#x27;s design is much more sensible from the get go, and it has a great UX + UI. If things being Open Source is so important, then I dream about a world where gitlab acquired Plastic SCM and makes it open source!<p>I hate git with a passion and am very happy with svn. Even my business users can learn and use TortoiseSVN in one session.')
