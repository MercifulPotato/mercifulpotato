Item(by='playpause', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611750983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925018, text='&gt;  We all like to think asking questions doesn&#x27;t make you look stupid but the reality is, it does.<p>This is the opposite of my experience. I hear alarm bells when a junior engineer says they understand something without asking many questions. Conversely, those who ask the most questions stick out as engaged and intelligent. Even silly clarifying questions often reassure me that the engineer is diligent and doesn&#x27;t want to waste time due to silly misunderstandings. That&#x27;s not something I &#x27;like to think&#x27; based on some theory I&#x27;m pushing. It&#x27;s just the pragmatic outcome of years of experience of junior devs fucking things up or wasting time because they didn&#x27;t make sure they understood something first. Even if you&#x27;re right that somehow we evolved to find people stupid when they ask questions, I imagine that would play a tiny role compared to the intuitions we develop from actual experience on the job.')
