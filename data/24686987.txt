Item(by='bwhmather', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601900012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686527, text='Commit history serves two largely separate purposes:<p>1) To provide a code-level record of what has changed in individual files and why.<p>2) To provide a high-level record of what features were introduced and what bugs were fixed over a period of time.<p>Often people will forget about one of them when arguing for a particular approach.<p>Squashing can make 2 easier but annihilates 1.  Rebasing gives you 1 but makes 2 difficult, or requires that you track high level changes in an external system.  In theory, approaches using merge commits can give you both but they are often difficult to apply in practice.')
