An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance.  An affordable mechnical voltmeter might have 100,000 ohms of resistance while testing a battery.  Simple electronic voltmeters (like the vacuum tube voltmeters they had in my high school physics lab) get into the millions,  precision test gear today has billions of ohms of resistance.<p>Now it takes a little power to power the voltmeter,  but not a lot.  A cheap DVM isn&#x27;t much more complex than a 1970s digital watch.  A smoke detector has a low battery detector that is good for years.<p>If you just want to know if a alkaline AA battery is good or not,  checking the voltage is good enough.<p>When the battery is under load,  the amount of voltage drops,  and when the load is released you often see the battery voltage recover gradually over the course of a minute or so.  A good discharge controller would be built with that phenomenon in mind.')
