I felt that the commenter was noting how the timing information in MIDI is not restricted to the note types represented in sheet music, and can include swing and shuffle that could not be represented in that format.<p>If those timing variations were intentional, then I agree they represent information. If they are just sloppy playing, they are noise. And if the performer is just applying a stylistic form (&quot;swing these bars&quot;), then it&#x27;s an inefficient encoding of the musical intent.')
