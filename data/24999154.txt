Nowadays I do Scheme embedded in C&#x2F;C++. The stuff I used to love Python for is now done in Scheme, and the outer containers are in C++. It&#x27;s actually a really nice way to write code, for me at least. Forces a clean architecture on you, and you know you can always move anything out into C++ if you need either a library or lower-level access. I use S7, but you could use Guile, Gambit, Chicken similarly.')
