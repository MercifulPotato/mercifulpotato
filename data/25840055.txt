Item(by='megameter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611096880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837349, text='I still have a copy of <i>Totaler Krieg!</i> My brother and I tried to play it once, in the 90&#x27;s. We did not finish setup before dinner, and decided to give up and relinquish the table. It&#x27;s classified as being in the middle of the spectrum of difficulty. Despite that failure, I don&#x27;t regret the experience. It produced a tangible connection between the computer wargames I had been playing and the history behind those.<p>It&#x27;s a different kind of way to think about play, and it helps to imagine you&#x27;re back in 1970 and computers are a thing only really available for Serious Projects, and working through a simulation with maps and minatures and calculation tables is the next best thing. Spending most of the day setting up the board made sense. A 12-year-old could do it, but Fortnite is more immediately gratifying.<p>Part of what killed wargaming as a major tabletop genre is that computers are better at being simulators of the &quot;noisy&quot; elements of warfare. On some level, you know that ranking a unit with &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;defense&quot; ratings is going to be bullshit. If you make up more numbers and add more tables and put more rules in the game - which is what the complex end of wargames did - that doesn&#x27;t make it better, but if you take an approach where physical reality is referred to as often as possible(which you can do in real-time on a computer), you can make a claim to accuracy emerging from that.<p>What tabletop has done since then is to get better at being a more immediate experience and to convey things in broad strokes of abstraction, instead of setting up dozens of units and running calculations of troop morale and weather.')
