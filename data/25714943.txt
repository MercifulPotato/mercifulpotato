I would be more inclined to think his strange style stems from his health problems and reclusiveness and made it easy for his sister to edit &quot;A will to Power&quot; into nationalist propoganda which got a lot of people reading things into confusing passages in his earlier works. (Particularly as propoganda may have integrated his choice of terms with his sister&#x27;s meanings into later nationalist works.)')
