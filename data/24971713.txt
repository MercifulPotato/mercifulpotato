I guess the fact they have everything they want allows them to better focus on improving themselves and thinking about their actions than someone who barely have enough to survive. A starving dog is more dangerous than a well fed dog.<p>There are exceptions of course, some are psychopaths. But I have always been impressed by how nice the rich tend to be in person.<p>Now about the wealth distribution. In developed countries, the rich are usually not sitting on top of a mountain of gold, mountains of gold are not of much use anyways. Most of their wealth is actually in their businesses, buildings, etc... Businesses get people to work and produce things for people to use, buildings house people, etc... Only a fraction of it is actually used for their luxurious lifestyle, the rest runs the economy.<p>Now the question would be, wouldn&#x27;t it be better if money went to the people instead of a few billionaires. Well, yes and no. Yes, for obvious reasons, concentrate wealth too much and that&#x27;s how you get slavery. But also no, because too much equality is not always a good thing. We need some people with crazy money to do crazy stuff, Elon Musk comes to mind, no billionaire, no SpaceX to do what NASA failed to do.<p>While it is not about money, another interesting example is the discovery of the Hubble deep field. The director is awarded 10% of the telescope time to use as he sees fit. Kind of like a &quot;telescope billionaire&quot;. Robert Williams, the then director, decided to use a substantial fraction of his time looking at an empty patch of sky, discovering many galaxies as a result. It was a bit crazy, and he couldn&#x27;t have done that if he went through the usual procedures, and it payed of in the end.<p>That&#x27;s why I think we need some inequality. Not too much, people deserve to live with a minimum of comfort, but not too little, we need to make large scale personal initiatives possible.')
