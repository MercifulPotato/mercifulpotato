Not &quot;reform&quot;. Not &quot;compromise&quot;. Abolish.<p>If 2020 taught me anything, it&#x27;s that society can come close to the brink pretty quickly. I thought there was an inevitable trend toward freedom, but recently think it&#x27;s perilous. We need ideas to flow to create a more distributed, less unequal, world, and we need it now. We need to unshackle the people.<p>If anyone is working toward this, let me know how I can help (including funding). I&#x27;m supporting things like SciHub&#x2F;LibGen and the like, but we need far far more organizers fighting to #EndIp, #AbolishCopyright, #AbolishPatents.<p>Trolls feel free to reply with the rote lies about how these laws make any sense. Anyone with a conscience doing something about it please get in touch and let me know how I can help!')
