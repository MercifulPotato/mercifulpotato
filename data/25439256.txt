I don&#x27;t think CDPR ever promised to create a Cyberpunk-GTA clone<p>I don&#x27;t think this is fair at all. From the earliest days of their marketing, CDPR was promising that Cyberpunk2077 would have &quot;unprecedented&quot; levels of customization, open world interaction, and next-level AIs. It may have been foolish for people to believe that would come true, but CDPR definitely did promise this, and I think it&#x27;s perfectly understandable that many people feel that they were straight up lied to.<p>It&#x27;s a classic case where CDPR just overhyped itself too much. If you ignore the ridiculous amount of bugs, it <i>is</i> a decent game, but it definitely is not at all the &quot;unprecedented&quot; game that CDPR hyped it up to be.')
