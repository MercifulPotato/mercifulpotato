Go will randomize iteration order of unordered collections (at least in development builds?) on purpose so you learn not depend on it.  The &quot;tricky&quot; thing with Unity is that you might find a consistent client behavior and unknowingly depend on it.<p>I think with time&#x2F;experience you&#x27;ll learn to spot what to ignore (frame lengths, etc) and what you could count on. And just to test fully-build games often, and across clients.<p>* C# does something similar with hash across builds (so you don&#x27;t depend on serializing&#x2F;deserializing hashes and expect them to work; they want the freedom to change hash functions).')
