I 20% on python...things. some python tooling, python3 was a major one, etc. I backed off recently just because most things I was involved in are wrapping up, but yeah, it was an active area for me. And also I am sort of 20%ing on my own project that is greenfield tooling with only dubious management support.<p>It&#x27;s given me exposure to lots of stuff, I&#x27;ve learned more about a favorite language, met some cool people, etc. Not to mention earned a handful of bonuses directly related to my 20% work.<p>There&#x27;s also now done tech debt reduction work that I&#x27;ve been tangential to that&#x27;s clearly a value add, and it&#x27;s primarily 20%ers.')
