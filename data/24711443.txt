From monoliths to serverless, you can instrument everything, then analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your entire software stack. All from one place.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m going to be really blunt here. What on earth does all of that mean? From that explanation alone I have no clue what New Relic is. I&#x27;m going to have to use it first to even know what it does.<p>So on my quest to figure out what New Relic actually is, I decided to research &quot;observability&quot;. Let me just say, WikiPedia did not help...<p>&quot;In control theory, observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a linear system are mathematical duals.&quot; - Wikipedia<p>I&#x27;ve put myself out there and called out, what I&#x27;ve heard is, an excellent product. I&#x27;m just saying, I can&#x27;t get a clear explanation on what it actually is from the website. Now it&#x27;s your turn...<p>What&#x27;s your best example of a website that doesn&#x27;t do a good job of telling potential customers what the product actually is? Why is it like this? Am I missing out on something? What do I have to do to become the type of developer that doesn&#x27;t cry when I have to investigate a new product solution?')
