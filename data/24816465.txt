Just trying to do a interoperability layer for the different versions of character strings would be incredibly hard.<p>Microsoft did something similar to this with CLI, but most people will note that JScript.Net and VB.Net are really new languages that just are optimized for porting Javascript and Visual Basic code over. They also defined a proprietary extension to C++ that allowed it to deal with managed objects so that it could interoperate with CLI code - but this did not aim to expose unmodified C++ code. Rather, it allowed you to use proprietary extensions to manually build bridges between the two.')
