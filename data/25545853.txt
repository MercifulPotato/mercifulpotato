Moore, Chief Scientific Officer, shows a figure showing the famous LIPID NANOPARTICLE (LNP) with mRNA entering an &quot;antigen presenting cell&quot; (APC, mostly dendritic cells and macrophages) surrounded by lymphocytes B and T. To a pathologist who has taught immunology all his life and knows cells well because he has often had them in his hands, this theory appears somewhat flawed, or at least stunted and shaky. I try to explain why in a popular way, focusing on the two question marks indicated (?). I do not treat the third (the reverse transcription from mRNA to DNA which I think is very unlikely even if not entirely impossible). But there is enough to worry about, as we shall see.')
