I found this a little interesting because it should have custom hardware specifically for this (i.e. an AES engine which is what&#x27;s being benchmarked here), formerly in the separate Apple T2 security chip? I wonder if this test simply doesn&#x27;t use that hardware (lack of support in Go libs?) or that it does but it really is this much worse. (or a third option -- there is support but the T2 doesn&#x27;t accelerate many of the features tested and it&#x27;s more special purpose for only specific calls from macOS)')
