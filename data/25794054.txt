Item(by='munificent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610734568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25780475, text='Yes, but it still means that when input is re-enabled later, the buttons are in an unknown state and you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll be receiving unexpected button up events.<p>Also, it&#x27;s very frustrating for users when input gets dropped on the floor at times where they don&#x27;t expect. Determining when to queue that input and when to forget it is a real art. Humans have subtle, complex expectations there and there&#x27;s no simple solution.')
