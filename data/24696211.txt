The easier it is to alternate between these positions, the more you will do it because there is less friction.<p>Picture of my setup: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;OLhkrPV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;OLhkrPV</a><p>Bought a used Aeron chair about 10 years ago and is still working fine. Love the Kinesis Keyboard, also about 8 years old.<p>The Lounge chair needs to be replaced once a year ($50) because by that time the fabric on the back becomes saggy and will start to cause discomfort on the back.<p>I don&#x27;t like to use multiple monitors. Somehow I couldn&#x27;t get used to it.<p>When I&#x27;m on the Lounge chair, keyboard is on my lap and I use the arm rest to make sure my wrist is not pressed against anything.<p>When I&#x27;m sitting, the armrest is adjusted to keep my wrist from touching anything.')
