Item(by='gwd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602670080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764086, text='I had two one-semester typing classes in junior high school on QWERTY (with <i>mechanical</i> typewriters, no less), where I got up to 70 WPM on speed drills.  Then in high school my mom got &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;, which got me up over 100 WPM on speed drills.  A few years ago one of my friends introduced me to typeracer.com, where I consistently clocked between 110 and 120 WPM, still on QWERTY, on the default Dell keyboard that came with my workstation.<p>So I bought a mechanical keyboard and decided to switch to Colemak, which someone had mentioned on the site.  But my numbers on typeracer still only hover around 100 typically, even after a few years of Colemak; presumably because I haven&#x27;t been drilling the way I did when learning QWERTY.  But my hands are certainly a lot more comfortable, and I&#x27;m pretty sure if I did drill I could surpass where I was before; so I don&#x27;t regret the decision.')
