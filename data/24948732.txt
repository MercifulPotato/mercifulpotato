Sciatica in teens is very unusual. The cause, likely, was a series of fairly involved surgeries I had had as a young child combined with overuse. None of the orthopedists I saw were particularly sure about the cause, nor were the physical therapists.<p>The long term solution was to avoid triggers and increase core strength. The short term solution was NSAIDs and correcting sleep posture (getting an 8-9 hour reprieve from loading the  muscles that spasm remains very helpful).<p>Long-distance running was a trigger for me (particularly running slowly, oddly enough), so I haven&#x27;t run in basically a decade. I used to run 5 days a week. It was pretty clearly part of my identity.<p>Years later, I picked up rock climbing (2-3 days a week) and my problems incidentally went away. Whenever I stop climbing for a while, I get periodic minor flare-ups. Fortunately, the short term fixes can nip this in the bud, particularly if I start exercising again.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of their situation, but I would encourage them to seek out a physical therapist. And to change therapists if it doesn&#x27;t work. It took me a while to find someone that could actually help. I have no idea why the first therapists did not suggest improving sleep posture.')
