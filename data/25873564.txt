It&#x27;s available ~&#x27;everywhere&#x27;.<p>RPi foundation has done a great job at making it&#x27;s product available to buy at the time of announcement in over 50 countries and I think that&#x27;s underrated.<p>It shows 5 different websites for me to buy in India, which is not usually the case here for new hardware except few exceptions like Nvidia Jetson; if at all they ever make it to the country. Also RPi foundation&#x2F;partners seems to be actively working with the Govt. to keep the prices competitive.<p>To give you a comparison, PinePhone costs &gt;$200 (+tax) to get it here that is if at all it doesn&#x27;t get blocked at the customs due to licensing requirements for telecommunication hardware, taxes for CBU(Completely Built Unit) smart phones, blockade on shipments from the country to the North. That&#x27;s a tragedy considering huge number of Linux enthusiasts in the country and that alternate smartphone OS can indeed help Govt.&#x27;s self reliance goals.<p>P.S. That was not to diss on Pine64&#x27;s efforts, but to show the state of enthusiast hardware availability in India.')
