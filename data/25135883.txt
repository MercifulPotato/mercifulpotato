It&#x27;s for access to the marketplace, which Apple created and sustains. Arbitrary? Yes. But it&#x27;s not some &quot;payment processor&quot; to an existing market that&#x27;s independent of Apple (like e.g. web payment processors are).<p>&quot;5x the market rate&quot; is also dishonest. What&#x27;s the &quot;market rate&quot;? Doesn&#x27;t Google ask for a 30% cut for the Play store? What about console makers? Doesn&#x27;t Amazon ask for 70% Cut from publishers?<p>Does anybody else has a say on what Basecamp charges, what partnerships they go into, how to add plugins to its products, and what to charge for them?')
