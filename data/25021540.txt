What are you smoking.. seriously?<p>Who is following in the footsteps of strong-man totalitarian practices? Trump. You can not name any democrat that would fit this description.<p>Who uses propaganda incessantly. Trump. 25,000 provably false statement in 4 years. Fox news, owned by a Trump ally , maintained a stead stream of provably false pro-Trump right-wing propaganda. Does any democrat or other politician in US history is have such a record? None.<p>Who is trying on undermining government and shove an agenda down our throats. Trump and the Republicans, who despite have little popular support for many of their policies (by independent polling) use gerrymandering to twist the vote, actively obstruct the government from governing, jamb right-wing extremist justices into court positions. Do democrats ever do this? Almost never.<p>I grew up in the New York area, like other new yorker&#x27;s who voted 90% for Biden, we all know something you don&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve seen his ridiculous antics for decades. He has been a perpetual lier, tax-evader, serial failed business man, narcissistic self-promoter, and con-man. Heck he&#x27;s been a democrat... but I guess that was back when he needed all those abortions for his mistresses.<p>In the end, he like much of his elections team, will be put in jail for his crimes. But because he knows he&#x27;s done a lot of illegal shit, he will first pardon himself... just watch.')
