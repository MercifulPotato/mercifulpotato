You need the logical conscious mind(similar to the CPU) to refine the solution.<p>The logical conscious mind is so slow that will never get the solution on its own, but being so close to the solution it can.<p>AI 1.0 was about solving all problems just using rational methods alone, like Lisp programming. AI 2.0 is solving all problems by neural networks and training alone without understanding or testing if a solution is right or why it is right.<p>Real artificial intelligence should be about integrating both approaches. E.g You use intuition to train a network in the English language, but then you use it to develop the english Grammar from it.  You extract the structure from the data.')
