Why is it useful? For one, as a kind of relaxant or a release; a release from working myself too hard, and from not feeling like something&#x27;s wrong with me when I&#x27;m unable wrap my head around some code after writing for the last 12 hours straight. We&#x27;ll hear from time to time about someone &quot;WORKING&quot; 80-hour weeks and that will lead us to think that maybe we could be &quot;WORKING&quot; longer, harder. Except &quot;WORKING&quot; to that 80-hour-a-week guy is a lot of business lunches &amp; dinners, social media, golf, or other busywork, while &quot;WORKING&quot; to another guy is high-intensity focus and creative output. By qualifying their hours worked with what constitutes &quot;WORKING&quot;, we find comfort knowing that no - something is not wrong with us if we can&#x27;t engage in a 14th hour of intense-focus creative output.')
