Item(by='parhamn', descendants=None, kids=[24903961], score=None, time=1603764976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903837, text='&gt; I assume anything that requires extra developer hours<p>Not sure why I was downvoted but this was my question, though I should&#x27;ve framed it nicer. I&#x27;m curious why there aren&#x27;t more designers (even understudies) contributing to OSS,  even to build their portfolio, in a similar way SWEs do.<p>&gt; That being said, this &#x27;4 decades dated to 1 decade dated&#x27; is not an useful way to criticize a design. Great design is atemporal.<p>I&#x27;m no designer but this seems absurd to me. Judging designs temporally seems to be commonplace. The new site feels like a period of design ruled by Bootstrap which new designs are using less than ever.<p>I also agree it&#x27;s not in good taste to be critiquing of open  source and reduced funding projects but I&#x27;m curious about the talent-attraction mechanics. We should be able to talk about that.<p>With that said, kudos to them for getting it out! Heres to hoping more designers dive into OSS :)')
