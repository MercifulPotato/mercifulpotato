My counter to your argument is that Twitter is &quot;effectively&quot; a monopoly, even though smaller competitors exist.<p>Any monopoly can claim that since were all in a free market system, it&#x27;s merely customers making free choices that&#x27;s causing an incorrect &quot;appearance&quot; of a monopoly to exist. But you can ask any journalist, legislator, or other public figure if there&#x27;s another &#x27;competitor&#x27; that can provide what Twitter provides, and the answer is simply &quot;no&quot;.<p>If we were talking about gaming consoles or some other type company the monopoly perhaps wouldn&#x27;t matter, but we&#x27;re talking about communications infrastructure for the entire nation, and frankly world. We simply cannot let a handful of unelected overlords censor the world.')
