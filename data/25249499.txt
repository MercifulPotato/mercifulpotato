This would be equally useful when discussing your project with other non-developers. Try putting together a narrative story board or moving Star Wars figures around on a table... whatever works for you, really. it might help to understand the basic tools in a developerâ€™s kit (objects, functions, etc.), but leave the programming to them. They should be able to tell you where there are problems and where you may need to compromise or deviate from your plan. A film director does not necessarily know everything about acting, lighting, cameras or whatever but is still able to explain how the scene should look in the end. just remember to be patient.')
