Do risk-based planning. You are likely to have an accident. Have a practical first aid kit a buffer of critical medicine you might need. You are likely to lose power for some amount of time, consider your plan if you lose power (and plan accordingly. A battery backup for your phone might be practical, a generator might not be). Understand you needs: you need potable water. Most can go days to weeks without food, and you can go months without a balanced diet. Don&#x27;t plan for things you can&#x27;t mitigate. Some things aren&#x27;t survivable: recognize that.')
