It&#x27;s my version and I make the rules!<p><pre><code>  Rules2: &quot;One player picks a door, the second picks a door (maybe the same), the host opens a door that has not been picked (if there are two he picks at random).

Then the player can either keep his choice or switch to the other closed door.&quot;\n\n  Scenario0: &quot;The player picked one door, the host opened another door and there was a goat behind it.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nBut the game I proposed is equivalent to the version of the problem that some people, including you apparently [0], insist in this thread that is equivalent to the original problem.<p><pre><code>  Rules1: &quot;The player picks a door, the host opens another door selected at random. Then the player can either keep his choice or switch to the other closed door.&quot;\n\n  Scenario1: &quot;The player picked one door, the host opened another door and there was a goat behind it.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe latter is not equivalent to the original problem. The situation is similar but the rules are different. The solution is different.<p>However the solution of Problems 1 and 2 is the same. In both cases the rules allow for the car being unveiled when the host opens the door (it happens with probability 1&#x2F;3). In both cases under the scenarios proposed there is no point in switching doors.<p>They are both different to the original problem where everybody knows beforehand that the door opened will hide a goat.<p>[0] The problem I proposed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24707305" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24707305</a> is also equivalent:<p><pre><code>    Rules1&#x27;: &quot;The player picks a door, and opens another door selected at random.
