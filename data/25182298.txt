I&#x27;m not trying to be rude but you seem to not be understanding what I mean at all.<p>&gt;Twitter can evict you from an audience bigger than Texas with no other way to reach them, and your argument is that a monopoly on Texas is only 10% of the country.<p>That&#x27;s not my argument at all, the argument is that if the private company had only owned 10% of the sidewalks in town, the court would have ruled that they had every right to tell her to distribute her materials elsewhere(it explicitly says this was the reasoning behind their decision).  It was only because one private corporation literally had a monopoly on sidewalks in the town that the court saw differently.<p>&gt;And you as a speaker can&#x27;t use the Facebook sidewalks instead of Twitter unless they had all the same people walking on them<p>But they do have the same people walking on them...<p>&gt;If you want to reach your entire audience, you have to use both at once.<p>This is a bit of a catch-22, no?  Your &#x27;entire audience&#x27; is everyone that you can reach.  If Twitter objects to your content, they can bar you from their (relatively small, to point out the analogy again) share of &#x27;sidewalks&#x27;, but there are still a vast number of other sidewalks &#x27;in town&#x27; that you can advertise on.<p>&gt;Twitter can evict you from an audience bigger than Texas with no other way to reach them<p>Who are these people that Twitter denies access to the rest of the internet?  You are perfectly capable of reaching anyone who uses Twitter through another social media service, or setting up your own website&#x2F;newsletter&#x2F;Discord channel&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;blog&#x2F;etc.')
