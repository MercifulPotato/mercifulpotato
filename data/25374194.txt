When we&#x27;re uploaded to the matrix, you&#x27;ll finally be able to be whatever gender you want to be without fear for the stupid stigmas of this world. You can try lots of things. You can be a man, woman, multi-gender foxperson, or a stoic agender deity. Maybe lots of things. You&#x27;ll be free.<p>Let people be who they are.<p>You be who you are.<p>Just be happy.')
