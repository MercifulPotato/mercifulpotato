I mean the 3d curvature of the keys, your hand is kinda in a semi circular channel. I just find it comfortable, especially to reach the furthest rows of keys from the home row. Its not a huge deal, just something I like about the Kinesis. I also use the Kinesis foot pedals -- does something similar exist for the Ergodox? I didn&#x27;t see one at my quick look, but I also didn&#x27;t look very hard.')
