Something I&#x27;ve wondered with these sorts of things is what&#x27;s meant by &quot;used&quot; with water? I can understand measuring the input into the system, but there&#x27;s a lot of outputs, &amp; some of those outputs should flow back into the system sooner than others, causing variance of how much impact that input of water had on the surrounding areas&#x27; drought<p>Since you&#x27;re saying 99% evaporation, I assume for most everything most water follows air flows which through the pareto principle collect to places which don&#x27;t need water?
