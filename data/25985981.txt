Have the hedge funds publicly said “you got us!”, and even then why should we believe them?<p>The story is fuelled by a subreddit and celebrity hot takes on Twitter.  The news coverage I might actually trust also happens to be extremely weak — it’s all on the periphery rather than at the center of the story and I’m deeply skeptical anyone knows what’s actually going on.  Why should they?  Without a leak from an institution that’s how it should be when private entities trade on a public market.<p>I have seen the mansplaining of what a short position is or what a short squeeze is or how someone can be 150% over shorted — originally 138%, then inflated to 140% for impact, then inflated again.  The explanations aren’t wrong but knowing the mechanics of a theory doesn’t differentiate between an internet fantasy and the real world.  That kind of self-fulfilling logic is one step away from the world of <i>conspiracy theories</i>.<p>As I’ve said before, on the face of it this just looks a lot like some folks pumping a cheap stock.  Potentially the first round of these had good reason to — the actual squeeze — but now the second, third, fourth and upcoming fifth daily cycles are pumping it for the sole reason <i>because the last one did and we need an exit</i>.   It could well by pyramid shaped — <i>I’d put money on it if I were you.</i>')
