Yes it seemed stupid to me at first too, but all it takes to end up like that is to decide <i>not</i> to give yourself unfair special exceptions to your own policies, which is how things should be!<p><i>frankly, I would be shocked if any of the various DNS blocklists that people use for determining who&#x27;s a dirty spammer would actually put a Google IP block on there</i><p>Be shocked. It did happen when a particularly clever spammer got through the controls. There are no bits of logic in most email servers that say &quot;if IP is owned by Google, ignore&quot;. Spam filters are all relative. If senders send a lot more good mail than bad, they&#x27;re good. If they send a lot more bad mail than good, they&#x27;re bad. Google IPs are rarely blocked because they send a <i>lot</i> of good mail and invest a huge amount of money and time in keeping it that way.')
