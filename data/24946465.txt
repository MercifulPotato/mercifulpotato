For example: in a world more tech-dependent i think cybersecurity will need to grow at the same rate in order to prevent attacks and similar stuff.<p>So, I&#x27;m trying to understand in which sector (excluding the main sector written above) will be valuable to spend time, to study, in order to be more ready for the next future.<p>In my opinion innovation in sector like e-commerce is &quot;finished&quot; (given that society (like amazon) cannot go too much over a more sophisticated recommendation system).<p>So, what do you think will be the sectors most interesting &quot;data science&quot; speaking? cybersecurity? blockchain?<p>In which one will be better to spend time in order to have a job in it?<p>thanks all')
