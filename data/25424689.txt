This doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with social media, but rather the pages you&#x27;re going to have chosen to use a service provided by Facebook to track users. They could use another behavior targeting service, but chose Facebook&#x27;s.<p>2) You&#x27;re saying Instagram deletion didn&#x27;t work. It sounds like you deactivated it instead of deleted it. I haven&#x27;t heard this be an issue (it&#x27;d be widely reported if it were)<p>3) You&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s not opt-in because people refer to it in the news. In that case, nothing is opt-out because people have the right to refer to anything they want. Making this opt-out would mean censoring other people from saying things online or referring to things online, because of your views.')
