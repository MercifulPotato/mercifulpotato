I&#x27;m the dad and handle most of the barn-related duties for my equestrian daughter. Also my wife makes more money than I do and has a position a few rungs up the corporate ladder from me. So I end up with a few more chores traditionally done by a mom. Over the weekend my daughter took a fall and (we thought) broke her foot. I brought her to her orthopedist appointment. The doctor asked a few questions and then turned to me and said, I kid you not, &quot;Do you have any questions from mom? Usually the mom has more questions.&quot; Ha! She&#x27;s probably right though. It&#x27;s not mean-spirited chauvinism it&#x27;s just business as usual. The next time the day care calls you, then tell them to call your spouse instead. If they can handle it, you&#x27;ll only have to do this a few times, before the daycare starts going to them first. Lighten up folks. Cut some people some slack. Men and women have had their traditional roles in family and society since <i>forever</i> until the 60s and the invention of the birth control pill. It&#x27;s going to take a few generations to settle into this new normal. In the mean time we&#x27;d all be a lot better off if we could assume best intentions and not jump to drama every time.')
