That is traditionally how all poultry was raised, really, on family farms, etc. Roosters were raised and fattened until a few months in, and then slaughtered and eaten, while a portion of the hens were kept for laying. The meat from roosters isn&#x27;t as good, but it&#x27;s frankly fine overall.<p>There&#x27;s no reason the meat industry couldn&#x27;t divert the male chickens into a separate supply chain where they were raised until 6-8 months and then slaughtered and sold as stewing meat or some other (decent tasting) protein product for human consumption. The roosters don&#x27;t develop aggressive behaviours until much later.<p>But that would be inefficient by market measures. So it doesn&#x27;t happen.')
