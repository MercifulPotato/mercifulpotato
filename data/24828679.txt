They are easy to farm in large quantities, and they store well. Most crops that you think of as more profitable are worth more, but not always profitable - either because so much labor is needed that you cannot scale as far, or because they spoil so fast that you can&#x27;t be sure of selling your entire harvest before it rots (Corn can be stored for a few years if you need to, lettuce is not edible after a week).  Also there is the demand problem - even if there is more profit in some other crop that doesn&#x27;t mean there is enough demand to sustain adding another farmer without prices collapsing.')
