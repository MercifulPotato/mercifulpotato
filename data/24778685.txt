It&#x27;s such a mistake, even in this form with the compact and I really wish people would realize it.<p>Put it this way: what happens (and this will happen) when the popular vote is ridiculously close? We had a preview of this in Florida in 2000 when a few thousand votes decided the election. Now imagine the litigation, the endless recounts and the uncertainty but it engulfs the entire country. Imagine an election decided by less than 10,000 votes and litigants try to scrounge up a few dozen votes in every county in the country.<p>As much as people like the crap on the electoral college it has (thus far) done one thing well: and that is to create w winner. Creating a winner is _way_ more important than creating the &quot;right&quot; winner.<p>The one big problem with the electoral college is that the Founders never envisioned the huge population disparities we have today ie California has &gt;500 times the population of Montana, Vermont or North Dakota.<p>There are legitimate issues with the electoral college. A national popular vote for president is not the answer.')
