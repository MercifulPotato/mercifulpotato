I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fault, that I do not remember it. Even if I had it stored in my computer, opening it from a computer would not be as fast as looking it up online.<p>Another example: the setTimeout(a,b) in Javascript has two parameters: the time delay and the function to call. I never remember which one is the first, so I look it up every time.<p>I can type without looking at the keyboard. But I believe there can be great programmers, who need to look at the keyboard when they type.')
