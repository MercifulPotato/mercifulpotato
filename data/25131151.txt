The markets are definitely more Republican (or maybe just Trump?) leaning. I&#x27;m not convinced that the second half being true isn&#x27;t just a coincidence.<p>IMO the analysis about how PredictIt bettors followed 2016 polling trends seems to be ascribing them an excess of rationality. I think if you mirror that S-curve diagonally you can see that: The betting markets put really high odds for Trump in states like New Hampshire and Minnesota(which went 55% to Biden but still had 25% odds of going blue). If you look at the mirroring red states which went 55% to Trump, there were no bettors expecting a blue wave (Missouri and South Carolina had ~5% odds of going blue).<p>When you look at markets like &quot;Who Will Win California&quot; or &quot;Who Will Win the Popular Vote&quot;, I&#x27;m convinced that many people making bets are delusional.')
