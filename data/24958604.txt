I went to go download the driver and realized the .dmg file was <i>five hundred megabytes</i> in size. I had no idea what I just downloaded. Either it was every single printer driver for HP in existence, something else, or a mixture of both. Assuming the best of intentions from HP in that I only got drivers, itâ€™s terrible UX to bundle them all together like that.')
