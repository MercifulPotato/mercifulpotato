Very quickly got a letter from their lawyer pointing out that a) that was a violation of their ToS (right) and b) they have a sui generis database copyright that applies to whatever we got (doubtful, that applies in Europe to &quot;big&quot; parts of a collection).<p>We deleted everything we got from them. We got a second letter when we reached independently to some authors with CC icons, got their explicit approval and got their icons from their site. The same icons were also available on the noun, and I guess they thought we had downloaded them there. This time we answered back and never heard from them again.<p>They seemed pretty protective to me, and I would not recommend touching their site if you want to get a CC collection of icons without troubles.<p>Btw, Iconduck looks dope :) congrats!')
