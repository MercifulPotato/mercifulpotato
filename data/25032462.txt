A configurable limit would be nice, but p will do just fine.<p>My mistake was thinking that my mounted file system&#x27;s root would be my btrfs&#x27;s root, which of course it is not, it&#x27;s itself a subvolume (a standard configuration has @system and @home, i think). When I re-ran btdu on the separately mounted root volume it worked flawlessly.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the only one making this mistake, but maybe it makes sense to remind people of this. Especially since currently btdu doesn&#x27;t fail with an error, but seems to <i>try</i> to navigate up to the root volume (it shows my @-subvolumes from wherever I start) but then presents a broken result.')
