I went to MIT, and found interactions with other students much more useful than the coursework itself.  If you&#x27;ve spent 18 years with tons of people telling you that you&#x27;re the smartest person they&#x27;ve met, it&#x27;s really good to meet (1) a few people who put you in your place and (2) lots of people who are genuine peers and push you and encourage you for the first time in your life, instead of just telling you that you&#x27;re smart (or giving you a hard time for being smart).<p>My freshman year at MIT, I roomed with a guy who was a highly ranked chess player, and one of the smartest people I&#x27;ve met.  However, 18 years of having the rules never really apply to him and never being forced to actually focus really hurt his work ethic.  He was plenty smart enough to graduate from MIT, but failed out due to a lack of focus.<p>There were about 1,000 people per grade in my high school, and people occasionally asked me if I was as smart as the girl a year ahead of me who went to Harvard.  There was really no question that by most measures of intelligence, I was the smartest person in my grade.  I was getting strait As in honors-level math classes at the state university while in high school.  I got 800 in both the SAT I Math and SAT II Math sections, and 790 in the Chemistry SAT II.  My chemistry teacher just started marking my scantron sheet as the answer key, and the day after every exam, the whole class would go over my exam answers on the board to see if I had made any mistakes.  I ended the year with 9 points above 100% in Chemistry because on the first exam, the second highest score in the class was 90&#x2F;100, so the teacher just added 10 points to everyone&#x27;s scores.  I made one mistake (at least mistakes that got caught) later in the year in chemistry.  In my university honors-level math classes, I would bring a newspaper and read, until one day where the TA asked a question that nobody else in the class could answer, so I folded up my newspaper, figured out what was going on and answered the question.  The professor (standing off to the side) got red in the face and pulled me out into the hallway and said &quot;I don&#x27;t care who you are.  I don&#x27;t care what kind of grades you&#x27;re getting.  If you bring a newspaper to class one more time, I&#x27;ll get you thrown out of the honors program.&quot;   It was good for me to interact with others with similar experiences growing up and get a drop or two of humility.<p>Your mileage may vary.')
