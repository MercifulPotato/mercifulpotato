But your comment was in response to someone who&#x27;s experience was having more issues on Windows than Linux by saying that you don&#x27;t have issues on Windows, which is the same thing.<p>Personally, I run into way more issues when I try to use Windows than Linux; for example, whenever I boot into Windows on my desktop, it doesn&#x27;t recognize that my ethernet cable is plugged in unless I unplug it and then replug it back in. It also sometimes just doesn&#x27;t give any audio output when it boots up, and I have to reboot to get it to work. These and other issues I have may not be issues you run into, but they are just as valid experiences as the issues you might have with Linux. My point is that the argument that Windows &quot;just works&quot; out of the box is not as objective as you might think.')
