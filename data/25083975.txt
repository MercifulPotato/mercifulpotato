Most of us didn&#x27;t want to organize photo folders, we wanted to make the computer display something cool or play a song or something, and usually we had to start with something elementary when tackling a new language, especially a complicated one like C.<p>I can still remember being 11 years old and meticulously keying in the hello world program on my dad&#x27;s aging Tandy Model 16, then saying &#x27;cc hello.c&#x27; and watching as the compiler chugged through the tiny program for a minute or two. (It #includes stdio.h, so there was more code to go through than it seemed, plus there was a linking step. And not much actually happened, because Unix C compilers are silent if there are no errors.)<p>When I ran a.out and saw &quot;hello world&quot; appear, I was over the moon. It was like clearing 1-1 in Super Mario Bros. for the first time. Like I had surmounted the first obstacle and was thus ready for all the challenges that lay ahead.')
