All branches on the remote repo got wiped. My local refs <i>replaced</i> the refs on the remote.<p>Somehow I found the right commits floating around in the git ether.

In retrospect, I shouldn&#x27;t have panicked so much -- there were daily backups -- but the sheer terror I felt has made me read the man pages really closely to this day.')
