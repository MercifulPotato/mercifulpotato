I&#x27;ve never been in a conversation where using any of these terms led to a misunderstanding. Everyone understands that mocks, stubs, fakes are programmer-written stand-ins for other objects.<p>In the vast majority of the cases no one cares whether it returns a preset value or only counts the number of hits or whatever else it might do. And if that level of implementation detail becomes important, then it&#x27;s described that way, not by the use of Fowler&#x27;s terminology.<p>The shame of it is that the title of this essay makes it appear like it&#x27;s simply an introduction to a lexicon, whereas the word definitions are actually a small part of the essay and there are more important topics presented (and presented fairly well).')
