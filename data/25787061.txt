Your article actually does a good job of showing this. \n&quot;the Oslo Peace Accords of the 1990s between Israel and the Palestinians gave the Palestinians (the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza) responsibility for healthcare.&quot; as your own articles asserts. Israel has already declared it will help the Palestinians, but the official position is that the responsibility ultimately lies with the Palestinians themselves. \nSome Palestinians officials agree: \n&quot;Dr Yasser Bozia, Palestinian Director-General for Public Health went further: &quot;We haven&#x27;t asked for any vaccine from Israel. It&#x27;s our responsibility to procure and roll-out the COVID vaccine and all other vaccines. That&#x27;s been the case going back years,&quot; he told Sky News.&quot;<p>&gt;By denying half the population you control the vaccine, you are always gonna get better results.\nYet, even if the total Israeli population was twice what it is (and the absolute number of vaccines stayed the same), the country would be #2 in the world in the share of the population that has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (falling from #1 in the last few days). Learning from an efficient model is the whole point here.')
