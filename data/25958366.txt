I’d rather the targeted ad model fail.<p>Ben Thompson argues that if Apple wins this then <i>only</i> FB, Google and other ad monopoly mega corps will be competitive in the ad space because they’re the only ones that can collect information on users in other ways even with Apple’s move to stop tracking.<p>That may be true in the short term.<p>If legislation trends in the CCPA, GDPR direction and users prefer the moves Apple is making then the ad model may start to falter for them too.<p>The sooner, the better.')
