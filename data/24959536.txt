A glance at the blogs on cato.org shows a pro-business editorial line which is perfectly well aligned with the chamber of commerce wing in both parties. It is very anti-Trumpian and somewhat anti-Biden. I am not a huge follower of the Cato Institute, but in my recollection, this is the same type of stuff that could be found there 20 years ago.<p>Sometimes Cato has useful studies or data, and then it&#x27;s worth reading. It&#x27;s a moderate, academic, economics-colored point of view on the world. I wouldn&#x27;t call it exciting, but this kind of complete dismissal in a thread about dismissal and silencing of moderate voices apparently looks silly to some people.')
