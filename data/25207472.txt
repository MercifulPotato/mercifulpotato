Where I live there are probably three different supermarket chain stores within about 500m, so easy walking distance. If I expand that to 1km because I feel like biking a short way, there&#x27;d be dozens of more shops and probably a few more different brands. This isn&#x27;t even including the multiple non-chain ones. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any risk of a food desert here.')
