I find Twitter to be a fantastic news source, with higher concentration of good links than HN, and often see stuff there far before it shows up ok HN.<p>The thing about Twitter is that it is entirely about who you follow, and what those people talk about and retweet. So if somebody is a source of toxicity, unfollow them. I have a very low threshold for both following and unfollowing.<p>This part, curating your feed, is not trivial, but it is what determines 100% of your experience. I don&#x27;t blame you at all for having a bad experience and not wanting to use Twitter again! But also realize that it&#x27;s not the only experience to be had there, and I think that for many, and hopefully most people, it&#x27;s a positive experience.')
