I want to like Apache products, or maybe “projects” is more accurate. It’s really quite the dumping ground of random things. I’ve tried so many of them, and it feels like it’s mostly a random professor implements something to justify his of her position at a university, gets it approved for Apache to get more prestige, has students add random bits every year. It’s just all so uncohesive within itself, or as a whole.<p>Like, you might not like Microsoft Office, or the Mac suite. But at least you don’t end up with Microsoft Word, Mac Numbers, Gmail, Office 365 notes, and pretend that everything is one office suite.<p>Apache really needs to define and enforce some unifying standards.<p>Or we need something un-Apache that can do this for open projects.')
