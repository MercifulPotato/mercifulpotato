But I think that I would really want is something built in Node that I can import, add configs, and hook into my front-end. FaunaDB comes close, but  I would still need to build the comments and moderation UI etc. It would be nice if someone fleshed out a more full commenting example on top of Fauna, but I haven&#x27;t come across that yet, so I guess I&#x27;ll eventually need to do that.<p>My site is just a super simple site that runs on top of Vercel w&#x2F; Svelte&#x2F;Sapper')
