Item(by='toomuchtodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604420331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980882, text='Business owners, land owners, and property managers are working with EV charging station partners to install chargers because EV owners spend money while charging. For example, Tesla colocates Superchargers at Meijer in the Midwest (a grocery store chain) and Wawa in Florida and on the East Coast (which isn&#x27;t just a convenience store with bathrooms, but also makes sandwiches and such). There is a  Wawa location in Vienna, VA that only has EV chargers [1], no petrol pumps. I&#x27;ll agree that chargers aren&#x27;t ubiquitous, yet, but they are being deployed rapidly. Tesla continues to own their Supercharger stations (and all associated equipment), and I&#x27;ve heard mostly positive reviews from business owners who provide Tesla destination (high power wall chargers) and J1772 Clipper Creek chargers to patrons.<p>It&#x27;s a net positive if we push petroleum refueling stations out of business. They sell a harmful product that we&#x27;re working to phase out rapidly through electrification of transportation, and there will be a cost to remove and remediate petroleum storage tanks that were used at these stations.<p>In short, the EV charging infra will be built, but if there&#x27;s someplace you want to go that doesn&#x27;t have chargers, make it known to those folks you&#x27;re looking for that amenity (now, or in the future).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globenewswire.com&#x2F;news-release&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;2100911&#x2F;0&#x2F;en&#x2F;Wawa-Announces-Tesla-Model-3-Lease-Sweepstakes-for-Virginia-Residents.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globenewswire.com&#x2F;news-release&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;210091...</a>')
