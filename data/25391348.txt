Big corporations want to show how diverse they are.  It might hence improve your chances to get hired if you fit at least in one of the minority categories.<p>Long time ago I worked in a small company were they hired a deaf girl as a trainee.  One might think that it&#x27;s so nice that they give disabled persons a chance (in her case the inability to hear unfortunately affected her ability to read as well, to the point that my boss discouraged me from teaching her the use of e-mail) however the company received some 100 grand&#x2F;a (a lot of doe in Germany then) from the government for her professional development, so the company gained a little even if she wasn&#x27;t all that productive.  I don&#x27;t think the company had any intention to hire her afterwards.')
