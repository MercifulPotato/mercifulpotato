Item(by='murm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609606481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25608123, text='&gt; This is particularly true when the people whom you criticize are manifestly doing quite well in general compared to you.<p>In these cases someone might be doing hundred things right in their life and the one mistake is what catches all the attention and provokes criticism. I feel like if only humans could view themselves with the same ruthless no-excuses mentality as they do view others they would immediately realize how much there is in their own life to fix and fixing all that would probably keep them too busy to unnecessarily point fingers at others.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying that criticism is always unnecessary, but that there&#x27;s probably all kinds of low-hanging fruit in people&#x27;s own lives that they&#x27;re not just able to perceive. This blind spot of course applies to me too which I find frustrating at times).')
