Item(by='areoform', descendants=None, kids=[25039864], score=None, time=1604954563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039536, text='Yes, Apple runs the largest hedge fund in the world, but the question isn&#x27;t whether they&#x27;re getting some return on their investment (I&#x27;m assured that their hedge fund is). But rather, where&#x27;s the long-term research that&#x27;s necessary for future growth and human prosperity?<p>If the logic of the comment I was replying to held, then Apple would be investing a commiserate amount into fundamental research. They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;d rather seek a return (however, meagre) by buying bonds than fund research.')
