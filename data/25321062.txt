I don’t think traditional rucking gear is optimal though. The backpack format puts more strain on your back and most rucking forums and such I’ve seen recommend only like 30lbs. The most amazing piece of fitness equipment I have is a 36lb belt which puts no weight on your back and doesn’t hold in heat like a vest. I’ve since had to add a 45lb vest to it, but the vest should at least put less torque on your back than a backpack.')
