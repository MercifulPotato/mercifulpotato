What are these studios thinking??<p>No one steals music like it&#x27;s 1990 anymore. The RIAA is finally realizing that the ship has sailed, and they&#x27;ve entirely lost control of distribution. No one listens to radio anymore. Very few people buy music. YouTube and Spotify are the music distributors of the younger generation, and the RIAA wants to put that rabbit back in the hat.<p>All that&#x27;s left is for Spotify and&#x2F;or YouTube to start signing artists and it&#x27;s basically the end for the RIAA.')
