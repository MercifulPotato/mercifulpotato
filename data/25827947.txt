Medicare pays ~10% of list price. So, for example, if there is an insurance rate set at &quot;130% medicare&quot; (common to have a coefficient between 1 and 2), then yes, you&#x27;d still see many cash rates that are 5x insurance. However, many hospitals also listed Managed Medicaid insurance rates. These are generally 3-5% of list price &amp; look for similar to normal insurance plans. So, what you&#x27;re seeing may also be comparing a Medicaid rate to a very high cash rate.<p>Will add 43284 &amp; other gastro procs shortly. Thanks!')
