Apple seems to be aiming towards piling as much into their dedicated SOCs as they can. I expect what &quot;pro&quot; capabilities they do build for it going to be in the vein of the cool stuff they were doing in the Mac Pro, like the FPGA &quot;Afterburner&quot; and will probably cost way more than any person with generally &quot;consumer-level&quot; use-cases would want to spend.<p>As a technology enthusiast I&#x27;m excited to see what bonkers stuff they&#x27;ll be announcing. But, since I am not doing climate models or rendering hollywood movies, I don&#x27;t expect I will never work on any of them since I don&#x27;t want to drop a new car&#x27;s worth of money on one.')
