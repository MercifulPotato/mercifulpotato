I first went to a small local clinic. They stopped the bleeding and bandaged me for free and sent me to a larger hospital. There i got stitches. The hospital bill (which they handed me) was 50â‚¬ ($60), which my insurance paid.<p>Look at it this way:<p>$18,933 is more than Apple would charge! ;-)')
