This ties in neatly with the claim that consciousness evolved in order to predict other agent’s behavior (presumably to counteract if not control those agents). In such a case, an evolutionary arms race of controlled unpredictability would occur as each agent seeks to control others while simultaneously being uncontrollable.')
