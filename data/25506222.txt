They are.  Just the other day Abby Martin interviewing Jews who say they want to kill all the Arabs was at the top of &#x2F;r&#x2F;Documentaries. \n Thousands of upvotes and front page [1].

You can support it if you want, just don&#x27;t expect to be invited to any parties full of uni-educated people who are really into pro-semitism.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be hard on you because you&#x27;re not really hurting anyone but the idea that you&#x27;re part of a much higher caste because you reject a single Jewish lizard people conspiracy theory is laughable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Documentaries&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k7mxxa&#x2F;everyday_israelis_express_support_for_genocide_to&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Documentaries&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k7mxxa&#x2F;every...</a>')
