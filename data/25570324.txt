You have to import a trillion dependencies because the browser, despite being mostly a glorified layout engine, doesn&#x27;t really support much but bare primitives.<p>Thinks like date pickers or color pickers are a recent development and are not supported everywhere.<p>Making range inputs is not supported by most browsers and requires a heavy dose of javascript and CSS to achieve, and you end up with something that won&#x27;t look or feel like a native control in all browsers.<p>Ditto for treeviews.<p>Styling and customizing combo-boxes is so limited and browser-dependant that you have dozens of libraries reinventing the wheel by creating completely custom controls, each with their own quirks and feature set.<p>There&#x27;s no built-in support for translations and localization (unless you count the accept-language HTTP headers I suppose). On something called &quot;the world wide web&quot;, that&#x27;s pretty embarrassing and short-sighted IMO. But you do have a Bluetooth stack now, so that&#x27;s nice.')
