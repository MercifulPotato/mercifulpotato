Previously I suffered extreme migraines that would easily knock me out for a day, I couldn&#x27;t take any medicine or I would vomit it back up, etc. I haven&#x27;t since my first &quot;shroom&quot; experience.<p>The weird thing is that I get the pre-migraine experience at the same rate, it just isn&#x27;t followed by a migraine. Previously I&#x27;d get the vision distortions that would get worse to the point that I could barely see, and then an extreme migraine would start. I still get those vision distortions (every week or two) just as frequently, but they&#x27;re followed by just returning to normal.<p>This is obviously single case anecdotal, could be purely coincidental, and I don&#x27;t encourage anyone to base any action on it, but it was something I literally had a discussion about this weekend.')
