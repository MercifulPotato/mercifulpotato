You drive there, plug in your car, swipe the RFID and go shopping. You come back and your car has charged a bit.<p>No, it&#x27;s not at a 100%, but it still has more charge than it did when you came in.<p>And again, load-balancing electricity is REALLY old tech. It&#x27;s completely trivial to balance the load among the whole field during Christmas shopping season with every charger occupied so that everyone gets some charge, but the transformers don&#x27;t explode.')
