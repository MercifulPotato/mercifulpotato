Ruby and Python (to a lesser extent) make writing flexible, readable code very, very easy. You donâ€™t have to worry about types (unless you want to) and correctness; there are lots of ways of getting things done in those languages, and writing tests&#x2F;mocks&#x2F;stubs is WAY easier because of that.<p>In my experience, what would take me 30 lines of Ruby with maybe the same number of lines for its test takes 2x the length and boilerplate with Golang.')
