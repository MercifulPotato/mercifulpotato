It&#x27;s not the super advanced stuff that Bazel can do, but you don&#x27;t need Bazel to do build caching.<p>When the Linux kernel (~27 million LoC) can be compiled from scratch in under a minute on modern machines (30 seconds on some of the beefier machines)... there&#x27;s clearly a lot of low-hanging fruit in that &quot;hours long&quot; compilation that has nothing to do with build caching.<p>Whether you can get stakeholders to buy into paying down technical debt or not is an unrelated discussion. Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to sell fancier build systems as the solution instead of better code organization and simplifying overly generic code.<p>C++ code doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be super slow to compile: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zverovich.net&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;improving-compile-times.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zverovich.net&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;improving-compile-times...</a>')
