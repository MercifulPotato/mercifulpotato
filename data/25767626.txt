It&#x27;s a cheap and unsatiating 774 calorie (per a google search) product which is then combined with a calorie rich <i>food</i> (not beverage) to eventually sate the appetite. The food itself is often extra salty (if fast food) which entices the person to consume more of the calorie rich, unsatiating drink. And if the food is similarly high in sugar it is also unsatiating (compared to high fat or high protein food stuffs), which leaves the person eating even <i>more</i> calories. If someone consumed 5 beverages of that sort a week, that would be an extra 3500+ calories (approximately enough to gain one pound) on top of whatever their food calories were.')
