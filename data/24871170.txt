Changing the processor governor affects the clock, undervolting affects the voltage.<p>If you use a more conservative governor you lower performance and power consumption both linearly; this means that e.g. the total energy used for running a long batch job is roughly constant.  If you lower the voltage, you don&#x27;t decrease performance at all, but still lower the power consumption.  It&#x27;s a free lunch, right up until your CPU starts silently generating the wrong results and possibly corrupting your entire system.<p>On top of this, CPUs now often will (internally, or with the help of the motherboard chipset) dynamically alter their clock based on the temperature.  So undervolting reduces the power consumed at a given temperature, which will <i>increase</i> the speed your CPU runs at, if you are thermally limited.  This means a setup with poor cooling will use the same amount of power before but run faster.')
