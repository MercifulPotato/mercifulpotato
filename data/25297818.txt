The gist 8is split amongst everybody (all your friends getting value out of the same $20) even if you&#x27;re still paying the whole amount.<p>Plus when this happens usually they&#x27;ll bring food and drinks,  or they&#x27;ll do similar when at their house, or cover you when the next time you go out, etc. So it all evens out.<p>It&#x27;s the same concept as having a BBQ. You&#x27;re not the only person eating the bbq but you likely bought it and ate doing the cooking lol')
