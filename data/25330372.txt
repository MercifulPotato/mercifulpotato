Certainly renders it unusable for me. Having Lua integration is just great.<p>Also, `lualatex` does not have some of the limitations of `xelatex` (memory limitations, `contours` package, ...), but I guess this XeTeX reimplementation can work on removing those implementations, so that only lack of Lua integration remains.<p>Also, like another person said, not having biber breaks my workflow as well, which specifically tries to leverage the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; of what LaTeX has to offer [0]: `pdflatex` is obsolete, so `lualatex` it is. `nomencl`, `makeindex` etc. are obsolete, so `glossaries-extra` it is. `bibtex` is obsolete,  so `biber` it is. Throw in `latexmk` for automatic compilation (which the tool presented here does too, which is a biggie! [1]) and CI&#x2F;CD and you have a 1970s tool in 2020s attire. Lua rounds off the picture.<p>Among other things, this given Unicode-native (<i>gasp</i>) code&#x2F;documents, and great automation capabilities (`latexmk`, CI&#x2F;CD, Lua).<p>I think a modern TeX engine reimplementation should support all of the above, which are arguably the best modern options there are.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collaborating.tuhh.de&#x2F;alex&#x2F;latex-git-cookbook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collaborating.tuhh.de&#x2F;alex&#x2F;latex-git-cookbook</a>\n[1]: I wonder if the logs are available though? aux, blg etc. are important for debugging and shouldn&#x27;t be dropped outright.')
