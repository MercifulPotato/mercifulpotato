If you or the team do a shitty job, the feedback and the results are often not immediate, and absorbed by the bigness of the corp. I have seen fair share of disinterest and mediocrity in my place of work and I think it&#x27;s a leadership problem partly, where they&#x27;ve pretty much failed to motivate or incentivize people to improve&#x2F;move around the company and you have people working for years in the same role and project doing the same work, creating very little new value.<p>Also great point that it might be a characteristic of somebody choosing to work for a big corp vs something else. In today&#x27;s climate that seems a very safe decision for a new grad. Ultimately it&#x27;s a job that you do to earn money, it&#x27;s naive to think everybody wants the same thing from their job.')
