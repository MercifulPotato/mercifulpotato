I can&#x27;t see this lasting long term in its current form.<p>I had a form readers of my blog could fill out to contact me.  It asked for their name and email address.  After they submitted the form I sent them a nice automatic reply along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  Hello &lt;name&gt;,\n  Blah blah blah.\n  \n  Thanks,\n  frompdx\n</code></pre>\nThis was integrated with my personal gmail account.  One day I woke up to a ton of bounced emails.  Checking my sent folder, a ton more didn&#x27;t bounce.  The name field was enough for a spammer to co-opt my contact form into a spam mailer.<p>Regardless, I think this is needlessly passive aggressive and not a good way to handle something like this in general.  For one, I think there is a good chance the recruiter will still know who sent the message.  It&#x27;s a small world.  Why burn bridges?<p>I know how it feels to never get a reply back.  Yes it is frustrating.  I just don&#x27;t think this is the solution to the problem.  Someone being unprofessional to you is not justification to be unprofessional to them.  Reputation is a two way street.  Don&#x27;t let others catch you on the wrong side of the road over something like this.')
