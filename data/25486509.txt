In a more complex design you have add and multiply, but also add-multiply that does both. By having that more complex instruction you can get more work done on a single instruction, but it requires more silicon.<p>If your goal is: build a CPU that is as simple as possible, with as few gates as possible then RISC-V is great, But if you are trying to get good performance, then RISC-v is a bad design. I think RISC-V is great, and i think it will se a lot of sucsess, because there are many applications for a slow, simple and free CPU, but it wont compete with x86 and ARM on performance.')
