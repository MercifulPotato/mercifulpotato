Yes, the subject domain is <i>much more</i> complex than in physics or chemistry, which means it&#x27;s much harder to apply any sort of rigor, and much harder to get an actual result. But that shouldn&#x27;t be an excuse to stop trying! As the field gets more difficult - softer(!) - I&#x27;d expect the work to be done with much more care and at much slower rate. Instead, I see that the quality of work has been sacrificed. The replication crisis happened not because soft fields were difficult per se, but because the work done was sloppy. It is my impression that the soft fields don&#x27;t respect the difficulty of their subject domains.')
