[0] Here are some quotes from said emails:<p>&quot;This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.&quot;<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll probably have to go to other regulators around the world to Jedi-mind trick them into accepting the FSB findings, but that shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.&quot;<p>&quot;Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>&quot;I still haven&#x27;t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year.&quot;<p>&gt; What do people propose? Shut down Boeing?<p>No. What I propose is what I&#x27;m doing; I don&#x27;t fly on Boeing planes anymore. If I see a flight change to a Boeing plane, I call the airline and demand to be switched to a different flight. It worked once, and I plan to keep doing it.<p>&gt; Want carriers to just scrap their 737 MAX tails? Right now? That&#x27;s the same thing as just declaring bankruptcy. The investment in a commercial aircraft takes years of steady use to pay off, and no one in the industry is in a financial position to take that hit.<p>I don&#x27;t care what carriers have to do. At this point, I would consider it justice to see Boeing go bankrupt. And I really don&#x27;t care if every airline that runs Boeing planes goes bankrupt. Companies come and go. Money is made and lost. But human lives cannot be returned and corruption like this can&#x27;t be allowed to continue.<p>But that won&#x27;t happen. What will happen is that the government will continue to bail out all the above, indefinitely. But if enough customers begin showing concern over Boeing, the airlines will purchase their planes less and less, and we can expect things to get better, either with Boeing&#x27;s demise or its reform.<p>----<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;outrageous-messages-from-boeing-employees-2020-1#this-airplane-is-designed-by-clowns-who-in-turn-are-supervised-by-monkeys-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;outrageous-messages-from-boe...</a>')
