Do we have enough data to compute this?  my layman&#x27;s guess is that if someone is asymptomatic and receives a negative test, they&#x27;re not likely to follow it up with another test (which would be one way to learn the first test was a false-negative).  But maybe there are other clever ways at getting at the false-negative rate for each type of test.')
