I&#x27;m alert and well rested, but if I wake up I&#x27;ll be tired in an hour or two.  If I push myself to sleep more, I wake up around 7-8 hours feeling more tired, and I can easily sleep to 10 hours at that point.  It&#x27;s really frustrating, because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a perfect amount of sleep for me anymore.<p>I&#x27;m 45, Bipolar type II.  Ever since trying intermittent fasting I&#x27;m extremely tired after meals, and my caffeine tolerance is <i>way</i> up.  I always drank half a cup at most, now I need 2.5 a day just to function.  I have sleep apnea, but it&#x27;s well controlled with a CPAP(AHI&lt;5).  I feel like I need a couple month sabbatical to reset myself but I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon.')
