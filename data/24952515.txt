He says slapping a woman is fine if she is already abusing you.<p>I&#x27;d rather walk away than slap personally, because girls like he describe are just a waste of time from experience (even though they usually think it makes them cool lol), but he is NOT advocating abusing at all. He is advocating &quot;slapping&quot; (and making it clear to not punch) to END abuse.')
