Not only deaths but possible permanent damage to respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems.<p>I agree, do what you want, but I think you should also be liable for the damages you inflict on others. If this means jail time (possibly life if enough are infected and killed), how does that help your &#x27;personal freedom&#x27;.')
