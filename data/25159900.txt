I&#x27;m not an anti-vaxxer or anything like that. But I think &quot;don&#x27;t use version 1.0&quot; advice applies here just like it does for software. Especially given the possibility that things have been &quot;hurried&quot; in the name of expediency in terms of getting the vaccine(s) developed, tested, and approved.<p>The good news, in a sort of perverse sense, is that some delay to see what happens with &quot;early adopters&quot; is kinda inevitable anyway, due to the distribution logistics. Unless you&#x27;re a health care provider, first responder, or in a high risk group, you&#x27;ll probably have to wait a while to get access to the vaccine even if you <i>want</i> to take &quot;version 1.0&quot;.')
