I visited my local library for a tour.   They have an automated system that collects returned books, sorts them, scans and processes them, then puts them in boxes to be shipped to other libraries if they need to go there.   Or puts them in carts and labels them with instructions about the efficient path to travel to return books...<p>The humans just take orders from the machine when there is a cart ready with books to be put on the shelf or boxes to be sent to other libraries.<p>Interesting times.')
