The issue here is that land is scarce, and can be made more scarce by various laws. Building&#x2F;construction costs have decreased somewhat, but the major cost is the land, and lack of density leads to lower supply.<p>You may have misunderstood, I&#x27;m suggesting it&#x27;s not possible for something to remain perpetually affordable and be a good investment. A good investment becomes <i>less</i> affordable over time. A bad investment does the opposite.<p>For instance, nobody complains about how unaffordable AAPL shares are do they? That wouldn&#x27;t make a lick of sense because that&#x27;s the desired outcome. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> you invest.<p>If you want housing to be affordable you don&#x27;t invest, you buy. Like a car.')
