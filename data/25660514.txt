As long as you use a histogram first and don&#x27;t blindly calculate (say) the mean it should he obvious.<p>Two examples( that are slightly bigger than this but the same principles apply):<p>If you benchmark a std::vector at insertion, you&#x27;ll see a flat graph with n tall spikes at ratios of it&#x27;s reallocation amount apart, and it scales very very well. The measurements are clean.<p>If, however, you do the same for a linked list you get a linearly increasing graph <i>but</i> it&#x27;s absolutely all over the place because it doesn&#x27;t play nice with the memory hierarchy. The std_dev of a given value of n might be a hundred times worse than the vector.')
