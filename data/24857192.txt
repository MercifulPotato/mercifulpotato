Instead, Talib would bet their behaviour will still be like others in the X-believing community. When tech is currently doing a lot of soul-searching about the social effects of e.g. Facebook it&#x27;s useful to have a theory to explain why predictions of user behaviour were wrong.<p>At a more specific level, I think this is very useful for thinking about programming language communities and how they affect behaviour.')
