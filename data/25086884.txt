The only model line that gets replaced is the MacBook Air which has been, frankly, cheap-is and underpowered for a long time.<p>So you have a platform that is (currently) embodied by entry level systems that appear to be noticeably faster than their predecessors. Apple has said publicly that they plan to finish this transition in 2 years. So more models are coming - and they&#x27;ll have to be more performant again.<p>It seems pretty clear that the play here runs &quot;Look here&#x27;s our entry level, it&#x27;s better than anyone else&#x27;s entry level and could be comparable to midlevel from anyone else. But after taking crap for being underpowered while waiting for intel to deliver we cn now say that this is the new bar for performance at the entry level in these price brackets.&quot;')
