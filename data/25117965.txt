To add all those buttons means for other games players are left wondering which of the dozen buttons is &quot;jump&quot; and which one is &quot;fire&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re into the fighting games, then what can you do. It seems often that people try to design a machine to do <i>everything</i> and end up with a bad UX.<p>I&#x27;ve built perhaps 8 or so MAME machines over the past 15 years or so and have experimented with different layouts on them. I move more and more away from trying to be all games in one cabinet.<p>Not to piss on this particular cabinet at all. I love it when anyone builds something for themselves. I love it doubley when they share their experiences. Congratulations on both.<p>It had never occurred to me to use GitHub to document such a thing. I do see it more and more though veering from code-only. Your write-up is so much better than anything I have seen on that Instructables car-crash of a site. ;-)')
