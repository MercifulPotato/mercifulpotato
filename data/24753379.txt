They collaborated on merging the Wikidata dataset and Google&#x27;s Knowledge Graph, so now the entities can be connected.<p>Google gets the benefit of their dataset for their knowledge boxes. You can see the difference in the source code of searches looking at the entity ids, &#x2F;g&#x2F; is Google&#x27;s own data and &#x2F;w&#x2F; is wikidata sourced.<p>I see the relationship Google has with Wikipedia similar to the one it had with DMOZ. I imagine at some point in the future that Google will see them as surplus to requirements, though not quite sure how they replace 5 million volunteer editors economically.')
