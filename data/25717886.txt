The way I season pans is simple, I just put the thing on a medium fire, dab some canola oil on it, rub it in, wipe it off, repeat this once or twice after which I just use it with enough oil (canola or olive). I clean them by rinsing them while hot with cold water which starts boiling immediately, wipe them with some paper and put them away. As long as they&#x27;re kept dry they don&#x27;t need reseasoning. No fancy oils needed, no special rituals, just use them regularly and that&#x27;s it.')
