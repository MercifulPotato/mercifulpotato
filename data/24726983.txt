Those goalposts moved quickly.<p>But let&#x27;s say your theory is true and that the lower ranks of Yale&#x27;s graduating classes are full of Black students, why is that a problem?  Is getting bad grades at Yale going to damage your life?  Are people graduating low in their class from elite universities worse off than people graduating higher in their class from worst universities?  Plenty of successful people weren&#x27;t highly ranked in their graduating class.  Getting bad grades at an elite university like Yale seems to almost be a requirement to run for president nowadays.  And regardless of the admission policies, some people have to end up being the worst ranked in their graduating class. Why does it matter if it is a Black students or anyone else?')
