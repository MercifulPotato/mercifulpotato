I hope the experience this time will be better than the previous ones:<p>what drives the schema?\nWe provide you with an intuitive UI to create the schema. Later down the road, we plan to add a CLI for easier integration with scripts and other tools.<p>Can I use websockets with this? \nSince we provide you with a generated Node.js source code you can build on top of it with whatever you want and expand your application with any missing capabilities. \nWebsocket is also on our list, but to be honest the list is long. We are looking forward to getting more contributors to be able to expedite the releases.<p>What problems does it solve that others don&#x27;t? \nWe are focusing on saving time for Node.js developers and provide them with a set of tools for all the repetitive tasks they usually face.<p>Why does a simple CRUD application need GraphQL integration? \nWe initially generate the app with CRUD operations (both with REST and GraphQL). The idea is that developers will keep adding on top of that all the more complex APIs and operations relevant to their business domain - Currently with code, and soon with more tools to expedite some of the boilerplate.<p>Why are there emojis everywhere? \nWe love emojis, more precisely we love beautiful UI. Once the CLI is out you will be able to avoid the emojis :-)<p>Why does it feel like their intentions are unclear?\nI would love to provide details on every question you may have about our intentions. Generally speaking, we hope in the future to create a sustainable business around the open-source project, while keeping the service free for 99% of the users. The project is open-source so anyone can host a server locally and get all the benefits of Amplication with no string attached.')
