There was a startup years ago whose name I can&#x27;t remember anymroe that tried doing it with a (relatively) high voltage DC system (I think 240), where the &quot;packets&quot; were very short (ms) bursts of energy, followed by short signaling bursts with very little amperage.  Something about the protocol and design of it meant that even though high voltage DC systems like that are typically considered very dangerous, this one you could just grab a live wire, and it would just not send the next pulse because the signaling had been interrupted.  The energy within a given pulse was under the safety threshold of things we tolerate now.<p>That and of course the reigning champion so far: USB PD.  Wicked hot mess that it is, wouldn&#x27;t be the first time the kludge wins.')
