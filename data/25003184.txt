There are plenty of unusual resumes. For example, someone whose mobile app got millions of downloads while he was still in high school. Someone who is a chess grandmaster. Someone who has no college degree, but is the top-rated answerer of Stack Overflow questions in a popular category. It&#x27;s not like there are thousands of resumes out there just like this, and I just haven&#x27;t seen them due to my biased experience.')
