My college and I were both getting failures, but different failures. The reason was: Different versions of Chrome, and thus different versions of the chrome integration plugin.<p>Given that we have effectively no control over Chrome&#x27;s auto-updates, we&#x27;ll never have truly identical development environments. A container with headless chrome would have resolved this for us.')
