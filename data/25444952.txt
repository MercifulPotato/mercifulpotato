Right now, the only reason we&#x27;re talking about them is that Firefox is sitting atop a sizable share of a practically impenetrable market. Very successful companies are being started around much less of a product, but Mozilla seems to genuinely have no idea what else can be done with a browser in the future. If they knew, they would become a proper <i>browser as a platform</i> company.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s me being too naive, but if you had asked me 10 years ago to predict where they would be, I would&#x27;ve said that in the future Firefox would come in different versions. The main one, the flagship, would remain the general purpose browser that we know. But there would be some special editions custom tailored to specific markets. You&#x27;d have &quot;Enterprise&quot; editions, that facilitate internal app development for organizations. If your organization needed to quickly build internal tools, you wouldn&#x27;t need to tussle with WebPack and all the other front-end nonsense. The browser would come already equipped with a development toolkit and environment, ready to connect to your db of choice, etc. I imagined that they could come up with other special versions of Firefox already customized to facilitate integration with popular platforms like Salesforce, Amazon, and others for people who work or develop for those.<p>A proper <i>browser as a platform</i> with an ecosystem. I still think it&#x27;s possible.')
