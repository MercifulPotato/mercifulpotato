The notion that hygienic lifestyles can lead to a weaker immune system or microbiome is plausible, but I&#x27;d actually be pretty surprised if it translated into worse long-term outcomes like life expectancy. Being exposed to lots of pathogens can have some pretty big downsides. We&#x27;re only just beginning to understand long-term COVID symptoms and it&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ve missed long-term symptoms of lots of pathogens. I have had chronic canker sores my whole life (cause by retrovirus) that I definitely could live without. ERVs kinda freak me out too.')
