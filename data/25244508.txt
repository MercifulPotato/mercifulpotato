The price of the phone pays for certain expectations of service: software updates, Siri, Maps, etc. (this is even reflected in the way Apple books revenue in their public filings.) There&#x27;s no reason the app store couldn&#x27;t work that way as well. It&#x27;s not selfish to expect that if you pay $1,000 on a phone that there isn&#x27;t a hidden and unavoidable tax on third party apps purchased for it.')
