Where is she saying this? Everything I&#x27;ve read from her suggests that she&#x27;s against <i>building bigger accelerators</i>, not stop investigating particle physics.<p>E.g. from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;nonsense-arguments-for-building-bigger.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;nonsense-arguments-...</a>:<p>&gt; Science is exploratory and to make progress we should study what has not been studied before, true. But any new experiment in the foundations of physics does that. You can probe new regimes not only be reaching higher energies, but also by reaching higher resolution, better precision, bigger systems, lower temperatures, less noise, more data, and so on.<p>&gt; No one is saying we should stop explorative research in the foundations of physics. But since resources are limited, we should invest in experiments that bring the biggest benefit for the projected cost. This means the higher the expenses for an experiment, the better the reasons for building it should be. And since a bigger particle collider is presently the most expensive proposal on the table, particle physicists should have the best reasons.')
