Quip could provide the productivity suite features, and Slack could provide the chat features.<p>An integrated Slack and Quip product could be a decent competitor to Microsoft Teams, especially for the large amount of customers who already pay for either Salesforce, Quip, or Slack separately. It would probably be a lot easier for existing customers to add new features to what they are already paying for than it would be to switch to Microsoft Teams.')
