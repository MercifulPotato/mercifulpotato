That and of course, collecting the proceeds of ransomware.<p>That&#x27;s the wrong part, even if it was just hyperbole for literary effect then you are conflating legal terms you don&#x27;t really understand then. Money laundering is a legal term that requires an illicit origin, not merely circumventing the permission of a centralized authority. You were correct that it is designed to ignore the concept of centralized authorities, the rest was either a completely incorrect extrapolation of that, or hyperbole that did not give the effect you thought it did as it just undermines your point and the strength of your argument.')
