The first thing it puts is the argc followed by an array of argv pointers, followed by a zero. After that it puts the environment variables, followed by a zero. And then it puts the aux-vector, which contains lots of useful things. And that&#x27;s where you could pass the address of a system call translation&#x2F;jump table. This aux-vector is already used to enable multi-threading, because it contains the necessary information to create the thread-local storage.<p>One drawback here is that your simple hello-world write&#x2F;printf in assembly becomes complicated, because you need to get the table address so you can access the write&#x2F;exit information. As far as what this would help for security, I have no idea, other than making it harder to exploit cases where you don&#x27;t have a lot of room.<p>We don&#x27;t hear a lot about all the exploits that didn&#x27;t happen because of all the extra hoops you have to jump through with each change over the years.')
