Item(by='rm445', descendants=None, kids=[25093585], score=None, time=1605371044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093030, text='I&#x27;ve had a recruitment consultant suggest I use a gmail e-mail address on my CV, because it looks weird to have an address at a domain (my own, and not anything strange btw) that people haven&#x27;t heard of. Sounds crazy. But try dictating an e-mail address over the phone to a hotel or whatever and see that if you say &#x27;Fred Bloggs seventy six at gmail dot com&#x27; or whatever, you never have to repeat yourself, whereas anything less usual you&#x27;ll be spelling it out all day.<p>On the technical side, one hears about individuals&#x27; domains being marked (blamelessly) as possible-spammers by the big e-mail services, and finding it hard to get messages through. There is effectively some scarcity in legible, desirable gmail addresses.')
