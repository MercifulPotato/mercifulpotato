I definitely hear this, and I think it would be crazy for us to think that we can build a single tool that will be useful across all ranges of team dynamics and culture.<p>FWIW, just like how companies can have different cultures around their physical spaces, they could have different practices&#x2F;expectations set around the virtual space. For example, if there is now an expectation for people to be in the Gather office all the time, that seems like an issue with the company (and you could expect them to do other unpleasant things like, expect you to respond to Slack messages at 10 PM).<p>Another q would be: under the current paradigm, are you enjoying work from home more than physical offices? One of our goals here is to replicate the physical ones, so maybe this is just not directionally correct for you.<p>I also admit that I haven&#x27;t had any of the particular experiences mention, so maybe I&#x27;m talking out of my sphere of knowledge here.')
