So many restaurants I&#x27;ve found, plans I&#x27;ve made, songs I&#x27;ve remembered, on empty roads or in Nebraska in broad daylight. I&#x27;ve encountered multiple people who don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to use your phone <i>while stopped at a light</i>. They&#x27;re intolerant of other opinions so they will win eventually.')
