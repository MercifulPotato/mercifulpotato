So the title is wrong to start with.<p>Then, they assert that <i>most people don&#x27;t live in houses</i>, also wrong. 60% of Americans (and similar elsewhere) live in houses. Not apartments etc.<p>Then, the predictions. Why are 1-2 person households the trend? Is it because people don&#x27;t want to live in a house and own a car? Are the so-called Millennials at the core of this? No. If they have the income, they buy houses and cars, exactly as people before them did.<p>So what is the supposed trend about? I imagine it&#x27;s because of a lack of suburb development. Zoning, land use, distance to city centers. People don&#x27;t live in suburbs, because for whatever reason they&#x27;re not being built fast enough at a cost that is affordable.')
