It&#x27;s a stimulant, like caffeine.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Nicotine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Nicotine</a><p>I propose an alternative - a charity should just give nicotine gum or patches to smokers to help them quit.

Even a percentage uptake should save them money if their incentives are aligned.')
