IIRC they were about 9”x6” and mostly black &amp; white. I found them hilarious, I think for a couple reasons:<p>1. John was such a clueless loser<p>2. Garfield got so enraged at Nermal<p>3. Odie kept bouncing back<p>This was not a deep humor. It’s the kind of humor where you see a dumb, funny video on the internet, snort a laugh, and move on, completely forgetting it ten seconds later.')
