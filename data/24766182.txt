I personally see this as a privileged perspective.<p>&gt;It might instead be that the more aggressive police departments are the ones that more seek to purchase military equipment, and the more aggressive police are the ones with more killings. I tend to think that&#x27;s the case.<p>Causal relationship between killings and military gear can easily be explained by &quot;dangerous communities motivate police to seek out military gear.  Dangerous communities have more killings in general.&quot;  I believe it&#x27;s the most straightforward explanation.')
