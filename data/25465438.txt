So let’s render its contents and find the height. But wait – the thing we are trying to render in the centre is part of the contents, so we’ve got ourselves into an infinite loop.<p>What? Where did the loop come into it? The height of the document is defined by the height of its contents. The thing we&#x27;re putting in the document is part of the contents. So what? You can render it and measure its height without needing to lay out the document. There is no self-reference or circular reference anywhere in the &quot;problem&quot; you&#x27;ve described. The height of the element is an input into the centering problem, but it&#x27;s not also an output of the centering problem. The positioning of the element is an output of the centering problem, but it&#x27;s not an input into it.')
