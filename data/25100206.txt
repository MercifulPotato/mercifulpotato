If the baby falls asleep before the light is off, she doesn&#x27;t want to get up to have to turn the light off since it will wake the baby. Now she can just turn it off from her phone.<p>Kinda just expanded from there.<p>Now a good chunk of the regularly used bulbs in the house are &quot;smart&quot;.<p>Basically what it means is that if you turn a light on, it turns on like a normal bulb (or you can do a quick flick off&#x2F;on again to turn it on at a dimmer brightness) but you can pull your phone out and dim it &#x2F; change the temperature &#x2F; etc. Closer to bed time? Easy to dim the lights and make them super warm.<p>So that right there is already kinda useful for &lt;$5&#x2F;bulb. My workspace is a normal warm temperature at a reasonable brightness until I&#x27;m trying to do some soldering or something then I can instantly make it bright and white.<p>From there I expanded out into adding a few basic sensors. Combination motion&#x2F;temperature&#x2F;humidity&#x2F;brightness sensors. So now when I get up for a piss in the middle of the night as soon as I walk out of the bedroom the hallway sensor sees that someone&#x27;s there and that the hallway is pitch black and turns the hall light on as a red light at ~5% brightness.<p>When you walk into the baby&#x27;s room in the middle of the night, same deal. Dim red light. If you go in in the daytime, bright warm light.<p>Did a similar thing with some of the basement too. Now as soon as I walk into one end of the basement to take the dog outside, do laundry, grab a tool, etc... the lights just come on. They stay on for a couple minutes after the last time motion is sensed and then automatically turn back off. Especially since half the basement is on a single light switch, this results in a lot less wasted power.<p>The lights in my office come on when I walk in if it&#x27;s dark, and when I unlock my computer it shoots a message out over a MQTT broker which my automation takes as &quot;someone is occupying this space now&quot; and leaves them on. When I lock my computer, two minutes later if no motion is sensed it&#x27;ll turn them off.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d ever add 500 different controls to my house (not sure what I&#x27;d even use that many for...), but as far as I&#x27;ve taken it so far it&#x27;s super convenient.<p>In the future I fully intend to get a smart thermostat (or replace my thermostat with some controlled relays) and use some &quot;smart&quot; air registers so I the temperature sensors I have can create a loop integrating the temperature sensing integrated in the motion&#x2F;luminance sensors in most rooms with the heating to more precisely control the temperature throughout the house--if one room is already warm enough but the rest of the house is cold, can automatically close the vent to keep the temperature pretty consistent throughout the house.')
