AMD could do the same.<p>The only thing the M1 has integrated that a typical AMD or Intel laptop CPU doesn&#x27;t have is a neural net processor. Everything else about the M1&#x27;s &#x27;integrated architecture&#x27; is typical.<p>Notably the M1&#x27;s RAM is <i>not</i> integrated as is often incorrectly stated. It&#x27;s just regular soldered LPDDR4X. And M1&#x27;s RAM latencies are worse than Intel &amp; AMD&#x27;s socketed DDR4 latencies, so being soldered and physically close is definitely not providing a performance advantage.')
