Switching to a synonym which is maybe more often associated with female instead of male gets everyone in the entire department fired?<p>What a horribly toxic environment. I can&#x27;t imagine any employees slept soundly at night knowing that if they were in the room when someone said a PG-13 word that they&#x27;d be fired on the spot.')
