Some might argue that it distorts the democratic process, some others could argue that it&#x27;s merely an extension of exchanging promises for votes.<p>Unfortunately, this is not an area I&#x27;m very familiar with, so you&#x27;ll probably have to look elsewhere for well-reasoned analyses.<p>&gt; Politicians get to do it. Why can&#x27;t I do it?<p>Someone else doing something wrong is rather poor justification for you being able to do something wrong.<p>Of course, this is contingent upon you believing vote selling is wrong; if you think it is acceptable, then the unequal treatment can be something worth addressing.<p>&gt; How does it open the door to voter intimidation? Someone steals my ballot receipt and checks who I voted for?<p>It basically boils down to someone with power over you sitting you down in front of a computer and asking you to prove who&#x2F;what you voted for, with some kind of negative consequence if you refuse or picked the &quot;wrong&quot; candidate&#x2F;issues.<p>Stealing a ballot receipt in lieu of asking you to show the result yourself is another way to go about it.')
