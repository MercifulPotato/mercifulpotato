You can do that now on Google AdWords if you&#x27;re will to out spend anyone else for those keywords like &#x27;Android&#x27;. In that instance, all it means is that an ad for your product appears when someone searches your rival. In fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure this SOP for marketing teams.<p>If you mean replace any relevant search results for &#x27;Android&#x27; with &#x27;iPhone 12&#x27; and&#x2F;or &#x27;iOS 14&#x27;, then yeah, that would be pretty egregious. However, I can&#x27;t see that actually happening for a couple of reasons. 1) it would be so obvious it was happening that there&#x27;s no denying it, 2) it would be so damaging that it would be a service killer as it&#x27;s all anyone would talk about and never trust it')
