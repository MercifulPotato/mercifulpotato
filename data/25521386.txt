That means he the flight was filed as VFR.  One of the things they teach you when you get an IFR rating is that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> fly into IFR weather (IFC for the pedants) during a VFR flight without a pre-filed plan. His IFR training didn&#x27;t teach him to fly in those conditions---it taught him to avoid them.  They didn&#x27;t have an IFR flight plan or clearance, so\nflying into a fog bank and persisting in that flight was forbidden and if unavoidable would constitute an emergency.  Which is why I tend to look pretty hard at the pilot in this case, not the instruments.')
