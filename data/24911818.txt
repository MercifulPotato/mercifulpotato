They are just tools and&#x2F;or higher abstractions. Embrace the fact that at one point you need to go down the abstraction layers and enable the users to do this, and do it well.<p>E.g. Unity is &quot;no code&quot; for a lot of stuff (putting scene together), but you also need code for other stuff.<p>Essentially for those tools to succeed they must allow mixing their abstractions and visuals with lower level code, in my opinion.')
