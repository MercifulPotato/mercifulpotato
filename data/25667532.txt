The protestors were able to gain access to several locations in Federal buildings that they weren&#x27;t supposed to be in. Nothing was changed to improve security, rather stupidly. During both  Kavanaugh and the BLM &#x2F; Antifa protests members of Congress were repeatedly threatened with death and or general physical violence (eg Rand Paul, a pacifist, being surrounded by a hyper violent mob and having to be shielded by half a dozen police officers as the mob tried to attack him and his family), little appears to have been modified to adjust for the atmosphere of increasing partisan violence that is enfulging the US. It&#x27;s obvious what that&#x27;s going to inevitably result in unless some appropriate security steps are taken. The partisan violence will get dramatically worse this decade as the sides split further apart. Some people foolishly think Biden is the end of it; Trump was only a symptom of what&#x27;s happening, which is the beginning of a cultural civil war (the two major political sides in the US have absolutely nothing in common now), and increasingly intense acts of violence will go along with that.')
