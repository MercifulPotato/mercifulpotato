Item(by='Pfhreak', descendants=None, kids=[25480585], score=None, time=1608406833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480291, text='&gt; History does not show this to be the case at all, The World is becoming a better place for everyone [1]<p>Driven predominantly by growth, which will taper off. We are an unusually explosive period of growth at the moment, and it&#x27;s already starting to recede. Growth is fueled in many cases by population expansion which has almost completely stalled in many places.<p>For an introductory read on the topic, I recommend Thomas Piketty&#x27;s <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i>.<p>&gt; The problem here is the fact you are not pushing for everyone to &quot;give&quot;, giving is a voluntary act, taxation is compulsory done under the explicit threat of violence. It is not an act of &quot;giving&quot; it is an act of taking.<p>I believe that the taxes you pay were never your money to begin with. I&#x27;m not giving the government my money, the government is ensuring that society has what it needs to care for everyone. The mechanism that it uses to do this needs to tap into either wealth or streams of finances, but neither is theft or taking from what I see. An analogy, salmon ladders in dams allow an important resource to flourish and don&#x27;t generate power. You might call that &#x27;theft&#x27; or &#x27;taking&#x27; power from the dam. I see it as &#x27;never the dams to begin with&#x27;. (In case it&#x27;s not clear, the water is money, you are the dam. Are you entitled to all the water that flows to you? You say yes, I say no, we disagree but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an objectively correct answer.)<p>Counter to the opinion that taxes are theft, I believe that austerity is theft. We can agree to disagree here if you&#x27;d like.')
