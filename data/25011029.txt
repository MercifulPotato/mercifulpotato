(10 megabytes per domain)<p>The design of localStorage is basically flawed, IMO.  It should have been two things: volatileStorage and permanentStorage.  volatileStorage would basically be exactly what localStorage is today, being very limited and not requiring any permissions.  permanentStorage would be like localStorage except it would require explicit permission, allow unlimited storage, and would be more difficult to accidentally delete(separate delete dialog from Clear History).<p>As far as I know, we don&#x27;t have anything like my proposed permanentStorage outside of web extensions, which leaves localStorage in a weird area where it&#x27;s only really useful for local app settings, even though such sparse data is easy enough to just store on a server in the first place.  It would still be useful for truly offline-first apps, or apps that don&#x27;t require accounts, but then this space of apps is still crippled by limited storage capacity.')
