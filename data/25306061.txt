Of course even the best comment can later be invalidated by someone carelessly changing the code and failing to update that comment. However, that doesn&#x27;t make pointless repetitive comments somehow better or more useful.<p>For me comments should concentrate on the why and maybe the how but mostly ignore the what. That should be obvious from the code.')
