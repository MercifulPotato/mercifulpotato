Are there more privacy based cell providers that people could switch to? I know it&#x27;s possible to make your own ISP for home internet but can that be done for cell phones too?<p>I primarily use a smartphone because my job makes me use one for VPN. If it was possible I wouldn&#x27;t mind keeping a useless smartphone with no data plan sitting in a drawer at home and going back to a feature phone (especially one with a slide out keyboard :D).')
