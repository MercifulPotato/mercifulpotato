It&#x27;s the critisism that at least three people (the document creator and two interns) did not use it, either due to ignorance or because Word has frequent problems with automatic lists. Either way, this is a problem with Word.<p>For me, Word and LaTeX are on par. Styles, referencing, formula, macros, auto-layout are possible in both. However real-world use is different because Word is the lowest common denominator and thus mostly only the basic features actually get used. Because everybody experienced the horror of automatic features at least once.')
