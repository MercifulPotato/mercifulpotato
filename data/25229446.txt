The difference in blood glucose between the two arms was just about 10%.<p>The na√Øve p-value between the two arms was barely significant at 2%, 6%, and 2%, but the p-values were taken from a complex model that probably has p-hacking problems and needs p-value correction.<p>I would wait for the replication study before believing in this effect.  <i>If</i> the effect is real, they only need to double their sample size to get a t-stat of 3 instead of 2, which would give a much more convincing p-value of 0.2% instead of the 2-6% right now.<p>I applaud the authors for exploring this theory though, and encourage replications to push the p-value down.')
