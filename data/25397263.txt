The testing disaster killed far more than this vaccine approval delay has killed and it&#x27;s infuriating that nobody seems to care.<p>They shut down testing back when we needed it most, allowing us to pretend there was no spread in the US for far too long: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;27&#x2F;coronavirus-testing-seattle-bill-gates-fda&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;27&#x2F;coronavirus-testing-seat...</a><p>They spent far too long before approving any kind of at-home testing and to this day have not approved most rapid testing.<p>Three weeks ago the EUA was submitted, so three weeks ago there was an entire team of people at pfizer who had reviewed all the data and were confident FDA would approve the application, but somehow nobody at FDA was part of that set of people. In any reasonable process that application would have contained no new information, if it contained any new information they were not communicating closely enough.<p>I understand spending a few days doing some final checks on the data before approving. Three weeks, however, is suspiciously long. It&#x27;s possible they were in fact doing important work which could not possibly have been done before the application was submitted, but nobody seems able to articulate what that important work actually was.')
