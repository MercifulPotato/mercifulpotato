My old flatmate was a very sort-after chef in the city we lived, getting job offers all over the place and he&#x27;d come home every night and make himself instant ramen because he didn&#x27;t want to spend anymore time in a kitchen.<p>If you&#x27;re failry young and unencumbered you have a few options ranging from least drastic like: pick up a new hobby, change teams, change jobs within the company or change jobs completely to a new company and variations on those to most drastic: change professions entirely, go to university, pick up a trade doing something that interests you.')
