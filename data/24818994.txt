It just so happens that in Rust a regular, adequate, middle-level engineer can easily write the best possible code because the language guides him to it, but in C++, a regular engineer still wouldn&#x27;t know about some gotchas that would make his code inferior.<p>It&#x27;s unknown unknowns: Rust shows most of them to you, while C++ stays silent.')
