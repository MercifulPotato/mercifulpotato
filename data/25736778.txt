That is on top of all the minor bugs others have already mentioned.<p>While I was able to at least get between 50 and 80 fps, the performance was absolutely terrible if I consider my specs (&gt;3500$ PC build).<p>All in all I was &quot;relatively bug free&quot; compared to the experiences of others. What I don&#x27;t understand are people saying it would be &quot;a masterpiece&quot; without the bugs, I disagree, the game was very bland in my opinion and I regret my purchase and the time I invested regardless of the bugs and problems. It wasn&#x27;t TERRIBLE, but I wish I had spent the money on another game.')
