I would posit that any goal of tax deductions is more transparently accomplished by the government spending the cash outright and having to account for it.<p>&gt;Just because what IKEA is doing is legal does not make it right.<p>In the context of tax law, I think it&#x27;s all fair game.  If the people want to close loopholes, then close them for everyone.  As a business, I&#x27;m going to do whatever I need to maintain a competitive advantage.  As a vote, I&#x27;m going to support legislation that levies taxes according to the quality of life I think people should have in society.')
