Item(by='__ryan__', descendants=None, kids=[24857773], score=None, time=1603366015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855893, text='&gt; Also - fuzzy search as mentioned.<p>So was your edit on the comment I replied to (repeated below) a typo?<p>&gt; Edit: also, searching for &quot;prolog web framework&quot; gets you stuff about using prolog for web application development. So, yeah, naming is not great and your assertion is not entirely correct.<p>This is an anecdote in favor of fuzzy search <i>not</i> really being an issue.<p>&gt; If someone tells me about this &quot;prologue web framework&quot; I could easily transliterate that as &quot;prolog&quot;.<p>If someone told me about that “C programming language” I could easily transliterate that as “sea” or misremember it as “B”.<p>These are contrived situations. Imagine someone told me about “Prologue: a web framework written in Nim”, and I transliterated that to “prolog web framework”. If I searched that and it didn’t come up with a web framework written in Nim, I would think critically about the issue and change my search to “prolog web framework Nim” and would find this project.<p>It would be so silly to change the name or avoid the name of a completely unrelated project when ideally anyone faced with the issue would have the critical thinking skills to adjust and refine their search terms so it was not an issue.')
