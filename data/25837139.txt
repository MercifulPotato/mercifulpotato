It sucks for Elastic but it&#x27;s good for customers. Amazon is driving the cost of hosted Elasticsearch down closer to its real costs which will always out-compete Elastic who&#x27;s trying to use their margin to fund development as well. So many businesses fall into the trap of not charging for their actual value and get eaten when someone else is better at their paid complementary services. Elastic&#x27;s value is the software, not their hosting abilities.')
