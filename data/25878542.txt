The nationalization of the parties, driven by people attacking each other within the party, is damaging. Other Republicans attack Larry Hogan as a RINO. How could that possibly help the party? On the other side of the aisle, the people I know who wanted to kick Joe Manchin out of the party for compromising on abortion are dead silent now.<p>I get voting Republican is a non-starter in most blue places, but where are the good-governance Democrats? There are some—I’m thrilled Biden is trying to raise the profile of Keisha Lance Bottoms. There used to be more. Back when Virginia was a red state, we had solid good-governance Democrats like Chuck Robb.<p>I don’t like to blame the parties, because I think they’re just responding to their incentives. I think there are just so many other battles to fight fixing things and making them work well isn’t a boon for re-election.')
