We do need to get our net emissions to 0 though, or even drive it negative for a while.<p>I&#x27;m such a fan of carbon taxes. If the market doesn&#x27;t account for externalities, then price them in with taxes. Then the market will solve climate faster than any amount of regulation or wishful thinking. That&#x27;s an excellent use of state power. Or governments or our people are too shortsighted or stupid I think it&#x27;s fair to say in this case to see that. I&#x27;m not entirely sure which it is, maybe both.<p>Working on carbon sequestration instead is also silly. I mean it&#x27;s a typical engineer response of ignoring the messy regulatory and political world and trying to build our way out of the problem. But we need to focus on both, working on one approach does not preclude the other.')
