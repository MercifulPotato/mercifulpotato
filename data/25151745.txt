A supersonic propeller is a propeller that can work in a supersonic airstream. The XF-84H had a top theoretical speed of Mach 0.9, though in testing it was evaluated to be more like Mach 0.83, and even that&#x27;s disputed, with another estimate being Mach 0.7. It never achieved these speeds.<p>The only plane to fly with a propeller at supersonic speeds was the XF-88B, though that was actually a jet aircraft that just had a propeller on the front for testing purposes - the vast majority of the thrust was still coming from the jet engines.')
