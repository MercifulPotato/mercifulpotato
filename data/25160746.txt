Unit tests are fragile. IMO, a significant factor contributing to relation between N (lines of code) and B (expected number of bugs) is human error. Humans write unit-tests. For a fun spin, consider the fact that &quot;more unit-tests&quot; means &quot;more lines of code&quot; and thus &quot;more bugs&quot;, but now in your &quot;test suite&quot;.<p>[p.s. fragility above refers to the <i>inevitable</i> drifts between the original test-subject (and associated test code) and subsequent changes to the codebase that require updates to the test codebase.]')
