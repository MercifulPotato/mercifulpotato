After some years the disk failed, and I had no chance to recover its content as touching a few bits meant the inability to decrypt it or recover a part of it. It had some of my most valuable memories and unfortunately, I had no backup.<p>Now, I prefer a solution which preserves the directory structure like EncFS and I make sure to backup.')
