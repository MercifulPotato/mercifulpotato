I want to build tools that make it dramatically easier to apply ML (especially NLP) to real world problems like:<p>- Routing customer support requests\n- Understanding freeform user feedback\n- Understanding the memetisphere of social media \n- Automating content moderation on social platforms\n- Bringing order to large document archives<p>I think it&#x27;s possible to build a code-free, interactive interface that enables all of these things (though it may be best to focus on a single vertical).<p>Hit me up if you&#x27;re interested in any of this. grady.hsimon at gmail.')
