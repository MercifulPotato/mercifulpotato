Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608571108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494649, text='I grew up in Sacramento and now live near Palo Alto. Sacramento has great public schools. I went to a public IB high school, whose science teams regularly placed in the top 3 in the US for Science Bowl&#x2F; Science Olympiad. In many parts of CA, the best schools are private (LA), or you have to pay millions of dollars for a house in the good districts (Palo Alto).<p>In Sacramento, they have what is called &#x27;open enrollment&#x27;, which allows people to send their kids to school outside of their district, if there is a program there that isn&#x27;t available locally. I had many classmates from across town, and one who lived halfway to Tahoe.<p>I personally think that areas like Half Moon Bay and Scott&#x27;s Valley will benefit from remote work. It&#x27;s close enough to go into SV when needed, but farther than many people would have wanted to commute daily. And they&#x27;re beautiful, with good weather. SLO will probably benefit also, and I imagine that schools will change in these areas, to become more like SV&#x2F;LA. That&#x27;s probably good for SF&#x2F;LA families, though locals might not like the changes.')
