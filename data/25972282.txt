It isn&#x27;t. America has crumbling infrastructure <i>and</i> a lack of jobs to fix it at the same time.<p>China turning off the trade tap will likely also stimulate the creation of jobs. iPhones will need to be made at home at some point in the not too distant future and they will still need plenty of people to do so.<p>Wealth re-redistribution will also stimulate demand, creating jobs. A lack of demand caused by a lack of wealth is not a &quot;true&quot; lack of demand.<p>When society starts lowering the retirement age to 50 and nobody frets about inflation <i>ever</i> - THAT&#x27;S when you know that full time work is really drying up. Not happening.')
