Item(by='inshadows', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612021422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969315, text='App Store is about central authority. F-Droid is about freedom to add whatever repositories you deem useful. It&#x27;s up to operators of F-Droid-the-repository to decide what they want to host. But it&#x27;s up to you to add another repository to the list. You say there&#x27;s no other repository hosting Gab? That is not a problem that can&#x27;t be dealt with. Unless network operator decide to ban routes, it&#x27;s just a work (setting up a repository and trust) that needs to be done.<p>EDIT: This is mentality I find hilarious. It&#x27;s either I can something for free or I can&#x27;t get it at all. I think freedom in this case is about having something with little expended work.')
