But I don&#x27;t expect OEMs to greatly improve their device&#x27;s support liftime: the industry is still not incentivized towards supporting a device for 4 years. On that point, please note how the SoC mentioned is amongst the highest-end. Don&#x27;t expect low-end devices to follow suit.<p>As a side-effect:\n- It&#x27;s likely the number of new features on a older SoC will drop (for instance I think we wouldn&#x27;t have WPA3 on SDM 855 under such a scheme)\n- Open-source community support will become harder. At the moment, a flagship released with Android 8 will get Android 10 drivers. With this, a flagship released with Android 11 will remain on Android 11 drivers forever. Community support is easier with the most recent drivers, so we&#x27;ll loose that.')
