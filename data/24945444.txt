There are groups attempting to force expression of certain opinions to only be through &quot;other choices&quot; and preventing third parties from interfering with communication between a speaker and people who <i>voluntarily</i> want to listen to that idea, no matter how good the intentions of the third party are, _is_ very much a matter of freedom of speech.  For example, note the &quot;seek, receive, and impart&quot; part of Article 19 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.[0]  That&#x27;s why the &quot;other choices&quot; argument isn&#x27;t persuasive; its underlying intent is often interference with voluntary communication in order to cut it off.<p>[0] &quot;<i>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</i>&quot; from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_speech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_speech</a>')
