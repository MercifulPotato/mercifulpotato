FB are also a fast growing company, and the likelihood is that many of the people who really appreciate how transformative and important Presto was are mostly gone now (perhaps lying on a bed made from dollar bills).<p>It appears (again from the article) that crummy management&#x2F;directors appear to want to maintain too much control over Presto (hilariously enough, FB actually stopped using open source Hive as the open committers kept introducing things that broke their workloads).<p>Therefore, the founders have made a company and changed the name. This could easily be a MySQL vs MariaDB situation, post Oracle acquisition.<p>I&#x27;d say the Linux foundation probably support any of their sponsors desires, much like other advocacy organisations.')
