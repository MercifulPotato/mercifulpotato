AlternateHistory.com is by far the biggest and there are active youtube channels<p>One of the biggest you tubers recently got outed following a white supremiscit rant - and that is one of the bigger &quot;smells&quot; around the community - histories of &quot;what if the Nazis won and what if the South won US civil war&quot; <i>can</i> spring not from curiosity but yearning.<p>I personally enjoy WhatIfAltHist as a channel, partly because he is fairly front and centre about his own political (rather centrist and boring) (small p) views.<p>The big takeaway I have found is that I learn something interesting about our real timeline history and about our real geopolitics - how England supported the creation of Portugal through the middle ages, or the extent Tamerlane changed Europe by killing everyone.  And just how <i>contingent</i> the world is.<p>So yeah it&#x27;s a fascinating area, tread carefully, I have only dipped my toes in, but it can be very eye opening.')
