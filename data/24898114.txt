Forcing white people to say &quot;all white people, including myself, are racist P&#x27;s of S&quot; is garbage and I would get up and walk out at that point, no amount of money or &quot;this position is cool&quot; would convince me to do otherwise. If you don&#x27;t have standards then why even be alive or call yourself an individual? Sure if you&#x27;re racist speak up and would like to fix it, otherwise it&#x27;s blackmail and you are working with garbage people.')
