It proactively reports illegal postings to LEO, shares logs proactively, responds quickly and is heavily moderated. Additionally most of the site isn&#x27;t troublesome.<p>The rules are US freedom of speech which is much more liberal than Europe and hate speech definitions so the content on the adult boards is shocking to me and some may be illegal in Europe, but it&#x27;s not illegal in the US.<p>There are worse sites but this one is the one that enters the less well informed public&#x27;s consciousness ironically.')
