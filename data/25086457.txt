Some seem to insist on attributing fallout like this to being caused by the _virus_ and as something that was never in our control.  That is false.  Covid doesn&#x27;t make measles spread.  Covid doesn&#x27;t force people to not get vaccinated for measles.  The culture and mitigation society chose to develop around covid caused these things.')
