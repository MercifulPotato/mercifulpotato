However, I think the “support small business” angle is going to be somewhat compelling. I have, for example, two friends who are starting a niche business, offering a good and ethical service, and reaching people in that niche through Facebook and Instagram ads. The customers they find <i>love</i> what they’re doing and happily paying. If I had Facebook, I could see doing my small part to help them find a few more of those types of good businesses succeed.<p>I also kind of despise Facebook, hence no account, so I don’t mind if this permission screen fails. :)')
