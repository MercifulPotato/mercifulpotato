A fast low-level program was re-written in a high-level language to reduce maintenance costs. These days on HN you usually only hear about the opposite, eg. Figma rewriting server Typescript code in Rust to improve performance [1]. Not fair to compare Rust to C, I know, but interesting nonetheless.<p>The loss of JIT was interesting. How does eval work? Apparently Chez Scheme AOT compiles code at runtime. Comparatively a JIT will change the compilation at runtime based on codepaths. There&#x27;s a thread about that here [2].<p>Part of the motivation of CS was to make it easier for people to contribute to the compiler. I&#x27;m excited to see how that plays out.<p>Thanks again everybody. I&#x27;ll go back to toying around with macros and tiny Racket programs now.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-in-production-at-figma&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-in-production-at-figma&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16406391" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16406391</a>')
