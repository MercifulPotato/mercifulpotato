We use Twilio for our WebRTC infrastructure with VP8 simulcast setup so we do use SFU but only through Twilio. We were considering how to get rid of Twilio and quite extensively researching what would it mean to run our own WebRTC infra as Twilio costs are pretty high (sometimes up to 1&#x2F;4 of our revenue).   But operating multiple servers around the word to act as SFUs or creating them on demand in e.g. GCP and paying the cloud tax in form of extremely expensive egress costs doesnâ€™t seem to be the right solution either. Other service providers have very similar pricing, that&#x27;s why we will stay with Twilio for now.')
