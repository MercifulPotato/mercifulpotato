That translation seems quite good given that they demonstrated a complex 3D game running translated code on ARM hardware much weaker than what Apple will deliver in laptops.<p>Honestly I think x86 games will run better on these ARM laptops. Keep in mind x86 on laptops donâ€™t work great. Apple could outperform most of their x86 laptops with a passively cooled ARM tablet.<p>An ARM laptop with active cooling will destroy their x86 lineup.<p>Besides you also get the whole iOS games catalog now which is much larger than the macOS game selection.')
