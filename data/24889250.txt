Item(by='laverya', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603654823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887026, text='&gt; we can&#x27;t find any lasting intervention (beyond very early childhood) to improve people&#x27;s IQ<p>We have, actually! It&#x27;s just that they&#x27;ve all been implemented already. Iodine supplementation was huge. (Childhood Iodine deficiency results in an adulthood IQ deficit of ~15 points)<p>The next big IQ improvement looks like it might be iterated embryo selection [0] which is currently possible and will soon be practical, but has a whole host of ethical issues attached to it. (Is it right for the children of the rich to get another advantage like this? (Not a question for the Talebs of the world who think IQ is bunk, but one I&#x27;m sure many will be asking) Is throwing away dozens of viable embryos ethical? Are we &#x27;playing god&#x27;? And further down the line, is using CRISPR-Cas9 to directly edit the genome of your descendants OK?)<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Embryo-selection" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Embryo-selection</a>')
