Historical data and all that. In the year 2020, there&#x27;s exactly no reason any jurisdiction should have anything less than perfection running poll sites.<p>The only slack (goodwill) I&#x27;m willing to grant admins this cycle is the massive pivot to postal ballots on short notice, while fending off widespread sabotage and harrassment.<p>Postal balloting <i>is very different</i> from running poll sites. Oregon and Washington experienced a lot of growing pains. And they made the transition gradually. Even so, our admins experienced a lot of burnout.<p>I imagine OR and WA admins are in a lot of Zoom calls with noobs nationwide. Alas, some jurisdictions don&#x27;t want to learn.<p>I expect 2020&#x27;s election to be the biggest fubar imaginable.')
