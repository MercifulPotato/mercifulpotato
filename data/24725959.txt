This would be identical to how you&#x27;d access your secrets locally when developing. You&#x27;d wrap your command with our CLI so that your secrets are injected into the process&#x27;s environment (e.g. `npm start` becomes `doppler run -- npm start`).<p>Client certificates are an interesting use case that we&#x27;d be open to, but admittedly the request hasn&#x27;t come up a whole bunch yet from our customers. Same with Kerberos tokens- this would definitely be used in the Enterprise space, which is an offering we&#x27;re still in the early stages of. Other forms of identity-based auth would fall into this category as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DopplerHQ&#x2F;cli" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DopplerHQ&#x2F;cli</a>')
