It&#x27;s not causing any extra consumption. It&#x27;s using space, but I don&#x27;t wish for a future where I don&#x27;t even have enough space to keep a personal car.<p>As for sharing everything, it&#x27;s a good theory but would never work in practice. Have you ever lived with people outside of your family or bubble? Some people are filthy and don&#x27;t even take care of things they own, let alone things they don&#x27;t. Are you expecting to be able to select who you are happy to share with?')
