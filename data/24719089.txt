They compete with each other in the same territories. With communication providers, it can sometimes be impossible to switch unless you physically move. That&#x27;s simply not the case with search engines.<p>&gt; Give me at least 5 - and in practice, more - options to choose<p>While this would be nice, not having &quot;at least 5 options&quot; is not a prerequisite for monopoly, by any definition.<p>&gt; If AMD had a smaller market share, Intel would be in much hotter water as recently as a decade ago.<p>Again, switching costs. That simply doesn&#x27;t exist in search engines.<p>&gt; Google maintains share by a variety of ways, including app store, mobile OS, agreements for pre-installation etc.<p>I think, at best, you can make the case that this kind of pre-installed bundling should be curtailed. But that&#x27;s a pretty narrow ruling.')
