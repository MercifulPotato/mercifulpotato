Not the metadata. And apparently the metadata is the most valuable data for government snoops. They don&#x27;t care as much what you&#x27;ve been saying, but knowing that you&#x27;ve been emailing back and forth weekly with some person of interest over the last 5 years is what they&#x27;re really after.<p>Also pgp doesn&#x27;t support any of signal&#x27;s key ratcheting or deniability. And the web of trust leaks information publicly about who your contacts are! (And its vulnerable to Sybil attacks.)<p>Don&#x27;t get be wrong, I love email and think its great. But it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Signal when it comes to secure communication.')
