In my city there is a situation where the police department and the transportation department currently define &quot;crosswalk&quot; differently, leading to some rather bizarre situations with police reports and attribution of fault (e.g. pedestrian crossing in something the transportation department considers to be a crosswalk but the police department does not, such as a marked bicycle crossing, because their definition is stricter).')
