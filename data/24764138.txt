Code has a clear context (variables and functions in scope) and a clear goal (return type). Editing code vs tactics is easy because the impact that each edit has on the context, goal, and code is clear and localised. Add or remove a tactic, and the rest of the proof can be completely invalidated.<p>The fact that you can look at a code snippet and tell what it does, but looking at a tactic snippet essentially tells you nothing, is exemplary of the difference. Just the fact that you need a more powerful editing tool (interactive provers) to edit tactic proofs at all is testament to how much more complicated they are.')
