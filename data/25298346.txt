I pay for what was google g suite for the &quot;unlimited&quot; storage. I&#x27;m at around 13TB stored, it&#x27;s mostly just backups so not really a huge deal if I lose it. The problem is there&#x27;s no real way to pay them for this. The new workplace plans are vague about additional storage.<p>I don&#x27;t get why companies selling storage cant offer higher and higher plans in say 2tb chunks.')
