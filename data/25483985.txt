You just said you wanted deterministic, text-based config, which JetBrains has.<p>I&#x27;ve used VS Code&#x27;s text-file config, before there was a GUI for most of the config options, and I actually found it to be pretty frustrating. A good GUI is a lot better than editing text, even with the IDE helping you stay within the schema.<p>JetBrains IDE&#x27;s probably fail the worst in that regard, I agree; but once you have a config you like, it&#x27;s easy to keep it consistent.<p>&gt; <i>but that doesn&#x27;t keep people (myself included) from running and debugging things from within their IDE because it&#x27;s a lot more comfortable</i><p>Again, these aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive. You can run&#x2F;debug code in a Docker container[1][2]. The IDE experience is exactly the same (click the Debug icon or use the shortcut, set breakpoints, whatever), it&#x27;s just that the VM is running your code instead of your dev environment.<p>1.
