Other countries did the former.<p>&gt; The reality is that maybe EU should have locked production to EU<p>They did, just read the contract. It&#x27;s not about locking production, it&#x27;s about paying for development.<p>As an analogy: let&#x27;s say you designed a new mobile phone, and you sent those designs off to a chinese company to manufacture. The deal is that after filling your order, the chinese company can continue manufacturing the product and sell it to other potential buyers in china. Is it surprising that your order should be filled before those of the other potential buyers?<p>The other buyers had the opportunity to come up with their own designs. They could even have split the cost of developing those designs with you. They didn&#x27;t do either of those things. Now that manufacturing has hit a short-fall, they don&#x27;t have a leg to stand on.')
