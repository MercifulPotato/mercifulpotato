I&#x27;ll secretly wait while you fix a thousand other unrelated problems that make our business better despite making no visible progress on the open-ended problem. Then I&#x27;ll reframe your work to show management that the thousand other things you improved are more valuable than the open-ended problem, and get you promoted.<p>I miss that guy.')
