My point was that history is cyclical, the same trends come and go. Static vs dynamic typing. Thin client vs thick client. Local vs distributed. Key-value vs relational. Monolithic vs micro*. And so on.<p>Yes, sometimes these have to do with changing requirements or hardware capabilities, but more often they&#x27;re just about a new generation wanting shiny new things rather than boring old things. Except that the shiny new things were the boring old things of the previous iteration.<p>Many ideas of the yesteryear were not bad or even infeasible, indeed they were successfully put into real-world use. Until the tide changed and they became unfashionable for whatever reason. And then they became fashionable again, but without a view of the history there&#x27;s little synthesis of ideas, little learning from past experiences beyond the current cycle.')
