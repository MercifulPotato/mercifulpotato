You might need WEEKS for this.\n- all variables are taken care of. Stack is known, and you’ve experience with all parts involved. If you don’t, get familiar with the parts first. Again, might take weeks.\n- there is no implicit functionality. It is either explicit or not included.\n- there are clear boundaries and rules to prevent feature creep.\n- you cannot estimate an estimate\n- all designs and UX are final<p>Now the problem is, this estimate is really expensive, because it’s actual work. It takes about 10-25% of the total project time to estimate the project.')
