I installed it, and as a new user the default experience is basically a Twitter clone, but with only prominent right wing celebrities like Sean Hannitty.<p>I didn’t see any hateful trending topics here. My personal opinion is that it seems Parler is getting somewhat screwed here.<p>Sure, maybe there was some hateful content somewhere, but it certainly wasn’t being promoted to new users. Every online site has people trolling and spewing hate, but Parler is a tiny site with minimal funding.<p>I get that people want a scapegoat, but I do not think this is constructive.')
