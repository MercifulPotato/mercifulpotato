Then stick in two pipes, on for sending water down, one for steam to come up. Run a turbine, add a valve to regulate how much water you want to converted into steam to be able to regulate output, enjoy your first mover advantage and price the competition out of the market.<p>... It&#x27;s not that I do not understand that it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that - but I&#x27;m puzzled that noone is doing it on a much bigger scale.<p>Oil companies are the ones at the forefront of deep drilling technology,<p>They know that &quot;Oil is bad&quot; and that oil is going to run out. <i>I&#x27;d</i> like them to stop drilling for oil completely - but even if they keep pumping oil, why do they not cash in on this additional front and enjoy money <i>and</i> good PR.')
