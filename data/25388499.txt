Option, Result, and Future are all both Functors (map) and Monads (and_then). You&#x27;ve probably used them without even knowing, because we didn&#x27;t give it some weird, unlearnable category theory name.<p>If someone were to create an explicit trait for them and RFC it, they&#x27;d probably name it something like Map and Then rather than Functor and Monad.')
