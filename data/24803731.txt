Each app (network ingress&#x2F;egress, data handling, relays, etc) sits on the bus, and can use async&#x2F;await to do IO concurrency, but on the app level, there&#x27;s no threading and no locking to observe.<p>Each app also has a erlang-inspired supervisor task system, where each task is just a async proc kept alive. It&#x27;s proven to be very robust (from the standpoint of service availability) in the face of bugs or input validation mishaps.')
