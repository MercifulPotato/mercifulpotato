Store a NAS. The entire freaking computer is stored as a unit. Every few months, turn it on, push &quot;ZFS Scrub&quot; to double-check the data, and you&#x27;re set.<p>BluRays also degenerate over time unless stored in proper UV-sealed conditions &#x2F; temperature controlled conditions. Everything requires a degree of maintenance and checking. The question is how to best automate that checking process.<p>Hard drives are read&#x2F;written to at 200+ MB&#x2F;s, making these maintenance checks much faster. They&#x27;re also bigger, which means no need to manually insert &#x2F; remove disks from drives. This entire process could be automated from a &quot;Wake on LAN&quot; packet and a few clicks from any terminal (phone, computer, whatever).<p>-------<p>I dunno. I&#x27;m looking up these BD-R XL drives you&#x27;re talking about: its like $30 per 100GB disk or something. That&#x27;s an obscene price for so little storage. I guess if all your data fits in one of those disks its fine, but... I got some archived movies and stuff on my NAS (50GB per Blu Ray). Needed to store some of my video editing files (so I need the original data that matches with my video editing files).<p>The real data of importance of mine probably fits in a BluRay. But then I won&#x27;t have all the other stuff I&#x27;ve saved up &quot;because I can&quot; on my 2x 5TB NAS (Mirrored, so only 5TB of storage).')
