All of this under a government where such ideas and art were not embraced, or made illegal.<p>I recall when I saw an exhibit of his work at the Tate Modern, how floored I was by all of this - such greatness and ambition, from an artist I had no knowledge of before.<p>His legacy cannot be faked, or will time and fakery-for-profit lead those in the future to question even his existence? Hopefully never.<p>I once tried to find the grave of Kazimir Malevich using   the internet, for surely his greatness would be celebrated and marked. I think it is lost and perhaps under residential buildings or near a tree somewhere. Do the people that pay $86 million for his paintings consider this?<p>Cheers')
