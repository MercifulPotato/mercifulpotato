This was respectful and appropriate, period.  Someone clearly had an axe to grind about a separate topic.<p>That said, some of the comments here are just off the wall paranoia, and really distasteful.  I mean, look: while it was enforced badly it&#x27;s certainly not innapropriate for a conference to demand, y&#x27;know, that it&#x27;s speakers not be assholes.  There was a real and pretty awful culture in the open source world about this stuff for a long time, and it&#x27;s a good thing that we&#x27;re cleaning that up.')
