It is impossible to say with certainty whether a hypothetical attacker, who had stolen one of the NEOs enrolled in your system, and had suitable lab equipment, could conduct a similar attack to recover authentication credentials from the NEO if they stolen the PIV PIN. Perhaps, perhaps not.<p>In general you should not be worried about this, it is unlikely you are so well defended that &quot;Buy this lab equipment, hire an expert, and then steal someone&#x27;s Yubikey&quot; is the most viable attack, so time spent figuring where the low hanging fruit is will be better than worrying about this.')
