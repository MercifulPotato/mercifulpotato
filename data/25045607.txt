Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605014422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045453, text='Oh right sorry, Telegram indeed doesn&#x27;t do group calls. Removed them from the list. Thanks!<p>As for Jitsi, BigBlueButton, and OpenMeetings, no indeed they don&#x27;t do encryption currently, hence them being in the second section with open source self-hostable conference software rather than the e2ee section above. To me, depending on the use-case (if you can self host on a trusted system) that would be equally secure and also doesn&#x27;t leak metadata (who calls who) to some central system.<p>Wire&#x27;s most recent system (launched a few weeks ago to make the video conferencing more efficient, bumping max participants from 4 to 12) also tries to avoid learning who is in a conference with who, but fact is that if you observe their datacenter there&#x27;ll be traffic going to certain IP addresses that starts and stops at the same time.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, to add my experience&#x2F;recommendations: I really liked the BBB setups I&#x27;ve been in (largest was a hundred or so people) and would recommend that if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative. Wire also works reasonably and because it&#x27;s end to end encrypted you don&#x27;t need your own setup to get started, but isn&#x27;t as open source oriented as BBB&#x2F;Jitsi and the CPU load from the encryption during video or screen sharing is quite significant. Jami, last I tested, was quite buggy, but that was way before the pandemic. Full disclose: so far I&#x27;ve only had to decline one Zoom request and so I&#x27;ve never been in a ZoomÂ® call (not a single of our clients uses Zoom, yet people use the brand name as a synonym for video call? I don&#x27;t get it), so I can&#x27;t compare any of these with Zoom.')
