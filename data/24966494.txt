In the Netherlands, you can&#x27;t drive these on bike paths &#x2F; may have to mingle with cars. \n* US-Spec E-Bikes: Up to 32kph, unregulated &#x2F; illegal<p>In general, all three categories are capable of easily sustaining reasonably high 25 to 35kph speeds for 40 to 150km on a flat surface.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with hills or wind resistance, you&#x27;ll need the beefier motor &amp; battery of a pedelec, or you&#x27;ll need a slightly more specialised E-Bike, but there&#x27;s no reason why you couldn&#x27;t make it work by throwing a bit more bike at the problem. I&#x27;ve taken E-Bikes around some of the medium sized hills in San Francisco before, and apart from having to pedal slightly harder and my battery usage doubling, cycling on a hill wasn&#x27;t that much different than cycling along Market Street.')
