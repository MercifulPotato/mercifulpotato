A bit less &quot;middle of nowhere&quot; than Southam maybe, but still, not particularly San Francisco or London either. What&#x27;s up with that? Have game studios simply been remote longer? Or do gamedevs actually relocate en-masse to places like Southam and Cary for their jobs? How does this work? What&#x27;s the employer pitch? &quot;Sure, there&#x27;s like one bar and half a supermarket, but you&#x27;ll get to work on cool race games!&quot;?
