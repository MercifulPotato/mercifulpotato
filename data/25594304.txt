It&#x27;s not about the specific party policy points as it is about being blind to everything your party does wrong.<p>A &quot;red&quot; Californian transplant in some other state is more likely to vote for some insane leftist who wants to turn the economy inside out because they like their policy on police reform and they are blind to all of the things that should be red flags because those things are within the realm of normal back home.<p>And the same goes for a blue transplant from the reddest parts of the bible belt.  They&#x27;re more likely to vote for some insane moralizing right winger because they support legal weed despite having beliefs about homosexuals that are straight out of the 1980s (or whatever, I&#x27;m just making up somewhat realistic examples).<p>IMO the worst part is that both groups don&#x27;t realize that the rampant ineffectiveness, corruption, back room dealing and bad treatment of the populace that governments in both red and blue states indulge in when they don&#x27;t have to fear being voted out isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s normal or something that should be tolerated.<p>If you live in a single party dump of a state you&#x27;re eventually gonna stop smelling the dump.')
