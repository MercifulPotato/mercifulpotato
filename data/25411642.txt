Maybe not even in 1938.  By 1941, we sure did.  (If we had stood up to Hitler in 1936, the world would have been a lot better off.)<p>Back to the larger argument.  Declaring &quot;they&#x27;re both corrupt&quot; is appropriate if, in fact, they are both corrupt.<p>Are they both corrupt?  As both mellosouls and throwaway9980 pointed out, the Democrats did their absolute best to cancel the results of the 2016 election.  Can we say that both of those are bad?  If not, why not?<p>And if you say that the Republicans are worse because, first, it&#x27;s <i>now</i>, and second, because they&#x27;re using more extreme methods, I would agree with you on both grounds.  But are you against <i>trying to overturn elections</i>?  Or are you against <i>Republicans</i>?  Which is it?')
