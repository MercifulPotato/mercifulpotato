Its linked-list-based memory layout means it is extremely CPU cache-unfriendly, making it incur an inordinately high amount of cache misses. [0] As you have a budget of 6ms per frame for 165 FPS, and you often need to iterate over many thousands of entities in each frame, std::unordered_map for one is a non-starter.<p>In general, when discussing which language features to use, I would keep in mind that something can work well for an application that is fairly straightforward and has modest performance requirements, while being a complete no-go for a different use case. I&#x27;m not saying we should throw C++ in the bin, but I also think many people have their reasons for saying some C++ features are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;42588264&#x2F;why-is-stdunordered-map-slow-and-can-i-use-it-more-effectively-to-alleviate-t" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;42588264&#x2F;why-is-stdunord...</a><p>(Edited to remove the bit about std::vector, as this argument does not apply to it.)')
