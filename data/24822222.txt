It seems like mismatched units. Gravity is an acceleration, not a force. F=ma, right? So if gravity were a force, it would produce an acceleration that was dependent on the mass, and it doesn&#x27;t, so it seems to me like the <i>only</i> sense in which gravity is a force is if you define force as &quot;something you can&#x27;t see that makes things move&quot;, which is a pretty useless definition.')
