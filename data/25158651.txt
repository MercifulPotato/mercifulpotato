Reforms take patience, time and compromise. In our culture of instant-gratification nobody has that patience anymore.<p>Democratic rights are slowly eroded by the corrupt political elite under the pretense of lockdown measures. The prostesters see this &quot;Infektionsschutzgesetz&quot; as Germany&#x27;s version of the PATRIOT Act. Convenient neverending powers to subjugate dissenters.<p>The German mainstream and state media is also complicit in this with decrying brutal police response in Belarus while at the same vilifying anti-government protests in Germany.')
