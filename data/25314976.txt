Bonus points for him being &quot;revered&quot; for being an excellent engineer (which I bet he his), so small chances of any humility coming back from him.<p>If this looks like a &quot;calling out names&quot; post that&#x27;s because it is such a post, people who hold power (in this case Dean) in this type of situations and who use it contrary to society&#x27;s needs (which demands more inclusiveness, less social friction) need to be called out.')
