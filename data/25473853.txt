I&#x27;m talking about simple selection bias.<p>A no-financing company with a decent head count is probably in the top 1 percentile among peers. Chances are they&#x27;re delivering real value.<p>A VC backed startup hiring a bunch of people is perfectly average. The top 1% for startups would probably be post-IPO&#x2F;exit&#x2F;very-late-stage.<p>So it seems perfectly normal to me a VC backed startup in most cases will look like a total trainwreck compared to a bootstrapped company of the same size.<p>The vast majority of bootstrapped companies die before they even had a chance to hire anybody. Unlikely you&#x27;d ever have to deal with them.')
