Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608408164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478947, text='&gt; We should be praising the Times for having the courage and integrity for calling out their own errors, which many publications wouldn&#x27;t do, rather than punishing them for not figuring it out in the first place.<p>We can do both, praise and criticize. While I agree with your statements, they NYT also have another job: Report the news accurately. That&#x27;s why they exist and it&#x27;s critical to our society.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t overreact to one error and I think the NY Times is generally more reliable than most. A metric for overall reliability would be very valuable, especially in the disinformation age. That would be an interesting project for a leading journalism school. But how to measure it? Omissions, including context, are just as significant inaccuracies as misstatements (imagine the story &#x27;The U.S. declares war on Japan!&#x27; without context). How could the study objectively set a standard for what facts and context should be included?')
