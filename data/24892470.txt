If a process in my CI was taking 40 minutes I would be investigating sooner than a 40-minute delay.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to throw shade on the pintrest engineering team, but, it speaks to an institutional complacency with things like this.<p>I&#x27;m sure everyone was happy when the clone took 1 second.<p>I doubt anyone noticed when the clone took 1 minute.<p>Someone probably started to notice when the clone took 5 minutes but didn&#x27;t look.<p>Someone probably tried to fix it when the clone was taking 10 minutes and failed.<p>I wonder what &#x27;institutional complacencies&#x27; we have. Problems we assume are unsolvable but are actually very trivial to solve.')
