(I also have a 1200sf apt downtown for 1&#x2F;6th the price of SF)<p>(iiii) It&#x27;s an amazing market where to fail quickly. Quebec is some sort of small scale self-sufficient society where you can experiment before scaling. And outsiders tend not to look at failures in the Quebec startup scene<p>(iiiii) It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to get funding from the massive government investment funds(IQ, CDPQ, BDC), and they have been focusing more on the startup scene lately.<p>(iiiiii) The french Canadian &quot;culture&quot; tends to be bolder and more dynamic than what you would expect in the rest of Canada. Can&#x27;t hurt the ecosystem if you&#x27;re expected to move fast and fail quick<p>(iiiiiii) Move to MTL already, we want more startups!')
