Random people on facebook cannot challenge because they are random people. In choosing between an official source and random guy on facebook, the statements are not equal and the official source takes precedence because they have accountability while random people do not.<p>It is a bit more complex due to stuff like whistle-blowing and so on, but in general credibility is something that must be earned, not given to every random person who states something.')
