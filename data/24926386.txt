For now I&#x27;m planning to rely on user submissions for the catalog--if you have some favorite classic&#x2F;non-tech essays, you could submit them (there&#x27;s a URL input box after you sign in).<p>Before today there were about 60 submitted essays; we&#x27;re up to 117 now. So the recommendations going forward probably won&#x27;t be dominated by my own submissions, but they will likely still be tech-focused, given the (initial) HN&#x2F;programmer user base. Eventually (after we have enough users&#x2F;submissions&#x2F;click data), Findka should adapt to your preferences quickly. i.e. even if most of the catalog is tech-focused, the algorithm will look at what essays you&#x27;ve submitted and select recommendations from the appropriate niches. But at this early stage, the recommendations will be sampled more-or-less uniformly from the entire catalog.')
