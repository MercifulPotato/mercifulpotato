I still don&#x27;t think that race or national origin should play a role here, but maybe some other factors that help the best of us in life&#x27;s worst circumstances to succeed.<p>Maybe today&#x27;s financial aid policies accomplish just that. But it&#x27;s still worth exploring other factors beside finances that potentially successful college applicants need help with.')
