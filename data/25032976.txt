Item(by='rawoke083600', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604914061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030938, text='TL;DR - The older I get and experiment the more I realised:<p>a &quot;BALANCED&quot; approach(philosophy) is the best in all things health. For long term vitality(fitness-function). Ignore short-term gains (fitness function) from &quot;extreme views&quot; or choices - they either don&#x27;t last or is not sustainable.<p>I see a lot of anecdotes and recommendations for health and exercise regime etc. Allow me to cite my own experience and armchair-opinions.<p>I&#x27;m in no way an expert or special(physiology) - although my mom thinks I&#x27;m super !<p>I think many of the HN community can relate to my experience.<p>I&#x27;m 38 male generally healthy (minus some sport&#x2F;exercise injuries). CompSci and BioChem background+education<p>I&#x27;m sort of an extremest in all things and especially health ! This include taking a &quot;somewhat&quot; extreme view (and implementation) where I will usually for a few months focus on one thing exclusively as the new gospel.<p>This Includes The following:<p>-Supplementation(vitamins,fish&#x2F;krill oils, minerals, timing,brands, protocols etc)<p>-Diets(all sorts)\n--keto\n--elimination, \n--lowcarb,high-card\n--Paleo \n--Carnivore\n--Vegetarian(this one really sucked for me)<p>-Diet Regimes\n--Fasting\n--OMAD\n--Juicing\n--monotone (eat the same meals most days)<p>-Nootropics(What a rabbit-hole ! - Too many to list)<p>-Exercise\n--P90x\n--Crossfit\n--Cardio\n--Strength\n--kettle bells\n--BodyCombat(like Tae Bo but with better music and prettier girls)\n--Hiking<p>-Life\n--Mediation\n--Relationships\n--Business\n--Sleep<p>Most of the items on the list had some sort of short-term benefit, but it either didn&#x27;t last or was really not sustainable.<p>a Balanced approach to diet(a little of everything that is considered not terrible, meat,fish,veggies,chocolate,carbs etc)<p>a Balanced approach to exercise ( strength + cardio + Lots of REST) I can&#x27;t stress rest enough. I went from working out 5 days a week, to 3 days a week and I feel better !<p>Less injuries, my two big health issues and 5 operations over a decade was because of exercise injuries. Maybe I&#x27;m just getting older or my DNA is not correct for too many physiology stresses. Or hell maybe I&#x27;m just doing all the exercises wrong !? (I don&#x27;t think I am though)<p>YMMV :)')
