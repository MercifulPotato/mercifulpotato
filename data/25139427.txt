It&#x27;s more about the ability to prevent reodering of instructions (so that Kahan summation etc is not screwed up), and having well defined spec for the precision of things like transcendental functions. HLSL is bit better at controlling this than GLSL is.<p>It has also improved greatly. Using workgroup shared memory is now a thing. And also one can use subgroup ops that have been in Cuda for years.<p>Some of the other things like commandqueues are in Vulkan and DirectX12. But oh boy those are pain to program in compared to OpenCL or Cuda. Usability matters too.')
