The basic interface design seems really neat but it&#x27;s so easy to run into horrible problems with it. For one it doesn&#x27;t really deal with errors very well: once you&#x27;ve thrown a message into it there&#x27;s basically no mechanism to know if something goes wrong with it (and it certainly used to just straight up assert in many, many error cases, which sure made it hard to use the &#x27;reliable central broker&#x27; mechanism they advocate in the docs). The implementation is also really brittle: it&#x27;s basically trivial to cause all kinds of misbehaviour if the other end does not act as expected. The problem is there isn&#x27;t really many good alternatives that are actually similar. Other &#x27;message queues&#x27; are basically big databases, not a library. I feel there&#x27;s room for something with the same philosophy but better execution.')
