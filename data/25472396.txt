Many of us would like to see C&#x2F;C++ replaced by something as fast but more modern. Each alternative has some problems, like being too slow (Python), or tied more to one platform (C#, Swift), or not being backed up by a big org (my favorites here are D and Nim), or having other issues (Java), or just too boring (Go). It looks like Rust finally got the momentum to become a language of choice for writing efficient apps, and with time the generated code might be on a par with C&#x27;s. So I hope it succeeds, even though I wish it had happened with D.')
