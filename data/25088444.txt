My wife is and she will constantly apologize for things that are 100% the other person&#x27;s fault.  It really bugs me, especially because the other person will some times say, &quot;oh it&#x27;s ok&quot; (as they are accepting her admission of guilt) and I usually say something like, &quot;Honey, that wasn&#x27;t your fault, you shouldn&#x27;t be apologizing.&quot;<p>On the flip side, when someone runs in to me or steps on my foot or something, I&#x27;ll usually just look at them, giving them an opportunity to politely say, &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;  My wife tells me that it is <i>extremely</i> rude when I do that, but that feels normal to me.<p>I&#x27;m really wondering if where we grew up is playing a big part here?')
