There is a time in the not so distant past where female involvement in the labor pool and earnings was a fraction of what it is now, and men were judged by women and others on their ability to provide for a financially stable family.<p>Cultural values are evolving, but I personally think this is still on the minds of many, and deeply ingrained in our culture. Female earnings have grown, but the ability to support a family with a single income have diminished. I think that being unemployed or low earning is still an unattractive attribute, but not insurmountable.<p>Something that the earlier poster failed to cover, that I think could be more significant is the impact of a educational divide on the ability to find common interests and beliefs.
