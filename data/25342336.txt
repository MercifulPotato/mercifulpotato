It&#x27;s not interesting to simply wish that the warrant process was adversarial, because it doesn&#x27;t appear realistic to have such a system; you might just as well abolish investigations altogether.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in your feelings about the police killing people, because I share them, and there&#x27;s nothing for us to discuss about it.<p>I am interested in the provenance of warrants, because they&#x27;re central to the actual story we&#x27;re commenting on.')
