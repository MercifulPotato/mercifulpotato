Some people will be able to replace some of their driving with public transit, walking, or cycling, but most people can&#x27;t because public transit isn&#x27;t feasible and commuting distances are too great for walking or cycling (this is especially true for people who aren&#x27;t in peak health or who have families or pets or anything else that they need to regularly transport). Until &quot;robotaxis&quot; actually refers to fully-autonomous taxi services, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to see wide-scale movement away from car ownership.')
