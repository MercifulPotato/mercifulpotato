Item(by='rodolphoarruda', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603897413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917721, text='I always liked the idea of a second brain, an exobrain done in any form of technology.<p>I humbling say my exobrain is Evernote as I throw a lot of thing in there after adding some tags. I&#x27;m fast approaching the 3000 item mark, which is interesting because I&#x27;m gradually losing the capacity to find things as I can&#x27;t remember what&#x27;s in there to be searched&#x2F;found. Day to day things like receipt photos are in some way at the top of my mind, but unique events from past years may be forever buried in there.<p>Another evidence: I saved an article from 2017 just to find out days later when I searched for its title that I had actually saved the same article back in 2017.<p>Well, I can&#x27;t even imagine how this second brain will be like in 2027.')
