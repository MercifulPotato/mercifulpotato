Weinstein believes we should instead start with the basic geometric tools of general relativity and work at extending the equations in mathematically natural ways, without worrying whether they fit with the observable universe. Once you have such equations in hand, you can try to match them up with reality.  At the heart of Weinstein’s theory is the “observerse”, a 14-dimensional space that contains our familiar four-dimensional world (three dimensions of space plus one of time). The extra dimensions arise naturally by extending the mathematics of the original four, which appear in general relativity as the diagonal entries in a four-by-four matrix, he says.\nThe mathematical symmetries of the resulting equations predict three families, or generations, of particles, just as described by the standard model, though the third generation belongs in a different framework in Weinstein’s theory.\nHis work also predicts new, as yet undiscovered particles, along with mirror images of all of these particles. This group of particles could account for dark matter, the mysterious stuff thought to make up about 80 per cent of matter in the universe.<p>I hope that helps...&quot;')
