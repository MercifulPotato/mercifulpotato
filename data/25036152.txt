Only by granting equal state votes can we avoid a small portion of the country having an overwhelming amount of say in electing an executive.<p>States are members of the union.  You are a member of your state not of the union.  Not being a member directly of the union you should not have equal say.  If you did have equal say there is no reason to have states.  If we dont have states it is time to draft a new constitution cause the old one doesnt apply.')
