The vast vast majority of people in technology do not currently experience poverty in any real sense. The same tired and completely unproductive discussion plays out every time. You have:<p>* The &quot;I was broke once and I made it&quot; crowd. They made it out so everyone else should be able to. This creates a predictable argument of one side asserting privilege is a thing and the other side taking it as an insult to their self-worth and industriousness. Both are right, both are wrong, nobody learns anything.<p>* The &quot;Policy&quot; or &quot;Solutioning&quot; threads. Usually started with little nuance or specifics, or with an idea that is so large you&#x27;ll have to go 10 replies deep to have a chance to get down to anyone&#x27;s personal beliefs or life experiences as to why they believe how they do.<p>* The &quot;I myself am doing badly because I can&#x27;t afford a 7 figure home in silicon valley&quot; threads. The arguments are one side saying they&#x27;re out of touch with &quot;real&quot; people and the other empathizing with the lack of security that comes with not owning a home. Housing discussions follow which I would&#x27;ve hoped are as boring to others as they are by now to me.<p>Were we to emphasise having productive or at least different conversations, we might try for what I call the &quot;missing&quot; threads, IE the ones that don&#x27;t happen but should. Threads from:<p>* People who had to go to a food bank lately.<p>* People on SNAP, Social Security, Disability.<p>* People currently or in the past outside the western world who have experience with poverty.<p>This may not be the demographic that goes to HN, but if you take time to listen to people trapped in poverty for even 10 minutes and BELIEVE them, you might learn something really interesting.<p>Go give $100 to a local or international food bank now. They need it desperately. Instead of discussing policy on here go look at the lines of people who are currently hungry in the first world:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;picture&#x2F;long-lines-at-food-banks-across-us-idUSRTX7EHU2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;picture&#x2F;long-lines-at-food-bank...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;finance&#x2F;527462-long-lines-form-at-food-banks-across-country-ahead-of-thanksgiving" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;finance&#x2F;527462-long-lines-form-at...</a><p>You, on hacker news, can afford it.')
