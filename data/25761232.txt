Item(by='ethangk', descendants=None, kids=[25766311], score=None, time=1610541386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760836, text='&gt; Not really, considering it doesn&#x27;t enforce a single, consistent API, so most companies will still use something like TrueLayer (our local equivalent of Plaid) to aggregate all these separate APIs into a single consistent one.<p>That&#x27;s not quite true. The CMA9 have to follow the Open Banking spec, and some other non-cma9 banks have decided to follow the same spec. In practise, there&#x27;s some deviation from the spec between the banks (in part, due to ambiguity in the spec), but it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re all pulling their own spec out of the air.<p>&gt; Furthermore, &quot;open&quot; banking is very misleading because it&#x27;s only open to corporations with deep pockets to obtain an AISP license&#x2F;certification*, but doesn&#x27;t even allow the account holder to gain API access to their own account. Unless you&#x27;re lucky enough to be with a modern bank that provides that as a feature (which is legally separate from Open Banking, though often it&#x27;s the same API), your only workaround is to sign up for TrueLayer yourself just to access your own account through them.<p>The &#x27;deep pockets&#x27; don&#x27;t need to be as deep as implied. I think it&#x27;s &lt;~Â£3k. It&#x27;s not something that only big companies can afford, but I agree, it&#x27;s not something that an individual would use to test out an idea, which would push them towards something like TrueLayer.')
