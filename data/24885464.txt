Youtube&#x2F;VLC will freeze as soon as I plug in a headphone, Skype&#x2F;Zoom will crash and end my call. Some games will continue sending audio through the laptop speakers, and only switch if I restart the game. Others will just stop outputting any audio.<p>I really did not think this was possible, I thought the headphone jack was just a physical switch that sends signals one way instead of the other.<p>Software engineers can and will find a way to fuck up your life, even if the problem has been solved for a century now.')
