Several businesses have been built purely around that (Maptiler and Mapbox, to name two off the top of my head). I agree that, particularly outside the US, OSM may seem theoretically to be a better choice, but I&#x27;m more inclined to assume that DDG simply decided the development resources needed for OSM were too great to justify it, and went with the alternative that they think gives them the best shot at both improving user privacy and competing with google.')
