This makes it flat and windy. Ideal for windpower (in fact, we had an early lead on the UK in terms of industrialization with our windmills, but then they figured out how to use coalpower and took over). Also, being a river delta, containing <i>extremely</i> fertile soil that lends itself very well to agriculture (because flat landscape).
