The safety guarantees work only when humans demonstrate almost super-human regard to the safety of others, are never inattentive, tired, in a hurry or influenced by substances or medical conditions etc.<p>We try to align personal incentives to systemic goals with hefty punishments, but there is a diminishing return on that, at some point you have to consider humans unreliable and design your system to be fault-tolerant. Indeed, most modern trafic systems are doing this today with things like impact absorbing railings, speed bumps, wide shoulders and curves etc.')
