Item(by='naikrovek', descendants=None, kids=[25853682], score=None, time=1611116193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842320, text='I&#x27;m not a troll, or a machine, thank you very much.<p>At this point I can&#x27;t edit the comment in question, but every assumption in the comment it was a reply to was wrong.  Every single one.<p>Aliases in powershell are not turned off by default.  Aliases either exist or they don&#x27;t.  When speaking of aliases alone, bash is no simpler nor more complex than powershell.<p>By the way, this comment (the one I am writing right now) is ALSO replying to a comment written by someone who appears to be overconfident and under-informed.  It&#x27;s a freaking malady, and people are somehow proud of their incorrect blind guesswork.<p>Incorrect, blind guesswork gets a pass, because the statements made sound correct to a layman, and sound objections don&#x27;t get a pass.  I understand, now.  I wasn&#x27;t clear on how important facts are in a technical discussion.<p>I stated no facts in my earlier comment, that&#x27;s true, but neither did the person I was replying to.  I thought my point was clear.  It was less clear than the comment based on false assumption, I guess.<p>I fucking give up.  You assholes can have this.')
