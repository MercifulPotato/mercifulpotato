It&#x27;s a digital store of value. It will never be anything other than that. People may build new currencies on top of it in the near future. As the volatility fades from Bitcoin over time and it becomes extraordinarily boring (ie quite stable), some small nations will experiment with linking their fiat to Bitcoin for stability (seems laughable today, it won&#x27;t be in a decade).')
