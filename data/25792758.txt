In the real world, over the full year of 2020 inflation was 1.4% in the US (food costs went up a bit more, energy costs went down).  Failure to inject money into a failing economy results in massive <i>deflation</i>.  That&#x27;s because money was rapidly disappearing from the economy.  Money isn&#x27;t created primarily because governments print it; whenever a bank creates a loan money is created, and when they call in loans money disappears.  Central banks control the money supply by regulating banks, and their goal is to keep things stable.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;cpi.nr0.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;cpi.nr0.htm</a>')
