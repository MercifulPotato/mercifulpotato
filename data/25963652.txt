The actual risk for that age group is somewhere around 0.02%, which means they&#x27;re overestimating their risk of dying by a factor of 500.<p>Five hundred! It&#x27;s <i>mindboggling</i> how wrong people are.<p>But once you see those numbers, it becomes clear why there is such widespread support for strict lockdowns.<p>However, even with the accurate numbers, I would still say the case for the mRNA vaccines is strong. I think you are exaggerating the risks of the mRNA vaccines, in the same way that regular people are exaggerating the risks of the virus.')
