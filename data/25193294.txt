With unattended upgrades it isn&#x27;t much, but it adds up if you have ten other things already running and you&#x27;re actually trying to downsize this time commitment (mainly for the major version upgrades which take days out of holidays every few years, upgrading and re-testing everything again, sometimes fixing dependency issues, reinstalling things...).<p>Storage can be an &quot;as a service&quot; thing these days, indeed Google Drive &#x2F; OVH NAS &#x2F; hosted NextCloud &#x2F; HiDrive &#x2F; etc. is what I meant, basically anything that could interface with a pi in a way that it uploads the encrypted stream, so you capture whoever unplugs it -- at least that&#x27;s how I imagine a regular security camera would work. But then, the only things I find online start at 4 figures and none of them are open source so who knows what encryption (if any) they really apply... Is there really no one on this planet running open source encrypted cameras, are all these systems that consumers use (some of whom are hackers) 100% proprietary, plaintext, or only stored on-site?')
