Noise cancellation and high quality sounds are essentially orthogonal anyway so, it&#x27;s an easy choice.<p>Unfortunately sound quality almost always means giving up a mic and wireless too. Etymotic has a neckbuds adapter but you can&#x27;t replace the cables, which means its lifespan is something around a year. There are some great Bluetooth converters, but since they&#x27;re almost exactly like plugging into a phone I don&#x27;t really see the point.<p>There are some aftermarket cables you can buy that have mics built in. I messed with this a little but, it turned out that the mics on my laptop were actually pretty good.<p>So, yeah my setup now is I carry two sets of earbuds around, which actually all things considered is coming away pretty cheap. Can wholeheartedly recommend the ER4SRs too (they make a version w&#x2F; a bass boost but, don&#x27;t crack), replaceable cable, replaceable filters, insanely good sound quality, great support. The immediate feeling of IEMs is pretty uncomfortable, but spend 3-4 months getting tips that are right for your ears and getting used to them. It&#x27;s been <i>extremely</i> worth it for me, I can focus and do real work in pretty bonkers environments. Plus your battery will never die ;)')
