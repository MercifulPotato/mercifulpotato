I also will require iOS 13 or greater in new apps (probably 14, for the ones I think may take many months before release).<p>I try to use fairly modern techniques and patterns in my development (but I am not yet satisfied that SwiftUI is up to the task for my more complex work).<p>It is my hope that this means that my apps will be as performant as possible.<p>I may get an M1 Mini, as a test device, sooner or later. Thereâ€™s no hurry.<p>I am still planning on waiting for the M2 processors before upgrading most of my systems. By then, I think that most apps will have sorted themselves out.')
