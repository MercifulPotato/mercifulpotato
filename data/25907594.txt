I wouldn&#x27;t pay the average US price of a car :-) Most of the world, including most Americans, seems to agree with me.<p>&gt; As for used cars, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough data yet but I recall seeing an article where Teslas depreciated less than comparable ICE vehicles.<p>This is both good and bad. It&#x27;s good, rationally, for TCO (but see my comment about TCO below), but it&#x27;s bad because the second hand market price is higher, see my comment above :-)<p>&gt; The fuel costs ways less per mile, what don&#x27;t you believe about that?<p>I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t believe you, I&#x27;m saying that a big initial price is a much higher hurdle than you&#x27;d expect. People are not fully rational (otherwise the $9,99 psychological prices wouldn&#x27;t work everywhere across the world) plus they don&#x27;t fully&#x2F;correctly factor in savings later. As they say: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.')
