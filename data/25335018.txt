I&#x27;ve seen the code-as-you-go approach fail miserably over and over.<p>Try coding a decentralized P2P system where multiple instances of the same code running on many different kinds of machines communicates with itself in a scalable and DoS-resistant way. There is no way anyone can implement this properly without careful architecture planning. You would never get it right the first time unless you plan and analyze all the main use cases carefully.<p>Or try to design a distributed pub&#x2F;sub system or message queue with automatic sharding across the cluster. Also needs a lot of planning. You can&#x27;t just code along and hope to get it right.')
