Yea, no thanks. The way history is rewritten around touchy subjects is very clear to anyone paying attention, and it&#x27;s always the same thing. In the future a book written about our time will use fake news instead &quot;suppression of opposition&quot; as the reason for why Trump was never actually popular. I would tell you to go read actual sources of information at the time: newspapers, books written from German citizens during those years, that kind of thing. You&#x27;ll get a much more accurate view of history that way.')
