The worst part of Unity is anyone can develop something for it very fast. An asset developer might build something which he or she doesn&#x27;t actually update, or has a nasty habit of completely breaking your project.<p>The one thing I don&#x27;t like about Unity is the lack of quality control with assets. Some assets will give you a nice foundation for a fantastic project, others will set you back days. Asset authors are almost always either absolute Angels, who will go out of their way to help you and if they can&#x27;t offer you a refund.<p>Or their jerks, their assets don&#x27;t do what they promised and they&#x27;ll refuse to refund your money. If I could fix one thing about the unity ecosystem, I&#x27;d tell Unity to give asset buyers a few no contest refunds . I probably spend about 1000$ on Unity assets per year.<p>The one time a $15 asset ends up not working correctly I should be able to get a refund without begging the author for it.<p>Plus it&#x27;s essential to understand what your goal is. Do you want to actually ship your game within a reasonable amount of time? Or do you feel like creating a project primarily for learning, or to just share the code on GitHub?<p>If you want to ship a game, either use Unity or Unreal. These are the only two engines which are well supported enough where you can get something done within a reasonable amount of time.<p>Open source engines are cool, but there is absolutely no expectation of things working as well. Let&#x27;s say you want to build a project with Godot, and it&#x27;s going well so you want to publish it to Switch. You&#x27;re going to run into a ton of problems off the bat, one open source projects tend to not support closed apis which council manufacturers force you to support. So you&#x27;re going to have to build your own integration there.<p>Vs clicking a build to Switch button with Unity.<p>Honestly I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Unity, you have an amazing amount of educational material they publish. And for the most part I&#x27;ve been able to buy assets for $50 or $100, and save myself 80% of the development time on my projects. You aren&#x27;t going to have a good time with Unity if you&#x27;re adverse to buying assets.')
