One NVMe card can move 5GB of data or 1,000,000 IOPS over 4 PCIe lanes.  With 128 cores, you need to parse 39MB&#x2F;sec per core, or dispatch 7.8 thousand I&#x2F;Os per second for each drive in the system.<p>This processor has 64 PCIe lanes, and a drive uses 4.  If you use half the lanes for disks, youâ€™d need to multiply my numbers by 8.  So, in addition to running application logic and talking to the network, each core needs to parse 312MB or dispatch 62K IOs per second.<p>Those numbers are certainly achievable, but hitting them requires some care.  So, this processor is fairly well-balanced for moderately compute intensive workloads, such as query processing, or maybe frontend logic (which would probably want a machine with more network and less disk).<p>Note that the 128 cores are just to keep up with storage that easily fits in 1U or a fairly compact desktop tower case.<p>If you measure speed as the IO to compute density, these CPUs are actually slow and bulky by historical standards.')
