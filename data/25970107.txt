I think we’ve done a pretty good job duplicating this model for the masses! Even down to the alternate justice model inside most universities. Perpetrate a drug or sexual crime? No big deal, just switch schools and start over!<p>Takes a lot of admins to recreate the upper class bubble for the poors.<p>I can’t really blame people for wanting this security for their children. Ultimately I don&#x27;t think it will change until (at least in the US) we address things like universal healthcare, justice system reform and maybe even a UBI.')
