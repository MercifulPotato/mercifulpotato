On the other hand, it kinda sucks for customers like us.  Yes, we’re a big company and yes, we run data center instances of some of the tools.  But we’ve also got tons of smaller instances running around that basically have nowhere to go now.  There are several industries that are incline to stay on premise:  healthcare, legal, and financial software among others.  We’re in that same boat.<p>At the moment, I’m inclined to recommend we drop Atlassian altogether, for several reasons:<p>First, Atlassian has never really understood the needs of large enterprises.  They’ve recognized that we need performance and scalability and top level web security, but the rest of our large enterprise requiements remain largely unmet.<p>Secondly, I haven’t seen any good organic development from Atlassian for a long time.   They’ve bought a lot of other products and companies, but their ability to produce and deliver great features disappeared a long time ago.<p>Finally, I have no confidence that Atlassian will keep the data center products going and properly maintain them.  Something tells me they’ll do what’s necessary to keep too many customers from immediately jumping ship, but in the long run, I expect we’ll eventually see the end of life for the data center products just like they’ve done with the server products.')
