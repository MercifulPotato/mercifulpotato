Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607033831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294909, text='&gt; Be careful here, the wind has changed and blind auditions are now problematic.<p>The argument made in the article you cite is ludicrous, blind auditions cannot possibly hurt diversity. If there is a problem when blind auditions are used in hiring for professional orchestras, the problem is elsewhere in the pipeline, and the way to fix it isn&#x27;t replacing blind auditions, its fixing issue further up the pipeline.<p>There may be a pro-diversity case for using something other than current skill as a factor at other stages of the pipeline which are intended as, in whole or in part, educational and where current skill is being used not as a measure of current professional competence, but as a proxy for potential. But even there that&#x27;s largely a poor substitute for identifying and addressing the factors producing a skewed pool.')
