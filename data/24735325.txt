I&#x27;ve been looking for a file system for a non-RAID disk array I want to set up at home, and this seems to have <i>some</i> of the characteristics I&#x27;m looking for.  The primary downfall for my particular use case seems to be that I want to use partiy-based error correction rather than (or, in addition to) replication, because I want the array to be able to survive a failure of any N disks in the array.<p>Is there anything like that out there (other than Unraid, which I kinda don&#x27;t like)?')
