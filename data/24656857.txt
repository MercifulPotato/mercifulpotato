Our approach lets us gather thousands of times more data at a fraction of the operational cost of building, launching, and maintaining satellite constellations. Our competitors advertise daily revisit rates; we&#x27;ve demonstrated 1,500+ updates on a single coordinate in early tests using only cell phone cameras at an average resolution of 20cm.<p>I&#x27;ve been building the prototype and handling early-stage product market fit exercises as a solo founder, but now we&#x27;re actively raising with the help of an excellent advisory team. I&#x27;m looking to bring on co-founders who can help run the growth machine and assist me with development of the video ingestion engine in a GTM capacity. We currently have 248 customer commitments running on a negligible burn (~$100&#x2F;month for feeler ads, ~$400&#x2F;mo for cloud compute) and have begun the patent filing process.<p>If you&#x27;d like to hear more about the business concept, current challenges, the product roadmap, or just want to chat about GIS, shoot me an email (chris@notasatellite.com) or check us out @notasatellite.')
