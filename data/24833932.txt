Reddit used to be pro free speech. Now they are banning people and communities like the_donald and brag about how <i>deplatforming works</i>. People can create their own little ghettos but it&#x27;s inconsequential and no one uses them.<p>It&#x27;s not a stretch to imagine a repeat. That moxie will brag in 10 years about how much he is banning people and how well it works. I wonder who will be unpopular in 10 years..<p>EDIT: Or he might hang himself like Aaron Schwartz.')
