(For tabular numerals, is-digit-zero-versus-one clearly is, but what about digit-versus-question-mark when writing &quot;27&#x27;3?? items&quot; to indicate three significant figures? What about &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;, which should have the same width as each other, despite not being numerals at all? <i>Full</i> monospacing solves this, but that&#x27;s often a stronger constraint that you actually need.)<p>Also, nominally monospace fonts often end up having character-dependant width anyway (ranging from blatant bugs like substiting fallback characters without forcing them to the correct size, to completely legitimate-ish variations like CJK ideographs with integer multiples of the normal character width). So, I&#x27;d still say tabular numerals are more like a weaker form of monospace than a stronger form of uniwidth - constant width across styles may or may not be relevant, but if it is, it&#x27;s table stakes (no pun intended).')
