Of course, no community is &quot;perfect&quot;, and a lot of times conflicts happen just because someone having a bad day or lost their temper. That&#x27;s okay, part of the human condition and all of that.<p>What matters is 1) how you deal with things when someone is having a bad day (things can either cool down or escalate), and 2) how you deal with people who seem to be having bad days almost every day (i.e. assholes).<p>If you don&#x27;t do <i>anything</i> then all communities will gravitate towards toxicity; simply because non-assholes will get tired of assholes and will stop coming back, and then all you&#x27;re left with are ... assholes, and people with above-average patience.')
