So you don&#x27;t see price fluctuations more than you&#x27;d see for the bus;<p>- They need an authorization to serve an area (meaning they were checked according to local regulation);<p>- The company is responsible for its employees in many ways;<p>- And more.<p>A restaurant&#x27;s kitchen has higher requirements than your private one which makes owning and operating a commercial kitchen far more resource intensive than a private one. There&#x27;s no &quot;kitchen sharing&quot; where you can sell food straight from your private kitchen, &quot;infirmary sharing&quot; where you can pretend you&#x27;re a doctor or a hospital room, or &quot;legal office sharing&quot; where you can pretend to be a lawyer without meeting all the requirements imposed on those sectors.<p>This is the loophole Uber exploited. Replace &quot;car&quot; with &quot;house&#x2F;room&quot; and you get AirBnB. When they had enough of a head start they started complying with some regulation, while still acting like they&#x27;re a different kind of service for what other regulation is concerned. They want to live on the border and pick and choose what applies to them, something no other commercial service is allowed to do. Except all the other disruptors who raise enough money to afford some fines while they still operate in a grey area. Cost of doing business.')
