A pattern of use for gateways sometimes is to provide id&#x2F;auth and access the backing services with a high priv service account. This can’t be 100% of the time because some applications perform their own authorization at the data level, as in User X can see data A but not B, or in service Q user type X can crud attributes a thru d but only user type Y can enter attribute e.<p>What other patterns do people see?')
