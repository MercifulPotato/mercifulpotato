Item(by='Grimm1', descendants=None, kids=[25290547, 25290635, 25290887], score=None, time=1607012245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289893, text='&quot;Pinkerton operatives were inserted into an Amazon warehouse in Wroclaw, Poland, to investigate an allegation that warehouse workers were circumventing sort of the application process for applying to warehouse jobs&quot;<p>How does this match the title of the piece. Then,<p>&quot;So I imagine that in the U.S., they&#x27;re tracking labor organizing activity but not union members yet.&quot;<p>So they have no proof and this is all speculation. Another Amazon hit piece, real quality journalism here.<p>Amazon used some people to catch people cheesing their job application process and then because the US doesn&#x27;t have strong unions and they know they look at labor stats for people joining Unions this &quot;journalist&quot; has extrapolated they are definitely &quot;surveiling&quot; people. This is really low quality.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m fine with the allegations being true, the point I&#x27;m making is this isn&#x27;t the article that we should be discussing because it&#x27;s lazy journalism -- another poster below me linked much more well thought out and written posts on the subject being discussed by this article.')
