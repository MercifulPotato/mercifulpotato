Because she not only encouraged an occupation of the Capitol then, but she also directly participated in it (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-activists-nancy-pelosi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez...</a>). The same group repeated their illegal act multiple times (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commondreams.org&#x2F;newswire&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;kentucky-youth-lead-250-sunrise-mcconnells-office-say-kentucky-needs-green-new" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commondreams.org&#x2F;newswire&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;kentucky-yo...</a>). Each time, it was cheered on by politicians who still retain their Twitter handles and each time the media did not cover it or condemn the act like they have the recent capitol riot.<p>Twitter and other big tech companies are clearly using two different standards, based on whether you are a far left progressive or not. And this suspension of Trump makes no sense given that there is no evidence that he <i>incited violence</i>. Asking people to march somewhere is not inciting violence. It simply isn&#x27;t and everyone repeating the word &#x27;incite&#x27; is being disingenuous, especially if they are not consistent and don&#x27;t apply it to all the BLM riots in 2020.<p>This move is therefore just a disgusting act of censorship, and it sets a precedent and highlights further the need for alternate platforms to big tech companies based in overwhelmingly left-leaning cities with overwhelmingly left-leaning employee bases.')
