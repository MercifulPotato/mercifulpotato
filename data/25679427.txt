Rewritable disks were more expensive, failed like crazy and took a lot of time to burn anyway.<p>I remember that time as particularly annoying. It was a God send to see usb sticks become mainstream, and since everyone had mp3 players on them it meant that you were always carrying a USB stick with you (except for the poor souls that had ipods, who couldn&#x27;t treat the storage as a folder for random files and had to use iTunes instead ).')
