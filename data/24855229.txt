It is a journey some might like only after joining in so there should be exit path available to those who don&#x27;t like it.<p>Secondly money and conditions can&#x27;t be universal drivers.<p>On a side note I feel trend of letting youngster do whatever they want even during school years is counter productive. For example children who misbehave even once in a while with teachers and sometimes parents even are taken for psyche evaluation immediately. IMHO children does need direction and guidance until they understand the consequences of their choices.')
