Where should I start?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I just graduated from high school this past June, and due to a number of factors, I have elected to take a gap year and not attend college yet. I&#x27;m technologically fluent, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of programming experience (I plan on learning more as I go, though.)<p>I want to learn to create, experiment with, modify, design, train, etc-- neural networks and machine learning models, but I don&#x27;t know where to start. Rather than just blindly trusting Google search, I thought I&#x27;d ask HN since many of you do this stuff for a living!<p>Machine learning is so, so exciting to me, and and the possibilities with it seem endless. What resources would you recommend I dive into to teach myself about it?<p>I&#x27;m being vague here because I know there&#x27;s a lot of different branches in the field and I&#x27;m still not sure which ones I&#x27;m most interested in.<p>That said, image&#x2F;audio&#x2F;text manipulation or synthesis and simulation are of particular interest to me (I&#x27;m a big fan of Two Minute Papers)<p>If you took the time to read this, thank you! HN has changed my life and introduced me to so many new ideas and resources already :)<p>Looking forward to any and all responses.<p>EDIT: Realized it might be worth it to mention that the current extent of my knowledge on the topics is limited to &quot;grab a big dataset, create a model, refine the model through some kind of regression, then test with unfamiliar data.&quot; I also understand that there&#x27;s a tooonnn more than just that available (i.e. GANs&#x2F;synthesis etc).')
