So in effect you get one big bad guy rather than thousands of them. Well, at least that&#x27;s how it should work.<p>You&#x27;re wrong to compare these hacking tools to arms dealing. That&#x27;s a terrible analogy because international arms dealers and their customers aren&#x27;t going around interfering with the daily home and office life of ordinary Americans. Microsoft talks a lot about NSO Group, which makes tools that sound like highly targeted arms dealing. But let&#x27;s not forget there&#x27;s 10x as many smaller companies from that same country, which sell the tools for surveillance and hacking of ordinary people and businesses.<p>Just the other day I was reading about one called Komedia which sells Layered Service Providers that are used for things like building pre-installed lenovo laptop software that decrypts your https and routes it through some service which injected ads and broke nodejs.
