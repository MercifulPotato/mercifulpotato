Every village was down some track a mile from a good road. Just the place you needed the bike to work. Most weren&#x27;t going to Rome; just around the village.<p>And a modern &#x27;regular bike&#x27; is maybe 100x better than the original wooden, wooden-wheeled non-steerable chainless coaster bikes they started with. Made of local wood that could split and swell and snap at a bad bounce.')
