Browser JS VMs have integration between their parsers and their interpreter and their JITs, at minimum. You wouldn&#x27;t really be able to drop in a standalone project like this.<p>But I agree it&#x27;s not a bad thing to have more JS parsers out there!<p>Many are already written in a safe language, though, so this isn&#x27;t new, for example several are written in JS and TS, there is Rhino in Java, Otto in Go, Esprima .NET in C#, etc. etc. But it&#x27;s natural to want one in Rust as well.')
