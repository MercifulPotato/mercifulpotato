The point, and it&#x27;s a good point, is that every time this threshold is crossed, it puts some weird kind of new restriction or constraint on us. And this isn&#x27;t a kind of scientific complexity like how biology is and always has been too complex for us to understand. This is the things that you and I use and rely on being too complex to understand.<p>There is a famous talk by Milton Friedman forty years ago about nobody knowing how to make a standard pencil anymore. The red rubber tip, the yellow paint, the graphite, that little metal brace. Most of us could probably re-create most of it, but nobody could create the whole thing by themselves. (edit: apparently the pencil point (ha ha) was famously made by others going back to at least 1958.)<p>In my mind there&#x27;s a (pretty weak) analogy to the gold standard for money, or having an alternative when negotiating. With the gold standard, if somebody offers you one bitcoin (or equivalently X gold) for your widget, and you know how you value your widget and how you value gold, it&#x27;s easy to decide whether or not to sell (weak analogy, full of holes, I know). Or if someone is offering to pay you some wage, but you could go back to the family farm and just make more food for yourself than that wage would buy you, then there is some kind of grounding of that wage in terms of concrete do-it-yourself alternatives.<p>The more the things that we rely on and depend on (like the Internet) are so complex that the only alternative is whatever else happens to be furnished by &quot;the market,&quot; the more of life turns into sort of a Keynesian beauty contest in a bad way, without a concrete grounding, and only a &quot;what you think other people think that other people think that...&quot; equilibrium instead.<p>Not that the alternative is any better. I like my computer and my Internet and my prescription glasses and my ballpoint pen. It sucks that I&#x27;m practically required to have them, but I really do like them.')
