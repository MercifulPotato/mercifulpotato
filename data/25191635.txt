We&#x27;ve built out our own speech engine that&#x27;s designed specifically for code, along with an NLP layer to translate descriptions of code (like &quot;list of string&quot;) to syntactically-valid code (like &quot;List&lt;String&gt;&quot;) across a variety of languages. In fact, much of Serenade has been created using Serenade itself.<p>Today, we&#x27;re launching Serenade Pro [3], which runs all of Serenade&#x27;s speech-to-code AI on your device rather than in the cloud. The security of your codebase is important, and with Serenade Pro, no data ever leaves your device. We&#x27;ve also raised a seed round to continue building out our ML while bringing more languages, editors, and commands to Serenade [4].<p>Adding voice to your coding workflow can be a great way to deal with (or prevent) issues to your hands, wrists, and so on. Ultimately, we think applying ML to code will help automate away many of the rote, mechanical parts of programming, enabling developers to focus more on expressing ideas.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serenade.ai<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HtkelODtCkM<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serenade.ai&#x2F;pro<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;serenade-snags-2-1m-seed-round-to-turn-speech-into-code&#x2F;')
