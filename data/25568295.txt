Contact trace and socially distance. Wear a mask and actually DO quarantine.<p>They&#x27;re more ready to make up excuses:<p>- China and Vietnam are faking their numbers<p>- New Zealand is a low density remote island<p>- Australia became an authoritarian state<p>- Taiwan were already prepared<p>- Singapore is a dictatorship<p>Meanwhile these nations have only had to protect their entertainment industries (domestic tourism is clawing back some of the lost tourism income now) but all these other free countries like the UK have lived with restrictions most of 2020 now and have ALSO torpedoed their economy AND had the most casualties.<p>At this point I&#x27;d almost rather go full cynic and just appreciate covid as an agent of natural selection rather than collectively ruin the prospects of the future generation, but of course that is also politically untenable. So given that dichotomy of choice I will gladly cede some human rights to empower my government actually do their job.')
