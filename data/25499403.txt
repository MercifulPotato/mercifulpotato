It would make them look really, really stupid, like they had no clue why their users used their products.<p>Nobody wants to use CentOS. We <i>have</i> to use it because it&#x27;s the cost-effective alternative to RHEL. And nobody wants to use RHEL either, but we <i>have</i> to, because vendors won&#x27;t support anything else.<p>Part of this is our (the users&#x27;&#x2F;businesses&#x27;) own fault. We allowed our businesses to get away with depending on an OS with no support <i>until we needed it</i>, which is not really sustainable.<p>What we maybe should have been doing is creating vendor-neutral open standards for the platform, like a standard kernel (vanilla, anyone?) and a standard userspace distribution (vanilla, anyone??). That way any Linux distro could &quot;meet the standard&quot; (&quot;Install package standard-distro-20200816 to use packages and settings aligned with the standard&quot;, and then every vendor could support &quot;the standard&quot;. Vendors wouldn&#x27;t need to lock themselves into one distro, and we wouldn&#x27;t either. Basically a POSIX for Linux. But there&#x27;s no money to be had in that.<p>(It is in fact possible to run a Linux distro without patches. It&#x27;s buggy as all hell, but it can be done.)')
