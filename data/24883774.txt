They really are only interested I. Products with high margins, and if they donâ€™t see a component with the desired margin they get out.<p>For the change in the IDM model, it will be interesting. Part of the way intel has seen high margins is by having the best yields and processes. Outsourcing fabs may reduce their ability to execute, or allow them to take advantage of new expertise from folk making much larger quantities in the arm marketplace. I really only see them doing it if they can preserve or increase their margin.')
