The M1 is as far as we can tell an A14X-like chip with much higher thermal headroom within a Macbook&#x2F;MacMini for higher frequencies and has more L2 cache (12mb v 8mb), in addition to more CPU&#x2F;GPU cores. So if Apple can get frequencies up 10-20% they&#x27;ll be equal in single thread to Zen3.<p>A14 has some important and kind of crazy architectural differences like being 8-wide and having double Zen&#x27;s per-cycle throughput. It&#x27;s a very different chip from anything else on the market.')
