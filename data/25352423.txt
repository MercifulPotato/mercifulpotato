I have worked with some folks who basically just do &#x27;java&#x27; all day.  It&#x27;s a web app, but there&#x27;s a team who gets to pretty much do just &#x27;java&#x27; - little to no web stuff, little SQL (that&#x27;s another team), and...   There have been times over the years when I&#x27;ve been envious of that type of situation, but then I think I&#x27;d hate it.  But I sort of hate the current state working across all things web.<p>You forgot &#x27;SQL&#x27; (or broad &#x27;data management and access&#x27;), as well as security and performance stuff in your list above.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be a &#x27;stick in the mud&#x27; but.. I also resist some of the newer&#x2F;shinier things, precisely because they don&#x27;t always stick around (and I&#x27;ve been burned).  But also, I don&#x27;t really have time&#x2F;bandwidth to be an expert.  Doing server mgt, security, etc half-assed, by just following a couple of readmes... that can lead to lots of trouble.')
