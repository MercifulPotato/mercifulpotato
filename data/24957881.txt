By learning things with it? Plenty of people already have used SR to pass tests, aid in learning a language, etc. There are scientific papers that show SR to be an effective learning tool.<p>I really don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re asking for. It&#x27;s not like SR learning is going to let you &quot;unleash your strength on the quivering masses&quot;.<p>You also have to propose an alternative to it. In your comment, you seem to have critiqued it with &quot;if you want to be an encyclopedia, maybe SR is a good approach. But if you want to understand the world .... SR can&#x27;t help you&quot;.<p>The fact that you say &quot;If you want to be an encyclopedia, maybe SR is a good approach&quot; indicates to me that you think SR does actually work, and so there&#x27;s nothing to prove here.<p>Yes, obviously if your strawman is &quot;SR compared to moving to the culture to learn a language&quot;, then SR will fall short. But no one is saying that, everyone&#x27;s saying &quot;Instead of looking up a word in a dictionary each time you forget it, use SR, and instead of just doing immersion, do immersion + SR&quot;')
