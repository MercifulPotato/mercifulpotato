User A has disabled Javascript unless she needs it.</i><p>There is actually no technical reason that an HTTP request needs to be any more than<p><pre><code>    GET &#x2F; HTTP&#x2F;1.0\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s <i>nice</i> for the server to know your user agent, what fonts you have installed, your OS, and whatever else, but it is not <i>necessary</i> and so the majority of the problem of fingerprinting browsers is one created by the browser developers themselves. The original concept of the web was that the client controlled the rendering, the server shouldn&#x27;t care about what specific fonts you have or the size of your screen.<p>There is no reason that the Firefox or Safari developers couldn&#x27;t decide in the next version to send only bare minimal request headers.')
