Don&#x27;t miss the new landing page, it is probably the part I was most excited to share :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;</a><p>Crazy amount of effort went into building all of these interactive examples, so proud of how it turned out.<p>The trailer in the blog post is absolutely 100% a joke in case it&#x27;s not obvious. The music was scored for us by a friend, and that&#x27;s a real life professional opera singer at the end chanting &quot;utility first&quot; in Latin. It&#x27;s completely absurd and absolutely outrageous, just laugh at it :)')
