Only in the past 18 months has everyone starting to call Webflow &quot;no-code&quot; and I felt like I must have been missing something.<p>Thunkable, Adalo, Bubble, those are no-code tools\nWebflow, Carrd (which I like but is also touted as no-code platform when it&#x27;s basically a landing page builder) and in different categories Notion or Airtable... they&#x27;re great tools but it feels misleading to call these &quot;no code platforms&quot;')
