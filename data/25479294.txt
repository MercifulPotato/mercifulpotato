The argument is not &quot;I want your 30M&quot; it is that &quot;people having this much wealth is bad for all of society&quot;.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;abolish-billionaires-tax.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;abolish-billionai...</a><p>There&#x27;s much debate to be had over where that line of &quot;too much wealth that it can&#x27;t possibly be moral&quot; is, but this is where the cultural conversation is. You&#x27;re missing the point if you think it&#x27;s jealousy.<p>As an example, I never plan to have more than about 2M (in today&#x27;s dollars) of personal wealth. I&#x27;m not supporting this tax because I want the 30M, I&#x27;m supporting it because I think it may have positive effects on reigning in the human instinct for greed by aligning societal incentives with personal ones.<p>I&#x27;m trying to keep this narrow as I&#x27;m not trying to claim I&#x27;m correct that this specific iteration of the tax will work, or even of the form, but hopefully my point about the targeted issue is clear!')
