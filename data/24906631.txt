The &quot;no performance cost&quot; is indeed more like &quot;negligible performance costs&quot;. That&#x27;s because these days multicore architectures are quite ubiquitous and standard Python applications are single process. For multi-process Python applications, a busy profiler would certainly steal a good chunk of a core, so the impact might be noticeable in that case.<p>As for the race conditions, Austin does not introduce any pauses. Even if it did, there would be no guarantee that it paused at a &quot;good&quot; point, so there are no real benefits in terms of accuracy in pausing. Error rates are quite low anyway, so the actual benefit comes from not pausing at all.')
