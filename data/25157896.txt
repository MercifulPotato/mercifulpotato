That loose set of content eventually forced the Iranian government to admit responsibility.<p>I read about that case in detail, and it&#x27;s not as clear as the initial reporting.<p>It was a tough one since you can&#x27;t tell with any certainty which airplanes are truly friendly or not. Iran was in a state of heightened alert because of disagreements with the US. (Some countries, like Israel, use civilian airliners and routes as cover for military flights.)<p>A related example is how Iraq used a civilian Dassault F-50 jet upgraded with Mirage electronics (radar, launch rails) for a number of clandestine military flights around the Middle East, including the flight that hit the USS Stark with 2 Exocet missiles. (The Stark&#x27;s fire control system apparently didn&#x27;t recognize the F-50 as a threat, even though it had a fighter escort.)')
