So sure, the language could be used like that.<p>Our background and focus has always been more from the pro-audio side of things rather than performance, though, so the tools we&#x27;ve built so far aren&#x27;t really targeted at performance use-cases, it&#x27;s more about development of apps and plugins.<p>&gt; What prospects are there for beefing up hardware to run more DSP and bring down latencies? Are there, or will there be open-hardware DSP projects which run SOUL, or open-source runtimes which achieve high performance on standard issue CPUs? If the company behind SOUL goes under (Roli, I think), what happens?<p>Right now we&#x27;ve not had the resources to get stuck into that side of things deeply yet - hoping to be able to do more on it this year. (And ROLI aren&#x27;t going to go under, ha!)<p>&gt; Could I write a program in SOUL that does real time beat detection given an audio signal, say a steady drum beat (to make things simple)?<p>Yep, totally the kind of thing we&#x27;re expecting people to do with it.')
