Hispanics tend to self-identify as white, especially after a few generations.<p>I think the rest of your analysis is just wrong. First there was no &quot;English&quot; America. America from the start had European immigrants. New York was a Dutch colony. The early censuses used &quot;white&quot; and it always meant the same it means today.<p>This idea of a &quot;progressing&quot; whiteness is way way overblown to make people feel like the demographic changes we are facing are not unusual. But they are. Even if a huge percentage of hispanics start to self-identify as white - White people will still likely become a minority when they were around 90% of the population at the turn of the last century. Asians and Blacks are around ~20% of the population and Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;volokh-conspiracy&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;22&#x2F;sorry-but-the-irish-were-always-white-and-so-were-the-italians-jews-and-so-on&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;volokh-conspiracy&#x2F;wp&#x2F;201...</a>')
