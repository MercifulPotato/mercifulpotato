That&#x27;s why valid, trusted polls calculate a confidence interval instead of a single discrete result.<p>Other types of &quot;errors&quot; -- election results that repeatedly fall outside the confidence interval, or are consistently on only one side of the mean -- only arise when the poll is flawed for some reason. Maybe you relied on landlines only, maybe you spoke with too many men, or too many young people, asked bad questions, miscalculated &quot;likely voter,&quot; whatever. Accurate, valid, trusted polls don&#x27;t have these flaws, the ONLY errors are small, random, expected sampling errors.')
