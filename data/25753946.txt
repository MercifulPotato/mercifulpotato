In fact many people on the &quot;right&quot; were tired of seeing FB and Twitter control so much and they were constantly told it&#x27;s a private platform so go make your own.  They did so, and then those same companies worked in tandem to destroy Parler.  Signal and WhatsApp are used to coordinate violent and destructive riots...we don&#x27;t see anyone trying to take them down.  The opinion is they do more good than bad...despite the ability to use them for either purpose.<p>There are people on the left and right that are power hungry and make decisions only to benefit themselves...however some people actually care about freedoms and fairness.  Bad and illegal behavior will happen in any system with freedoms...banning those systems is not the answer.')
