Wow, that is really aiming low.  Lets list a few hard challenges:<p>* Read a book with your fingers.  At least 300 paperback pages.  That will be about 2000 braille pages.\n* Cross a road which lacks pedestrian lights.  Use your ears to find out if you are going to die.\n* Write a 2k+ lines program, pick a language of your choice.  For extra points, use a speech synthesizer only, no braille.\n* Go to the groceries store and buy the food for a week.  Go with whoever you get assigned as assistant.  If their IQ is likely not above 80, continue and try to explain to them what you need.')
