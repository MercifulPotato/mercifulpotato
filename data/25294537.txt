Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25295158], score=None, time=1607028219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292957, text='The vaccines will reduce the visible effects of pandemic, that&#x27;s sure, by reducing the numbers of those who will have to be admitted to the hospital. In Covid-19 a huge percentage of people who get infected currently have to be hospitalized, and reducing that number will help a lot.<p>What we still can&#x27;t expect, until we have some different and exact information, is to be able to visit our non-vaccinated or immune suppressed relatives and friends without a mask and be really sure that we can&#x27;t infect them as long as the incidence is high enough. What we currently know says the opposite: no proof of sterilizing immunity by the current vaccines, and animal studies which show the same viral load in upper respiratory tract mucosa.<p>That&#x27;s what I personally worry about, I have such people and I don&#x27;t want them to die because of the, at the moment still unfounded, belief of some (like &quot;phobosanomaly&quot; who uses totally irrelevant quotations to support their claims) that the vaccine must have &quot;sterilizing immunity&quot; while the experts are cautions to point that the currently available information surely doesn&#x27;t support that.<p>And if &quot;phobosanomaly&quot; now also doesn&#x27;t claim at the moment that the vaccines have such property but merely that the transmission will be &quot;reduced&quot; then I don&#x27;t disagree with that. But for me &quot;transmission will be reduced&quot; as this moment still means &quot;we can&#x27;t even assume that the vulnerable can&#x27;t become infected from those who already received the vaccine.&quot;<p>Also note that the distribution of those who get the vaccine but then still become ill (1 of 20 by Pfizer and Moderna trials) will also not be evenly distributed across the population. That means that if you know even less vulnerable people, you can expect that some of them won&#x27;t be protected even if they can and do receive the vaccine. I worry also for those.<p>If you also maybe believe that the vulnerable are disposable because they are old and not productive anymore or something like that, I can assure you that I personally know young and worthy people who can still contribute a lot to the world but who can surely be considered vulnerable, and who surely aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong, who aren&#x27;t overweight and who are doing sports regularly.<p>And finally, I admit I also worry for those who I know who are considered &quot;older&quot; but whose number of days on this planet can also be seriously affected by the attitudes of those who want to believe only that what is convenient to them, even if it is completely opposite of what is currently known.')
