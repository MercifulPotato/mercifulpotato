Item(by='akarma', descendants=None, kids=[25440345], score=None, time=1608061804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433454, text='The data on 110 journalists arrested comes from this source [1].<p>In the first three incidents listed, they are &quot;independent journalists.&quot;<p>(1) One of these independent journalists asked to be identified through their Twitter handle.<p>Their name on Twitter is &quot;Andy Ngo is a fascist,&quot; and their bio is &quot;ACAB means all of &#x27;em, including Kamala.&quot; The first handful of their tweets includes &quot;F<i></i>* the peace police&quot; in reference to those attempting to stop violence from occurring at a protest.<p>This person is most certainly not a part of the press, and it is not surprising this person would be arrested, presumably for violent behavior, at a protest.<p>(2) Looking at other cases, many of these &quot;independent reporters&quot; don&#x27;t seem to exist anywhere on the internet under their legal name. The first and only relevant search result is the Press Freedom Tracker website.<p>(3) Another one is actually a hairdresser instead, and not a reporter. No articles ever written that I can find, and on Twitter, no reference to journalism - just being a cat mom and lots of swearing about politics.<p>It&#x27;s really disappointing to lose faith in the Press Freedom Tracker. I expected a high level of journalistic integrity, and it feels so instinctually wrong to lose trust in an organization like that, but wow.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pressfreedomtracker.us&#x2F;arrest-criminal-charge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pressfreedomtracker.us&#x2F;arrest-criminal-charge&#x2F;</a>')
