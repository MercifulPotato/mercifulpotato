But it&#x27;s also easy to create your own &quot;garbage collector&quot; that cleans up dangling symlinks in your home directory.<p>All you need to do is to keep track of symlinks you&#x27;ve installed with your setup script. This can be done by creating a symlink to the symlink you&#x27;ve installed, which acts as a &quot;GC root.&quot; The next time you run the setup script, it would check those &quot;GC roots&quot; to see if they point to a valid file and remove any dangling symlinks.<p>This is the approach I take for my own dotfiles. I seriously considered using Stow or the bare git approach before, but I decided against it because setting up my dotfiles involved more than just installing symlinks. I had to be able to download files (e.g., vim-plug), clone git repositories, change file permissions, and maintain files that&#x27;s not meant to be linked into the home directory. I found the flexibility of a custom shell script most fit for my needs.<p>[1]: The &quot;Deleting Packages&quot; section in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;8&#x2F;stow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;8&#x2F;stow</a>')
