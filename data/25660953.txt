You&#x27;re just projecting that, maybe based on bad experiences you have had.<p>There&#x27;s an old saying:  a job interview is a two-way street. You are interviewing them (or should be) every bit as much as they are you.  If the applicant asks a basic question about the position, the interviewer has a duty to either answer the question or say &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what role this is for; I&#x27;ve just been asked to check your technical knowledge, and then we&#x27;ll get you to the actual manager who can give you a better answer.  Okay?&quot;<p>If the interviewer is immature, arrogant, rigid, etc., and regards the interviewer-applicant relationship as an antagonistic one, and views the applicant as incompetent and dishonest until proven otherwise, the interview will have that flavor.  To me, that is a red flag about the organization. Indeed, I&#x27;ve heard from many sources that Amazon is a toxic environment; I have yet to hear anyone say &quot;Amazon is a terrific place to work! [for engineers&#x2F;programmers]&quot;  I suspect that if you&#x27;re a high level product person who comes up with a clever idea like an AWS feature, and are able to pitch it to the top management, then you&#x27;re a star, you&#x27;re well paid, and life is good.  But for the people in the trenches... not so great.')
