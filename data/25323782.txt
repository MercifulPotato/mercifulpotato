Item(by='that_guy_iain', descendants=None, kids=[25324458, 25323940], score=None, time=1607266140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323680, text='&gt; The whole “unbanked” thing is really unconvincing, because there&#x27;s no way Libra&#x2F;Diem will be usable for people who don&#x27;t have identity documents and the evidence needed for KYC&#x2F;AML forms, and that excludes most unbanked people.<p>Who says the countries this will be used in have KYC&#x2F;AML? The unbanked people this would be for aren&#x27;t in countries that have those laws.<p>&gt; As for international money transfers: TransferWise and the like are already providing better solutions in that space without forcing you to use Facebook Coins. Now you might say that mostly caters to the rich world, and that&#x27;s true, but the people who can&#x27;t use TransferWise are probably not going to be able to use Libra&#x2F;Diem either for the same reasons they can&#x27;t use TransferWise: ID documents, KYC&#x2F;AML, plus capital controls and sanction regimes which aren&#x27;t magically going to disappear for this new currency.<p>Can&#x27;t use transferwise, so can&#x27;t use something else.<p>This isn&#x27;t aimed at people who can use banking where KYC or AML apply. It&#x27;s for people who are curently using other unbanking payment methods.')
