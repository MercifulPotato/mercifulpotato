The lawsuits sound pretty credible to me.  When I read the court&#x27;s reason for rejecting the lawsuit it sounds like the judge is looking for technical reasons to reject the lawsuit.<p>When I look for articles explaining why the lawsuits are rejected en mass, every article I have found is very hand wavy, stating the judges are appointed by Trump so we should expect them to be unbiased.  However, no one actually dogs into the opinions or takes the reason why the election seems highly suspicious seriously.<p>To pick out one specific piece of evidence, in PA they found 200k more votes than voters, which is more than enough to change the result for that state.  The counts are all from state government databases.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.repdiamond.com&#x2F;News&#x2F;18754&#x2F;Latest-News&#x2F;PA-Lawmakers-Numbers-Don%E2%80%99t-Add-Up,-Certification-of-Presidential-Results-Premature-and-In-Error" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.repdiamond.com&#x2F;News&#x2F;18754&#x2F;Latest-News&#x2F;PA-Lawmaker...</a><p>Navarro has over 50 such claims linked in his report, totalling over 3M potentially fraudulent votes.  Regardless of what you think of the man, the evidence itself I find hard to set aside, even though I am like you and would tend towards dismissing Navarro as a partisan hack.  But when he has laid out the claimed evidence like this in detail I must at least give it a spot check and the spot checks hold up so far.')
