Item(by='gvb', descendants=None, kids=[25777022, 25779488], score=None, time=1610635567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773492, text='I don&#x27;t know where your &quot;here&quot; is, but here in the USA, you cannot put diesel in a vehicle&#x27;s gas tank, but you can put gas in a vehicle&#x27;s diesel tank. Putting gas in a diesel vehicle is very bad.<p>Reason: The gas nozzles dispensing unleaded gas were made smaller to prevent people from putting leaded gas into a vehicle that required unleaded gas (which would poison the catalytic converter). The diesel nozzles remained unchanged and leaded gas (with the big nozzles) went away.')
