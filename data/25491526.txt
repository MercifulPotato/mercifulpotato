I&#x27;ve got no love for Symbian, but when you&#x27;re selling that many phones, you phase it out, you don&#x27;t announce to the world that there&#x27;s no reason to buy the phones you&#x27;re still trying to sell.<p>Porting Symbian UI to Qt meant that they could at least merge surface-level stuff and have core apps that ran on both Maemo&#x2F;Meego and Symbian, then retire Symbian when no one would care or notice.')
