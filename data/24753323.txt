As a enduser, I want to focus on solving problem at hand, instead tackling&#x2F;remembering language syntax&#x2F;quirks(and new apis).<p>Let me give a very simple example in golang. Function returning single value and function returing multiple values.<p>func foo(x int, y int) int {}<p>func bar(x int, y int) (int, int) {}<p>Even though below synatx works,<p>func bar(x int, y int)(int) {}<p>why there is a additional way to do it by removing parenthesis ?<p>This looks very simple example. But it breaks consistancy of syntax. Adds 2 rules to remember over what saving 2 keystrokes ? In the age of 100x full stack devs, life really sucks.')
