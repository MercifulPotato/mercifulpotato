So cliche. So performant.<p>Glenn Greenwald, Mark Crispin Miller, Greg Palast, Keith Olbermann, Harlan Ellison, Bill Maher... just from the top of my head.<p>I love their work but omg they must be terrible to work with. Greenwald can&#x27;t even get along inside the org that he cofounded.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with similar artists, purists, ultimatists. It&#x27;s exhausting. Harlan Ellison biopic &quot;Dreams with Sharp Teeth&quot; captures it <i>perfectly</i>. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt1018887&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt1018887&#x2F;</a><p>Contrast Glennwald with others who figure out the working artist schtick.<p>Bill Maher did a new thing on cable.<p>Rachel Maddow somehow plays the corporate media game.<p>Even Chris Hedges, the world&#x27;s biggest Eeyore (or Marvin the Robot from HGTG), gets paid.<p>Some leftists figured out the podcast game. Pod Save America, Young Turks, &quot;bread tube&quot;.<p>Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias launched a new masthead (vox.com). Seriously impressive.<p>And contrast the left and right ecosystems.<p>Rightists have time proven playbook. Merch, weird advertisers, tours and events, stable sources of funding.<p>If Limbaugh and Alex Jones and Shapiro can find patrons to seed their endeavors, and customers to buy their wares, surely leftists can suck it up too.')
