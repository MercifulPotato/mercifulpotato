Once because I got a contact lens to protect a wounded eye.  I told the doctor I could not imagine putting anything artifical in my eye while it is trying to heal.  She insisted it would work for 80% of the patients.  Once in, the world went black.  It didnt even hurt.  It was my brain refusing to accept this version of the multiverse.\nI make a point of mentioning my tendency to just pass out when I get slightly strange treatment from med personel.  They seem to have it often enough, because they are always happy to hear in advance something might come up.\nIts strange, because I can not really predict if it will happen.  I am not really afraid of pain.  It is more like being afraid of loosing control or something.<p>Anyway, thanks for giving the phenomenon a name.')
