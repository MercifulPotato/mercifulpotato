It&#x27;s sort of astounding to think that someone could get to that age and not have learned the lessons in life that teaches one to listen and own up to mistakes.<p>Some sort of nepotism perhaps?<p>It&#x27;s not age-ist to point out that you would have expected someone of that age to be more self-aware.<p>People that cannot own their own mistakes are downright dangerous. The older, the worse.<p>It&#x27;s sort of odd, because some people can just &#x27;slip through&#x27;, all the way to the top (failing upwards, I believe it is called), because if you perfect the art of not admitting mistakes, some people mistake that for confidence &#x2F; skill (and often, the more money you have, the easier it becomes to do this).')
