The frequency evolution of the measures waveform depends on the mass of the objects. Once you know the mass you can use the amplitude to infer the distance.<p>2. Galaxies do contain supermassive black holes at their centers. However the frequency response of ground based detectors preclude observation. When space based detectors are operating we will see those collisions.')
