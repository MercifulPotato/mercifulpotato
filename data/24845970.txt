For really simple queries it&#x27;s also nice to be able to write &quot;findAllBySomethings_IdAndPropertyIsNull&quot; etc instead of writing a SQL query. Been there, done that.<p>Though I have to admit I do check what queries Hibernate produces to make sure it&#x27;s not doing some funky stuff that&#x27;s not really needed (as a result of a mistake of my own, mostly)<p>Edit: It has come to my attention that it is ofcourse Spring Data that offers those named queries. Still see nothing wrong with hibernate since I still only have to write it once and I&#x27;ll be relatively safe supporting both db systems.')
