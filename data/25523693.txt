There is robust competition among registrars and since it&#x27;s easy to change registrars, registrars have a disincentive to screw over registrants.  In contrast, registries have registrants completely over the barrel because you can&#x27;t change registry without giving up your domain name.  So registries are absolutely the place where registrants need to be protected.')
