I started interviewing a few months back and just recently got a really good offer from one of the FAANG gang.<p>The company I am currently at doesn&#x27;t vest your first year on your anniversary, but instead on preset days each quarter (I&#x27;m not sure if this is common).<p>I pushed my start date out significantly, but its not more than 2 weeks from my current cliff and it is as far out as the organization will allow.<p>I want to get the stock for my first year, and I also want to give a reasonable notice to my current employer - the thing is, I dont trust my current employer.<p>If I were to give a 4-6 weeks notice for _after_ my cliff date, and my current org let me go in the meantime, do I have any recourse?<p>Is my only option to stay until I vest, and give a very short notice?<p>The stock grant is 6 figures, so not an insignificant amount.')
