(these were my early Christmas presents for him).<p>I&#x27;ve been trying using Apple&#x27;s &quot;Notes&quot;, which seems ok. But I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s something else out there that uses a better file format, and allows for more flexible integration between normal text (meaning: keyboard input) and handwritten notes (or should I say Apple-pencil-written?).<p>Thanks for any pointers.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve looked online, and found lists like this [0]. But it seems quite hard to discern whether an app is a good match for what I&#x27;m trying to do.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collegeinfogeek.com&#x2F;best-note-taking-app-for-ipad&#x2F;')
