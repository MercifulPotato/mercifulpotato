In my country, they were among the earliest demographics to adopt pagers, then mobile phones, but at the same time, they all have a steel clipboard that opens to a storage compartment for a stack of paper permits (one or more for every state in the USA you are driving across), log sheets (for state and federal government, job sites, etc). And while you must file things with some government offices electronically, you better have the paper copy for the cops and Department of Transportation inspectors in various states as well as for mandatory road-scale-houses on interstate highways.')
