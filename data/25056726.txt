I don&#x27;t want to search for the button on the TouchBar – I&#x27;m using the keyboard, it needs to be as natural as typing, without the need to look down at it. I have a screen already, I don&#x27;t need another one on my keyboard.<p>I firmly believe TouchBar can&#x27;t even come close to the same realm of usefulness as F-keys, much less being worth the price hike it imposes. Function keys are twelve, tactile, solid, free, reliable(1) buttons for keyboard shortcuts; TouchBar is a touchscreen that sometimes(2) works.<p>&gt; <i>a button to &quot;toggle mic in zoom&quot; actually solves a real problem</i><p>I haven&#x27;t used Zoom, but if it&#x27;s a decent-ish Mac app, it either already has a keyboard shortcut to toggle microphone, or you can set one in Keyboard Shortcuts, in System Preferences.<p>(1) as far as anything is reliable on the butterfly keyboards.<p>(2) same story as butterfly keyboard – if it&#x27;s even slightly sporadic, it is a shitty input device.')
