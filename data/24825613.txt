But he will not know how they came to be, or how they could be resolved.<p>Will the literate <i>know</i>? It seems similar to a sports fan saying what the coach should do. They absolutely know that if they&#x27;d just do X, they&#x27;d win. I have zero knowledge about professional sports. My guess is that neither I nor that kind of fan actually do know how to coach a professional sports team.<p>I believe it&#x27;s similar in politics. If you don&#x27;t become a subject matter expert -and I don&#x27;t mean &quot;politics expert&quot;, I mean a tiny field and literally expert, like seasonal effects on labor requirements in some specialized industry- you don&#x27;t know how to fix &quot;it&quot; whether you watch 0 or 10 hours of news a week.')
