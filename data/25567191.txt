I see 3 lane roads that would work so much better as a mixed tram&#x2F;bicycle lane. Crossing roads is also terrifying.<p>Nix the thought of walking to do the following activities: \n- fetching a missing ingredient from a local shop&#x2F;store that would take 25min round trip and benefit you with additional exercise.\n- spending an evening going between bars being mildly intoxicated but not requiring a taxi.')
