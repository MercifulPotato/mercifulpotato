And so they sometimes make tradeoffs in favor of performance instead of expressiveness or simplicity.</i><p>Yep, exactly my feeling. When I get back to writing Elixir at my $day_job I am just blown away how I can achieve most of the same results (for 100X less performance of course) in like 20x less coding lines... :( Not a direct comparison with a dynamic language is possible of course, but I too wish the Rust team starts sacrificing <i>something</i> for a bit more expresiveness and code conciseness.<p>&gt; <i>That is understandable - but 95% of the projects I(!) have worked on don&#x27;t need this - I can just give it a GB more RAM and a bit more CPU and write software quicker because I don&#x27;t have to care about certain details.</i><p>Both what you describe and hand-crafted and ruthlessly tested C&#x2F;C++ code that&#x27;s maximally efficient have their place. But I definitely don&#x27;t belong the the &quot;machine efficiency at all costs&quot; tribe and I get worried at any potential signal that Rust is headed in that direction. Which it might not be. We&#x27;ll see.<p>&gt; <i>The fact that you used Rust probably puts you in the upper 10% - rough gestimation. I&#x27;m not telling you which 10% though. :P</i><p>&lt;Saruman voice&gt; YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE!<p>...I mean, I am myself&#x27;s worst critic. It took me a while to get comfortable with Rust and even if that means I am a below-average programmer, I don&#x27;t care. I am taking my time and I can objectively measure that I am getting better with time there.<p>I still do agree that Rust does require time and persistence however. That is irrevocably true. Here&#x27;s to hoping the team will make it consume a bit less characters (and thus typing) and improve the compiler and the tooling further. I am rooting for them with all my heart.')
