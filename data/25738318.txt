A comparison: armed vigilantes overran the capitol and bludgeoned a police officer to death as part of their riot. These two events do not appear similar in that way.<p>You say you&#x27;re concerned about the violence on both sides and there being a double standard which you find distasteful, and yet all of your posts are attempting to paint the BLM protests with the same violent core as the folks who overran the capitol, which given any kind of context or detail isn&#x27;t true at all.<p>To my original point: the context around these events make it clear that they are different and should be judged differently -- context which you&#x27;ve continually ignored to push this narrative.<p>If there exists a double standard, it isn&#x27;t that &quot;violence on the left&quot; is suppressed, it&#x27;s that if the capitol were stormed by BLM protestors who&#x27;ve finally had enough of police violence and systematic racism, they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten into the building, and they for damn sure wouldn&#x27;t have walked out under their own power.')
