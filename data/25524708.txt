They reported a story objectively, stating each side, without their own opinion. Even though one side was acting in bad faith. Is the BBC out of their element here, absolutely. But are they engaging in lies and deceipt, like Fox or OANN? Hardly.<p>&gt; poorly researched pieces are the fault of no one but the journalists<p>Agreed.
