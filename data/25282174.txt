I&#x27;m not into weed (it&#x27;s always weird to feel the need to append this disclaimer) but for God&#x27;s sake at this point I think pretty much everyone recognizes where it lies on the harm spectrum and we still treat it like a deadly narcotic.<p>Not many people realize this yet, but weed is already legal in the US. With the legalization of &quot;industrial hemp&quot; [0], you can now buy cannabis sativa flower in all 50 states 100% legally. The law requires that it contain less than 0.3% THC by mass, so the strains you can get are selectively bred for that, but it actually isn&#x27;t a big deal. CBD, and all the other cannabinoids in cannabis that aren&#x27;t THC still absolutely get you high. You can also create extracts and cook with it for all the same effects as &quot;regular&quot; (high THC) weed. It&#x27;s essentially like being able to buy beer but not liquor at this point.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fixgov&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fixgov&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-farm-bi...</a>')
