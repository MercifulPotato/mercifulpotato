Teslas solve this problem with liquid cooling and the motor controllers use temperature sensors in the motor core to determine if the currents are too great for the cooling. So really, no issue. I expect the Tesla Semi will handle heavy loads at low speeds just fine. As for clutch dumping, I&#x27;ll take electronic stability and traction control over the smell of burning clutch any day. Plus, the traction delivery is better in an EV; much less rotating mass means more rapid response and a better grip on the road.')
