The former was considered correct at one time. To my knowledge, the latter was always a slur, in Swedish.<p>So there is bound to be some imprecision when discussing this topic across the two languages if one does not want to type out the full words even in their meta use.<p>It is not hard to find examples of meta uses of &quot;neger&quot; in respected sources from just a few years ago. &quot;N-ordet&quot; is a quite recent import, obviously influenced by the American &quot;the n-word&quot;.')
