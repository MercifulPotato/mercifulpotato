Hardware stores even sell pre-cut studs at 92 5&#x2F;8&quot; instead of 96&quot;.<p>The building code is another obstacle.  It requires kiln-dried stamped+certified stud lumber for walls, and getting those in anything over 8 feet is a custom order (the 2x4x10s you see at your local hardware store are not certified for this).  Above 11 foot ceilings the building code requires you to get an engineer to design the house and wet-stamp the plans.')
