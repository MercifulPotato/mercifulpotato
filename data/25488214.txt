But they are declining in popularity, they are fragile over time.<p>D is Lindy Effect. It&#x27;s been around for 19 years, it&#x27;ll probably stay around for at least another 19.<p>&gt; The Lindy effect is a theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.[1] Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time.<p>So Rust may be hot nowâ€“ but remember, NoSQL and Docker were hot once too, and they are now not popular.<p>Plus D is adding Rust&#x27;s ownership and borrowing.<p>D compiles faster than C++20 and is easier to learn.')
