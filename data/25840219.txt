I believe this may be the case for car alarms. It has a side effect of desensitization, but it is still effective. I doubt most thieves smash and grab without consideration of alarms on the grounds that probably nobody will care about the alarm.<p>Thieves want to steal without being noticed. The real threat of a giant siren bringing attention to them with a towel wrapped around their hand standing next to a shattered window deters a lot of opportunistic theft. It isn&#x27;t quantifiable, but it is no doubt there.<p>Determined thieves of course will find a way, or find less secure targets. But most theft is opportunistic.')
