There are more than 170,000 structures in the PDB right now.<p>To determine potential targets for drugs we have to understand what the proteins do. Having the structure is not really enough for that, it doesn&#x27;t tell you the purpose of the protein (though it certainly can give you some hints).<p>In most cases the proteins were determined to be interesting by other experiments, and then people decided to try and solve their structure. So the structures we already solved are also biased towards the more biologically relevant proteins.')
