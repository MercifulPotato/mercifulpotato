Space Quest took itself a bit less seriously than KQ in that regard, with its many sci fi tropes.<p>Loved them both for different reasons.  I thought Space Quest was really funny and intriguing as a kid.  King&#x27;s Quest V along with Monkey Island II are the first games I owned when my parents bought me a 386 SX with a VGA card.  At some point later I got a Sound Blaster and suddenly had non-speaker-beeping music.')
