I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t charge with any other cable.<p>If not even Benson Leung&#x27;s recommended cable works, what then?<p>This is the frustration. All USB-C cables should have some bare minimum features that all of them supply, and be clearer about which ones have which features. Labeling it all the same USB-C leads to the frustration so many people are talking about.')
