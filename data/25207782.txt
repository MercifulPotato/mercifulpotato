You would still have very strong g-forces, but you could control the impulse curve over time to spread out the forces better.<p>Steel cables, flywheels and other members aren&#x27;t going to care about such forces as much as the delicate electronics on board a spacecraft. Let these parts do the heavy lifting and then transmit the energy into the spacecraft in a methodical manner. You need to decouple the extreme nature of this sort of energy storage system from the spacecraft until it is go time.')
