Item(by='jasode', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604839412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025233, text='<i>&gt;, and your artist will get 1&#x2F;1000×15000=£15 and the other one will get 999&#x2F;1000×£15000=£14985.</i><p>The <i>denominator</i> of 1000 in your fraction is <i>artists</i> but the pro rata calculation in the paper has <i>total streams</i> as the denominator.<p>If Spotify paid out by directly mapping userid to (unpopular) artist, and a user only listened to 1 track that month, that 1 artist of that 1 stream would receive the entire user&#x27;s subscription revenue.  (I.e. Assuming a rough calculation that Spotify pays ~70% of revenue to license royalties, that 1 artist would receive 70% of $15 which would be ~$10)<p>But with the total streams aggregation, the more people listen to Lady Gaga &#x2F; Katy Perry &#x2F; Taylor Swift &#x2F; etc, the more it makes the denominator bigger with popular streams.  Therefore, the more it <i>reduces</i> income percentage of the unpopular artist.  (I.e., that&#x27;s why an unpopular unknown indie artist receives a fraction of a cent for each stream instead of $10.[1])<p>It&#x27;s a calculation that favors artists of popular songs (streams).<p>In contrast, I believe the Amazon&#x27;s subscription for Kindle Unlimited payout is based on author&#x27;s pages read without aggregating all other authors&#x27; pages into the denominator.  Therefore, an Amazon&#x27;s subscriber&#x27;s revenue goes more towards the particular authors the subscriber read and is not affected by millions of others reading the more popular JK Rowling or Stephen King.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=spotify+indie+musician+payout+cents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=spotify+indie+musician+payou...</a>')
