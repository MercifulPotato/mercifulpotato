Item(by='s0rce', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609630944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617771, text='Open street map is great for hiking trails, particularly around urban areas where the US government maps (USFS, USGS) are way too out of date and don&#x27;t cover new trails. I routinely update OSM for trails around the SF Bay area as I hike&#x2F;bike them. I like the TF outdoors product accessible via the Caltopo and Gaia GPS apps, particularly the ability to easily download the maps for offline use.')
