Item(by='caddemon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610989265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817821, text='&quot;Learning styles&quot; are a great example IMO of non-scientists taking an idea with some merit and running away with it, to the point that scientists stop investigating it pretty much altogether because it&#x27;s been branded &quot;pseudoscience&quot;. Yeah the term learning styles itself is probably at this point a red flag for education pseudoscience, but the idea that different people may naturally solve the same problem in different ways is still very much an open question. It is probably true to at least some extent (as can be seen in certain extreme examples e.g. non-verbal vs verbal specific learning disorders).<p>Another example of this broader phenomenon is galvanic skin response. People ran with the lie detector BS and then the whole field basically died for a few decades, only to eventually be rebranded &quot;electrodermal activity&quot;. Probably your smart watch will be collecting EDA in a few years.')
