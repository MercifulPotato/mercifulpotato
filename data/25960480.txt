In that case, your instincts on pricing could be way off.<p>You might be cost-sensitive and look for a good deal when buying tools and infra to support your own projects. But buyers at larger companies aren’t spending their own money, so their thought process is very different.<p>As long as the price fits in the budget and isn’t an outlier compared to other products they pay for, then it’s not going to be what they focus on. They’ll care much more about quality, trustworthiness, ease of integration, support, and things like that.<p>That’s why putting your price at the high end of the &#x27;acceptable&#x27; range is a win-win. You don’t leave money on the table, and you make an implicit commitment to high quality and good service, which the customers you really want value more than a bargain.')
