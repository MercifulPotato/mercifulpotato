Item(by='phil21', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603226985, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836866, text='&gt; Have you ever lived on that lifestyle to check your assumption that they have &quot;very little incentive to try and find a job&quot;?<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve lived and clawed my way out of that lifestyle.  And yes, I absolutely feel most have very little incentive to do so.<p>I am told these days welfare benefits fraud is something at some tiny fraction of less than 1%, but my experience and those of my friends who have grown up similarly really shows a vastly stark difference between lived experience and statistics.<p>If you&#x27;d have asked me growing up I would have told you benefits fraud was rampant and the norm.  Now I&#x27;m not so sure, but I am absolutely certain the definition of fraud has changed.  Fraud to me and many others is &quot;someone who could otherwise get a job but puts no effort into doing so or improving themselves towards being a self sufficient person&quot; - where to others it seems more outright fraud in a white collar sense like claiming too many dependents.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult topic for me because the &quot;science&quot; so jarringly conflicts with my lived experience.')
