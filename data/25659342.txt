Iâ€™ve seen it happen to family. Yes it could be better still, yes it was improved by having the province purchase private facilities, and yes an improvement is a win.<p>The challenge with transparency like this is you see a number like that and freak out. The reality is need based triage works and plays a huge role.<p>Their goals are likely a few months, due to low need.
