That is it gives them a timeframe (between late 20&#x27;s and late 30&#x27;s say) that they kinda know they want to be in a position to have a child and working back from that they need to get an education and begin a career.<p>It gives them almost a timescale to plan against and boys have nothing similar in the biological sense.<p>I genuinely have no clue if it actually holds any weight, just something I&#x27;ve always been curious about.')
