Very unlikely, even if I &quot;curse Xi&quot;. But still, I don&#x27;t want any topics about Chinese politics to be related with my main ID, &quot;just in case&quot;. Unlike FooBarWidget who (by glancing at his Twitter) has settled in EU, I don&#x27;t have this luxury still plan to go back to China.<p>I found this whole &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; I have myself ironic and, to be honest, pathetic. So I just stopped. :&#x2F;')
