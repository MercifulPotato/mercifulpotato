It was too late to warned them about a new phishing threat most of the time. Threat actors are evolving in a rapid phase. As a cybersecurity professional, I need to warn people whom I can reach about cyber threats.<p>So I built VIZZAG. I researched&#x2F;coded&#x2F;designed from 8 PM -&gt; 11 PM on Weekdays after office hours and 9 AM -&gt; 11 PM on Weekends. There are still tons of features missing (I&#x27;m working on Chrome extension next!) but, I think it&#x27;s reached that - buzzword alert! - MVP stage where I want to see if anyone&#x27;s going to use the darn thing.\nIt&#x27;s free forever for personal use, and I will introduce paid API plans for commercial use.<p>Here&#x27;s an example VIZZAG link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vizzag.com&#x2F;?scan=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vizzag.com&#x2F;?scan=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com</a> - I created an application which scans a website in real-time using expert and AI-driven detection algorithms to detect if the website is malicious.<p>I think it has some potential. What do you guys think?')
