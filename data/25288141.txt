I think I can speak for this considering my relatives worked those &quot;slave&quot; jobs as you put it.<p>The UAE had long been forced by the British and the Americans to abolish slavery before they gained their independence. This, unlike Saudi Arabia, where it was legal long after the 1970s.<p>About the &quot;slave&quot; jobs, most of them are basically menial jobs with really shit pay and a combined bunk accommodation. But it&#x27;s far better than what we get back in India or Pakistan or Bangladesh, which is usually the unemployment line. A number of people have improved their station and are part of the local business community from those levels.')
