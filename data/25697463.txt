Most people oppose killing innocent people. What is and isn&#x27;t a &quot;person&quot; is partially a subjective judgement; people who oppose abortion might believe that e.g. a one-month-old foetus constitutes a &quot;person&quot;, while people who support abortion might disagree. People have a right to believe that killing one-month-old foetuses is wrong just like vegans have a right to believe that killing animals for food is wrong; there&#x27;s no objective answer to moral questions.')
