I liked <i>Perelandra</i> best, but only after reading it a second time when a friend pointed out that it was a reimagining of the garden of Eden (I was too young to pick up on that during the first read).  <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> is interesting since the reference is to Earth and how it remains &quot;silent&quot; to those outside of it who choose to avoid its rampant evil.<p>Incidentally the trilogy came about when C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien agreed to write separate sci-fi series - Lewis would write a space trilogy and Tolkien  a time-travel one [0].  Tolkien was to write of a traveler from England who visited Numenor (the land of Aragorn&#x27;s sires) before it drowned in a fate similar to Atlantis. Lewis completed his, but Tolkien did not although much of the material was published in a volume on the history of Middle Earth by his son, Christopher. (Lewis referred to his friend as &quot;that great but dilatory and unmethodical man&quot;.) Tolkien&#x27;s experiment did result in the development of the idea of the Fall of Numenor which did get incorporated into the Lord of the Rings saga.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Lost_Road_and_Other_Writings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Lost_Road_and_Other_Writ...</a>')
