So below here is how I dealt with all of them. And in some cases, I&#x27;m simply offering a thing or two here, because I feel like you need some companionship (and since I have no clue on how to meet people during this pandemic, I&#x27;m doing it this way).<p>&gt; I write Python but I never learned how to use the Python debugger.<p>I can show you my workflow. Feel free to email me.<p>I love debuggers.<p>&gt; Every time I&#x27;m asked to give an estimate for something I feel like I&#x27;m pulling a random number out of my ass.<p>I think a lot of us do. I came to accept that this is the way it is.<p>&gt; I tried to learn TypeScript and React and I just can&#x27;t get it.<p>I&#x27;ve learned enough React and TypeScript to have some insights into this. Self-learning this takes around 100 hours. This is how I did it:<p>- Read a book (e.g. Road to React) and code whatever the book says<p>- Then make a project on your own that is like the project of the book but not completely<p>- Now make a project (small) that is something different<p>You&#x27;re now ready to code in actual React.<p>My route for this was:<p>1. Code whatever Road to React says<p>2. Make a favorites app. List your favorite websites and give it 1 to 5 stars.<p>3. My thesis (tbh convincing the academic board that a React project was scientific was as hard as the project itself :P). My thesis was an XML parser that feed to output to React components which would be rendered. Note: the XML language was academic and my claim was that there would be a 30% code reduction by using React, which was true as no parsing was needed anymore, you could use a webpack plugin.<p>&gt; My wife isn&#x27;t a gamer and there&#x27;s nobody to play with me.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that I only like and play games because my friends play them. And I then become quite competitive and practice that game over and over and over again. I always wondered why I was addicted to games, it was just a distorted way for my need for human contact.<p>With that said, feel free to email me to play Among Us. It&#x27;s one of the few games that I allow myself to play (as long as I know someone who wants to play as well).<p>&gt;  eat the cheapest fast food lunch alone during work days<p>In my country it&#x27;s quite easy to circumvent this as we have good bread, butter and peanutbutter (so I simply make that as a sandwich, super quick), throw in some tangerines and that&#x27;s my &quot;fastfood&quot;. Do you have similar ways of doing that?<p>&gt; When I&#x27;m off work and get home, I take care of watching over the little one do her homework, I have supper and I do the dishes, and then it gets late and I have no more energy to do anything useful.<p>For the past 6 months, I mostly worked 4 days per week instead of 5. The difference is massive. It sounds like your energy is being depleted too much for what you can handle right now.')
