This meant I developed a fairly unhealthy sleep pattern and would often only get 6 hours of sleep a night.<p>10 years on and although I don&#x27;t stay up to socialise anymore, I still really struggling to get enough sleep. No matter how tired I am throughout the day my mind seems to naturally wake up around 10pm and I rarely want to go to bed before 3am despite having to be up at 9am for work. On average I probably get 5-6 hours a night on a week day and 7-8 a night on weekends.<p>Also every now and then (2 or 3 times a year) my body simply refuses to sleep and I will be completely unable to sleep for 2-3 days. Again, although I know I need sleep I am not &quot;tired&quot;. I&#x27;ll put my head down on the pillow and nothing, my mind is racing and my body is fidgety and hyperactive.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve conditioned myself to develop an unhealthy sleep pattern as a teenager, but I really struggle with sleep these days. I have tried to condition myself with having a schedule and dimming lights past 9pm, but so far I haven&#x27;t had much luck shutting my head off at an appropriate time. However when I do eventually sleep I will typically want to stay in bed for 12+ hours it&#x27;s just that&#x27;s rarely possible because of work, etc.<p>Does anyone have any tips for me? I seem to naturally want to sleep around 5-7pm so these days if I&#x27;m feeling particularly sleep deprived I&#x27;ll try to get a couple of hours after work, but again this isn&#x27;t always possible and sometimes my body will refuse to sleep even if I lie there for two hours.')
