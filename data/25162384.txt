I don&#x27;t think people are talking about phrases like &quot;a little problem&quot; or &quot;a big deal&quot;. Do you take issue with the point I raised about &quot;falling on deaf ears?&quot; Why are we talking about hypothetical complaints people might have about the word small when we have real examples about the use of &quot;falling on deaf ears&quot; or &quot;master&quot; terminology in tech.<p>I think people are making good faith attempts to communicate that those phrases hurt their feelings. I think it&#x27;s not wrong to make a good faith attempt to avoid hurting people&#x27;s feelings. I think complaining about a hypothetical slippery slope misses the point.<p>&gt; I am not interested in devoting half of my brainpower to self-censoring<p>But we already do this. You don&#x27;t just blurt out everything you think. If you walk by somebody in the supermarket who smells strongly of perfume do you just shout &quot;you stink&quot;? When you&#x27;re speaking to a group you&#x27;re probably picking appropriate language to use. You&#x27;re not dropping a bunch of f-bombs at work and probably not using a ton of programmer-specific technical jargon or metaphors with your friends who aren&#x27;t in tech.<p>When one of my closest friends from childhood came out as trans it took me a month to stop using the wrong pronouns for them. I had to think about it in the moment... until I didn&#x27;t anymore because I built up a habit and got used to it. Now it takes no brainpower at all. This is normal. This is how normal habit-building works.<p>&gt; Being conscious of your partners emotions...<p>But not my coworkers? Not my black peers? Not a potential hearing-impaired contributor to one of my oss projects on github?')
