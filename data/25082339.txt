Why do you think that makes sense? If you&#x27;re going to say &quot;because this is the kind of thing a social justice minister would write&quot;, consider that:<p>1. You may have cause and effect wrong. The conditions this person lived through, especially as a gig worker, may have moved them to be a social justice minister; not the other way around.<p>2. You are not judging the article from the quality of the writing or the persuasiveness of the arguments, but instead by the background of the writer. Certainly it&#x27;s important to note that this article is written from the experience of a _gig worker_, but IMO that only adds to the persuasiveness.')
