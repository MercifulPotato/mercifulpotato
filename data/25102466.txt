Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25103789], score=None, time=1605458396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099554, text='&gt; Bush vs Gore took an entire month to sort out.<p>That was a difference of around 500 votes out of nearly 6 million, which was around 0.009%. That&#x27;s well within the range you can get with just the ordinary counting error. It is not at all uncommon for a recount to reverse a lead that small.<p>In addition, Florida at the time was using a lousy ballot marking system that caused many ballots to fail to register that the voter had tried to vote in the Presidential race. Neither side disputed this. The dispute was over how to address it.<p>Are you really comparing that to trying to challenge in several states where the difference is well outside ordinary counting error and there is no evidence of sufficient voting irregularities to come anywhere near changing the winner in those states?')
