Most of TimescaleDB is open source under Apache 2. The difference is that the advanced features of TimescaleDB - Eg clustering - are under a source available license and are free, while advanced InfluxDB features like clustering are under a paid enterprise license. In fact TimescaleDB recently made all of our enterprise features available for free. So one could argue that TimescaleDB is more open than Influx.<p>For more information on TimescaleDB licensing, check out this blog post: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.timescale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.timescale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-open-source-busines...</a><p>(Disclaimer&#x2F; fyi: I work at Timescale)')
