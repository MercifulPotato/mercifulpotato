Sure it might be [emph shown] in a marked up way, but then doesn&#x27;t your LaTeX editor do this?<p>And if your editor does this, how can you be sure that the new markup language for documents are not, in fact, superior in readability and expressiveness to LaTeX?<p>I mean, the made up formatting I tried to show in this comment is more readable and extendable than LaTeX (in my eyes, anyway), but it is still raw text.')
