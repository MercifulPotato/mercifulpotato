Even if the shorting ones end up going belly up, they&#x27;ll just restructure, shift people around, and be back in business as if nothing ever happened.<p>&gt; <i>and why people who bought in at 200&#x2F;300&#x2F;400 will lose their YOLO money</i><p>Because the stock is not worth it, and they won&#x27;t all be able to pull out in time.<p>That said, I can&#x27;t say WSB is <i>wrong</i>. Many of the players don&#x27;t mind losing the money - the current sentiment seems to be, at least overtly, to show a giant middle finger to established financial institutions, and make &quot;them&quot; suffer for 2008. I think WSB is likely to achieve that goal to some extent. At the very least, they&#x27;re sending the message. Personally, I&#x27;m only worried about second-order consequences for the stock market at large (wouldn&#x27;t want it to trigger the next 2008). I&#x27;m also worried if they get shut down from the top by more &quot;uncoordinated&quot; corporate shenanigans, this may spill over and turn violent.')
