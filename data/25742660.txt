Your freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t entitle you to use it on the stage built by someone else.<p><i>Free markets aren&#x27;t either</i><p>Again, that doesn&#x27;t contradict me. It would take a fundamental adjustment to the legal framework surrounding either user licensing agreements or the definition of public utilities in order to say these companies aren&#x27;t allowed to enforce their current ToS.<p>If you want to argue that laws should change, that&#x27;s fine, but then we&#x27;re talking about a slider between the definition &amp; right to own private property on the one hand, and freedom of speech using 3rd party&#x27;s property on the other hand. If you want to slide it more towards the later, you are taking away from the former, and vice versa. I don&#x27;t know any formula for where that line should be drawn, only that in this particular example I believe the line drawn was acceptable.')
