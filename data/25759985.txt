This book is not about UFO sightings, but about how ordinary people can have wild hallucinations. For example, an elderly woman who would regularly have very vivid, daytime, hallucinations of a concert being played in her living room. She knew it was not &quot;real&quot;, but it was comforting and a welcoming distraction from the isolation that elderly folk often suffer from. It is quite an eye-opening book.')
