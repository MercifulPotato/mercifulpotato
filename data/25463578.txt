It might be up for a few days but the seller will have it removed under the reason “you didn’t purchase this item”.<p>I’m really close to buying, and leaving reviews all while doing a return.<p>Sad part is amazon knows about this. They just don’t care because they’re making money and most people won’t blame the card for being fake they’ll just assume their camera or whatever corrupted the clips.')
