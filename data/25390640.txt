Item(by='otterley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607719035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389522, text='&gt; We know the price of the combined 3, and we know the price of the 1 unique unit, that gives us a very accurate idea of the retail price of the 2 matching units.<p>There <i>is</i> no retail price because you can&#x27;t buy them retail new. That&#x27;s the only point I&#x27;m trying to make here. I don&#x27;t contend your math is incorrect in the abstract, but in the real world, it&#x27;s irrelevant. That&#x27;s all.<p>Case in point: A quick eBay search shows that a used working AirPod is about $45. If you are correct, and only the abstract math matters, why would anyone pay $45 for a used working AirPod when, as you claim, it is only worth $40 new? Is the market that irrational? I kind of doubt it.<p>I also don&#x27;t contend that the original is worth $50 to Apple (this was a best-case high water mark). It&#x27;s almost certainly worth less because their incremental cost is less.<p>I&#x27;m strictly speaking in terms of real markets as they are observable today. Heck, even a non-working AirPod is still worth about $10 on the open market. Exchange it with Apple for $49 (assuming the battery is the only problem) and that makes the market value of a new (-ish?) unit $59. (This makes Apple&#x27;s goodwill worth about $15 per unit.)')
