Their promo photos and videos show it on the left side because of the most convenient usb port. I have never actually seen a left-placed mouse in the wild. Having it all look so clean and organized in the promo is a bit disingenuous.<p>In reality, the mouse will be on the right, and the cable will have to cross over top of <i>all</i> cables except the ethernet and usbc power. For such a beautiful form factor, it will look like a mess.')
