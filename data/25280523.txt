And believe it or not, the predominant german population in the US at the time did not like war with Germany. Go figure.<p>In regards to the Pacific, the Japenese navy couldn&#x27;t even hold a candle to the US. Even after Pearl  Harbor it basically equalized it. What was discovered though throughout the Pacific campaign was that air superiority defined who&#x27;d win. The Japanese instructed kamikazes as opposed to saving the aircraft. Since it&#x27;s a lot harder to rebuild a new aircraft and ship it out than it is to just put a fresh out of flight school kid in a plane, they basically crippled themselves with a semi accurate human guided missile with a minor payload. Not to mention the Japanese still had a smaller navy.<p>The US had a lot of WWI era ships, but they were still perfectly viable. The Japanese had no chance from the beginning. Thats specifically WHY they attacked Pearl Harbor. They anticipated US involvement so to try and get ahead of the game, they waited until they knew many of the US naval ships were in Pearl Harbor to attack. While it certainly dampened our navy, it didn&#x27;t stop industry building one up, and definitely did not even compete against US at the time. In terms of chess, the Japanese basically took a rook or a bishop with a pawn.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naval_history_of_World_War_II#Japan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naval_history_of_World_War_II#...</a><p>The Battle of Britain though was far more of an important battle. The British and whomever the Air Marshall was at the time got absurdly lucky they discovered radar. That coupled with the Air Marshalls strategy alone was a testament to his intelligence of the battle he was facing. He knew it was one of attrition so he let the Germans waste time trying to draw out his fighters. Radar helped them determine when the real invasion was coming so they could go balls out to defend it. Had Britain been taken over, I&#x27;d be willing to bet the US would only have faced the Japanese. Germany would&#x27;ve likely be able to successfully push through the eastern front with more resources as well.')
