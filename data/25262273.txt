And yes, some people really do have ADHD and need various support, not limited to extra time on exams, to succeed in the school environments we have created.  But _so_ many people are diagnosed with ADHD who have nothing of the sort...<p>Anecdotally, my acquaintances who teach at elite liberal arts colleges say that 25-40% of their students nowadays are receiving extra-time accommodations, a sharp rise over just 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s possible that the prevalence of ADHD and various mental health issues really is that high amongst high-performing teenagers nowadays; the college admissions crapshoot and lead-up to it surely is not helping with mental health.  But I find it much more likely that there&#x27;s a significant amount of gaming the system going on, unfortunately.')
