FWIW, I always disable notifications, have a filter on my email for “you missed this message” emails to go to a separate inbox, only use slack&#x2F;matter most in the browser, and only open it a few times a day.<p>I have trained my colleagues and boss to never expect a response right away. We’re also forced to use Skype at work which is a plague because people are lazy and will call about anything and everything without thinking it through. So same thing there, I’ve disabled all sounds, filter notification emails away, set my self to busy all the time, and never answer calls when they come in except it it was agreed upon beforehand (so, like a meeting)<p>I try and force these incurable skypers to send an email instead: it forces them to really think their stuff through, organize it in a more structured way, and takes me two minutes to answer instead of having a 15 min call that is all over the place.<p>And I don’t get interrupted while trying to visualize complex things in my head.')
