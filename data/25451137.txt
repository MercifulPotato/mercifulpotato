Thank you very much.<p>I have a pretty big background in fitness (studied&#x2F;taught martial arts for 15 years, coached(L1) Crossfit, was a powerlifter and also an amateur olympic lifter for a few years).  I like fighting, lifting heavy, and I personally hate cardio.  I live in a city that gets cold, and the Peloton sits in my room and I constantly jump on it and get my heart rate up daily.  I&#x27;ve lost 20 pounds in the last 4 months.<p>Before this purchase I had never been to a spin class in my life.  I&#x27;d rather bike than run, because I&#x27;m lazy and I appreciate sitting down.  The Peloton classes are great and they have HIIT, EMOM&#x27;s, long distance rides, and their &quot;Power Zone&quot; stuff guides you through hitting your VO2max, Lactate Threshold, etc.<p>I already have a home gym, and the bike cost + $40&#x2F;mo for classes makes it so I don&#x27;t have get a gym membership and drive to a gym since I can do everything at home.  Plus, there are gorgeous women motivating me to work.<p>You may not be the ideal customer for this product, but don&#x27;t call those that are idiots.')
