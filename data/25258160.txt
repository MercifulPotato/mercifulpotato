Furthermore the creation of cash&#x2F;fiat creates high benefits to those that benefits from the newly created money first, before the money spreads and devalues its value due to inflation over time.<p>Inflation vs deflation debate is a complicated one, I don&#x27;t know which is best in terms of enabling technical progress. One is more short termist, another is more long termist.<p>But fiat&#x2F;inflated currencies won&#x27;t go away. It&#x27;s just that those kinds of currencies just tends to blow up at some point because of inflation and human nature. It&#x27;s more than nice to have other options, especially digital. The idea to have some kind of worldwide standard that is open and won&#x27;t change is also nice.')
