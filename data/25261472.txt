If the field fails, the reaction stops.<p>If it didn&#x27;t (hypothetically), I imagine it would do some pretty severe damage to the reactor parts specifically. At some point, the vacuum would be broken, air would rush in, and the reaction would _definitely_ stop.<p>Most of the larger fusors (as far as I&#x27;m aware) seem to be refinements of the basic Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor design (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fusor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fusor</a>), which is a relatively simple device. If you have the motivation, you could build one at home with common-ish tools.')
