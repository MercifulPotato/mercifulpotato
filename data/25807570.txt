This is quite critical for anybody planning to live in a country.<p>Update: found it, but it&#x27;s hidden on a separate page behind a tiny &quot;Visa&quot; link up top.  The overall nav here is a bit awkward, I though the nav was just providing quick links to sections of the home page but turns out they&#x27;re pointing to separate pages, some of which duplicate content (eg the news &amp; updates stream).<p>Also, COVID restrictions are quite important now, although these are a nightmare to track because they change so rapidly.')
