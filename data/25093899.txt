During some of the lockdowns in Canada drive-thru and delivery were some of the only options for getting food. And places without a drive-thru were forced to rely a lot on delivery apps.<p>Unfortunately you&#x27;d think it is a choice, but in today&#x27;s day in age a restaurant cannot afford to skip being on the delivery apps. People are lazy and are likely to just not order from a place if they don&#x27;t see it on a delivery app. No one I have talked to has ever been happy with the way the apps work. However part of the problem is that most people don&#x27;t know how much these apps are screwing over the restaurant. I have talked to people who were happy to have so many options of local places on these delivery apps and were happy to be able to support them. But they did not even know that these companies were taking such a huge cut of the money that it meant those local companies often weren&#x27;t making profit on the orders at all.<p>Even various leaders in different provinces were making statements publicly asking food delivery companies to not be greedy and to lower fees: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobilesyrup.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;premier-ford-food-delivery-companies-greedy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobilesyrup.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;premier-ford-food-deliver...</a>')
