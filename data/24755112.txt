It is quite likely safer than the internal network. Security is often a second rate citizen in most companies.<p>Also, strict security practices that affect productivity often get worked around - for example, if I want to examine a diagnostics archive I got by mail on my phone, but the IT policy won&#x27;t let me, I may well forward it to my personal mail, open that though Firefox, and get the archive this way. It&#x27;s much worse for overall security, but pretty hard to prevent, and less important to me when I get a call about blocked builds at 10 o&#x27;clock.')
