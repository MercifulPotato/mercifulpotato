They can&#x27;t easily cache content from origins that use TLS due to the encryption, unless you install a root certificate that allows the proxy to spoof any origin.<p>You could connect to the proxy via HTTP which then uses HTTPS to the origin, but then you&#x27;d get mixed content warnings (loading scripts via HTTP when the page is loaded via HTTPS).')
