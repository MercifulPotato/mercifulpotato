You have to know how to read (and ideally write in) your native language at a relatively high level. So much of our craft&#x27;s knowledge is written down, in technical if not arcane terms, that in order to learn you really have to read.<p>2) The ability to reason about causes and effects, that is, to envision in your head what the computer will do when it evaluates a statement in your program. Also, the ability to back-reason which statements will produce a desired effect. You need to be able to predict what will happen before you write the code and test it out after the code is written. You&#x27;d be surprised how few people have this ability developed and how <i>hard</i> programming is for the general population as a consequence.<p>3) The ability to be humble and stay focused. Your program will take much longer to write than you think it will, and there will be more bugs. You have to have the diligence and passion to see it through.')
