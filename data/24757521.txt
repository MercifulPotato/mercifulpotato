I worked at a large US CPU company (Not AMD). There were several buildings on the campus. When nature called, I often had to go one or even two buildings away to find an open toilet stall. It was a nightmare. God help you if you had to poop near the top of the hour when meetings were getting out. There were lineups in the restrooms. I used to joke that it was like a concert but without the music and beer. I couldn&#x27;t believe that a company that designs CPUs couldn&#x27;t anticipate something simple like restroom loading.')
