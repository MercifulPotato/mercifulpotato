But then some of the precincts reported &quot;nope, we found 100% accuracy; no discrepancies&quot;, for the same batch sizes. That struck me as odd. There wasn&#x27;t a spectrum where 0-10 or even 0-20 were the outliers; it was bimodal around 5-10 and 0. Or whatever the actual numbers were, my point is bimodality with a mode at 0. That was odd.')
