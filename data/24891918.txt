The platforms themselves are a mixed bag, occasionaly banning content that represents legitimate disinformation, but often suppressing information that&#x27;s contextually true, or conflicts with an existing broader social narrative which the moderator required to inspect the content has bought into. The human moderators are often inconsistent.<p>The concept that any person or organization should be granted absolute authority to serve as the arbiter of whay constitutes dangerous or false speech, and the power to arbitrarily silence those who utter it offends me, and I consider it to be dangerous in and of itself. We&#x27;ll not be able to agree on this.<p>WRT the NYP piece, probably foreign sourced is about right. Even before the media picked up its Russia Trumpet, I remember reading a rumor towards the beginning of the Trump-Ukraine phone call debacle that a Chinese billionaire had slipped Juliani a hard drive containing information that might be incriminating to Biden&#x27;s some. Irrespective of the source, the computer shop narrative reeks.<p>But in spite of information&#x27;s questionable provenance, it has been accompanied with compromising images of Hunter himself, and beyond stating that a meeting with Burisma execs wasn&#x27;t on Biden&#x27;s &#x27;official&#x27; schedule, the biden campaign has yet (to my knowledge), to expressly deny the validity of the documents.<p>If this is disinformation, the FBI, which has ostensibly been in possession of the documents for several months, has every incentive to comment on it, as does the CIA. Beyond ambiguous citations of &#x27;anonymous officials&#x27;, I&#x27;ve yet to read that they&#x27;ve communicated anything to this effect. The Director of National Intelligence has gone so far as to claim that this wasn&#x27;t a Russian disinformation project. But he&#x27;s a Trump apparatchik with no history in intelligence outside his appointment, so I generally ignore him.<p>Probably foreign sourced? My gut says yes.<p>Possibly disinformation? The juries still out. Possibly&#x27;s a pretty low bar for stealing someone&#x27;s voice.<p>The tech companies took it upon themselves to censor this information. They&#x27;ve not claimed they were compelled or reccommended to by any official bodies any more than they were required to censor the name of the Urkaine whistleblower. But they chose to, of their own accord.<p>If you want to be treated like a platform, you have to live with the fact that your platform&#x27;s going to be used to further the aims of anyone who wannts to use it. Bar illegal content and behaviors (things disinformation is not), the most you should do is notify your users, sit back, and take it.')
