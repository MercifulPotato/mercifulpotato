Always surprises me how precarious driving a 4x4 can be on fairly mild terrain.  You need two tracks whilst a bike only needs one.  You need vertical clearance between the wheels in both directions.   And there is no way to just get off and push a few metres.  Trying to navigate between obstructions and zombies on a deteriorating road surface would be <i>challenging</i>.  Although I don&#x27;t fancy changing an inner tube in that world.')
