Engadget journo bizarrely salutes.<p>Here&#x27;s the Canon site <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redefinethelimits.us&#x2F;space&#x2F;cornerstone&#x2F;experience" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redefinethelimits.us&#x2F;space&#x2F;cornerstone&#x2F;experience</a><p>Explanation: This Canon site is one of the most remarkable examples of Dark Patterns I&#x27;ve seen. It purports to let the visitor use Canon&#x27;s satellite to take an orbital picture. Instead, you can select a curated picture and pretend you took it.<p>What I experienced was me clicking thru Canon&#x27;s funhouse nightmare of a site, while autoplay sounds and videos jump-scared at me - even with the site&#x27;s mute button selected. I keep getting led in circles trying to find a way to move the globe for my shot. At the end of it, I learn I can&#x27;t even position the map at all. I can only pick one of the handful of presented pics and then interact with simulation of me taking the picture.<p>What the heck Canon?')
