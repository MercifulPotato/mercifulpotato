Item(by='switchbak', descendants=None, kids=[25888208], score=None, time=1611452363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887812, text='Smells a little trollish to me, but I&#x27;ll bite.<p>The HAES (Health at every size) movement that has been gaining in popularity states that people with a marked excess of body fat can still be considered just as healthy as someone with a normal range of body fat (particularly if they&#x27;re active).<p>That assertion is fairly shocking to people familiar with the studies on the subject. This study focused specifically on quantifying the measurable health differences between these groups, specifically factoring in activity level. It shows a strong correlation of excess body fat and worse health outcomes. Even among obese people that are active. This is strong data to directly counter the claims of the HAES proponents.<p>I would think the progressive &#x2F;&quot;sjw&quot; (as you say) mindset would be to embrace the HAES model, but you&#x27;re suggesting they&#x27;re picking on overweight people? That doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>My opinion is that we should be honest about the real danger obesity presents (even with exercise), and have that inform our approaches to treatment. I see no value in shaming or picking on people though, those are orthogonal issues.')
