Most futures arbitrage trades made by large multinationals are fundamentally these sorts of storage cost arbitrage and&#x2F;or funding cost arbitrage.  (Funding cost can be thought of as a storage cost for money&#x2F;debt.)<p>For instance, my understanding is that trading stock index futures vs. a replicating basket of single-stock futures is usually a matter of finding ways to secure funding more cheaply than your competitors.  In this case, your competitive advantage is fundamentally linked to time, and exiting early reduces your competitive advantage.')
