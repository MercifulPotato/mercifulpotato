In most of the other cases, the corals had much, much more time to adapt.<p>Imagine going 0 to 60 in a minute vs going 0 to 60 in a millisecond. One of those is going to crush you into a paste. We&#x27;re halfway through that millisecond, watching things get pasted all around us, and trying to figure out if we can somehow stop this process.<p>Gradual warming and cooling, even to relatively extreme temperatures and CO2 levels by today&#x27;s standards meant that corals had many, many generations to adjust. Today, not so much.')
