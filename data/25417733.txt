But the next paragraph says:<p>&gt; In parts of Europe, as in Late Medieval Germany, spending time as a wandering journeyman (Wandergeselle),[6] moving from one town to another to gain experience of different workshops, was an important part of the training of an aspirant master.<p>So I guess at least in some times&#x2F;places journeymen also did actually journey? Whether wandering or not, I&#x27;d think the right to charge a fee for each day&#x27;s work is also the right to <i>leave</i> at the end of the day if you&#x27;d like, having gotten paid. Unlike an apprentice who is tied to his master and does not get paid for a day&#x27;s work, if he leaves he&#x27;s out of work entirely.')
