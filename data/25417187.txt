You&#x27;re not reinventing the wheel offering plumbing services in your local village.<p>I guess we have to think about how these experiments might play out and the risks involved as we participate in them. How will food delivery services change my community? What&#x27;s the risk that an investment in personal education with this newly launched service won&#x27;t pay off? What am I giving up by opening a free account with Facebook?<p>There&#x27;s a strong likelihood that any of these experiments will blow up. Just as there&#x27;s a strong likelihood that a direct investment in any of these companies won&#x27;t pay off (especially as an early investor, which is at the point where we&#x27;re likely using these services.) Maybe people shouldn&#x27;t be so quick to jump in early, and more accepting of the mistake once they find out they placed a bad bet.')
