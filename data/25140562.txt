I know two people who were told that their children will have down syndrome with almost complete certainty, and their kids ended up completely fine, at least in this regard. We&#x27;re on our third child and the screening and push to make a decision is at every appointment. On our first pregnancy, after the first ultrasound the doctor told us there was a &quot;roughly 10%&quot; chance she had down syndrome and asked us what we wanted to do. As if I&#x27;m going to kill my kid over a slim chance at disability determined by a grainy picture from a 10+ year old ultrasound machine operated by someone just trying to make it to their lunch break. I can&#x27;t help but wonder how many parents terminate perfectly healthy children.')
