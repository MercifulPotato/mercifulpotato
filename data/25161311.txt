My mom buys random things from them like clothes, jewelry, and random appliances for literally $5. She’s willing to wait three weeks to get her stuff because it’s such a good deal. My dad was able to get a quality DSLR for $50. He doesn’t care if the brand is unknown.<p>Most people on Hacker News (software engineers) probably wouldn’t need to use an app like Wish. It wouldn’t make sense.')
