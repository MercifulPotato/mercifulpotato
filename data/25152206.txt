It shows that it is IPS, but it really looks good, imo.<p>Do you have a big contrast between your screen and your room?  That&#x27;s a big deal.  I run a blue light filter at night.<p>I do prefer eink and anything oled looks fantastic, but the fire looks really good, well beyond its $150 price tag.  Better than my computer monitors (which are nice).<p>Are you reading tiny, detailed print?  Is it just a resolution thing?<p>Lastly, are you getting older (40ish) and need reading glasses?  That happened to me when crossing 40.  I could still focus sharply at reading&#x2F;screen distance, but I got tired.  I went through that a couple years and got reading glasses -- actually just weaker versions of my nearsighted glasses.  I had the doctor dial in the focal distance for screen distance, then got another pair for 12 inches are so (for a reading a book up close).<p>So I have three pairs of glasses, one for distance (everything sharp from 3 feet outward).  These strain my eyes from 3 feet inward.  You don&#x27;t need reading glasses if your arms are long enough...<p>I have computer classes dialed in at roughly 28 inches.  I can read up close, and see <i>nearly</i> perfectly at distance.  I&#x27;m probably 20&#x2F;20 at distance, but with my regular prescription I&#x27;m around 20&#x2F;10.<p>Then the reading glasses for up close things.  These are fine for computer as well, and just slightly more blurry at distance.')
