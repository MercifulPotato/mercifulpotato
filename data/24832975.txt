There are many excellent GUI based applications.  The lack of game development has little to do with the vision of an auteur.  Game development simply depends upon a rapid development cycle and hasn&#x27;t fared well with the more iterative approach of open source software.  Open source software is often more radical than boring given the freedom to experiment with ideas.  There are also plenty of people packaging it up nicely to provide the best possible user experience.  Quite frankly, the user experience from a competently managed Linux distribution is better in most respects than its biggest competitor.<p>The lack of adoption of open source likely has two sources: first is that it doesn&#x27;t have the marketing muscle of the commercial alternatives.  Heck, most people are blissfully unaware that they are using open source software or software with major open source components.  The second is that the open source world is more accessible to people with a deep interest in technology.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how friendly the software is when you actually have to discover what is available then decide upon what reflects your needs.')
