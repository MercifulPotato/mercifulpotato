I helped them set up the app, configured their communick accounts, made a few video calls to ensure it was working, etc. Current step is to help my wife to do the same with her friends. Slowly but steadily, we are moving our communication network away from WhatsApp and into Matrix.<p>Each one that we move makes WhatsApp less &quot;critical&quot; and makes us more free from monopolistic assholes. We don&#x27;t need the Government to control any of that, in fact I believe that waiting for the government to do anything is not going to achieve anything.')
