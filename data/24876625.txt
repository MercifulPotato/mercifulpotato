Perhaps the real policy move is term limits + enough UBI that the lame ducks are truly safe no matter what.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sortition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sortition</a> is a neat idea which is like term limits but on steroids: you&#x27;re as suddenly on the job as you are suddenly off it. I think this example, with the heightened stakes &#x2F; wider Overton window, makes for the more interesting debate.')
