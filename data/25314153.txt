Interest rates far higher despite an incredibly low rate environment.<p>But.  The repayment thresholds and the loan forgiveness period do massively reduce the onerousness, especially on those in lower paid roles who would otherwise never repay.  My main complaint about the system is really how it drags on the middle.<p>The successful graduates pay off their loans in 6-7 years, or less.  If you&#x27;re earning 40-50k, you&#x27;ll take more like 20 years to pay off the loan which feels like a long hard slog.  I still think graduate tax would have been the right call.')
