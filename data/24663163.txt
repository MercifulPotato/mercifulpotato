I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, &quot;Here&#x27;s my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you&#x27;re doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you&#x27;re not a bad person, if you&#x27;re doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide.&quot; Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.&quot;\nGlenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED Talk<p>&quot;[...] But saying that you don&#x27;t need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is to assume that no one should have, or could have, to hide anything -- including their immigration status, unemployment history, financial history, and health records. You&#x27;re assuming that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about their religious beliefs, political affiliations, and sexual activities, as casually as some choose to reveal their movie and music tastes and reading preferences.&quot;\nEdward Snowden in Permanent Record')
