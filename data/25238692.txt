Since the subsequent links are over-provisioned, if the sum of the input rates exceeds the output rate, some packets may need to be dropped.<p>good or ill - the solution is to put a controller on the sender that examines the traffic statistics and tries to adapt its sending rate so as not to overflow the network capacity.<p>since everyone is doing this, we also kind of want to make sure that everyone sharing an output link adapts to something close to a fraction of that bandwidth divided by the total number of TCP flows. this is fairness.<p>without getting into the highly involved details you can already see that this is a really interesting control&#x2F;game  theory problem.<p>I find it particularly weird, astounding even, that this situation is really quite ideal for a tragedy of the commons. except there is no tragedy. everyone can cheat, but almost no one does. sure - you&#x27;d have to recompile your kernel, but anyone could ship &#x27;network turbocharger 2.0&#x27; that forces all the other TCPs on the network to back off and allocate as much intermediate bandwidth as you like.<p>a very easy way to do this as Netscape discovered is to use multiple connections. the pieces are all the same size, but you can take as many as you like.<p>obviously that situation degenerates very quickly. but it hasn&#x27;t. and it leaves the designers of wide area services that don&#x27;t just use one TCP connection quite at a loss about how much bandwidth they should take.<p>as far as the survey goes, I can think of all sorts of reasons why the IETF would care. one reason is that uptake of new work is pretty hard - and has killed lots of great protocol work. I&#x27;m pretty surprised that BBR has such rapid uptake - the technical situation remains a little unclear.<p>for me the interesting part is the discussion of the measurement technique')
