It doesn&#x27;t store files, proxy to the internet, run a web server, etc. All it does is anonymously connect standard servers and clients.<p>Freenet on the other hand is an anonymous content distribution system. You can&#x27;t use it to connect arbitrary network services together, it&#x27;s only good for storing and retrieving files. Nodes on Freenet each store encrypted pieces of data but it&#x27;s computationally hard to figure out what data a particular node is storing unless you have the key to access it. Files are prioritized based on popularity so old files that no one has accessed in a while and the original host is gone can just be lost forever. It&#x27;s similar in some ways to bittorrent swarms. Over time as a torrent becomes less and less popular you&#x27;re likely to run into issues finding a seeder that&#x27;s still around.')
