All of those options still exist. So the modern state of things hasn&#x27;t <i>removed</i> anything.<p>Since the age of the Internet, cloud providers have the same power as any other hosting provider: Geocities, Angelfire, AOL, whatever; they all have acceptable use policies that will get you taken down if you don&#x27;t obey them. Outside of those, colocation and network providers seem a bit more willing to tolerate things, but they can still cut you off, just like they (sometimes) did in the good old days. And you can still go full-on backbone peer, if you can afford it, which these political groups certainly can.<p>The bottom line is, you have your old options and you can still host yourself. You have options in between, but if they decide you aren&#x27;t playing nice, they can hurt you.<p>The only thing &quot;exceptional&quot; here is the nature and vocality of the groups in question.')
