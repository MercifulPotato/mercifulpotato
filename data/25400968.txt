I distro shopped a lot around ~2006, settled on Ubuntu then moved to Debian for project philosophy reasons. It&#x27;s great because I haven&#x27;t had to think about &quot;how do I install this again?&quot;. Same web page, same link to netinstall image, same prompts to install.<p>It&#x27;s fun to try other things like NixOS and GuixSD, but also have the warm blanket of &quot;just put Debian on it&quot; to fall back to.')
