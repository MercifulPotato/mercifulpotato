This guy fundamentally doesn&#x27;t seem to understand what an index is. The S&amp;P 500 doesn&#x27;t (well, shouldn&#x27;t) make value judgments about the quality of the companies in it. It&#x27;s just the 500 largest companies on US exchanges. That&#x27;s what people who use it want.<p>Really, the big problem here was that it wasn&#x27;t already included on the S&amp;P 500 years ago, so that all of the gains leading up to this point could have been shared with passive investors. It&#x27;s satisfied the market cap requirement for awhile, but not the profitability requirement, which clearly didn&#x27;t work well in this case.')
