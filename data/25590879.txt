From that, I&#x27;ll try to find synonyms for my product &#x2F; service and combine them in a two-word way (Face-Book, You-Tube, Linked-In, Hacker-News, Duo-Lingo, Snap-Chat, Drop-Box, ...). If nothing comes to my mind after a lot of tries, I stick with a &quot;meaningless&quot; name, or simply something that is not directly correlated with the product itself (Uber, Waze, Dell, F5, Amazon, Apple).<p>You can also try with word alterations such as Lift &gt; Lyft, Scribble &gt; Skribbl, Domainer &gt; Domainr, Engine X &gt; nginx.<p>Best of luck!')
