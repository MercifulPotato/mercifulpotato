I suppose Wodehousian or Jane Austen-style comedies of manners set on Shipboard probably weren&#x27;t really his forte.<p>Plus, presumably an all-seeing Ship AI probably wouldn&#x27;t permit the atrocities required to drive most Iain M Banks (or, for that matter, Iain Banks) plots. A would-be molester or rapist on Shipboard would presumably get his brainstem lightly zorched by the ship&#x27;s effector before he got too close a victim, depriving Banks the opportunity to write a vivid description of the act, and the subsequent opportunity to write about the Bad Person getting incinerated, shot, torn apart by hundreds of tiny drones, etc. etc.<p>I enjoyed that vignette where everyone on board some ship are getting the common cold for <i>fun</i>.<p>I didn&#x27;t particularly find the writing in Colin Greenlund&#x27;s &quot;Take Back Plenty&quot; that interesting, but it was fascinating reading space opera in that general genre that wasn&#x27;t violence-driven.')
