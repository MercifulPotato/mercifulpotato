Usually these projects are big and it&#x27;s just too much work up front to implement a tiny feature which you don&#x27;t even know if it will be accepted upstream. I&#x27;d rather spend that time working on my own pet projects.<p>I happen to have a project that is fairly successful and all of the substantial contributions are from _big_ companies (think Google, Uber, Airbnb, etc) who have the cash to pay their employees for days or weeks of OSS contributions. Independent private&#x2F;free-time contributors only make small changes despite the project being quite small.<p>A very interesting thing is that there is one contributor of my projects who appears to make a huge number of very simple pull-requests to a wide variety (literally hundreds) of projects. Things like fixing typos, dependency updates, and so on but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a bot, so I have been wondering why he is doing this.')
