Right? I can agree with that.<p>The hidden assumption is that if HFT hadn&#x27;t done that, then something else would have come along to drive those numbers down, but not as far. If so, then the benefit to the rest of us would have been much the same as it actually is.<p>You may be right, but I don&#x27;t see what that &quot;something else&quot; could be. It would have to be something where some actor benefits from quick reaction and low spread, right? AFAICT, that must be either HFT or something indistinguishable from HFT. Something with the same traits, blamed by the same people for the same reasons.')
