The script your write <i>is</i> the operating system.<p>Think: relatively simple, dedicated, repeatable applications (if&#x2F;then scenarios)<p>Controlling lights in your house, simple robotic behaviors (sensor I&#x2F;O and motor control, nothing ML related), or reading&#x2F;displaying sensor data (temperature, light, etc), are common applications for microcontrollers.<p>There isn&#x27;t enough onboard memory to run anything too complex like an OS. If that is the route you want to go, the Pi Zero might be more suitable for an entry-level board that can handle a Linux kernel.')
