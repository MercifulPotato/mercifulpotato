That&#x27;s fine for trivial stuff, but for real work you really owe it to yourself (and society at large) to use a build system which can correctly build things.<p>Some examples applying to the above:<p>- if your paths have white space in them, you are generally fucked<p>- if your change your Makefile, nothing will be rebuilt<p>- if inkscape writes out a partial file because full disk and you fix the problem, the partial svg will no be rebuilt<p>- if you install a new version of inkscape nothing will be rebuilt')
