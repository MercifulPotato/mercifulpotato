I forget who they partnered with. I think Ford and Rivian have a &quot;skateboard&quot; they can use which is self-conatained. I&#x27;m guessing that one might not be super repairable, but might not have the same restrictions that Tesla does. I think GM is with Lordstown Motors. Not sure on their implementation.<p>I think price is the big issue. The batteries and motors are expensive in a variable cost way. Most of the  features use relatively inexpensive sensors or components and have low variable cost. So a consumer sees all these features as justifying the high cost. Removing those features probably wont make it much cheaper (unless maybe you&#x27;re a separate company that doesn&#x27;t develop&#x2F;engineer those features at all).')
