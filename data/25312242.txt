You probably can influence the company a lot more than you think. Don&#x27;t play the victim card; roll up your sleeves and start building the culture you want to work in. If you&#x27;re a co-founder, that&#x27;s your job anyway. If you&#x27;re an early employee, you have the credibility and visibility, and people will follow your lead.<p>2) Establish well-being as one of your core values. Given you already had an exit, I&#x27;d imagine you&#x27;re past the ramen-profitable stage, so your focus now should be on scaling fast, and building a sustainable long-term strategy. Long work hours, burnout and a toxic environment are sure ways to crash a company.<p>3) Give yourself a deadline, and work your ass off till then. If you&#x27;re proud of the work you did to help turn things around and <i>still</i> wasn&#x27;t able to make a dent, then it&#x27;s time to move on, and with your head up. If you can&#x27;t change how the company operates, you can always change who do you work for.<p>OTOH, if you don&#x27;t love the job enough, OR if you don&#x27;t have the energy to do #1 and #2, then I&#x27;d suggest you quit or take an unpaid leave of absence, and use the time to disconnect and recharge. You have plenty of runway, so you can afford to take a sabbatical. If you want to keep yourself intellectually challenged you may want to go back to school or something (given travelling the world is unfortunately not an option right now).<p>Last, but most important of all: seek help. Don&#x27;t underestimate the impact of burnout, and assume it&#x27;ll go away one day. It&#x27;s serious, and may have long-lasting impact if you don&#x27;t pay attention, and address the root-cause. Nothing is more important than your mental health. Feel free to ping me if you need a stranger to chat.')
