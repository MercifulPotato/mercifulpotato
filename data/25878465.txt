I suppose suspending Trump&#x27;s account qualifies as &quot;anti-left&quot; these days. Zuckerberg openly stating he supported Black Lives Matter? Anti-left. Facebook deleting PragerU content for &quot;hate speech&quot; before getting reprimaneded? Anti-left. Zuckerberg personally assisting Pete Buttigieg around primary season? ANTI LEFT, I SAY! DIDN&#x27;T YOU HEAR HE SAT AT A DINNER TABLE WITH CONSERVATIVES? HE&#x27;S ANTI-LEFT!<p>Both Conservatives and Liberals claim Facebook is biased towards the other side, so you&#x27;re going to have to do a hell of a lot better, and produce some actual, bonafide evidence their &quot;incentive structure is anti-left&quot; besides witchhunting and saying one of their upper middle-managers is a hardcore republican.<p>Care to let us know about the political leanings of Sheryl Sandberg and Chris Cox, who are actually in the C-Suite?  Or would you prefer to cherry pick someone in upper middle management who is a staunch republican, which according to you seems to be some kind of heinous crime. Not to mention you&#x27;re cherry-picking someone who reports to someone who reports to someone etc... who reports to Sheryl Sandberg (COO).')
