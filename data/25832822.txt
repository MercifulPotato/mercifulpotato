It would be more interesting to freeze the system, change a constant and see how it would&#x27;ve propagated from boot to present, and to apply the patch (not that the operator would care about preserving their sims). I suppose in a different universe, a stronger gravity could&#x27;ve meant an ancestor hit the ground a bit harder when s&#x2F;he fell off a roof and didn&#x27;t survive, so I might not even be here.')
