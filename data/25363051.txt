For instance, Gladwell. Study after referenced study to support his theory, but rarely if ever a counter point.<p>Confirmation bias gone wild. Which in this day and age is understandable. It&#x27;s the norm. What&#x27;s disheartening is how this approach gets passed off - and generally accepted - as expertise.')
