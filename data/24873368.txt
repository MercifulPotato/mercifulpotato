Rents for low end 1 bedroom apartments in Mountain View seem to be down about 20% from a year ago. The apartment I left is still vacant a month on despite being listed much lower than what I was paying. I don&#x27;t think a mere tens of thousands of new units accounts for a drop in rents that seems to be nearly unprecedented in both magnitude and geographic scope.')
