I have no idea to this day how macs became the premier development environment.</i><p>Because:<p>(a) it&#x27;s quite easy to set things up with brew, macports, and&#x2F;or Nix<p>(b) because Python is shitty everywhere anyway, and Python isn&#x27;t the be-all end-all of development work.<p>(c) because you get a full-featured, working, coherent, take-it-or-leave-it desktop that stops one way of endless tinkering and procrastinating available in Linux to get things &quot;just right&quot;<p>(d) because it&#x27;s still a UNIX with a full support for unicy tools, not a hack like WSL or WSL2.<p>(e) because it has good hardware (mostly - BS keyboard-era aside) and good resale value<p>(f) because you get to enjoy most&#x2F;all the proprietary tools you like too (from MS Office and Adobe Creative Suite, to whatever)<p>(g) because in 2020 Docker, remote environments, etc, make many &quot;local dev environment&quot; points moot anyway')
