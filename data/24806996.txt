From a young age, it became apparent that I did&#x27;t experience jealousy in relation to a deep interest having close friends including ex&#x27;s or infatuation clicks with other people. Not some sort of low self-worth thing, but the opposite. Therefore, mutually open relationships work better for me to dispense with dishonesty and limitations based on insecurities. Not in my face if it&#x27;s with a dude, don&#x27;t get pregnant, or diseases, and I don&#x27;t care. Heck, I think it&#x27;s extremely cute when a bi&#x2F;pan woman I&#x27;m seeing hits on another woman, even right in front of me. Also, it&#x27;s exhilarating when she feeds me her cool friends like proverbial bow-wrapped gifts, such as a row of lined-up puppy-dog eyes looking up as who will be chosen next. This makes her a potential keeper#.<p>Partner guarding seems like a lot of pointless energy expended based on insecurity; one of my aims in relationship(s) is to constantly improve to remain the highest-value around without resorting to possessive capture. Plus, it&#x27;s better to let people move freely and self-select voluntarily, rather than give them ultimatums or threatening &quot;if you ever&quot; speeches.<p>I look at importance of relationships (love&#x2F;friendship) based on the amount and sustainment of attention, mutual care, support, and trust. Sex is just sex to me without deeper affinity and common interests; a shared, social activity that is delightful without being black-and-white all-meaningful. It&#x27;s also important to be sure other participants are truly on this same wavelength so that they don&#x27;t end-up regretful or are otherwise left worse than before.<p>In conclusion: open works best for me, with a consideration for Mff or Mfff poly where f are pan&#x2F;bi. I think Mfff tetrad of ever-reconfiguring pairs is more stable because there&#x27;s no third-wheel issue. And all disagreements must be followed by bedroom activities, and stalemate disputes are resolved by last one who gets there wins.<p># Keeper<p>1. You trust them with your life<p>2.
