The dark grey and orange skies would all come out looking blue or something. It&#x27;s like the &#x27;camera&#x27; is telling me I&#x27;m f&#x27;ing crazy for taking a picture of smoky skies, and surely I want to pretend the smoke isn&#x27;t there at all! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m taking a picture right? So I can pretend that reality isn&#x27;t real. I have no photos that match the smoke. I have only my memory and other people&#x27;s photos. WTF.<p>That was due to automatic white balance, which is perhaps the most basic and low-tech automatic adjustment on your phone. We&#x27;re talking deep AI tech from the 90s, if not earlier.<p>I ran into the same problem on that day, so I googled &quot;iphone manual white balance&quot;, got an app that looked decent (Obscura), and took my pictures without issue. Try that next time. (But get another app, Obscura literally takes half a minute to load for some reason.)')
