Item(by='FabHK', descendants=None, kids=[25889590], score=None, time=1611456859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888160, text='&gt; I recommend expanding your understanding of the world beyond your coddled first-world perspective.<p>That comment doesn&#x27;t enumerate or even alludes to any tangible benefits of crypto currencies. (It&#x27;s about the benefit of mesh networks during HK protests when internet was shut down, and the supposed resiliency of the &quot;Bitcoin network&quot;).<p>&gt; Then I suggest you learn something about what liquidity, bid-ask spreads, arbitrage, and price discovery are, and how financial systems work in general.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure GP has heard of those.<p>Whether HFT provides any benefit in terms of liquidity and smaller spreads is by no means clear. HFT is certainly  neither necessary nor even contributing to price discovery. I submit that the economy would work just fine with a price auction every minute (maybe with stochastic cut-off) for, say, 3 hours a day; and maybe even a bit better, because all the HFT guys would have to do something else, which would most likely be more productive.')
