I guess they have to &quot;pinky swear&quot; they&#x27;ll only lookup people with their consent, but there was nothing technically preventing them from looking up anyone.<p>On a similar note, I had a UK credit referencing agency salesman contact me and try to sell me their product; as part of the sales pitch he gave me credentials to their web UI and encouraged me to try it out; on there I saw their other leads&#x27; credit reports (including mine, which was empty as expected) and their trial attempts at looking up other companies, and had the possibility to look up any company or individual as long as I pinky-promised I had their consent, and even if I did have their consent, that data would still be exposed to anyone else having access to this demo account.')
