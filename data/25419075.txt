I have a hyperhidrosis issue (excessively sweaty hands) that compounds the situation.<p>I feel like homes and offices do not breath. My anecdotal napkin math would say like 10% of buildings are designed with proper ventilation, blending of outdoor&#x2F;indoor air, etc... and the rest are just boxes that are slowly killing us.<p>The furnace is below me which is good and bad in that it warms my office quick but sorta too much. I am constantly battling too hot or too cold and of course the humidity. Lots of trial&#x2F;error of opening various windows to get a cross flow without letting too much hot air out.<p>That is just temperature. I have a CO2 monitor that has been interesting. I try to keep my CO2 ppm below 800 foor good measure. For a while I was feeling like dogshit in here and I assume it is due to being literally directly above a gas furnace in an older single family home - in hindsight I wish I had a monitor that detected more gases.<p>Anyway, still figuring out the secret to this. If anyone has tips for a glove that would work to keep my hands warm while typing I would love a recommendation. The article focuses on wearing clothing that will keep your trunk and limbs warm but I find that my hands are always an issue.')
