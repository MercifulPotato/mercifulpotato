The article&#x27;s main argument is wrong and dangerous to an extent! A software engineer&#x27;s productivity depends on the quality of his thinking that goes on between his two ears - not on the number of lines of code (LOC), number of commits and some other meaningless measure. I don&#x27;t think the author knows&#x2F;understands what it takes to operate at a Senior&#x2F;Staff level and beyond. Yeah, may be for someone just out of school productivity can be measured in terms of lines of code. OTOH, if a Principle Engineer in the team comes to me and says that he feels great just because he added 500 commits&#x2F;30k lines of new code to the code base I will just say one thing: &quot;run for your life&quot;! as soon as possible.')
