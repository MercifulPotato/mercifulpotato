Yes I think they are a lie for now, they’ve been shown to be dishonest.  If a Tuatara owner wants to post specs that weren’t measured with the help of SSC, then I might believe them.  But so far the independent analysis points to the car not going that fast.<p>This wasn’t an “editing” error where the framerate of the video accidentally was slowed down, it wasn’t a GPS calibration error, it was a company being caught in a lie.  It happens from time to time, especially in motorsport.<p>Edit: to clarify, it’s not on me to prove that the car isn’t the fastest in the world.  It’s on SSC, which is making the claim, to prove it.  That their first attempt has been debunked means they will be given more scrutiny the next time around, and I’m not confident that they will do it.  Because if this was just an editing error, why don’t they just go back to their footage and show us the real stuff?  Did it conveniently get deleted?')
