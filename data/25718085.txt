The middle ground is better than the extremes.<p>I&#x27;ve actually long wondered if this is true.<p>Freedom of movement obviously works at the city level, up to 1 million or so. It obviously works at the megacity level, up to 10 million. It obviously works at the individual state&#x2F;province level up to 40+ million. It obviously works at US scale (350M). It obviously works at EU scale, 800 million. It obviously works at India&#x27;s scale, 1.3 billion people.<p>Why is it that if you tried to open the border literally any wider than it is right now, it would all fall down?<p>It&#x27;s never made sense to me.<p>There are huge disparities in wealth and income within America, right? America&#x27;s poorest state has a median income of 45K (Mississippi) and it&#x27;s richest state has a median income of 80K (Maryland). Why doesn&#x27;t everyone just move to Maryland? Or better yet just move to San Francisco (median 112K). Obviously there&#x27;s factors other than economics keeping people in place.')
