First and foremost, this wasn&#x27;t just a moral failing, this was a major professional violation, regardless of any government incentives. They put patients in unnecessary risk of complications and likely caused harm in some cases, in direct violation of the one of the most important oaths in any profession. It is the job of healthcare professionals to cater to the health of their patients, not their billing departments.<p>You can&#x27;t write all laws like we&#x27;re living in a Mad Max dystopia - some laws will need to assume that other laws are functioning correctly in order to be practically implementable as a law - just like software has dependencies that must uphold some invariants for the interface to work. The issue isn&#x27;t subsidizing healthcare, it&#x27;s unethical professionals abusing our trust.')
