On the other hand, I haven&#x27;t been able to get comfortable with Elixir. It&#x27;s a significantly larger language, which comes with higher complexity (but also lets you write code at a higher level of abstraction). I often found myself only half-understanding the code I was writing (and I always make an effort to fully understand what I&#x27;m doing).<p>And personally I find the Elixir syntax to be among the most confusing and inconsistent (especially when compared to Erlang).<p>Nevertheless, if I was making something web related, I would definitely go for Elixir (because of Phoenix). If I was making something lower-level, I would probably consider both options.')
