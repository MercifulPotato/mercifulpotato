In a single household it wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily need to be an <i>extra</i> television, unless it&#x27;s some kind of truly abusive household where the kid&#x27;s not allowed to pre-empt the family TV to attend school.<p>Of course, in a multi-kid household, yes - one screen per kid would be needed.<p><pre><code>    plus they&#x27;ll need a separate webcam \n</code></pre>\nYes. Though, I&#x27;d be shocked if drivers were much of a hassle.<p><pre><code>    This new Pi form factor is kinda clever but surely a\n    $200-$300 chromebook or tablet is still significantly \n    more accessible.\n</code></pre>\nSurely, but is the extra <i>money</i> more accessible?<p><pre><code>    And how does a desktop enable more advanced STEM learning \n    than a laptop? \n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not the form factor. It&#x27;s the OS. A fully-open OS, versus a locked-down OS.<p>Of course, whether or not this matters depends on the kid and the curriculum. If all the kid&#x27;s doing is some web-based online curriculum whose needs are perfectly serviced by a Chromebook, then yeah - an RPi device isn&#x27;t magically going to grant them magical STEM learning powers by osmosis.')
