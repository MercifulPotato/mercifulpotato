It becomes tedious.<p>1) I don&#x27;t care what Rothbard became in the end. It is completely irrelevant. Rothbard&#x27;s critique of the state is an interesting perspective and some of them seem particularly apt when the leviathan of government is eroding people&#x27;s rights because of COVID.<p>2) As for the Hoppe quote. The &quot;neo-reactionary&quot; you mention can be counted on one hand. The activist left (which is why that quote is on wikipedia in the first place) will take quotes and call someone alt-right based on one spicy paragraph in a book (which is exactly the trick you&#x27;ve tried here and I am not that naive to fall for it).<p>I haven&#x27;t read &quot;Democracy the God that failed&quot; (yet) and I will decide for myself once I&#x27;ve read the book. I very much doubt it is a <i>new feudalism</i> and I very much doubt you&#x27;ve read the book either.<p>From watching him speaking. Hoppe&#x27;s construction seems to be that given the choice between King and a Politician, a King would be better. His rationale for this is sound IMO. The most important part of it (for me) is a King will care about his legacy and a politician typically won&#x27;t.<p>My own feelings is that I&#x27;ve never thought that democracy is effective or desirable. I&#x27;ve found the act of voting to be completely pointless due to the fact I have nobody to vote for in the UK that represents my interests of decreasing the state.<p>The only time when voting is effectives is during referendums when it is a single issue. Even then it isn&#x27;t effective The UK&#x27;s politicians and press did everything they could to deny the referedum result (and are still doing so btw).<p>I have heard arguments that the whole idea of democracy itself has been perverted during the enlightenment of those putting a Christian&#x2F;Individualist perspective on Athenian ideas. But I won&#x27;t pretend to know the argument well enough to have any opinion either way on it.')
