And they&#x27;re kind of way more fundamental to the basic interactions than your idea of adding video calls.<p>- User authentication, preferably via some semi-standardized form of single-signon (e.g. SAML, or maybe OAuth).<p>- Users being able to receive messages even when all their devices are offline.<p>- Users being able to connect from multiple clients at the same time, with good UX. With IRC, people doing that will have to have a separate nick for each client they connect from. And people who want to @ them or &#x2F;msg them will need to know which of the near-duplicate nicks to actually choose. Choose poorly, and your message might be sent to a device where it won&#x27;t be read for hours even though the recipient really is actively online.<p>- State sync across the clients. If I&#x27;ve read some specific messages on one client, they should not show up as unread on my other clients.<p>- A consistent user experience. In IRC there&#x27;s no reliable cross-client way of tagging a message for the attention of some set of users. Sure, clients will do various levels of nick highlighting. But the exact patterns will vary between clients, and the sender can&#x27;t even know whether they got the format right since the decision on the highlighting happens purely on the receiver&#x27;s end.<p>And that&#x27;s not even getting into the things that IRC can reasonably do, but that are incredibly kludgy. Say history search in a channel. No organization wants to run channel logging bots, and no normal user wants to go to a totally separate service to do a search.')
