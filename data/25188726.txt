It&#x27;s complexity really only scales with the complexity of the system you&#x27;re running on it. If you&#x27;re just bringing up a database and a backend on top of it, it&#x27;s honestly very simple to get running on a single linux box using something like microk8s. And, as a benefit, you can move everything over to EKS or GKE in like a few hours max, if you ever need to scale.')
