But it&#x27;d be both frustrating and bizarre if I insisted on redirecting every conversation to burritos. Burritos are great, sure, but sometimes they&#x27;re just not what we&#x27;re talking about!<p>That&#x27;s about my feelings towards (partisan) politics. I totally understand the impulse towards politics; I have a preferred political camp too, and I think it&#x27;d be great if they achieved more power and influence. But I don&#x27;t think my camp is so important that it ought to go around intruding on every discussion in the world.')
