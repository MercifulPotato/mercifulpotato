Item(by='tthhrroowwaway', descendants=None, kids=[25600849], score=None, time=1609473308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597892, text='&gt; I worked with a POC who the CEO told me point blank to give them extra leniency with regards to them not performing their duties (an ongoing complaint of mine) because a &quot;diverse face&quot; on the pitch deck helped us raise money.<p>So, it sounds like the CEO is using this person of color in order to earn a certain credibility and get more money from investors.<p>And, maybe this person of color is either, a) working hard, but not very experienced yet&#x2F;able to complete their tasks. Or, they are wrongfully neglecting their duties&#x2F;have no interest in doing their job. Or, some other nuanced situation, I don&#x27;t know. You believe they are benefiting though.<p>But either way, exactly what is your point? To be honest, reading this, it seems like you are biased against people of color, and you view this situation as evidence that all people of color do not work hard&#x2F;are given unfair advantages in life, and therefore, your bias is warranted. In other words, you appear to believe in a common racist trope. To you, it is true, based on this story.<p>Or, you are not biased against people of color, and simply think it unfair that this person, regardless of their ethnicity, is being given a free pass on not doing their work. If the latter, isn&#x27;t your CEO partly in the wrong here? They are capitalizing on the identity of this person of color, which shouldn&#x27;t matter, by your logic.')
