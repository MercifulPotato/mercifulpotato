At that price point you&#x27;re largely paying for the land.  Cheap structures (which abound in Tahoe) can be built for ~$250K, while even a really fancy 4000+ square foot mansion in Los Altos can be built for &lt; $1M.  Most of the mid-level FAANG employees and ex-startup&#x2F;growth folks easily have that much in liquid assets.')
