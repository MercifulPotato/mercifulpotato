I always tell them, you wont do it. They attended the right school, joined the right firm, attained that corner office. As a founder they would give up all that, and their family and friends will tell them that they&#x27;ve made a massive mistake, for years, while it appears that nothing is happening.<p>&gt; Then they sheepishly admit that this is true.<p>That might be less about agreement and more about politely getting the guy who&#x27;s being deliberately discouraging to shut up.')
