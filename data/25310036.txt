It diverts a lot of money into certain startups and makes for good Marketing and PR, but I&#x27;ve had impossible burgers and never really wanted to try it again as its something that never stood out as a better product. Burgers are such low hanging fruit, too; try making a stroganoff from tempe or seitan, its horrible if you&#x27;ve ever had the real thing.<p>I can tell you you right now that Livestock Ag has a critical role that cannot be displaced when done correctly, ironically to be able to maintain soil viability in fields where heavy feeding crops like tomatoes, or brassicas have to be rotated with to maintain viable yields for organic and biodynammic farms. Something these vegans and vegetarians are entirely oblivious about since most have never worked a day on a farm in their life, yet think they&#x27;re &#x27;part of the solution.&#x27;<p>Lab grown meat is just another one of those panacea sounding things you&#x27;d expect would be the norm in the 21st century, like a flying car, but are entirely impractical and only used to divert resources from more impactful things, like Farmer Education outreach that tells them about the monetary gains to be had from growing sustainably&#x2F;organically and using seaweed in their feed to offset CH4 emission, and how to build sheds&#x2F;barns to use that for syngas production and compost.<p>Eat Just has raised $220 million since its inception [0], just think about the amount of progress towards those ends we could have made with just the funds that one startup has raised.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agfundernews.com&#x2F;singapore-grants-eat-just-worlds-first-regulatory-approval-for-lab-grown-meat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agfundernews.com&#x2F;singapore-grants-eat-just-worlds-fi...</a>')
