Anyone can build a computer with off the shelf parts that has the absolute maximum specs that any vendor can produce. Anytime a new workstation makes the news (see Apple&#x27;s latest workstation), the &quot;PC Master race&quot; gang is quick to point out that they can build the same system without the Apple&#x2F;HP&#x2F;Dell&#x2F;Lenovo tax. What they somehow always forget about is that, if I&#x27;m an ITDM and I need 100 or even 1000 systems and they need to be configured, validated and ready to deploy from day one, custom built computers aren&#x27;t feasible in any sense of the word. The value add from workstation companies is a mix of scale, availability, validity and uniformity.')
