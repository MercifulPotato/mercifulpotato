You&#x27;re going to hand code a lexer each time you need to parse a phone number or a zip code? If there was a better alternative we would be using it.<p><i>STOP PARSING WEB FORM INPUT</i>.  Please.  For the love of God just stop.<p>This is why emails of the form &quot;foo+bar@fakeaddress.myemail&quot; rarely work.  Somebody&#x27;s regex didn&#x27;t allow &quot;+&quot; and everybody copied it.  If you really need to check an email address, send a verification email to it.  It&#x27;s the only method that <i>actually works</i>.<p>Why are you <i>parsing</i> a phone number.  The user typed in a phone number, obey it.  Are you <i>sure</i> that you know <i>every</i> combination of valid phone number?<p>Zip code ... maybe ... if you are US only.  Otherwise a postcode can&#x27;t be parsed either.<p>And this is before we talk about the Cardinal Sin of using regexes as parsers.')
