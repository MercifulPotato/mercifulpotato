Item(by='jamesbyrdjr', descendants=None, kids=[25540840, 25540684, 25540898], score=None, time=1608941185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25539845, text='&gt; E Ink is a great example of how the patent system stifles innovation.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is an obvious fact. I don&#x27;t even see how this is a valid example.<p>&gt; every comment in this thread is looking forward to finally seeing some innovation in this space &quot;once the patents expire<p>It is telling, very telling that when asked, none of those comments are even able to describe which patent it is that is blocking &quot;innovation in this space&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the facts.<p>The physics of bistable displays is complex.\nMany have tried with very different technologies. Electrowetting. Interferometric. Other types of electrophoretic. Electrochemical.<p>The investors in all of these realized it was too expensive to get it to the finish line. Even Amazon decided to trash Liquavista.<p>The truth is that investors would rather invest in some new consumer internet service, or AI&#x2F;ML, which is a simpler problem that will give a quicker return on their money rather than try to create a bistable display solution.<p>If you go to SID, you&#x27;ll see that there&#x27;s tonnes of startups that try to solve the &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;color&quot; bistable display chalenge, and they all fail due to fundamental physics problems and burn out their funding. That&#x27;s also probably why E Ink isn&#x27;t able to get past their limitations.<p>I genuinely hope this helps people understand that this is not &quot;patent system stifles innovation&quot;.')
