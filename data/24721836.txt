And if you e.g. deploy to safety-related targets you even have to demonstrate that there is no &quot;dead code&quot; (e.g. DO-178). Of course it doesn&#x27;t matter for hobby or non-critical applications.<p>&gt; So application source code isn&#x27;t just text that can be saved in text files and versioned like other text files<p>In ST80 source code is just an external dump file; the actual configuration unit is the virtual image. Bootstrapping a virtual image from source code in ST80 is very difficult or nearly impossible.')
