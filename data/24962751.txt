Because that seems like your goal.<p>I&#x27;m trying to point out that if you follow your current path - including the name calling - then you won&#x27;t get very far, and I&#x27;ve pointed out some of how people will perceive you if your pieces continue in this vein.<p>Say &quot;Oops, yes, I somewhat underestimated the time and was thinking of a different New Deal project. Thanks for pointing it out!&quot;<p>I am dead serious that I believe the poor infrastructure of our existing water, power, and mass transit systems, and horridly unequal internet service, are far more important than shaving a few hours off a transcontinental passenger service.<p>I am also annoyed with using the huge number of small public works projects of the WPA (the largest being the TVA, which is quite large but much smaller than the Eisenhower interstate system), which was explicitly made to hire unemployed people, to justify a single large public work; and one which excludes the WPA support for artists, musicians, libraries, education programs and many others who are not construction workers or support staff.<p>Would it really affect your views or your ability to persuade were you to posit a 5 hour estimate instead of 4?<p>Airplane travel times have <i>decreased</i> over the decades because it&#x27;s more fuel efficient and therefore cheaper. You can&#x27;t simply predict that the future is going to faster than current estimates.')
