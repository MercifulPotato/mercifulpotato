If that happens then you must get a two thirds majority of states to agree on the proposal presented and it becomes a constitutional amendment.<p>The required majority to approve the output of the convention is 3&#x2F;4 of the states, not the same 2&#x2F;3 as to call the convention in the first place.<p>&gt; Entirely side stepping the federal government.<p>The entity that is required to call the convention once 2&#x2F;3 of the states have requested it is the federal Congress, so they are not entirely side stepped. But, it is true that they are not allowed to refuse to call the convention in this situation. There is nothing in the Constitution, any federal statute, or any court ruling that addresses what happens if Congress doess not do so.<p>&gt; This power hasn&#x27;t been used in a very long time<p>It&#x27;s never been used successfully, although it&#x27;s been attempted at least once by every state except Hawaii. (Some attempts were indirectly successful in achieving their goal, by spurring Congress to propose the desired amendments.)')
