Especially today, capital is highly abundant and dirt cheap. The markets are starved for yield  on any sort of fixed income product, especially when it&#x27;s secured by tangible assets with predictable cash flows. Every day the market sees new successful covenant-lite bond and loan sales raised with payback periods measured in decades.<p>The larger issue is that many municipalities explicitly enforce the local cable co&#x27;s monopoly. This takes the form of exclusive &quot;pole attachment&quot; contracts. The local governments took kickbacks from the first broadband company that came along. For a quick payday upfront, they screwed their constituents out of any sort of competitive marketplace.')
