Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608151692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446336, text='Furthermore, note that there really is a significant &quot;avoiding surgeries on birthdays&quot; effect: 2064 in 980,876 operations were done on a birthday, which is 1 in 475, rather than the 1 in 365 if there were no such effect.  That&#x27;s a reduction of 23%, which is <i>rather</i> suspicious given that we&#x27;re trying to explain a 23% increase in mortality rate.<p>So what mechanism is responsible for that reduction, and is it likely to affect surgeries differently based on how urgent and specialized (and therefore dangerous) they are?  Since the authors restricted it to surgeons that have done at least one surgery on their birthday, that rules out blanket &quot;never on birthday&quot; policies.  It seems like the only mechanism that <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> affect them differently is &quot;the surgeon is already on vacation in another country and <i>can&#x27;t</i> get here for the operation&quot; (and they choose to take vacations on their birthday more frequently).  One could probably check vacation-day records relatively easily...')
