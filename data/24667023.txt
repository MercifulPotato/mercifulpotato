Dynamic libraries can have multiple versions which can be installed in parallel. zlib hasn&#x27;t changed much lately, so there&#x27;s only really one version that matters, but this does come into play for other libraries. For example, LibUSB has libusb-0.1 and libusb-1.0, both of which are widely used.<p>librust-libz-sys-dev is a Debian package for a Rust library that&#x27;s literally called &quot;libz-sys&quot; [1]. Why the developers of this package decided to call it this and not &quot;zlib&quot; is a question for them, but Debian packages libraries based on the language&#x27;s own name for the package, not its own reinterpretation of those names.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;libz-sys" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;libz-sys</a>')
