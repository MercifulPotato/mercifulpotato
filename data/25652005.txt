Maybe you could argue that this flexibility arose because of the popularity it gained by being in the right place at the right time, but at this point the network-effect is not the only reason we use it. It has genuinely become a more powerful platform than the alternatives.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we couldn&#x27;t do better - the CSS API has a lot of warts and the DOM has performance issues if you don&#x27;t know how to avoid them - but I am saying we had decades to do better and didn&#x27;t, so there must be something very difficult about doing better and we shouldn&#x27;t discount the only thing that&#x27;s ever really succeeded.')
