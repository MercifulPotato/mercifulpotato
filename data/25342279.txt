Are you sure you didn&#x27;t read about this in a different book? If so, any idea where?<p><pre><code>  So, it was several days before I realized how bad\n  things really were. My face was swollen to the size of\n  a pumpkin, badly charred from being blowtorched.\n  Ol&#x27; Stan Bear came in and sat down. He said, &quot;Well,\n  Chuck, I&#x27;ve got good news and bad news. The good\n  news is that your lungs have not been permanently\n  damaged from inhaling flame and smoke, and your\n  eye looks normal. The bad news is I&#x27;m gonna have to\n  hurt you like you&#x27;ve never hurt before in your life to\n  keep you from being permanently disfigured. And\n  I&#x27;m gonna have to do it every four days.&quot;\n\n  I stayed in the hospital a month, and every four\n  days, Doc started from the middle of my face and\n  neck, scraping away the accumulated scab. It was a\n  new technique developed to avoid horrible crisscross\n  scars as the skin grew beneath the scabs. And it\n  worked beautifully. I have only a few scars on my\n  neck, but my face healed perfectly smooth. The pain,\n  though, was worse than any I have ever known.</code></pre>')
