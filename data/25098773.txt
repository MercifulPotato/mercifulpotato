That&#x27;s bizarre.<p>Hopefully, oil dependence will wane (it&#x27;s not going away though), and tensions will subside.<p>And FYI there&#x27;s a lot of social and civil progress throughout that part of the world, we don&#x27;t talk about it but the amount of access to education, information, awareness is shocking. The inter-generational divide in the ME is interesting.<p>Consider MBS murdering a journalist. 25 years ago - no problem. Today? It made the news, which means US politicians &#x27;have to care&#x27;, and because his hold on power is tenuous, it means repercussions. He probably won&#x27;t do it again.<p>Look at Jordan. They are quiet and &#x27;play nice&#x27; not for 40 years. Oman is not even on the radar.<p>The &#x27;odd ingredient&#x27; is Iran, because it&#x27;s hard to see where their endgame is, the regime they have there is inherently unstable.<p>Give it a few generations, it will settle down.')
