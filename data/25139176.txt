I was going through some old bookmarks and submitted dark.fail and it hit the dupe detector as a duplicate submission from October 2019 from user rakefire.<p>A few other links to different sites I tried submitting also hit the dupe detector too. Normally I do a hn.algolia.com search on the headline keywords (sorted by date) for anything current before submitting a link but after the third or fourth &#x27;dupe&#x27; I dug out the Standard Ebooks link, gritted my teeth and mentally dared the dupe detector to find someone else on HN that had come across the site before. Turns out many had (lol).<p>Your comment made me chuckle (and also scratch my head a little about the dupe-detector algorithm) so thanks for pointing it out (and have a +1 from me as thanks).')
