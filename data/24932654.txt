I thought it was more people being overly sensitive, and the enforcement team not using their brains. I think pindab0ter would agree that it was improper enforcement of the CoC. I&#x27;m not sure anybody can speak to the intentions of the people that reported it with certainty.<p>&gt; Well, if you dislike someone&#x27;s political views, and then you hatch a plan to make up fraudulent sexual misconduct allegations with the hope of &quot;canceling&quot; someone, I would describe that as &quot;weaponizing&quot; the CoC<p>Is that consistent with the thread? Are you arguing that the majority of CoC reports are outright lies? I thought this thread was about the use of CoC to enforce a code of behavior, and if stringent enforcement counts as misuse.')
