As a left-handed person with poor writing technique, writing continuously for a 3 hour exam caused me a fair amount of discomfort and pain, so i&#x27;d take a lot of breaks. So when my friends were leaving the exam 30 minutes early, having filled three booklets, I was staying to the very end - struggling to fill even one.<p>In nearly every example of this, I got (marginally) better grades than them.')
