Item(by='webmobdev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603662589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889249, text='&gt; I ask this with no malice: What makes people work on projects like this?<p>There is market for these kinds of phone. Check out the &quot;Classic Phone&quot; segment of Nokia - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nokia.com&#x2F;phones&#x2F;en_in&#x2F;classic-phones" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nokia.com&#x2F;phones&#x2F;en_in&#x2F;classic-phones</a> ... they&#x27;ve even recently released a 4g &quot;dumb&quot; phone.<p>Not everybody can afford a smartphone. And &quot;dumb&quot; phones like this provide the much needed mobility and connectivity to low-income group of our society (especially in a developing country like mine). Apart from this, the other reasons to consider these phones is the long battery life, and the less distractions they offer.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m willing to bet that the phone is bound to fail and their OS will be doomed to obscurity. How do the creators not see this?<p>Yes, the phone will fail. But not for the exact reasons you cited.<p>They will fail because they are targeting a niche market - people with good income who have chosen a minimalist lifestyle. And that&#x27;s why it is priced at the nonsensical price of $314 dollar (&quot;discounted&quot; from the &quot;original&quot; price of $369). The pricing makes no sense when you consider that Nokia offers 4g capable dumb phones for $40 to $48.')
