This is untenable of course<p>They could tax you by a percentage of each asset. At the end of the year, you might owe 31 bitcoins, 0.0125 acre of land, and a chicken.<p>Ironically, this is why money was invented in the first place -- an asset that <i>represents</i> value rather than having inherent value (such as, the inherent value of a chicken is one chicken).')
