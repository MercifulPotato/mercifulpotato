How does that work if you need email address to send email to the user? If only the client is able to decrypt the addess, you will basically have to wait until the user connects and gives <i>you</i> the email (which your presumably never store long-term, handling it like you&#x27;d handle credit card numbers). That severely limits what you can do with an address.<p>If you&#x27;re okay with being technically able to access email address, you&#x27;d probably better off with just straight encryption. That solves data leak protections, key rotation, backups, etc.<p>If you want some magic ID which is known only to the user and your servers will only use it to verify identity, then why not use just passwords with client-provided KDF parameters. Your machines will never know the plain data.')
