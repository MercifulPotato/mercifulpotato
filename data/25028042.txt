I don&#x27;t think internalized shame is the only motivation for equality. I think we all are born with a little bit of universal empathy and we shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to tap it. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of social justice that is motivated by the thrill of the attack more than simply achieving equality, and it easily falls away from the delicate balance they claimed to want at the start.')
