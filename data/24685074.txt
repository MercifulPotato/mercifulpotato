There are plenty of CI services supporting macOS. Looking at the pricing sheets of CircleCi, Github actions and TravisCI. CircleCI was only one listing lower maximum concurrent and varying cost based on machine size and type. Others only listed total minutes without differentiation between machines. As long as you are using it only for making builds and daily testing instead of anything compute intensive that takes long time, the prices should be reasonable. There are also free tiers for open source projects.<p>In my experience developing cross platform open source software, doing builds isn&#x27;t the biggest problem. The situations when you need to debug platform specific behaviour, integration with OS and verifying that your software is properly packaged for macOS is when you might want direct access to a  real machine.')
