There&#x27;s no reason for any moderation to take place.<p>Whereas on a web forum such as this, moderation is necessary for conversations to not descend into chaos.<p>Frankly I don&#x27;t understand why people think moderation has gone too far.  Is it that e.g. Twitter shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to silence unpopular opinions because silencing unpopular opinions is always bad?  Or is it that it&#x27;s bad because Twitter is huge and influential.  Would you have a problem with someone silencing a gun control fanatic who has appeared unwelcome on their private little gun collectors&#x27; website?')
