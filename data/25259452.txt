With some package tweaks I think they could double the ram to 32GB inside the package and leave the motherboard interface untouched.<p>I do wonder how many use cases actually need more then 32GB when you have a low latency NVMe flash with 5+ GB&#x2F;sec of bandwidth and relatively low latencies.  Especially with the special magic sauce that I&#x27;ve seen mentioned related to hardware acceleration for either compressing memory or maybe it was compressing swap.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m not expecting the top of the line for the next releases.  Step 1 is low end (mba, mbp13&quot;, and mini).  Step 2 is mid range, rumored to be a MBP 14.1&quot; and 16 in first half of 2021&quot;.  After that presumably the mac pro desktop and Imac&#x27;s &quot;within 2 years&quot;.  Maybe step #3 will be a dual socket version of step #2 with of course double the ram.')
