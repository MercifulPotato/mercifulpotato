I do not use a browser for pipelining; I wrote simple, custom utilities for generating HTTP.<p>The notion of &quot;HOL blocking&quot; as a &quot;problem&quot; relies on an assumption about the user.  Namely, that (a) the user is trying to load resources from multiple sources to display a webpage and (b) the order of the delivery of those resources does not matter.  I understand how this fits into Google&#x27;s business however this is not something I am trying to do.<p>Rather, I routinely download multiple resources from the <i>same source</i> and the order of delivery is important.  The simplest example is I am downloading 100 pages from a website; I want page one first and page 100 last, and I do not want page 2 before page 1 is finished.  I use pipelining to make 100 HTTP requests over a single TCP connection.  It is fast, efficient and has worked reliably for decades.^1<p>There was a time when server resources were important.  For example, opening 100 TCP connections to make 100 HTTP requests might be unduly burdensome on the server.  Not to mention each request might complete (or not complete) at a different time.  I might receive page 42 before page 21.  Then I have to check to make sure each page was received and order them after they all complete.  Relative to what I can do, easily, using HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining, this is a PITA.<p>HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining has more uses than what the designers of HTTP&#x2F;2 (Google) might envision.  The way I use HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining, for <i>information retrieval</i>, which only requires a TCP client, e.g., netcat, and a text editor (cf. a third party HTTP&#x2F;2 library), does not have a &quot;HOL blocking problem&quot;.<p>HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining is not &quot;useless&quot; simply because it does not fit a particular use case involving browsers, internet advertising and commercialisation of the www by those organisations who control browsers and the internet advertising market (and pitch the things they develop in-house like HTTP&#x2F;2 as &quot;standards&quot;).<p>1. It is common when the topic of discussion occasionally turns to HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining to see the follwing factoid repeated: &quot;No browsers have it enabled&quot;.  There is another factoid we should repeat: &quot;All web servers  have it enabled&quot;.  (This is why I have been using it for so long.)  In both cases there may be exceptions.  There could be a browser that has pipelining enabled and there are some websites, a very small minority, that have pipelining disabled.')
