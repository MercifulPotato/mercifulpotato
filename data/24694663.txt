What is it that Trello or JIRA cannot track that you are offering?<p>I looked at the product and it appears like you can track which feedback (whether product or employee) is bubbling up based on popular vote.<p>How do you offer to track users? Do you expect me to make my board public for collecting feedback or something else?<p>BTW, you had a great milestone. As someone in infancy of building my product, $1MM ARR souunds really good.<p>Now, to add to what other users are saying, it appears like you both (Hum and Rasmussen) worked at FB before. I would imagine you made a bank (aka $500k at least) between you before jumping the ship.<p>A few questions - 1. How did you find first few customers?\n2. How did you convince them to buy over existing products with fair degree of overlap such as Trello, JIRA, ProductPlan, RoadMunk etc.  \n3. Who do you consider your competitors?<p>TIA for answering!')
