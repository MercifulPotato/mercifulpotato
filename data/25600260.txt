My grandparents generation regarded those two as <i>very</i> different, having lived through the bank runs of the depression.<p>The difference between their gen and mine is due to the advent of the FDIC. This would also address your point about Mt Gox: Had there been insurance, Mt Gox would not have been such a clusterfk.<p>So no surprise: Coinbase and Bakkt both tout the insurance of their holdings.  It&#x27;s not quite FDIC levels (ie, a defacto government backing) but it&#x27;s getting closer.  As a consequence, it is not too hard for me to imagine a time that custodial accounts will have nearly the same confidence as a private wallet, because the equivalent of FDIC will likely be created by bitcoin-based institutions.')
