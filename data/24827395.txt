A human consumes about 1M Kcals a year (accounting for meat as waste), and at best you can achieve 11M kcals per acre with corn or potatos.  Beans yield about 6M and wheat 4M.  My guess is you are growing and giving away about 600k kcals of roughage.  70lbs of tomatoes only has about 6000 kcal, so enough for one person for half a week.')
