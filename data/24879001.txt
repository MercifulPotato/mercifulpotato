But the founders are very nice and have a lot of good will. I&#x27;m working 12-14 hours every day because I want and I have fun doing the work.<p>But even though I&#x27;m getting a lot less salary than I could have, I decided to keep grinding because I see way more opportunities and chances than my &quot;personal loss&quot;.<p>Imo, everyone working his ass off in a startup should make sure it&#x27;s worth. And that, for me, means looking for opportunities regardless how shitty the founders may be.<p>Being an early employee gives you a shit ton of responsibilities, but instead of seeing them as a burden, take them to shine and negotiate your future.')
