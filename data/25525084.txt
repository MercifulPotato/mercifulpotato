Quite a few apps are delivered as separate numbered versions, like Acorn 4, Acorn 5, Acorn 6, Textual 7 etc.<p>That&#x27;s how software used to work a millenia ago. Yearly updates that you would buy separately should you chose to.<p>Most of the time I can still download older versions even if they&#x27;re not listed on the App Store.')
