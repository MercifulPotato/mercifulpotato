If you feel like you live in a corrupt state, then &quot;but it&#x27;s very big you see&quot; will do absolutely nothing to reduce the negative experience.<p>And if one felt like they should leave their current country and move somewhere less corrupt, then size doesn&#x27;t really matter either. If the hypothesis is &quot;living in the US is unpleasant due to corruption&quot; then &quot;but &lt;alternate country&gt; is small&quot; is a bizarre non-sequitur.')
