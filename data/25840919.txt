The man pages are well written and complete, the filesystem is well organized, having no issues that people have with Systemd the simplicity of OpenBSD&#x27;s init system showed you don&#x27;t need complex init systems. Then you have PF which is far easier to deal with than IP tables.<p>It took me a few hours of playing to set OpenBSD up with multiple vlan&#x27;s, dhcp server, firewall, cross vlan routing, mdns etc. The hardest part was figuring out the correct parameters for my ISP broadband connection as the ISP didn&#x27;t publish some of the information so needed to sniff the network traffic to find that i needed to set a vlan for my isp.<p>The simplicity of OpenBSD makes it very easy to learn networking and if you are familiar with Linux you will become familiar with BSD very quickly as BSD&#x27;s are less fragmented than Linux by their nature.')
