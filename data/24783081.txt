He failed on that.<p>He finally did the right thing by stepping down.  He would have always carried the weight of the mismanagement of the response to the employee-criticism, and that is what killed him ultimately.<p>A CEO position isn&#x27;t a reward, it&#x27;s a service position, and I believe that no one is entitled to it.  (Ditto many forms of leadership)  So to complain about how unfair it was to him, perhaps we should think about how unfair it was to the employees of the organization who had to deal with situation instead.')
