Item(by='jqcoffey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604630766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003844, text='&gt; That sounds awfully close to &quot;books will ruin the world. If people stop memorizing their scriptures they&#x27;ll stop believing&quot; and complaints against progress.<p>Ok, so wow!  No!  Definitely not the message I was trying to convey.  I love books, have many of them, don&#x27;t read as much as I&#x27;d like, but would _certainly_ love to have more of them memorized!  I&#x27;m always jealous of those folks who can recite poems from memory and the like.<p>&gt; &quot;I write by hand. Using a typewriter will take me away further away from the essence of &#x27;writing&#x27;&quot; etc...<p>Off (my) topic, but because you brought it up, writing by hand does increase memory retention!

Fax works fine for me and I get a hard copy&quot; etc...<p>Well... I do have a very nice laser printer and tend to print whitepapers even though I have a really nice iPad to read them on.<p>So I guess all of the above could add up to me being a bit of a luddite, which I accept, but really I guess I was just expressing my way of retaining and improving my own knowledge of programming languages that I like.  Hard copy reading, hand writing (which I don&#x27;t actually do much of) and navigating scaladocs instead of tab-completion helps me do that.<p>As I also said, if my job depending on my coding output, I would absolutely use a full featured IDE of one sort or another.')
