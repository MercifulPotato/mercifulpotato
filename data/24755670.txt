This allows Unity track all the dependencies and load everything you need.<p>Unity is still crap at loading things in order but you simply have to make peace with that.  Instead you have to write a bit more defensively and assume that your code will get initialized in a random order. As long as you use Unity serialization all the references will be set when the lifecycle callbacks fire.<p>You can \n- Use coroutine Starts to wait for initialization<p>- Ensure all the inits are done in Awake so things are ready during Start<p>- You can also move away form initialization towards a more lazy pattern and make sure any calls into your behavior are asynchronous and include self init when needed.<p>It is a bit clunky but you can get used to it.  Lean into the idea of behaviors being asynchronous actors and it makes a bit more sense.')
