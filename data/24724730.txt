We are currently focused on creating a super easy to use solution. An analogy: there are open source versions of Dropbox for users that don&#x27;t trust Dropbox with their files (NextCloud, ownCloud, etc.), however this comes with the friction of having to host your own solution. We are more like Dropbox, where we want to create a solution that is incredibly easy to install, manage, and work with. That being said, a self-hosted solution is top of our mind as we totally acknowledge that some companies would not want to use a hosted solution.')
