Senior dev on team decided it would be cool if it included some lite NLP. When product owners heard from him how easy it would be to add, they were on board.<p>He started with a popular existing Python library. But there was a bug with one corner case that was causing problems. So he took the initiative to spend a few extra days on the story to write his own simple NLP date parser.<p>A couple months later, early on Jan 1st, the new feature wished our ops team Happy New Year by taking down our application.<p>I happened to open an issue for the library&#x27;s bug on Github after learning about it from the other dev. The owner there promptly responded to share a simple workaround for the issue. But by that time we already had too much software on our hands.')
