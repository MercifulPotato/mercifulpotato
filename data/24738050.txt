Just think about the lenght of the reach - trying to regulate what content somebody on a messenger app should post, not even social media platform like twitter&#x2F;facebook (do they monitor those too? Telling them which groups to have?) They feel like they&#x27;re creating their own little world, their own universe. And it&#x27;s not some unambiguous situation like posting nudes of your ex gfs, it&#x27;s very complicated what&#x27;s happening in Belarus, at the very least they shouldn&#x27;t interfere. But they couldn&#x27;t care less about democracies of the world, if there&#x27;s a slightest chance that Apple very very remotely might burn - they&#x27;re OUT. And on top of that they want you to be clueless about it.')
