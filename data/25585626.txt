Android had only been out for a couple of years at the time so it was easier to get noticed then.<p>The game was free with an ad-banner during gameplay. I was making a decent amount in ad clicks and also had players emailing me for a paid version that just disabled the ads. Instead of jumping on this to release a paid version and expand the game with more features, I ran into perfectionism issues + decision paralysis releasing any changes.<p>The game blew up for a few weeks and I got something like 0.5 million downloads eventually but didn&#x27;t do anything to monetise it more so felt like I missed a big chance.<p>It was a great feeling checking analytics though to see that there was literally years of collective gameplay time being logged, and I&#x27;ve had several emails and reviews from players saying they&#x27;ve been addicted to playing the game for years.<p>My biggest lessons are probably:<p>1) Doing&#x2F;releasing something is always better than doing nothing so don&#x27;t let decision paralysis get in the way. &quot;Don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of good&quot;.<p>2) Don&#x27;t fear releasing or making changes because you might get bad reviews. You&#x27;ll never please everyone and even the perfect app will inevitable get some brutally unfair and weird&#x2F;crazy reviews.<p>3) Some people are obsessed with word games!<p>Anyway, as a lockdown project for fun, I started making a new web version for mobile + desktop. :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seanwilson.itch.io&#x2F;wordoid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seanwilson.itch.io&#x2F;wordoid</a>')
