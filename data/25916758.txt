I&#x27;m from a lower middle class family and that because my parents worked overtime in their blue collar jobs. I went to a public 4 year university. I was successful in college precisely because I didn&#x27;t have a privileged background. While I also had no idea how to manage that much money, I erred on the side of caution. While my contemporaries lived in dorms, I spent half and rented a house with several other people some miles from campus. I didn&#x27;t have daily Starbucks. I didn&#x27;t party or skip classes. I worked 20+ hours while I was in school.<p>&gt; I assure you your classmates who went to private 4 year school on dadâ€™s dime do not reflect the majority of working class millennials.<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about working class millennials, but millennials in general.<p>&gt; For many millennials they are more worried about being wiped out by a trip to the hospital that would cost the price of 3 lifetimes of lattes<p>Yeah, we have private health insurance and that really sucks for those who don&#x27;t have access to decent insurance. But that doesn&#x27;t justify living it up in school. Note also that I&#x27;m not even blaming millennials per se; our society failed to teach us personal responsibility, and it went even farther by creating a loan program and dumping us into a predatory university system with the vague guidance that we should follow our dreams, have a good time, and everything will just work itself out. Of course the majority of us took the bait and lived it up. Worse still, we graduated into an economy that was worse than what our parents dealt with. Excuses abound, but nevertheless, our generation YOLOed pretty hard even though the YOLOing wasn&#x27;t evenly distributed.')
