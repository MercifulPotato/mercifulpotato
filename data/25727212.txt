That lasted quite a while and it worked well (bad signal just meant a slightly more snow in a picture). Then on digital era I have already transitioned from DVB-T to DVB-T2. When changing a channel in those 70ies or 80ies televisions, it happened instantly. Now we have huge amounts of computing power, but every press on remote feels like the command is queued somewhere for a second or two. I hate using today&#x27;s televisions and tuners. While the picture and sound is considerably better, the usability is horror. Also Teletext worked always fast and was instant.
