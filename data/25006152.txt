You need to figure out what your class knows. And a fair proportion of your students won&#x27;t bother to really know stuff unless it&#x27;ll be formally assessed.<p>I don&#x27;t think this approach is right. There is an obvious conflict of interest when the same party provides (1) education) <i>and</i> (2) assessment. The better approach is actually that taken by the College Board -- they do assessment, and only assessment. If you&#x27;d like to do well on their test, you&#x27;re free to get whatever training you see fit. And that training is, theoretically[1], evaluated by how you eventually do on the SAT, not by how well you do on practice exams provided by the educator.<p>This should be the practice everywhere else: credentials are given by assessment, and the assessor doesn&#x27;t do anything other than assessment. If the assessor sells training, that corrupts their assessment.<p>[1] In fact, the system seems to have broken down; SAT training is widely accepted to have large effects, while actual measurements of those effects have difficulty distinguishing them from zero.')
