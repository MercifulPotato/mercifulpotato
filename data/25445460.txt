The US ought to do better, but its sins (especially those prior to our modern understanding of environment) don&#x27;t vindicate Brazil&#x27;s deforestation today. This line of argumentation--that we all need only be as good as the worst of our rivals (and by whatever standard suits us in a given moment, no less)--is just a race to the bottom and I reject it wholesale.')
