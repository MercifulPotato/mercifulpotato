I stayed on IRC for a very long time, and grew-older with the same circle.  It was nice.  It was personal.  I know people in that group that got married.<p>Time passed, people moved on; had families, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other platforms like facebook, but they all seemed so fake, shallow, and &quot;designed for AOL&#x27;ers&quot; that was a recipe for crap.  So I never stuck around.<p>G+ arrived and had the right feel, but it never grew legs.<p>Facebook has two things going for it.\n(1) it&#x27;s an echo chamber\n(2) the &quot;OMG I can communicate with somebody over the internet&quot; dopamine spike<p>Well I got #2 too, but I was 12 years old on a C64 connecting to BBS&#x27;s.
