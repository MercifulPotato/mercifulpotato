But it could also refer to people who ignore the shut-downs and hang out in smaller groups regardless limits on gathering etc.<p>In my country there is no clear distinction of what type of people make up the crowd which is &quot;still&quot; socializing. While you get some pockets of conspiracy theorists, covid-deniers, mixed with conservative or right-wing elements, the left, or even politically abstinent are also there. It doesn&#x27;t make them all abnormal people. There are some who I have perfectly communicated before the pandemic. But the pandemic has made many people mentally struggle (without a need to lump them all together into &quot;abnormal&quot;).<p>My guess is those who have already been (mentally) vulnerable are now even more so because the world around them is becoming even more depressive&#x2F;depressed. It&#x27;s not that there are only abnormal people left who to socialize with. It&#x27;s because many just die because they were anyway hanging on to a bare minimum before. It doesn&#x27;t require the presence of &quot;abnormal&quot; people to kill them. It&#x27;s enough when a support structure that they previously had (a friend, a source of fund&#x2F;support, etc) simply breaks away. it&#x27;s not an addition that hurts them but something that is taken away. (so it&#x27;s actually less complicated&#x2F;complex&#x2F;conspirational and more ugly&#x2F;sad as to why this happens)')
