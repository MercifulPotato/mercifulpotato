Item(by='DrBazza', descendants=None, kids=[25969016], score=None, time=1612010041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968423, text='&gt; Approval doesn&#x27;t matter when AZ has to build stock to meet deadlines. Basically they weren&#x27;t building stock to fulfill UK orders, from EU based production.<p>Vaccine delivery, like pretty much everything else, is just-in-time delivery.  They haven&#x27;t been building stocks.  They&#x27;ve been manufacturing vaccines and shipping them straight out as they have signed contracts with many other countries other than the UK.  Demand is outstripping supply.<p>The EU&#x27;s argument, which is well documented in the press, is that they&#x27;ve promised about 300 million Euros to AZ to build up capacity, only a small amount of which they&#x27;ve paid AZ.  It is also well documented that it takes time to get a vaccine manufacturing plant working at close to 100% yield, something even the UK plant hasn&#x27;t achieved.  It&#x27;s simply the case that the EU should have agreed and paid sooner so that AZ could have invested that money in the EU plants sooner.  All of this is covered in the &#x27;best reasonable efforts&#x27; parts of the contract.<p>&gt; It takes months to build stock, but they were flushing that stock to UK.<p>Evidence?  As far as I can see in the press, the AZ doses in the UK are coming from the AZ manufacturing plants in the UK, and it is vdL &#x2F; the EU that is demanding that AZ doses in the UK are diverted to the EU to make up the current shortfall in EU manufacturing.')
