I witnessed the reporting from both sides and saw things progress on the ground.  I have quite a different view.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the Australian call for an investigation was genuine&#x2F;scientific&#x2F;objective at all. The call was meant as a political attack. There is no way Australia or the US would accept any investigation result that doesn&#x27;t put the full blame on China. It&#x27;s a case of &#x27;guilty until proven innocent, and we won&#x27;t accept evidence of innocence&#x27;.<p>This is shown by the fact that Australia and the US are not interested in investigating whether other countries (including their own) could be related to the origin, nor whether the response outside China has been adequate. Come on, if you&#x27;re already set on a result, then why begin the investigation in the first place? And why divert resources to such an investigation, when there are much more urgent issues, such as fighting the virus? Such an &#x27;investigation&#x27; only serves to legitimize prejudice and political agendas.<p>It does not surprise me in the least that China sees through these disingenuous intentions.<p>Earlier this year, China already pledged in front of the UN that they will allow an truly independent, scientific investigation, after the pandemic was over.<p>Furthermore, China&#x27;s response to Australia isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> the result of Australia&#x27;s call to investigate China. China has been taking punches from Australia for years. Australia went full in on Trump&#x27;s rhetoric about China being a bully&#x2F;threat, and has been blasting China in its media for years now. Things inside Australia have escalated so much, that anybody with a Chinese origin is viewed with suspicion for being a potential CCP agent, even if no evidence exists, and even if said person was Australia-born. The COVID-19 investigation call is just the last drop.<p>Is China sometimes overly sensitive? Yes. Is China always in the right? No. But when you keep insulting a big customer, is it any surprise they chose not to buy from you anymore? The media seems to want to exlusively portrait Australia as a wholly-innocent victim, meaning that that they think it&#x27;s okay to keep attacking China while being entitled to benefiting from China. In my opinion, Australia needs a dose of self-reflection too, and admit that they too played a part in deteriorating relations.<p>I hope you guys can continue sort things out at the negotiation table, and mend this broken relationship, rather than continuing to deny own responsibility and to deny this reality where China no longer be walked all over.')
