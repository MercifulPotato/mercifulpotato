This strongly indicates is that, with sufficient time, money, and fortunate circumstance (e.g. capturing a phone in an AFU state), law enforcement agents can typically extract significant (if not all) personal data from modern iOS devices, despite Apple’s claims around user privacy . This is exacerbated by Apple’s failure to widely deploy Complete Protection over user data, and its failure to more broadly secure cloud services (particularly, the decision to store cloud authentication tokens in AFU). These facts combine to offer extensive access to law enforcement agents, rogue governments, and criminals.<p>Android:<p>The primary takeaway from this discussion is that there are many techniques to bypass user data protections on Android. Lacking an analogue to iOS Complete Protection, decryption keys for user data remain available in memory at all time after the first unlock of the device; live extraction then becomes a question of breaking security controls instead of breaking cryptography or hardware. Additionally, the extent of Google’s data collection affords law enforcement and rogue actors alike considerable user data, acquirable either through the legal system or through a device bypass.')
