The Hunter story is valid, simply because it&#x27;s valid. The same media that decided not to cover the story before the election, confirmed its validity since then and decided that it was in fact news-worthy. Also the FBI launched the investigation into this.<p>Hate to be the person to point that out, but let&#x27;s be honest with ourselves, if it was Trump Jr. who was taking pictures of him putting his dick into a pizza while smoking crack with random hookers, it would be probably retweeted by @jack himself lol.')
