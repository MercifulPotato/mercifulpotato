Item(by='sequoia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605734019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139175, text='&quot;Life sucks and you may as well learn it early.&quot; Setting aside the fact that tweens &amp; teens <i>in particular</i> need more sleep (you can do with less when you&#x27;re older), even if one has to get up at 6:30 and do a 90 minute commute every day, why make kids do this?<p>They can learn to get up early and commute when they have to do so. I don&#x27;t think making kids spend 10 years waking up early is necessary to prepare them for getting up early as an adult.<p>Analogy: they may have to go without food at some point their life, that doesn&#x27;t mean we have to starve them now so they&#x27;re prepared. They can learn to do it when they <i>need</i> to do it.')
