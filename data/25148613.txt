I&#x27;ll try to list what came to mind.<p>- Just like the 60s-70s in music, product people had no concept of what a marketable game looked like, and were willing to fund much more riskier ideas.\n- Video game team sizes and budgets were smaller, allowing designers much more leeway, as well being able to personally oversee the production much better.\n- Although Moore&#x27;s law was a thing before and after the 90s, It&#x27;s the advancement during that time meant that games went from pixelated abstract bleep-bloop affairs, to being able to render and simulate complex 2D and 3D worlds.\n- Feeding in to my previous point, people were literally writing the book on modern game genres, like RTS, Sim games (who thought that managing a city could be fun?), FPS, etc.\n- John Carmack, I literally cannot overstate how impactful his contributions were to the FPS genre. With the introduction of Binary Space Partitioning in games (first in Doom in 2D, then a fully 3D version in Quake), he elegantly solved occlusion culling, collision detection, and 3D level editors in a masterstroke, while allowing 3D games to run on the meagre hardware of the times. Almost literally every FPS game used a BSP to represent its levels for more than a decade (Unreal, Quake and Source sure did).<p>Unfortunately, the console era which came after, has put a brake to this breakneck pace of development.Console games, especially in the PS1-X360 eras, were dumbed down for both technical limitations, and gameplay:\n- Studios sought to appeal to the masses, who didn&#x27;t always appreciate the complex mechanics.\n- You just can&#x27;t make as sophisticated UI for gamepads as for keyboard&#x2F;mouse. This killed of multiple PC genres on console, the RTS most prominent among them.\n- Due to the primary storage medium being DVDs&#x2F;CDS in the console space, developers had to contend with their limitations, such as slow transfer speed, and abysmal seek times (yes even compared to HDDs). This meant that levels needed to be more linear, and player freedom had to be restricted. RAM sizes were also tiny compared to PCs of the time, further increasing the problem.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ton of stuff that I missed.')
