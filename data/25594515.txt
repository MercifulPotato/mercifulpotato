I literally asked to be downvoted in the GP and then when I was (as expected because of course HN is full of more racist and sexist people than you’re willing to admit) I copied&#x2F;pasted the same comment and changed numbers while waiting for my builds to finish. It’s not as serious as you keep alluding to (i.e. “I understand Internet posts can be activating.”)<p>So like I said, I don’t mind calling out racist and sexist people on HN. You should try it some time. I already told you what you could do to nudge this community in the right direction. But again, I already said PG wouldn’t allow this.<p>Is there any data to back up your claim about this “small minority”? If I run a sentiment analysis on the most “charged” posts, will the analysis indicate that there’s a “small minority” of racist and sexist people on HN?<p>Sure, no one’s going to be racist or sexist on the millionth hate post about Electron or AMP. I understand that. Is that all you’re saying?<p>Have you seen how toxic the Blind app community is? There’s an overlap between that community and this one. Maybe it’s just the exact same “small minority” everywhere... (Sarcasm)<p>FWIW, to be clear, it’s not that I lack faith in only HN readers. My ideas&#x2F;truths about the world extend past this community. HN comments are just a symptom of something much larger: a diseased system being upheld by people who just want to see the good in everyone and vomit rainbows.')
