The fact he hasn&#x27;t explicitly and publicly embraced them isn&#x27;t evidence of innocence. It just means he is engaged in dog-whistle politics. He gets Nazis on board by being inspecific about who is a &quot;very fine person&quot;, then you and I argue over whether he is just dumb or actively a nazi. That let&#x27;s non-Nazis support him without having to explicitly be Pro-nazi and keeps the Nazis on board. He&#x27;s built a big tent, made some racist statements and closed his eyes as the Nazis flooded in.<p>If you get into bed with a nazi, you&#x27;re in bed with a nazi, even if you pretend you can&#x27;t see their flags.<p>I actually think trump is a &quot;nazi of convenience&quot; rather than a real, ideological nazi. He pushes their ideals and covers for them in exchange for their votes. He doesn&#x27;t actually care about them more than anyone else. They&#x27;re a means to an end. The same with coal miners or the religious. He doesn&#x27;t care about abortion, he wants their votes and their money.<p>The difference is that to be religious, you need to actually believe, to be a looter you have to actually loot, but to be a nazi, you just need to work with and help nazi, you don&#x27;t need the tattoo and the party membership card...<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t have to be a racist to support trump, but racism has to have not been a deal breaker for you&quot;<p>Sorry this is so long, I&#x27;m not smart enough to make it shorter!')
