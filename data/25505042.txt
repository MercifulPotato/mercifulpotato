It doesn’t make it less credible, but it also doesn’t make it automatically credible.<p>I have not yet had a chance to read the letter and all commentary, but I hear echos of Max Howell’s “google didn’t hire me because I cannot invert a binary tree”.<p>It was obviously a rage post; it was obviously his impression of the interview (even though “inverting a binary tree”, being an ill-defined operation, is unlikely what they asked him to do).<p>And following that affair, my impression was that he wasn’t hired for reasons other than his programming abilities - being a team player (and specifically not being a loose cannon) matters at least as much.<p>I have no idea what the story is here, but taking one side or the other based on a single post (and prejudice) is not really helpful.')
