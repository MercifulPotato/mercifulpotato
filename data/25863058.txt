Twitter obviously does make mistakes - both AIs and humans are fallible - but they have about as good a moderation process in place as it&#x27;s possible to have with the amount of message traffic they process.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to point out that the only evidence WE&#x27;VE seen of this so far are a few claims made in a lawsuit.')
