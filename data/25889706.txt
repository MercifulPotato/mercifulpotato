You still to this day see dialog boxes in Windows with microscopic text areas in windows that cannot be resized. This is an artefact of the GUI builders used where the developer just &quot;drew&quot; the UI components with fixed positioning.<p>As for Motif, there were third-party GUI builders, but Motif itself did not have one as standard that I know of (I developed on Motif on Solaris when working for Sun). The layout model for Motif is so easy that you don&#x27;t need a GUI builder anyway. I&#x27;ve used may UI frameworks since then, and Motif is still the easiest one to use in my opinion.')
