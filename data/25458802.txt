Even in your telling of it, we have a company that does whatever the hell it wants and employees doing whatever the hell they want, and I see no reason to hold employees to a higher standard than we hold the company.<p>&gt; Once again, if you want to agitate against the company, you are free to do this. Just don&#x27;t expect the company to employe you.<p>Sure, but that is a question of power and tactics. The company  could sack you, and it could also suffer negative PR as a result. Both sides use whichever power they have to their advantage. You could argue that what the employees are doing is not smart and that they might be overplaying their hand, but not that what they&#x27;re doing is <i>wrong</i>.<p>&gt; Not without limits. Boards are answerable to shareholders, and may be held liable if they act against the interests of shareholders.<p>Yes, but even the interests of shareholders are a result of political action.<p>&gt; But even then it is the board that decides this, not random employee X.<p>But whether or not employees are on the board is itself a result of political action. In the US, they&#x27;re not (as a result of political activism), but anyone is free to take any political action to change that.<p>&gt; As an employee, you are in a chain of command (tends to also be in your contract, which you entered into voluntarily).<p>But as long as you&#x27;re not breaking the law, you&#x27;re allowed to take whatever action you please, including one that risks termination. The company might well be within its rights to sack you, but that has a cost so they might not do it. Corporations do such things all the time, sometimes choosing to risk litigation, and I see no reason why workers couldn&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t. Each side uses whatever power they have to their advantage.')
