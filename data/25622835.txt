The publishers are trying to shut down sci-hub, and to disincentivize policies of mandatory open-access.  And they have a long history of getting in a door with tolerable cost and terms, and then each time you need to renew the contract, costs are higher, terms are worse, and both are bundled so &quot;there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it, is there?&quot;.  Combine those ethics with Indian governance&#x27;s potential for kickbacks, and sadly, not good news.')
