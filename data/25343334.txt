It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a question of ensuring the canister itself stays warm enough (e.g. warm it up in your jacket before use, put in a bowl of water, or welding some sort of metal to the stove to conduct the heat back to the canister.. the last which I have NEVER done, since I&#x27;ve read about all sorts of explosion-likely events!)')
