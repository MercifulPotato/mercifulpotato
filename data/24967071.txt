Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=[24967604], score=None, time=1604317964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24966262, text='&gt; Escooter&#x2F;ebike is rarely a replacement for a car.<p>Yeah, well, I guess you are not from a big city like Amsterdam.<p>&gt; Need to buy groceries for the whole week and deliver them home, a car can do that.<p>I just order my groceries online and get them delivered. I could also use my cargo bike, normal bicycle, or walk to do groceries. Neither of these options is electric, but you can buy these electric. Last time I checked, each of these options give me enough &#x27;freedom&#x27; so that I don&#x27;t need a car. Sure, I can&#x27;t go to the other side of the country with my car, but I don&#x27;t want to either. <i>If</i> I am going on a spontaneous _long_distance_ trip I got two options: I go by public transport, or we rent a car. Cars are overrated; we got a lot more options nowadays so that the use of a car is diminished (though not completely). People in Amsterdam are living without a car and go by fine (they also need the money they&#x27;d otherwise spend on a car on rent ...).')
