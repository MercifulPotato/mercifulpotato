If Parler was instead a pro-abortion forum, and it was taken down by a conservative company citing that abortion is an &#x27;act of violence&#x27; (I don&#x27;t agree, but many pro-lifers do) I think we&#x27;d see very few of the same voices cheering.<p>Businesses should tolerate some higher-cost customers.  Ex. If a restaurant wants to exceed regulatory accessibility requirements to make their business serve disabled clients better, that is a good thing.  Similar examples: multilingual support, making female hygiene product freely available, parental leave.  This does &#x27;reduce value for other customers&#x27; but is a net societal good (and hopefully most customers get some amount of that reduced value back in feeling good about helping people).  Some customers costing business more isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing that should be avoided.')
