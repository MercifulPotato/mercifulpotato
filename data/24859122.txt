Sorry for missing the point. Of course I have to agree that what you describe is the enterprise of scientific discovery altogether! My point on that end is all these “mysteries” in the biological domain are easier to spot with the proper framework. Right now the biological sciences do not emphasize any mathematically rigorous understanding of electricity which is keeping their blinders on. It is intuitive to understand the oxidation reactions, per your example, dielectrically, but the researchers certainly lack the cohesive understanding.')
