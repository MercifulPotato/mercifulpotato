You don&#x27;t need to have a subscription, you just need to own the game.<p>Some games are also available for free:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stadia.google.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;super-bomberman-r-online" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stadia.google.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;super-bomberman-r-online</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stadia.google.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;destiny-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stadia.google.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;destiny-2</a><p>The subscription gives you 4k streaming and games that you can claim and keep (as long as you have a subscription, even if you interrupt it and resume). Very similar to Xbox Games with Gold:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;store&#x2F;collections&#x2F;gameswithgold&#x2F;xbox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;store&#x2F;collections&#x2F;gameswithg...</a><p>I was skeptical at the beginning, but I prefer it to a Netflix style subscription (like Xbox Game Pass Cloud or Playstation Now)... since if the movie that you&#x27;re interested in leaves the streaming service, it&#x27;s not a big deal (or even if it&#x27;s a whole season of a series), but if a videogame is leaving, that might be quite a bit more frustrating, since it might take you more than 1 month to actually complete your game. At least with Stadia I know that (as long as my Stadia account is active) I&#x27;ll always be able to come back to the games that I&#x27;m playing now.<p>Just like on Windows and Luna, you can also make use of your Ubisoft Plus subscription, though (only available in the US, for now)<p>One nice thing is that a lot of modern games (like some available with Ubisoft Plus) have &quot;cloud synced saves&quot; or cross-progression. So you could stop playing on Stadia, and continue your savegame on another platform.')
