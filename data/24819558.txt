For example, a workflow is expected to run for three months. A bug is found at the end of this workflow definition. The bug is fixed and deployed as a new version, but all workflows that started up to the fix and used previous versions will keep failing for the next three months. So there is a need to patch workflow without changing its version.<p>The approach Temporal takes is that every part of the code is versioned independently. This allows deploying changes at any time, even for libraries shared by multiple workflows, and doesn&#x27;t require running multiple worker versions.')
