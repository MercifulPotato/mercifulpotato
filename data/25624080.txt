Meaning, when I was younger I could focus on problems for long chunks of time. As I’ve gotten older and had to deal with work stress, kid stress, life stress, dozens of devices all pinging me with notifications, people demanding my attention constantly... the truth is I can barely make it 15 minutes without someone or something interrupting me. I had this jerk client for a brief while - he was on monthly retainer, but wanted this kind of minute-by-minute granularity of tracking my time. It was the kind of thing that finally put me over the edge against this kind of relentless optimization because all it was doing was <i>wasting my time</i> tracking time rather than actually <i>doing the bloody work</i>. So hey, if tracking your life in 15 minute increments gives you what you need, great, but I personally am working on how to build long increments of time with greater focus.')
