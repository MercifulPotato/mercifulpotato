I use my phone for the things I can do while I&#x27;m outside the studio &#x2F; with no access to an instrument. This means like listening to demos, taking notes on things I&#x27;d like to change, humming into the recorder app to save an idea for later, etc. So in that tine on a train, waiting for the doctor, etc., I consume my own stuff so I can possibly better create later.')
