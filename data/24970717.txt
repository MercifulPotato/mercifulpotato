In European countries making a copy for personal use is generally legal, unless the user should have been aware that the content was uploaded illegally; in the case of Youtube, the user may generally assume that the content has been uploaded legally, because Youtube has concluded contracts with most copyright collectives and the compensation is made in the form of a flat-rate surcharge on all storage media.<p>In Switzerland you may even legally download illegal content for personal use and also circumvent a copy protection for the purpose of creating a personal copy.
