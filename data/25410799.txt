Harder to ultimately monetize, since the business model for the online book market is pretty mature at this point but no one directly directly pays for that single essay.  So where are micro transactions?<p>Anyone who has been in the position where their time was truly valuable instinctively protects their free time from “long form” intrusions.  It the book is worthwhile, the essays on the essence of the ideas will be even more valuable (per minute).  Most pop books or ideological rants might only need a paragraph.  Condensing into short form might lead to the embarrassing disclosure that the emperor has no clothes.<p>The idea that you have to read a long form text to understand a different perspective sets off alarm bells in my head.  I seem to remember that cults would always want prospective recruits to stay at the Center <i>the whole weekend</i>.')
