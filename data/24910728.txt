So he always reserved the right to change his mind about his languages. If he could save a compiler pass, or make the compiler faster, by changing the language, he often would.<p>And the people in Wirth&#x27;s orbit (The OberonScript author did his PhD with Wirth) were naturally interested in programming languages, and the compilers were small and well designed, so they were easy to modify.<p>Last of all, while Wirth is a very practical guy (having designed multiple workstations full-stack), but he never pursued commercial practicality or industrial applicability as an objective in itself. He&#x27;d rather pursue whatever his research agenda at the time was, and if industry found something useful to pick up, good for them.')
