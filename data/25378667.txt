There&#x27;s very little precedence in computing history for this other than game consoles, and it&#x27;s not super crazy to ask whether that&#x27;s a model that should apply to smartphones and tablets. (To me, that seems to be actually be a fundamental question, and I don&#x27;t think I have an answer.)')
