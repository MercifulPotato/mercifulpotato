Then look the panel up in a database like panelook.com. This way you can get the specifications without any marketing bullshit.<p>It also works the other way round. Find a panel that is good enough for your eyes, then see if there&#x27;s a mass marketed display with that panel. If you are adventurous, you can grab &quot;DIY&quot; or &quot;assembled&quot; monitors with the panels on Chinese e-Commerce sites.')
