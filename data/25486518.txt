But don&#x27;t call that a system based on merit when you&#x27;re quite transparently admitting it&#x27;s not.<p>Meritocracies are an inhuman system which, to the extent they can be realized, only happen incidentally. How many of the relatively well to do people on this board subvert the meritocracy every day by giving their children every little advantage that tons of families just simply never could give their children. What would it take to make a meritocracy work? Ironically it would take a great flattening. But precisely because they believe in gain from advantage, the biggest proponents of meritocracy can never argue for the one thing that would actually make their system work. So instead we end up in this weird limbo where merit is actually subverted over and over again by a highly stratified social&#x2F;economic makeup that begins in childhood and has strong persistence throughout life. &quot;Actual&quot; meritocracy may arise from time to time as a result of society spanning tragedy but will also quickly disappear and that doesn&#x27;t exactly seem like the type of thing we should be aiming for anyways.')
