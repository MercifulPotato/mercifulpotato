I have an ME degree that, at the end of the day, I did mostly for fun and have never really used.<p>On the other hand, I also understand the perspective of those who maybe don&#x27;t care for school, want to&#x2F;need to minimize the time and money they spend on it, learn &quot;just the facts&quot; they need to get hired to pursue software development mostly in the vein of a trade, and the paper that is often needed to get hired or pursue various types of opportunities. In that light, it&#x27;s understandable they don&#x27;t want to learn a lot of theory they won&#x27;t use much, much less take unrelated science distribution and humanities courses.')
