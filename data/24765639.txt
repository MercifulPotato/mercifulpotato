Mostly white people who can&#x27;t handle that they may have contributed to racism at one point. &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist! You&#x27;re all just social just warriors!&quot; turns into &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist but...[insert racism here]&quot;. Of course the deep insecurity over being actually racist is the common thread. Meanwhile there&#x27;s a whole other movement of white people who are now willing to admit how privileged all of us are to have been in a system for hundreds of years that was a &quot;democracy&quot; for some, but a nightmarish dictatorship for black people. Was I insecure when I realized how tone deaf I had been? Sure. But I possess self reflection and have made efforts to change my behavior since then.<p>But yes, if I find myself in a conversation with a holocaust denier I&#x27;ll do my best to convince them they&#x27;re wrong. I highly doubt that winds up working though.')
