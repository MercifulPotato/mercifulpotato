It&#x27;s worth the lower quality just for the music. Some of the most powerful scenes are deeply tied to the nusic for me, dancing at prom, Brian&#x27;s bowling, the first episode, so many more - the replacement &#x27;music&#x27; they hacked together is horrible too...<p>Wow i didn&#x27;t know the cellular aging part thank you. Do you have anymore info? I&#x27;m on it (or was when I could actually be around humans ;( )<p>The biggest downside I know about is the cost. It&#x27;s insane even though i have really great insurance. Gilead does reimburse but it takes like 6 weeks or more. A low income person can&#x27;t be out almost 2k for that long. Medicade&#x2F;care is also a pain especially those most at risk, IV users, etc. Hopefully I&#x27;ve heard it goes generic soon.<p>I feel like we are 5-15 years away from being able to eradicate or relegate sadly to the developing world only.')
