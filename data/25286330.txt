But I&#x27;ll argue that the opposite can be true as well! By using a machine that is far removed from what your customers are on, can you really test their user experience?<p>And, this is a personal anecdote of course, but sometimes having fast machines can paper over problems that you should really be addressing: I had a coworker once who temporarily used a fairly (~7 years) old machine to do their development work until they could get something newer to work on. During that time I noticed that they would take a while to make minor fixes after reviews. I asked them why and they told me that they would make the change and then they&#x27;d build it and it was taking dozens of minutes–it turns out that there was a creeping dependency tracking issue in the build process that nobody had bothered to address yet because it didn&#x27;t seem like a huge issue on our normal machines. But fixing it certainly got his turnaround time way up, and the CI machines really liked the change too ;)')
