If we&#x27;re using the dictionary definition, a state is:<p>&quot;a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government.&quot;<p>Which is exactly which each US State is. My home state, NC, is a territory which has a distinct culture and community, and it&#x27;s own governing body.  I&#x27;m a 10th generation North Carolinian, and I respect that fact that NC existed before I was born - and will continue existing after I&#x27;m dead. A state is more than the people who are currently residing in it or it&#x27;s current power distribution - it&#x27;s a long-standing culture, governing body and community of people that are inextricably tied to their own geography and their own decisions, past and future.<p>I don&#x27;t care about preserving the current power structure for future generations - but you can bet I care about preserving NC&#x27;s culture, environment, and state sovereignty for future generations. Those things are all  bigger than any individual, and I certainly still believe they are worth fighting for. NC has the world&#x27;s first public university and an amazing state university system in general. We have amazing food and BBQ culture, we have 3 different unique dialects of American English, we have our own tradition of folk music, we have our own religious traditions and our own way of going through our lives.<p>Also, FWIW - if you think Americans think of themselves as a single nation with minor variations - you really haven&#x27;t spent enough time in the South.')
