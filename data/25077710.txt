Surely we care about a murderer who kills an elderly person.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re saying here. If a murder kills someone, the murder was the direct cause of death and we count it as murder. If you die of old age while having covid, it is not necessarily covid that is the killer, so it&#x27;s not clear that it should <i>necessarily</i> be counted as the killer in all old-age cases.<p>&gt; and are going to die whether or not they have it<p>Yes but... you understand I&#x27;m talking about the specific case of actually being on your deathbed, right?')
