And are soft-subbed. To the point where I often hear it as an explanation of why so few animes get DVDs in France.\nBut at the same time, Wakanim sells DRM-free episodes that are soft-subbed for 1€&#x2F;episode. We are talking about a 95% discount compared to Japan here. Hope this won&#x27;t change with this new quasi-monopoly.')
