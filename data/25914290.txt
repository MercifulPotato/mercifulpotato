This has many advantages from simpler setup to shorter build to easier verification.<p>When you&#x27;re compiling software on remote, restricted systems; these optional components makes people&#x27;s life a lot easier. Also, esp. in scientific community, every library needs something lower level so, trying to compile everything in results in exponential dependency hikes. Optional components solve this very neatly.')
