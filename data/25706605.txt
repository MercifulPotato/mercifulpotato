Then marched straight from there to the capitol. Maybe there were some guns from others that didn&#x27;t come from the rally, I don&#x27;t know. I only know the only one that used a gun was the capitol police on an unarmed protestor. She was shot without warning while trying to climb through a door window.<p>We don&#x27;t know if the bombs were planted by Trump supporters or Antifa.<p>This wasn&#x27;t an assassination attempt but a rally that got out of hand. I watched the livestream. Did you know what most of them did when they were inside? They were in awe of the building and started taking selfies. Then most of them just stood there, unsure what to do. They even stayed inside the velvet ropes in Statuary Hall, like a bunch of tourists. Does that sounds like an armed insurrection?')
