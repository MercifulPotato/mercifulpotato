Item(by='dmayle', descendants=None, kids=[24990527], score=None, time=1604487248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985764, text='Since 2009, my requirements for a printer has always been:\n * Color (switched away from laser for this)\n * Printing and scanning (all-in-one)\n * Duplex printing and scanning\n * Automatic Document Feeder\n * Network print&#x2F;scan (Wireless and sometimes ethernet)<p>Before that, I&#x27;d been very happy with the Canon Pixma inkjets, and so I upgraded to the Pixma all-in-one (MX860, and later MX870), and I&#x27;ve sworn by this line.  Reasonable ink&#x2F;printing prices, great performance, fantastic network support.<p>Two years ago, we moved temporarily, so I bought a bargain basement Pixma TR4550 that checked off all of the boxes, but it was terrible.  The first time my wife used it, she thought it was garbage.  We made do, but I knew I wanted to change.<p>A year ago (after moving again), I had to add a requirement to the list.  My new daily computer was a chromebook, which doesn&#x27;t have scanning support, so I wanted a printer with some sort of scan-to-cloud solution.  I was also eyeing color laser printers, which are now at reasonable prices, since I used to prefer laser printers before color became a requirement.<p>Enter the Brother MFC-L3750CDW, which I bought for $340.  It&#x27;s a color laser all-in-one with everything I wanted (including ethernet)... <i>and</i> it supports both scan-to-Google Drive and scan-to-email!  This printer is nothing short of amazing.  I&#x27;ve never printed from my phone before, but my wife and I both do this regularly now.  I have two shortcut buttons in the interface, one for scanning directly to my email, one for my wife&#x27;s.  I have never installed a printer driver, every OS I&#x27;ve tried just prints directly to the thing (it&#x27;s autodiscovered when adding).<p>In short, Brother laser printers for the win!')
