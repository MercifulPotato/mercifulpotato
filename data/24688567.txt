I&#x27;ve observed that (for better and for worse), the culture of an organization is profoundly shaped by the dominant personality in the leadership team.<p>I have also in the past found myself being led by a deeply unethical individual, resulting (along with everyone else in the organization) in the difficult situation where we have had to collectively somehow drag the organization back out from under the lies (and perhaps fraud) committed by that single unethical leader.<p>This is a serious issue, and not something that we should take lightly. Not only have I experienced serious health repercussions from this episode in my life, but I have also seen other victims within the organization suffer emotional and psychological problems over the following years.<p>Creating a functioning, productive and healthy organization is such a critical activity - for all of us. It is something which by now we should know how to approach systematically and reliably, and yet I don&#x27;t yet see (or perhaps am simply not aware) of a state-of-the art approach to this, or even a useful set of metrics by which we can judge success.')
