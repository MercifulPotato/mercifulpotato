But, like many folks, I&#x27;m wary of this information being shared with others without my consent (or when my consent is non-optional).<p>Is there a better solution for looking up my own search history than syncing my Firefox history across multiple devices and querying the URLs directly? Is there a good Android app for automatically storing my lat&#x2F;long, mapping this to nearby locations from OSM, and syncing it to, say, a simple self-hosted database? Or possibly a good tool for syncing YouTube (or, better, all video) view histories across multiple devices like TVs and phones without logging in? None of these things seems like it is overly technically challenging, but it feels like a hole in some of the Google alternatives list I&#x27;ve seen.')
