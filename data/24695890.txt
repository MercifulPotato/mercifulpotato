I&#x27;m not sure the Chinese government would agree with your first statement. They seem to be getting significant US opposition to their technology advancement.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of some of the issues surrounding IP copying. I won&#x27;t call it theft because the word is contentious and there are those in this forum who don&#x27;t think you can steal ideas.<p>I&#x27;m also aware of the US&#x27; own history of gathering IP to bootstrap its industrial efforts.
