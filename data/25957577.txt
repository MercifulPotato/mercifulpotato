Put in place a physical security presence to contain and limit the damage, and address he worst cases involving violence, but also consider that escalation may not be appropriate. In a riot it unlikely you&#x27;re going to be able to quash it and clear it up completely, so you also need to make sure perpetrators don&#x27;t get away without consequences.<p>In the 2012 riots did the police really have no street presence at all? That&#x27;s not what I remember.')
