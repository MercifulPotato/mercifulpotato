Photos, for instance, are backed up on both services. Full resolution on Dropbox and whatever resolution on GPhotos. Dropbox is my real backup because it syncs to my PCs, and Photos is my convenient AI searchable backup for when I&#x27;m looking for a photo quickly.<p>And since Gmail&#x27;s inception, I&#x27;ve been using a forwarded pop (edit: I meant imap) address from a custom domain. I&#x27;ve been accessing my forwarded mail through Gmail for 15-ish years now. I remember there&#x27;s some fiddling in the settings and you have to make sure when you respond to an email that it responds with your custom address. But I&#x27;ve never had an issue all these years, and if Gmail were to drop tomorrow, I still have all my mail.')
