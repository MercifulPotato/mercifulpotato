But I&#x27;m also not looking to sell right now.<p>The reason I picked Tesla is that they are way more than just a car company.  They are a renewable energy company at a time when we are at an inflection point in renewable energy.  I&#x27;ve been downvoted before for saying that, but I don&#x27;t see Tesla as a car company and that&#x27;s why I invested and why I think it&#x27;s a mistake to compare their valuation to other car companies.<p>Tesla is involved in: Cars, solar panels, solar generation, a huge charger network, batteries, residential energy systems, and industrial energy systems.<p>Is it all down-side as OP speculated?  Only time will tell, of course, some targets are putting it at market cap halving over the next 5-7 years.  The most optimistic are putting it at quadrupling.  Most estimates seem to think that there&#x27;s room to go up.')
