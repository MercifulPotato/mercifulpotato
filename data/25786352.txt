This is the subject of MLK&#x27;s writing on justice and mutuality, that &#x27;an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere&#x27; as well as Niem√∂ller&#x27;s poem about &#x27;first they came for...&#x27;.<p>The question is really how to optimize awareness &amp; participation with personal wellbeing.
