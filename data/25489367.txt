The project leadership continuously makes weird decision rooted in the believe that Gnome is THE Linux DE and everyone should dance under their flute.<p>It does not help that project is riddled with technical issues (most notably memory leaks), quite inconvenient without installing a number of extensions (which often break from versions to version, no stable extension API, really? JS as the extension language does not help either) and fiddling with settings (e.g. to enable Ctrl+Alt+Left&#x2F;Right with grid workspace layout). I don&#x27;t have time to play with different DEs right now, but as soon as I find a suitable replacement, I quite probably will ditch Gnome for good.<p>Unfortunately, Gnome sucks a lot of corporate support, leaving alternative DEs quite dry in that regard, which significantly hinders their pace of development.<p>P.S.: The animated favicon is REALLY f<i></i>*g annoying.')
