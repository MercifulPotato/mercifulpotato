I guess it could be ten, or zero.<p>I don&#x27;t know what happens when a property is being rented though. E.g. Alice rents a house to Bob, they just signed the papers, suddenly they hear a crash and a meteorite lands on the table. Who can claim it?<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve found the answer at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacelegalissues.com&#x2F;space-law-meteorites-and-their-legal-status&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacelegalissues.com&#x2F;space-law-meteorites-and-th...</a><p>&quot;What about meteorites and their legal status? Legal solutions similar to the French one can be found in Morocco (the meteorites belong to those who find them), in Japan (the property of meteorites can be acquired by occupation), in England (the meteorite belongs to the landowner) or in the United States of America. However, any meteorite that has fallen on any part of the U.S. federal land (lands in the United States of America owned by the federal government) is insusceptible of private property, since it belongs de jure to the federal government.&quot;')
