You&#x27;ve entered into a new level of tactical nihilism here.<p>&gt; youâ€™re saying that I have the right to go to your home, plaster it with posters that you disagree with, then prevent you from removing them.<p>How is your personal home the same thing as a gigantic, billion-user social network that has effectively (especially in 2020) replaced the pub, the bar, the town square, and the public forum? It&#x27;s not, and you know it isn&#x27;t.<p>Step back and look at yourself: you&#x27;re defending the right of billion dollar corporations to tell you what you can and cannot say.<p>&gt; Does that sound like free speech to you?')
