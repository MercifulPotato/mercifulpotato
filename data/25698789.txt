Ignoring for a moment my instinct to down-vote unneeded sarcasm, I did my best to understand what&#x27;s going on, I still have no idea.<p>What are you trying to say? If you are Turkish and trying to make a point that here is some racism against Turks, as a Turkish-German, I&#x27;ve never witnessed that (other than a few flagged troll attempts). If you are Greek and trying to say (with too much sarcasm) that the Turks get a &quot;free pass&quot; or something, I don&#x27;t understand that either.<p>All these words, and what I&#x27;m trying to say is actually:<p>Please be clear :)')
