Item(by='remote_phone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606534746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233791, text='I’ve never worked in a company in Silicon Valley (I’m up to over 10 now over 20 years) where racism would just be silently tolerated. Never. I would certainly speak up against a manager who was casually racist or wouldn’t promote a good black engineer, knowing full well I might have to quit.<p>I’m sure racism exists but that type of overt racism that this article suggests, in the middle of SF especially in tech, is hard to believe.<p>So I take the accounts of some sort of systemic racism within Coinbase with a lot of skepticism. Especially the account of the support people who were forced to move to Portland. It sounds like all except one person was forced to move to Portland and both white and black people were asked. There’s a lot missing in that accusation which makes me think they are twisting things out of proportion.<p>I would love a more detailed account or talking with others. Could there be racists working in Coinbase? Sure. But this article doesn’t cover enough for me to not be skeptical without getting both sides of the story.')
