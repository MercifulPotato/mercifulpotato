The basic methodology is to prioritize the pages with the most pageviews + lowest helpfulness scores. Of course there&#x27;s a risk that we&#x27;re prioritizing our work based on data that isn&#x27;t indicative of our overall audience and due to the general nature of the question (&quot;was this page helpful?&quot;) we also don&#x27;t know how exactly the doc is unhelpful but in practice it&#x27;s usually easy to make an educated guess (e.g. one of the Lighthouse guides is very low rated, and when I checked on it recently I discovered it&#x27;s just a stub with very little guidance; so the educated guess is to add more guidance to the page; and then a few months from now I can see if the ratings have improved). Another good pattern is to provide a freeform textbox for feedback. The only reason we don&#x27;t have that is because Gooble considers it PII and I have to jump through hoops to store that data properly.')
