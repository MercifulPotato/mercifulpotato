One I ofter use (I work in biology) is that it is like a lab journal. A lab journal also needs to be in a specific format, dated, indexed, checked every now and then (by someone else), changes have to be dated and signed.. And it&#x27;s also hard :)<p>What make it less hard is something like vscode, just click the file you want to register the change that you made for, make a nice description, sign and date (commit).<p>I also went through the xkcd 1597 phase, we all do, but over time you start to appreciate the beauty. Like all hard things, take it easy and allow yourself to learn.<p>Maybe something easier will come along in the future, but also making it better will probably very difficult. It is more likely that more convenient layers are build on top of Git, imho.')
