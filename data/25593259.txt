The vast majority of hydrogen for fuel cells comes from petroleum and natural gas reserves.<p>&gt; New blast furnaces require trillions of yen (1 trillion yen equals $9.6 billion) in investment. Although DRI equipment produces less steel, the investment is estimated at less than half of blast furnaces<p>So they&#x27;re building a much more expensive furnace to produce less steel. Wouldn&#x27;t this create more pollution (not just carbon) because you&#x27;d want to hit the same outputs and now you need more energy?<p>I don&#x27;t understand &quot;zero-carbon&quot; in these cases. You still need trucks to bring in the tools and equipment to build the facility. All of them use hydrocarbons. You have hydrocarbons needed for the roads. Even if all your construction equipment is electric (they&#x27;re not) you still have all the massive amounts of carbon put in to producing the electric batteries, not to mention all the waste product that comes from creating lithium batteries.<p>Are they using all this coal and oil and then saying it&#x27;s being offset by some credit? How would that even remotely work? You plant a thousand trees for ever square meter? What about all the hydrocarbons needed to transport those seeds, feed the planting crews?<p>Most &quot;Green energy&quot; is really just burning trees (woodchips).<p>This whole zero-carbon thing would fall apart when you really started breaking it down. It&#x27;s marketing bullshit.')
