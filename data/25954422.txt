I saw maybe 1-2 kayakers a month, usually the guys from the old riot factory, no one knew about it. I found it only because my friend happened to live at habitat.<p>To be honest once people found out about it and the surf school started it was ruined, I never go anymore, Big Joe is still empty though most of the time, you have to be nuts to bring a suft board way out there, I think in 5 years I saw maybe 3 surfers out there and 2 arrived by jet ski.')
