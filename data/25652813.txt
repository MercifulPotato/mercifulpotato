But learning a language with an entirely different paradigm is really eye opener and will make you a better programmer even if you’ll never write a line of code in it. For example, learning Haskell is a really good way to learn about FP and then you can easily apply it in a not strictly FP language.<p>Prolog is interesting because it is really niche, and “learning it” as in solving a few easy problems will definitely not take much time but will add another way to think about a problem to your toolkit.')
