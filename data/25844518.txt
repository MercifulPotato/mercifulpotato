Since then, it helped me in many ways. Some random examples:<p>- At one of my previous jobs, there was a proprietary source control &#x2F; issue tracker &#x2F; timesheeting system that the customer forced on us. Everyone absolutely hated it, considered it clunky and super confusing. One day by chance I realized there&#x27;s an user manual in the Help menu, which I read end-to-end. And suddenly, I saw the system as easy to use, quite intuitive, and even somewhat likeable. Did wonders for my job satisfaction.<p>- My ability to use GDB went up an order of magnitude after I read the small book&#x27;s worth of user manual it ships with. Ever since, I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate Info pages that come with GNU software, and prefer that to skimming man pages.<p>- When we bought our current car, my wife printed out the manual and I read that cover-to-cover too. Discovered a bunch of tiny little features we would&#x27;ve never thought to look for otherwise.<p>At this point, I consider the skill of reading a manual end-to-end to be my little superpower :). And I&#x27;m deeply disappointed when a product (be it physical or software) doesn&#x27;t include a proper user&#x27;s manual.')
