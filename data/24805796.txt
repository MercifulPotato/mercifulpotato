Without Section 230 exceptions there&#x27;s no protection for <i>any</i> type of user generated content.<p>That means no user reviews of <i>anything</i>. No user contributed information so no more Wikipedia or OpenStreetMaps. No Wikis of any kind in fact. No hosting of public data sets for ML research. Forums would be a liability nightmare so they would go away.<p>Not only would current&#x2F;new instances of user generated content make sites liable but hosting any historical co rent as well. So to avoid liability the web would have to be scraped clean of user generated content.<p>Facebook and other large sites would be the <i>only</i> ones to survive because they could afford a moderator army. Your extremely short sighted position would basically leave only large content producers. The Internet would regress to the curated Online Service model but worse because user communication would need to be disallowed over heavily moderated.<p>You&#x27;re advocating for the Internet to turn into broadcast television. It&#x27;s sad that you either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t accept that implication.')
