Moreover, it uses a feature called Sealed Sender[0] to conceal even the cryptographic address of a message&#x27;s author. In contrast, Delta Chat leaks the email addresses of the people participating in a [group] conversation[1] (and, thus, their social network) not just to <i>one</i> provider (as in the case of Signal) but to all email providers involved in hosting the conversation, meaning that, as a user, you have to trust not just a single but multiple entities. Meanwhile, Signal doesn&#x27;t even know how many people there are in a group conversation.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sealed-sender&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sealed-sender&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delta.chat&#x2F;en&#x2F;help#how-does-delta-chat-protect-my-metadata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delta.chat&#x2F;en&#x2F;help#how-does-delta-chat-protect-my-me...</a>')
