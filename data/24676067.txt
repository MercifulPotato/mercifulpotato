If someone opens a bug report that factually represents behavior they&#x27;ve seen, and provides supporting evidence and information, and you react that way, you should probably re-examine your world view and think hard about why you believe that everyone is out to unfairly criticize your work.<p>&gt; <i>If it turns out that &quot;command X&quot; crashes for you...</i><p>As a project maintainer, I hope you recognize that people will run your software on all sorts of hardware and software configurations that don&#x27;t match how you&#x27;ve tested it.  It&#x27;s impossible for you to test all possible scenarios.  Requiring that every potential bug reporter explicitly acknowledge that their issue might be unique to their particular setup in order to assuage your apparently-fragile ego is unreasonable and counter-productive.')
