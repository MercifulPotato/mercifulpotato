I imagine pair programming resources would work too.<p>There are tons of videos of people live coding on Youtube&#x2F;Twitch but I find the majority of them often work on problems relatively trivial, do not explain their thought process very well or just don&#x27;t write easy to read&#x2F;modular code. Some examples of what I&#x27;d consider very high quality streams:<p>Hacking with Andrew and Brad: an HTTP&#x2F;2 client [0]<p>Porting flamegraph to Rust [1]<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yG-UaBJXZ80\n[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jTpK-bNZiA4')
