As long as voter turnout is consistently above 10-20%, with the 2-party system you&#x27;re simply not going to get the vote count number to span the several magnitudes needed to induce Benford&#x27;s Law. (Exception of course for smaller&#x2F;independent candidates, and perhaps if one of the major candidates really sucked and kept getting 10% of the votes)')
