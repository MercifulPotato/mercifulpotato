He is CTO and is in the trenches building the rockets. He is fully cognizant of the whole machine and he expects his engineers to be also. That way the design can be changed without regard to departmental infighting, etc. The best part is no part and always trying to get little improvements. Not something NASA can do with specs fixed in place for manufacturing in 40 different states 5 years in advance.<p>Of course he does not &quot;build&quot; the whole thing, but he has a vision that inspires people and the technical chops to lead from the front lines. And the endurance to put in productive 80-100hr work weeks for decades.')
