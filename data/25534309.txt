The correct design on modern &quot;intelligent&quot; buses is very simple. You standardize a class of device, and then you implement that class, OS vendors supply a class driver that works, out of the box, with every device in the class.<p>USB Mass Storage is the worst case of that approach (vendors with different ideas of how to solve it just agreed to differ and the standard offers all combinations of their preferred methods) but it&#x27;s still better than the alternative.<p>Other approaches are <i>crazy</i>, they produce a worse user experience and usually introduce perverse incentives that make life worse for everybody.<p>If there are in fact &quot;issues&quot; with &quot;vanilla USB&quot; you don&#x27;t fix those by having every single vendor hand roll their own attempted workaround and ship each of them.')
