Barbed wire is extremely cheap and is enough to generally contain grazing livestock contained but a lot of wildlife can freely move around them meaning their habitat doesn&#x27;t get cut up and cut off from itself. A tall fence buried deep enough to keep wolves from digging under would be very expensive.')
