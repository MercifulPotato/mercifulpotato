A64FX has all that (incl. assistant cores in addition to the regular ones and on-chip RAM with HBM interface) AND SVE, not just bare SVE as your comment seems to imply. And of course a big redesign would be necessary, I never implied it&#x27;s ready to be put in the next MS Surface. But screaming that all processor vendors are 100 years behind Apple is a bit questionable.<p>So my thoughts were: cool, Apple is bringing some of the processor developments to mass market that I didn&#x27;t think would hit the market for another 5 years. I am just a bit sad to see everyone (esp on HN) saying it was never seen before.')
