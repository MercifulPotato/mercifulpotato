It&#x27;s from 1978, still four years before Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The claim is that it <i>is</i> the best selling computer, in 1978, not that it always will be.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s interesting information. The phrasing of it as an exception to the claims of the ad is strange and confusing.')
