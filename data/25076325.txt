I feel like there is an impetus in the &#x27;rational&#x27; tech press to want to downplay threats like nuclear war, and emphasize dubious threats like AGI.<p>I really don&#x27;t care if nuclear war doesn&#x27;t kill <i>every single human instantly</i>. So what? Full scale nuclear war means instant civilization collapse....<i>full stop</i>.  Should we forget about disarmament?....guess not every single person theoretically dies....as in the AGI apocalypse fantasy land scenario....so let&#x27;s not worry too much.')
