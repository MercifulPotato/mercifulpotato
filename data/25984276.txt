There is no standards document I&#x27;ve ever seen which names kafka explicitly.<p>Kafka has some benefits (lovely API) and some tradeoffs (hard to maintain, zookeeper is a bit of a mess). But there are obviously a lot of other ways to build successful, scalable software. WhatsApp was implemented on top of Erlang, and scaled to over 500m users when they had only 35 employees.<p>I want to disagree with your claim that kafka should be considered the default option - but you haven&#x27;t dignified your (controversial) claim with any actual arguments. There&#x27;s nothing here to even disagree with.')
