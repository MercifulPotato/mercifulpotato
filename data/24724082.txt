If you invent something, say, a new battery, and somebody else copies it, doesn&#x27;t have your R&amp;D-costs invested and prices it accordingly lower than you, the market will &quot;reward them&quot; by buying from them instead of you, they&#x27;re getting the same thing after all.<p>We do want some stability though, if you invest money to create something and somebody immediately copies it, you&#x27;re not going to invest money again. We want you to invest money to advance humanity with new technology and knowledge though.<p>Since there&#x27;s no re-implementation without looking at the original, it feels sufficiently close to taking your buddy&#x27;s homework and saying &quot;no worries, I will change it a bit&quot; and you&#x27;ll have Math.add(a, b) and while they wrote <i>return a + b;</i>, you&#x27;ll write <i>return b + a;</i>, you&#x27;re not copying after all.')
