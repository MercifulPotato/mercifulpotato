The point of this paper is to provide modeling not only of the scalar output of the drake equation (which is... not used at all) but of the possible spatial and temporal distribution of intelligent life in the galaxy. For example, it turns out that even for wildly different choices of the unknowns, the region (and age) of the Milky Way that contains most life (i.e. that SETI should focus on) is the same.<p>Also, why do you consider &quot;unknown&quot; a problem when they explicitly set out to investigate the influence of these parameters? For example, they explore Pann of 0.0, 0.5 and 0.99 (per Myr). Could you explain what problem you see here?')
