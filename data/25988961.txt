Then some people need different\nsettings so you add config files and parsers&#x2F;dependencies for\nthose. At some point you update the model and now it can&#x27;t\nproperly differentiate Mandarin, Cantonese and short Japanese\nphrases anymore. You start adding cross-platform support and\nother features, and now some people say it&#x27;s too slow on their\nRaspberry Pi Zero setup. Bloggers complain as they have to\nrearrange some quotes via trial-and-error so the heuristics pick\nup the correct language. Unfortunately that makes it worse for\npeople running the older version 0.7.<p>After this rant it should be obvious, but: I prefer just adding\na [&quot;en&quot;] or similar and stop worrying about it.')
