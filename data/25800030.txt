We&#x27;re trying for something different here, and it&#x27;s not possible to have both.<p>Also, please stop using HN primarily for political battle. We ban accounts that do that (regardless of which politics they&#x27;re battling for), because it destroys what HN is supposed to be for. I had to go quite a way back in your comment history to get to a place where you weren&#x27;t doing that. Fortunately I eventually found it so I&#x27;m not going to ban you right now, but can you please review <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and use HN in the intended spirit?')
