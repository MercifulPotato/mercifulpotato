Writing in 2013, le Carré said that his &quot;readers hated me for it&quot;»<p>It’s a book about a bunch of idiots bungling stuff. Perhaps if I was in the IC or had come of age during the dusk of the empire I’d get its alleged biting satire, but otherwise it’s just very slow moving, without compelling characters or a particularly interesting or intelligent plot.')
