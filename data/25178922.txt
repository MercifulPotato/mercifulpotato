Twitter responded that it violated their policies and was removed.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that he was also subjected to threats-- after all, his own comments sets a tone where casual assault is, apparently, okay.  It&#x27;s not okay. It&#x27;s not okay when he does it nor is it okay for people to do it in retaliation.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be a dick&quot; has always been good advice.')
