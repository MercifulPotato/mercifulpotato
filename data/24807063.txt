The market, which already suffered<p>&gt; from low panel volumes (caused by the COVID-19 pandemic),<p>&gt; has now been practically drained of grade-A LCD panels<p>&gt; within the target price-range.

Open<p>&gt; market LCD panels come without warranty or reliable<p>&gt; quality assurance that vendors always offer.<p>&gt; According to some projections LCD panels ought to be<p>&gt; available again in December. Granted this projection is<p>&gt; accurate, we may see new batches available prior to the<p>&gt; Chinese New Year (February 2021).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pine64.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;update-new-hacktober-gear&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pine64.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;update-new-hacktober-gear&#x2F;</a>')
