It&#x27;s a very unnatural landscape, historically speaking.<p>Scotland (along with the rest of the UK) cut down most of their old growth forests in the industrial revolution, and also eliminated all of the large predators. As a result, the wild deer population is out of control, and even with management (read: stalking wild deer) there are so many deer that it&#x27;s impossible to simply plant trees and have them reforest; deer will eat and destroy the saplings before they can mature.<p>This arrests the natural reforestation that would occur over time, and makes even managed projects expensive -- for example here&#x27;s a charity that is working on reforesting a plot of land in Scotland: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bordersforesttrust.org&#x2F;places&#x2F;wild-heart&#x2F;carrifran-wildwood&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bordersforesttrust.org&#x2F;places&#x2F;wild-heart&#x2F;carrifran-w...</a>. They had to hire someone to kill deer on their land to protect the new trees, even after expensive plastic casings.<p>That&#x27;s a long-winded bit of context, but the summarized argument for re-introducing large predators is that they would help to control the damaging and out-of-balance wild deer population, reducing the amount of human intervention required, and allowing the countryside to revert back to its natural forested state.')
