Item(by='ivanhoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609893189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652742, text='Back in the University I&#x27;ve had an assignment in Prolog that I&#x27;ve completely forgot about, so night before the deadline I&#x27;ve sit down around 9-10pm with a huge cup of coffee and by 4am I&#x27;ve learned enough Prolog to finish it (it was a simple path finder for the given graph), I even had some time left for a nap that night. And trust me, I was more than average programmer at that moment - had a lot of enthusiasm and energy back then, but not that much previous experience and I&#x27;ve literally never seen Prolog before. So if you&#x27;re interested in playing with a quite unique syntax and a mental model of Prolog, just go for it, it will not be a huge investment of your time. You can easily cover the basics in a couple of weekends in your leisure time, instead of Netflix or something.')
