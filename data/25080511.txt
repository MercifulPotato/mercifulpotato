I wonder what would be more effective; nuking the targets that have been designated by various states already since the cold war, or piling up all the nukes, maybe a few km underground, and trigger a cataclysmic event (like a supervolcano as mentioned on the page).<p>Re: climate change, they could accellerate the process a bit and nuke the north and south pole ice, maybe. Or spread a darkening agent on any exposed ice to increase heat absorption.<p>But anyway, I don&#x27;t think any of these would completely sterilize the earth, possibly only humanity and other large animals. To sterilize it, we need to get rid of the atmosphere and most of the earth&#x27;s crust. I guess a big enough asteroid could do it (think moon-sized), something whose impact is so big it breaks up the whole ball.')
