Much radical decentralisation advocacy seems to embody little more than wishful thinking.  Centralisation affords efficiencies, but at a cost of resilience, as has been widely realised of late, and of power control, if my notions here are accurate.<p>One possible resolution is to accept necessary, or inevitable, network control points &#x2F; monopolies, but to ensure that control is shared, distributed, democratic, and&#x2F;or principled.  Public utlities, multiple stakeholders, public input, and the like.<p>Capture, corruption, apathy, mismanagement, incentives alignment, and the like, remain risks.')
