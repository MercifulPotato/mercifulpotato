I would say designed but that would be an insult to people that actually did&#x2F;do design languages.<p>You can&#x27;t actually fix it, you can only make it worse.<p>Simple point: Adding optimizations doesn&#x27;t speed C++ compilers up faster than having do those optimizations slows them down.<p>Solution, stop using C++ for anything.<p>The most hopeful thing in the last 5 years is the move to remove C++ from new languages tool chains. Good because C++ is hopelessly broken.')
