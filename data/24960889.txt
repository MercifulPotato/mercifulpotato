In theory the goal for a lot is to have a dumb client like you said but that&#x27;s rarely the case.<p>If you can have your apps share their data models between both android and iOS you can have the apps share the HTTP request&#x2F;response handling and their DB code etc and then it truly becomes just a dumb client.<p>YouTube&#x2F;Netflix also have complex video encoding&#x2F;playback code that can be written in c++ and shared between clients.<p>Most social media apps liek FB&#x2F;Insta&#x2F;Snapchat have complex camera and photo handling code as well as async messaging code. Which if you have things like retries or photo compression&#x2F;encryption you&#x27;d probably want to share between clients. etc..')
