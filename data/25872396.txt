At the same time you shouldn&#x27;t use such a &quot;proof&quot; as an excuse to dismiss conflicting information.<p>Bitcoin mining is a very competitive field. Information about the actual energy mix and location of miners are guarded secrets. Researchers are thus using models to estimate these holes.<p>Estimates on the electricity consumption of Bitcoin in 2018 are ranging from ~20 TWh&#x2F;yr to &gt;100 TWh&#x2F;yr. Some papers assume coal fossil power only (0% renewables), global average energy mix (~10% renewables) or a regional energy mixes (~73% renewables [0]).<p>Based on my experience with papers in that area, is that more recent papers with more complex models tend to produce higher estimates of the shares of renewables. It seems reasonable to me that Bitcoin is greener than many other industries because energy costs are the dominating factor in mining profitability and Bitcoin allows you to convert excess energy into money - at any remote location on this planet as long as you have an internet connection.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinshares.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;resources&#x2F;Research&#x2F;bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinshares.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;resources&#x2F;Research&#x2F;bitcoin-min...</a>')
