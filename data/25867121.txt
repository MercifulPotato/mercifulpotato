Instead of the US Government being able to routinely compel Apple, Google, FB, Amazon, etc to to hand over data they just say &quot;we don&#x27;t have the keys&quot;. The fact that any of these entities could find a way to get the data if they wanted (yes, even Apple, even with E2E could have an insider attack where a rogue spy employee implanted some code in the OS to intercept data)<p>Allowing the service providers to say &quot;we don&#x27;t have it&quot;, makes widespread government attack less scalable, because instead of focusing on one entity, suddenly they&#x27;ve got to chase down thousands of individuals and compel them. And the individuals usually have a lot less to lose if they don&#x27;t obey than a tech company with billions on the line.')
