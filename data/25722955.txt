I finally swapped to desktop linux last year and tried to be very mindful about all the little niggling issues I ran in to.<p>I think the difference between an okay piece of software and a great piece of software is how cognizant the designers and developers are of these things. It&#x27;s partially why I use an iphone now over android. Even if I disagree with how something is done it&#x27;s usually evident that Apple at least _thought_ about it. It&#x27;s not perfect, there&#x27;s still the occasional interaction that&#x27;s just plain bad, but those moments are much rarer than I encounter on my PCs (Xubuntu&#x2F;MX Linux).<p>If I ever have the resources to retire I think I&#x27;d dedicate a solid chunk of my time to just work on those quality issues.<p>Just to preempt the replies, this is how most of these conversations go:<p>Alice: I dislike [x] because I can&#x27;t do [a].<p>Bob: Oh, why are you trying to do [a]? You can accomplish that by doing [b], [c], and then [d]. [a] doesn&#x27;t really make sense, let me explain the model behind how this all works.<p>Alice: Thanks for explaining the model to me, but I still just want to do [a]. Could we expand the model, or handle this as an edge case?<p>Bob &lt;any of the following replies&gt;<p><pre><code>  : No! [a] breaks the model! Things are much simpler if you just embrace the model.\n\n  : If you want to do [a] go use this other product that&#x27;s broken in other slightly annoying ways.\n\n  : If you want to do it, you can open a PR adding it. But we probably won&#x27;t add it because it doesn&#x27;t fit the current model, and we consider that &#x27;bloat&#x27;.\n\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s difficult to get into contributing to some of these projects because you come in with a change you want to make, but you have no standing in the project to effect that change (or are out of your depth and need to convince a more established dev to help you). Which makes perfect sense, a project with random contributors adding their own preferences is anarchy.<p>It really seems like the best projects have a very strong guideline&#x2F;interactions framework, or a BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) who takes UX very personally. Most open-source projects are founded with a strong technical vision, but not a strong UX one.<p>The closest I can think of in the open-source desktop space is ElementaryOS. Which is lovely, but I dislike a few of their core decisions enough that using it is a pain.<p>The dream is a DE that enforces strict UX paradigms...but also lets you customize them easily. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s even possible. Even Apple isn&#x27;t perfect and they&#x27;re just trying to enforce one &#x27;Apple way&#x27; to do things.')
