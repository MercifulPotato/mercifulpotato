The Salieri March is actually a Mozart piece “Non piu andrai”[0] from Marriage of Figaro that the film makers “dumbed down” to make it a simple little tune that Mozart could fix in front of the emperor (and show off Mozart’s improv skills).  It was a clever way to sneak another Mozart piece into the movie.  One of my favorite scenes too!<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;yz8n2tVyGwc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;yz8n2tVyGwc</a>')
