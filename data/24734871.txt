Some things will fall flat because they seemed awesome only to you, but that&#x27;s okay.<p>This isn&#x27;t gram obviously, which I nuked because it wasn&#x27;t   serving a business or personal branding purpose for sometime, but I will slip back in for a vintage car restoration.<p>If someone cares about votes, they&#x27;ll be a slave to them and:<p>- worry more what other people think of them that writing, doing, or creating<p>- they&#x27;ll censor themselves about something they feel strongly about and regret it<p>- they&#x27;ll do something incredibly stupid for attention and regret it, such as jumping on top of a moving freight train. Don&#x27;t. Or get pulled over by 4 UFOs for doing a buck 40 (mph, that&#x27;s 225 kph). Don&#x27;t do that either. Or drop a cover over their motorcycle license plate and outrun the cops from a highway on city streets. Don&#x27;t do that either. Or have insanely hot sex at work in the back stairwell just before the lunch rush. You get the idea. You don&#x27;t need social media for the best things in life; some things are best not shared but lifecasting is cool too.<p>- Don&#x27;t become a trained monkey performer unless it&#x27;s a determined career path.<p>On HN, express yourself with reason and evidence, and let the chips fall where they may. On gram, it&#x27;s different because it&#x27;s about displaying moments, creations, and art publicly and let the critics do whatever the heck they&#x27;re going to do; it&#x27;s a museum or a show-and-tell where folks have probably had some champagne already and also cyberdisinhibitionism, so feedback needs some big ass grains of salt.<p>Meditate on being more like Peter in Office Space after hypnosis and be awesome. Votes are for other people. Take it only as feedback after the fact, not before. Risk being booed on-stage.<p>Peace, out')
