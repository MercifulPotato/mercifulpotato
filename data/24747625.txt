My initial reaction was &quot;It&#x27;s kind of weird to just hop into a video call not knowing what to expect on the other end&quot; but it&#x27;s no weirder really than...walking into a store (the &quot;door bell ringing&quot; metaphor is what it made it click for me).<p>But also it would just be great to replace the generic sales meeting that currently happens over Zoom&#x2F;Meet with this - you could do a lot of fun things with this, like a customized lobby that lets you play with the product while you wait&#x2F;talk for example.')
