The author is notorious for being directionally correct in his opinions,<p>I&#x27;ve read it and I agree. Although he does admit in the beginning that there basically is not much conclusive facts about sleep, hence his motivation for writing the book. It&#x27;s implied that what he is saying is fact, and its a lot more correlation than I think panacea.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also commonly known that people get less sleep than they think they do.<p>A few things IIRC from the book:<p>- The specific number is irrelevant as long as its &quot;around 7~9&quot;<p>- If you&#x27;re lying down &#x2F; resting this still &quot;counts&quot; (its not as impactful, but still beneficial)<p>If people don&#x27;t want to read the book, the JRE podcast is actually pretty good at summarizing whats in the book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig</a><p>Good high level points about what to do to get to sleep (5 things):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;pwaWilO_Pig?t=3011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;pwaWilO_Pig?t=3011</a>')
