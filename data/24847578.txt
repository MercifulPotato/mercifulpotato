Sure they&#x27;ll be doing their share of sub-optimal subqueries and head bumping trying to write group by queries. But in the end I think this would make them better developers who knew the underlying software and application logic, not just the API of the ORM.<p>Yet we don&#x27;t really live in that kind of ideal world and there are many factors that people have to consider. If everybody else in the company is using ORM, why shouldn&#x27;t you. Or, if you just need to ship products and don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy learning SQL. Or, if you don&#x27;t know how to properly abstract the structured SQL queries without making it a huge mess. Saying that ORM is better&#x2F;worse is like saying everybody likes music.<p>If I&#x27;m building a Nodejs app I would choose not to use ORM. For other languages and frameworks I&#x27;d probably reconsider and evaluate my options.<p>To me however, the biggest benefit of using no ORM is the learning of SQL. Time and time again that proves itself so invaluable, and I&#x27;m immensely happy I&#x27;ve learnt the quirks of SQL instead of some language specific API. If I can code faster with ORM that&#x27;s great, but in ideal world I would much rather learn SQL and become a master of it rather than of some ORM.')
