More bling is literally more resources.<p>A lot of it is merely feature creep. Remember when OSX used to have animations (like applications minimizing like a genie getting sucked back into its kettle) as a feature you could turn on if you wanted it? Now it&#x27;s pretty much default, and most people don&#x27;t know you can shut that stuff off. And that&#x27;s how things get sluggish. Sexy new &quot;advanced&quot; features become default, and you always need faster computers and more memory to keep up.<p>If you insist on using Gnome or KDE, obviously bloated because <i>everything</i> has extra features enabled by default, then then shut those resource hogs off. You&#x27;ll start to get back to fast desktop days again. Some people will miss the bling, but you can&#x27;t have one without the other. You can&#x27;t expect all that sweet sweet bling without the resources being tied up to make it happen.')
