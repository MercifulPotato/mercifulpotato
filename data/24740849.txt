Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602354547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739999, text='<i>&gt; Such a book (or whatever book-like device, i.e. a list of inputs with corresponding outputs) that allows a person to interact with someone in a language they don&#x27;t speak is an absurdity, it cannot exist.</i><p>And that, right there, is a sufficient rebuttal to Searle&#x27;s argument, as many critics have pointed out. The premise of Searle&#x27;s argument is that such a setup could pass the Turing test, which is absurd. So his argument fails because it is based on an absurd premise.<p><i>&gt; the notion is not far from the bone-headed simplicity of early AI and machine translation efforts.</i><p>That&#x27;s a valid criticism of early AI and machine translation efforts, but Searle did not put forward his argument just as a criticism of those efforts. He put forward his argument as a claim that <i>no</i> efforts at AI that used digital computers, <i>ever</i>, could produce anything that was conscious the way humans are conscious. But, as above, his argument was based on an absurd premise, and, what&#x27;s more, an attempt at building a conscious entity with digital computers does not have to satisfy that premise.')
