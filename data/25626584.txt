If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.<p>Are you sure about the latter? How do you know that the people that click the ugly ad werenâ€™t just curious about what it was because of how it looked rather than what it was about?')
