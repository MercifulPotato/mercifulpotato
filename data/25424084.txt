It is much harder for us to figure this out, looking from the outside.<p>For Apple Fitness+, it might sell more watches, but the reason it requires a watch is because the product includes sensors that read useful data during the fitness experience that other devices simply don&#x27;t have.<p>Given Tim Cook has stated publicly that what Apple wants to be most known for when looking back on the company is improvements to people&#x27;s health, I don&#x27;t think Fitness+ was spun up to sell watches. It was created out of a genuine priority for the company to have a certain impact on the world.<p>I also don&#x27;t believe the purpose of Apple TV+ and Arcade was to create Apple One. It seems like they genuinely are trying to come up with a unique service for these two areas. Apple One is just a bundling. They are also responses to growing problems. Apple Arcade is an answer to the growing problem of in app purchases and advertising. They want to create a pure, fun gaming experience that you can put in front of your kids and not worry about it. I think Apple TV+ is more about business deals required to build the Apple TV app itself. You aren&#x27;t going to have a seat at the table if you aren&#x27;t serious about buying and delivering content.')
