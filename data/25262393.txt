You cannot prove a negative (except in extremely bounded cases, of which the mask proposition is not one).<p>This is why statistical studies attempt to provide evidence supporting an alternative hypothesis. If you cannot <i>accept the alternative hypothesis</i>, you must accept the null. Studies do not attempt to <i>disprove</i> the alternative hypothesis, and accept it otherwise.<p>This study attempted to find statistically convincing evidence that masks provided personal protection, and failed to do so. Does it mean that they have <i>proven</i> that masks <i>don&#x27;t</i> work? Of course not. There are many reasons why they might have failed to detect a real effect. But it does imply that whatever effect is being hypothesized is smaller than the power of the study they used to detect it.')
