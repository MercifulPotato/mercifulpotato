But if you want to use a similar analogy. Assume there is toll road which allows the first 100 cars. \nThis guy uses his superior tech skills, to get his clients (cars) in the first 100. He charges them a premium.<p>Now the toll road keepers, arrest him for helping his clients? That I think is wrong. If his clients had complained that he didn&#x27;t deliver on his promise but charged money, then that could amount to cheating. He didn&#x27;t do that. He used code he wrote to provide a service to his clients.<p>Yes I agree, it could be hacky code, and it worked because the website was itself sub optimal. But putting him into prison because the website couldn&#x27;t be made better (prevent his hack) amounts to bullying to hide the technical incompetence.')
