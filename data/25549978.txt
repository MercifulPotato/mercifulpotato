Multiple parallel requests may get caught in a rate limiter, and impose much more work on the backend than a cursor (multiple unnecessarysort&#x2F;discards). It&#x27;s not a given that spamming a service gets you all the data any faster than using a cursor.<p>&gt; With non-opaque offsets these can be done in parallel.
