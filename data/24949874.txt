Reduce known and common sources of ignition, reducing their frequency (PG&amp;E should be involved in this)<p>2. Regularly do controlled burns so that huge fires are rarer<p>3. Improve standoff room so that when fires do happen, they do less damage to where the people actually are. (This is the town and property owner&#x27;s responsibility)<p>Number 3 is really important, because some of the worst hit areas in CA were built way too close to the interface between wilderness and urban areas. Living among the trees might be really nice, but when the fire comes there will be no stopping it at all.')
