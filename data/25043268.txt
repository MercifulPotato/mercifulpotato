Stories on HN don&#x27;t have to be about hacking, because good hackers aren&#x27;t only interested in hacking, but they do have to be deeply interesting.<p>What does &quot;deeply interesting&quot; mean? It means stuff that teaches you about the world. A story about a robbery, for example, would probably not be deeply interesting. But if this robbery was a sign of some bigger, underlying trend, perhaps it could be. &lt;&lt;')
