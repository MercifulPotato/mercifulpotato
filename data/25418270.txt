If you&#x27;re outside, you&#x27;re going to need a mask at some point. Especially in New York City, where you are almost certainly leaving your building via crowded corridors. You put on a mask when you leave your apartment, and if you leave it on, it&#x27;s one fewer thing to think about when you get to your destination.<p>It&#x27;s not at all difficult to run with a mask on. The holes in a mask are far, far larger than air molecules. I wear one when running in places where I might encounter people, and there is absolutely zero effect on my breathing. The only reason I take it off is that it can get sweaty.<p>In fact, with the weather as cold as it is, I find people wearing masks when running just to warm their breath. It gets lung-burningly cold in New York.<p>The mask is very little hassle, and it doesn&#x27;t require optimization. These people aren&#x27;t suffering from wearing a mask outdoors. It could just be convenience and getting on with their lives, and as good New Yorkers couldn&#x27;t care less what you think about them.')
