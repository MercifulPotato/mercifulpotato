Item(by='andrewla', descendants=None, kids=[24708096], score=None, time=1602077735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707450, text='I think this is a simplification that in some ways is ignoring the main point of this article -- the Paneka kick described in the article is a kick up the middle; relying on exactly that sort of decision process by the goalkeeper.<p>And the new-style kick being touted is also a meta game -- trying to telegraph a still-likely-to-succeed-on-power-alone kick and changing it up for a less powerful less reliable kick to the opposite side.<p>If the telegraphed kick were less of a threat (that is, if the anticipated speed of the kick were slower) then the goaltender would not have to commit as much. The subtleties here are interesting, though the article is missing a discussion of failed attempts at the Paneka and the Tielemans-style kick.')
