This isn&#x27;t an all or nothing &quot;digital bad&quot; &quot;bureaucrats bad&quot; situation. It&#x27;s Amazon and one complaint. This guy should find a good lawyer and take them to court. He had proof that his stuff was not counterfit. Adding some arbitrary &quot;you have to have a receipt no more than 365 days old&quot; is ridiculous. Amazon just doesn&#x27;t care. Even for a 1.5 million dollars worth of stock. What are the chances that they give a hoot about the average guy on the street? It seems to me like they could do something sensible like &quot;we have 4 complaints out of 10000 orders, chances are these are just peeved customers, tell him make them whole&quot;. That seems like just basic logic to me.')
