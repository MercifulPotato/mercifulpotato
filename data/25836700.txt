Item(by='michaericalribo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611080541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833328, text='Lots of comments here to the effect of &quot;novelists don&#x27;t need full-featured rich styling*, it&#x27;s all just plain text!&quot; It&#x27;s true for _many_ novels.<p>But it&#x27;s not true for _all_ novels! House of Leaves (Danielewski) and S. (Abrams&#x2F;Dorst) are full-fledged multimedia novels. Many fantasy novels use maps; Crying of Lot 49 uses at least 1 image, in situ. And I would love to see an edition of Pale Fire (Nabokov) that interposes annotations between the &quot;original formatting&quot; of the poem!<p>&quot;The novel&quot; isn&#x27;t really a well-defined concept...there are many interpretations of the basic concept! The high % of novels that are &quot;just text&quot; is descriptive, not prescriptive.<p>* Use whatever definition of &quot;rich text&quot; you like, I don&#x27;t care')
