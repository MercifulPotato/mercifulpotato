Typically this lack of positive tests is used to invalidate the experience of people with those conditions (usually women). This often seems to come from the implicit assumption that we know all the physiological markers and mechanisms of autoimmune disease, when nothing could be further from the truth. We know very little, and how a patient feels matters.')
