For example, if I buy kindle books instead of physical books, my kids can&#x27;t enjoy those books when I&#x27;m gone. I have a car that can now do software unlocking of physical features (e.g. rear heated seats). Am I adding value to the car which I can sell to the next person, or am I licensing the right to that feature for the duration for my own use.<p>We&#x27;re moving to a model where we spend the same, but their value is zero when considering the value of our assets.')
