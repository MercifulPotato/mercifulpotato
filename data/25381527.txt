I don&#x27;t mean to say that, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a doornail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country&#x27;s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that RHN was as dead as a doornail.”<p>With apologies to Charles Dickens[0].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;46&#x2F;46-h&#x2F;46-h.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;46&#x2F;46-h&#x2F;46-h.htm</a>')
