Item(by='Veedrac', descendants=None, kids=[25047395], score=None, time=1604939537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25035951, text='&gt; The point of the quote is to show there are no limits curtailing liberties, not an absolute we shouldn&#x27;t bother. The attempt to spin the quote into something else, probably because, you wish to &quot;protect the children&quot; is proving the point.<p>This is not even remotely how you used it. My argument is one where there are obvious checks and balances, where government power is clearly and significantly limited, and little is left exclusively to government trust.<p>Yet because I mentioned that there are actual people being actually raped, I get Godwin&#x27;s Law&#x27;d. Not because I advocated for Chinese style state control. Not because I took away liberties that most people even care about, given most people are perfectly happy using Google services. But because I dared mention that real people are suffering.<p>This happens every time on HN, no matter how moderate my position. Anything even remotely compromising the Bottom Line (universal perfect cryptographic security) is Hitler.')
