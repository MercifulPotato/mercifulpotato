The object that owns the &quot;modal UI&quot; part would own, or at least aggregate, a right-click menu. The canvas shouldn&#x27;t be busy handling right-click menus anyway, it should provide an interface to access and manipulate the underlying bitmap. The &quot;modal UI&quot; would own the right-click handler, and would populate the context menu with a filtered choice of options, including functionality provided by different objects.<p>It&#x27;s more complex than naive approach with everything being owned by a single one, but fundamentally not that different from a design you&#x27;d arrive to if you were intended to allow for plugins in your application - except now the &quot;plugin manager&quot; isn&#x27;t in your app, but in your OS.<p>&gt; <i>You would also have to wait for your OS to implement 10-bit support for it - I&#x27;m pretty sure that e.g. Krita had 10-bit canvas before MS Paint :)</i><p>Krita people could provide a 10-bit canvas implementation that offers an 8-bit canvas-compatible interface. Alternatively, your UI could require canvas objects implementing a 10-bit canvas interface, but you - or a third party - would also provide an adapter (polyfill, as the kids say today) that wraps the MS Paint 8-bit canvas behind a 10-bit canvas interface.<p>--<p>The teaching point you bring up is a strong one, and I don&#x27;t have a good answer. I think Microsoft&#x27;s COM, the Emacs ecosystem and every game with a large modding scene (e.g. Kerbal Space Program) all provide evidence that a fully interoperable system turns users into sysadmins. You don&#x27;t need to <i>code</i> to use such a system, but you&#x27;d better be prepared to be aware of all the components, and do a bit of configuring, if you want anything other than the defaults.<p>(But, as every game with a large modding scene demonstrates, it&#x27;s not necessarily that hard for regular non-tech-savvy users either.)')
