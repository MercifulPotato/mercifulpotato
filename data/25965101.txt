While I can appreciate the concept of basically just using standard libraries to teach CS fundamentals in theory, in practice it just means the only things available to you are mostly leetcode-esque academic coding. Would have loved an assignment like this in my 1st or 2nd year. I was probably not aware of stuff like curses libraries until my senior year if that.')
