The data caps and high internet costs are pushed onto the public because someone has to pay the ISPs. If Net Neutrality was repealed, Google, Netflix etc. would largely pay for it and the public wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for it. You could argue that this would mean these companies would factor in the cost in the services they provide anyway, but it would open the market to more decentralized internet, which would be better for everyone.<p>Net Neutrality is what keeps the internet favorable to large internet corporations... and the lobbies and special interest groups and all of these corporations put out so much propaganda when it comes to this discussion.<p>Imagine if people and large corporate entities had to pay the same amount of tax regardless of how much they made, and everyone called it &quot;financial equality&quot;. That&#x27;d be retarded... and so is this.')
