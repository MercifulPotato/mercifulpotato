I found a technical example in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anu.dev&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;associativity.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anu.dev&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;associativity.html</a>, but it was unconvincing. In their example, three way merge should produce a conflict for a human to resolve it. Which is good, we don&#x27;t want a &#x27;smart&#x27; tool to do the wrong thing and silently introduce bugs. If the argument is that pijul&#x2F;anu reduce the number of conflicts by exploiting history, is there a quantization of this benefit for practical workloads, e.g. popular git repos?')
