Item(by='ALittleLight', descendants=None, kids=[25190397], score=None, time=1606118812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184396, text='You seem to be arguing for laws that treat people differently based on their immutable characteristics - i.e. gender.  I think that&#x27;s wrong and people should be treated equally.  It&#x27;s true that most of upper management is male - but that fact only incurs a cost on me, not a benefit.  The cost is: The upper management is incentivized to promote women (i.e. not me) to balance out their existing maleness.<p>I could be the &quot;bigger man&quot; by ignoring structural disadvantages against me and people like me, and in real life, of course I do ignore these disadvantages.  The reason I ignore them is not because I think it makes me a bigger man, but because if I spoke out against them I would be fired and ostracized.  People would hate me for raising or sharing these opinions.<p>For your point about sexual harassment and rape - this is not something specific to the tech industry and not something that is fixed by deciding to prefer women over men in hiring decisions.  Is the idea that, because women are more likely to be sexually harassed or raped, outside of prison, they should get the compensatory prize of these career benefits I&#x27;ve described?  That just seems like a non-sequitur to me.')
