I assume the company was really small at the time, because the guy who answered the phone was clearly a network engineer who knew the system inside and out. I read him a couple of traceroutes over the phone and we resolved the issue within minutes.<p>I have never experienced such perfect tech support before or after that with any other ISP.')
