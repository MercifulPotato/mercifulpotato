The issues in C++ are 90% ones that you wouldn&#x27;t have in Rust<p>However my reply to the higher up comment was because you can&#x27;t switch every project away from C++. I think it&#x27;s a good idea to start most projects where you would have picked C++ in Rust now, just that it&#x27;s infeasible for a lot of code, given the mountains of code that exist in C++.<p>Also plenty of code needs certifications that just don&#x27;t exist for Rust yet.<p>So saying C++ is an anti-pattern is kind of correct, but it doesn&#x27;t help you if you have to deal with it.')
