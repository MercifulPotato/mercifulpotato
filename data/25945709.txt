I&#x27;ve classified those type of posts as <i>NOT</i> remote in this analysis. For example, I&#x27;d assume if you are a NYC based company, and want everyone to be onsite after the pandemic, you wouldn&#x27;t hire someone from Alaska without sharing the onsite expectation upfront (i.e. marking your job post as &quot;onsite&quot;).')
