I would spend more time fixing Ubuntu weirdness than I would all other distros combined.  It&#x27;s gotten much better the past several releases though, so thank you to Canonical for that :-)<p>The various RPM flavors keep their kernels vanilla enough that I can mostly just rebase on top of linux-stable, and it&#x27;s been that way since I started 7 years ago (according to github).<p>Arch is the winner.  I&#x27;ve never had to make a custom patch for Arch.<p><i>Disclaimer:  I work for Red Hat but opinions are my own</i><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreedomBen&#x2F;rtl8188ce-linux-driver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreedomBen&#x2F;rtl8188ce-linux-driver</a>')
