Comment left up as a monument to my hubris<p>***<p>&gt;The airframe with the engines mounted differently did not have adequately stable handling at high AoA to be certifiable. Boeing decided to create the MCAS system to electronically correct for the aircraft&#x27;s handling deficiencies.<p>While accurate, it omits that part of the certification Boeing were chasing was a common type rating with previous 737s on the basis of it having similar handling characteristics. MCAS did not exist because the 737 Max was unsafe, just different.<p>The reason they were chasing fleet commonality is because it would massively reduce adoption costs for airlines by making expensive training for existing 737 pilots unnecessary.')
