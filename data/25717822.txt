Ghadaffi was killed by his own bodyguards after Ghadaffi&#x27;s own citizens overthrew their government in a civil war spurred by resistance movements in neighboring countries arising from despots incarcerating and assassinating political opponents.<p>The U.S. was behind the killing of Bin Laden. He organized the single largest terrorist attack against the U.S. in history. As a non-state actor, he was not protected by any laws, therefore, killing him was not illegal nor was it extradjudicial. This has been the state of international law for over a century, as codified in the Geneva Conventions and the amendments and followup conventions. If you have issues with international law, take that up with the Hague.<p><i>This is false, since several members of the bin Laden family died in the attack, including women and children. I&#x27;m not saying that killing bin Laden was wrong, just that Twitter policies are wildly inconsistent regarding violence and falsehood.) </i><p>Bin Laden&#x27;s sons were killed in the attack and one of his son&#x27;s wives, but no children were killed. They were not just innocent collateral damage; they were killed in the attack while resisting U.S. forces. The non-resisting members of the family are alive today to talk about what happened because we didn&#x27;t kill them.')
