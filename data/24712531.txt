When Model 3 production started climbing, customers were seeing very thin and uneven paint application, well below what&#x27;s normal for a car in this price bracket, and often very light on critical areas like the sills. Owners in snow-bound places where Tesla is popular, such as Scandanavia, were reporting pain stripping within a few months of ownership.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but my expectation for what is nominally a luxury car would be to have paint standards better than British Leyland in the 70s.')
