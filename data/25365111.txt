A year from now it&#x27;s 4k a share. 800$ capital gains...you get taxed on that.<p>It is a terrible tax law bc it is unrealized. What happens when you get taxes on that 800$, then the share drops down to 3300, you sell at 3300, making a REAL profit of 100$?<p>Do you feel fairly taxes at 800$ profit despit having only 100$ profit?')
