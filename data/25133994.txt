It is mentioned in official documentation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.remarkable.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360002662557-Help" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.remarkable.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;36000266255...</a>) and also part of their promise to be compliant with GPLv3. Would be weird if they suddenly decided it was OK to break GPL and remove ssh access. Not only would the people who bought it because it&#x27;s so open (like me) try to return it, I&#x27;m sure bunch of people would try to sue them for removing features post-launch as well.')
