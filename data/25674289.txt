First of all, they haven&#x27;t been talking to each other in a constructive way on these platforms anyway, they merely exchange hateful messages.<p>So nothing lost?<p>&gt;Second, pushing radicals out of mainstream platforms is a good thing because they will go to many different places, break up into smaller fractions, and therefore not be able to reach as many people at once.<p>The thing about banning people on facebook, twitter, reddit, etc. You just create a new account. Nobody has gone anywhere. When there is a push for different platform like parler, then the migration occurs and there won&#x27;t be cells. thedonald.win for example just as popular as thedonald was. There&#x27;s no splintering. Though I can bet you within the next 2 weeks those sites will be taken down.<p>&gt;The division and reality-denial we see today is the result of small minorities reaching to large audiences and looking much larger than they are, thereby allowing radical and violent positions to become seemingly more socially acceptable.<p>To be clear, the political division is not on the republican side. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;charts-americas-political-divide-1994-2017&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;charts-americas-political-d...</a><p>The political divide is on the democrat side. More specifically... it was just the democrats. That&#x27;s not the case anymore. The republicans just moved to the right increasing the divide.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s perfectly fine if people who want to storm the Capitol (or behead Fauci, etc.) get to talk in their own, small little echo chambers. They do that already. Law enforcement is used to infiltrating closed circles and should know how to deal with those who become terrorists.<p>That&#x27;s the thing with reality. Those who arent involved in certain subjects can see it objectively. I&#x27;m not american nor am I there.<p>I have never seen the politics so divided in the usa. It WAS the democrats, It&#x27;s now both. The political divide has never been so bad.<p>What are the consequences?')
