I don&#x27;t think &quot;super productivity&quot; is healthy long term as well.<p>&quot;I wonder if there will come a new celebrity-backed fad (following mindfulness, minimalism, normcore etc.) where people do these mundane tasks themselves and give it some cute snappy buzzwordy name and there will be scientific studies that it increases one&#x27;s well being.&quot;<p>Would that be the DIY thing?')
