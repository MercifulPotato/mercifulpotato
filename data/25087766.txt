No unexpected behavior changes on update, just bug fixes, it does what I tell it, nothing crazy like Debian maintainers dictating what binaries I can run... if you want more or less control you&#x27;ve got plenty of Ubuntu style distros in one direction and Arch style in the other.<p>If you&#x27;re a media person then yeah, I feel bad for you, i&#x27;ve been there and it sucks, you&#x27;re stuck with mac and windows if you require mainstream design apps.')
