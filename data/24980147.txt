It&#x27;s a real problem because right now I am trying to get a PS3 going again. I&#x27;ve established that the HDMI port isn&#x27;t burnt out because I am able to get it to show an initial screen but not past that point. I have a new splitter on the way, hope this one works before I test other things out. I&#x27;m pretty sure the issue is the HDCP is malfunctioning or is corrupted because I hot-plugged the HDMI cable while the unit was turned on. I also notice an interesting symptom, on my monitor when I attempt to get the PS3 going and then switch over to the computer, if I play something that requires HDCP the monitor will flash a brightly coloured static snow pattern before continuing to play. This doesn&#x27;t happen if the PC and monitor have been powered down. So whatever is wrong with the PS3&#x27;s HDCP is definitely leaking out into the monitor temporarily.<p>HDCP is awful. Thanks Intel.')
