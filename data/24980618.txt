It&#x27;s a wonderful library and for good reason. But I&#x27;ve never used the OOP parts of it, because I like structuring my applications without a framework, customized to the domain I&#x27;m working on. Several mutable classes as a basic structure of an application is a no-go for me. Luckily, you could, can (and in my opinion <i>should</i>) use React without those parts, and the library works just fine as a VDOM engine.<p>Again, Facebook did an incredible job. I&#x27;m just commenting on why some people (not me) feel like React is &quot;just another framework oh my god when does this stop&quot;. If they released the VDOM engine separately and the framework parts after that, people would understand that you can build your application in a way where you can pop out React and replace it with any other VDOM implementation. Most people don&#x27;t seem to know this, and that&#x27;s why they insist on calling it a framework.<p>Also, JSX caused <i>so much confusion</i> among people who were used to template engines. There was a huge opposition to React as a whole simply because JSX looked weird when people were explicitly taught to never mix JS with HTML. React didn&#x27;t need JSX to work. For my first applications I didn&#x27;t use it because I didn&#x27;t want an extra compilation step, and the build&#x2F;packaging tools back then were quite painful when compared to those of today. I could use React perfectly fine and it did its job in pure JS. JSX to me was just syntactic sugar, but it became a huge red herring to people who were introduced to React.')
