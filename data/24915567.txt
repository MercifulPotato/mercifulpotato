Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603863264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914620, text='&gt; ZFC was never intended as a language for practically doing mathematics in, so that&#x27;s a weird criticism.<p>Isn&#x27;t that just the point? Currently we do metamathematics in an esoteric language where your normal mathematical tools won&#x27;t always have the meaning you expect them to have - HoTT is about enabling us to do it in something much closer to normal mathematics.<p>&gt; Could you give an example of how definitions from, say, probability theory and algebraic geometry might be merged in a useful way?<p>A lot of category theory is &quot;this theorem from this context can be translated to this theorem in this other context&quot;. Do I know any specific equivalences between probability distributions and multivariate polynomials? No. But I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if we found some. At one point the idea that arithmetic could tell us something about geometry was a surprising and novel one.<p>&gt; I think this comment misunderstands the problem with the ABC &quot;proof,&quot; which is (speaking roughly) that a certain lemma asserted something that was crucial to the argument, but which was never actually proved. Peter Scholze and others spotted this pretty quickly. Formalization wouldn&#x27;t really have helped at all.<p>The fact that it was disputed for at least two years whether that lemma was or wasn&#x27;t valid is the fact that formalisation would have been helpful.')
