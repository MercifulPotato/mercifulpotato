It&#x27;s a proper old-school Hollywood movie.<p>They entered actual Formula 1 cars into a grand prix, strapped it with cameras, and recorded the whole thing. Other times they added new bodywork to a Formula 2 car and had the actors driving around on track - again with cameras strapped to the car. Being recorded in 70mm it&#x27;s some of the best footage of on-board Formula 1 racing until well into the 2010s, and the advent of small 4k on-board cameras in modern races.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7HA71tYl640" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7HA71tYl640</a>')
