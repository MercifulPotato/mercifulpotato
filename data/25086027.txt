You are of course free to do however you like. And if you are leaving because of what they already have done, that’s reasonable, but if you are leaving because of what you are guessing that they might do tomorrow, is that really wise? I mean even with the ARM switch won’t it be as easy to switch to win&#x2F;linux intel after a year if you are not satisfied?<p>I don’t like the boot thing either, and it’s a bit scary not being on intel as everyone else is right now, but I also think ARM feels really interesting and it might turn out to be a great new platform!<p>Edit: i mean it is not like they never listen, they did take bake the mac pro, they did fix the keyboards, you have cli tools to make a lot of changes in how macos works, etc. Of course I would like hundreds of things to be different, but I believe that is true of all platforms.')
