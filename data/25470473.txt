I live in an ecosystem of DRY gone amok and it&#x27;s not pleasant.<p>There&#x27;s a standard library to connect to databases.  There&#x27;s a huge hierarchy setup just to start an app running.<p>All of these super dry infrastructure changes have, unfortunately, come with a huge cost.  We are still stuck on ubuntu 14.04 because our super dry puppet framework we invented can&#x27;t be ported to puppet 6.<p>We are stuck talking to MS-SQL, because our super dry database connection management library can&#x27;t handle establishing other database interactions.<p>We are still stuck on Tomcat 7 because our super dry Jersey libraries don&#x27;t work with newer versions of Jersey (which has locked us into older versions of tomcat!).<p>Consolidation is a decent goal, but it really needs to be measured.  For me, it is FAR more important to consolidate on the how to do things and not the what does things.  In otherwords, rather than making an &quot;elasticsearch connection library&quot; specify &quot;This environment variable is the elasticsearch host&#x2F;credentials&quot; and let the apps move from there.<p>That&#x27;s because, when it comes right down to it, configuration code is super easy to write and it really doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s duplicated.  You want your libraries consolidating knowledge to be for things that are easy to get wrong (such as checking who is currently logged in or how to authenticate).')
