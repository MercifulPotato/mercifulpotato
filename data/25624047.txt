Keeping that machine out of the landfill, and preventing the new carbon footprint of anything else I would have to buy to replace it, really makes me question the potential carbon decrease of such an effort. How much oil was burned to make your heat pump?<p>Also, in what world does this make any economic sense whatsoever? Most people cannot and will not be able to afford to do this. Meanwhile, why is the taxpayer subsidizing someone who _can_ already afford to spend $70K of their own money on this?<p>Enjoy your electric car, champ, but carbon-wise it&#x27;s actually better to keep a mid-2000&#x27;s Toyota running for an extra decade so that all the carbon that was released in its manufacture is amortized over a longer lifetime.')
