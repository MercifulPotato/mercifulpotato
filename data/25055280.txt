It&#x27;s pretty solid. I was excited about InfluxDB 2 since I wouldn&#x27;t have to run Chronograf and Capacitor separately.<p>The notification settings are somewhat odd, though. In my case I want a notification if something transitions into a bad state (Critical), and also want to get a notification when it&#x27;s back to normal (OK).<p>In InfluxDB 2, I can only set a notification to fire if the state goes to Critical, OR if it goes to OK. I can&#x27;t have a single notification rule that covers both cases. It&#x27;s super annoying to maintain two rules for each item I&#x27;m monitoring.<p>Meanwhile, Grafana has notifications work the way I described by default. I&#x27;m not sure if InfluxDB is weird, or if the rest of the world does notifications differently than I do.')
