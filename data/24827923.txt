That pays for like one and a half Warmates [0]? Drones are far more expensive than you think.<p>Also there are unmanned autonomous ground vehicles that can launch these like the mission master[1].<p>It&#x27;s merely a force multiplier for soldiers. Not some indiscriminate killing machine. Imagine a slaugherbots video based on conventional fighter jets or bombers. They would show them used indiscriminately too. The video is mostly FUD.
