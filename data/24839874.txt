If it&#x27;s not growing why should it be taking on debt?  I would grandfather existing debt, however, to avoid disrupting the market too much.<p>I would also like to see dividends only able to be paid from profits, period, no grandfather.  You didn&#x27;t make money, you can&#x27;t pay out dividends.')
