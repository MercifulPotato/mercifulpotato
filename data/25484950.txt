Running your own VMs doesn’t mean running your own hardware.<p>The original claim is not at all unrealistic, I’ve been running a small shop with about 20 VMs without issues for years, uptime seems to me about comparable with serverless or hosted services from big players who regularly have small outages and there really is very little work involved.')
