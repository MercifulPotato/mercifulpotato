It&#x27;s no worse than radio shows teens used to listen to. Idiots would call in and say all sorts of crap. Twitch viewership is young so there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;edgey&quot; channels.<p>There&#x27;s tons of streamers that don&#x27;t allow their chat to be a disaster. For others, allowing chat to go nuts is their MO.<p>The funniest thing to me is utterly un-insteresting &quot;tit streamers&quot; wearing as little as they can to avoid violating ToS.<p>IMO twitch is just a reflection of the differences in viewing tastes. There&#x27;s an extremely wide range of channels and personalities. Something for everyone.')
