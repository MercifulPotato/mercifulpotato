It&#x27;s using just a video camera to do food recognition, but it&#x27;s fairly high-accuracy for recognizing supported foods. The first few times you do it, frankly, it feels kinda magical.<p>But, actually, a lot of my usage doesn&#x27;t lean on the pre-set programs. Rather, I do a lot of &#x27;reheat leftovers&#x27; by sticking a temperature probe into the food, hooking it in to the oven, and having the oven automatically reheat until the internal temperature is warmed.')
