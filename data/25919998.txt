Without me digging through the SMART data, has there been any difference in data center temps over the years for Backblaze? I ask because I&#x27;ve personally seen disk life vary greatly between &quot;warm&quot; datacenters (closer to 79F) and &quot;cool&quot; datacenters (closer to 72F). I don&#x27;t have a huge dataset, only anecdotal evidence, but it seems to me temperature plays a pretty big role in drive longevity. Have you guys found the same, or is this a variable not controllable by Backblaze?')
