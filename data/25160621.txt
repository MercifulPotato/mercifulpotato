Ligatures distort that.</i><p>I feel the same way.<p>I do think I would enjoy programming in a language that used a slightly more extended set of <i>real</i> characters, as long as we had solid editor and font support so typing and viewing them wasn’t going to be an issue for anyone. For example, I’d like to finally have ≠, ≤ and ≥ lining up neatly with =, &lt; and &gt; in my code! I could imagine a few other carefully chosen and easily recognisable symbols, such as ∈ and true arrows, being helpful for readability as well.<p>But the world speaks in Unicode these days, so assuming there was adequate tool and font support, I think writing these characters for real would be much better than relying on ligatures. Even where ligatures are supported, they tend to use awkwardly wide glyphs to replace multi-character combinations so they don’t break alignment in a monospace font, and sometimes the fonts with programming ligatures seem to join certain combinations in bizarre ways just because they can, even when there’s no apparent need for it.')
