During the meeting we go through the topics, check them out and possibly create followup tasks. Lattice auto-add the tasks to the agenda of the next meeting.<p>Before I was using a single GDoc&#x2F;person, with &lt;date&gt; and a list of bullet points. Pretty much doing the same thing as Lattice.')
