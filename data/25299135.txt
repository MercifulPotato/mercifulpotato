Item(by='romanhn', descendants=None, kids=[25299342], score=None, time=1607057817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298574, text='In order to prepare for eng manager interviews a couple of years back, I quit my job and spent several months on Leetcode and system design. This is with 8 years of management experience at the time and many years without hands-on coding. I landed a FAANG job as a result, something I would have 100% not been able to accomplish without the prep, so I suppose it was worth the effort.<p>The not-at-all-surprising end result is that my role has no coding or system design expectation, nor is there time for that even if I wanted it. I&#x27;m exactly the same person, doing a not-entirely-dissimilar job to my prior experience, yet I would not have been considered a desirable candidate had I not jumped through these hoops that bear no relation to actual responsibilities.<p>Now that I&#x27;m on the inside, I don&#x27;t see any particular conspiracy to select for people that are willing to jump through hoops. Yet I have a hard time reasoning out why else my candidacy would undergo such a drastic transformation otherwise. It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs indeed.')
