Plant some trees, no need to prove it. Look into fast growing trees for your agricultural zone. Look into pruning techniques like pollarding to keep trees small. Use pruned dried material to make charcoal (has many uses in fish farming) and then charge it up with goodies to make biochar and finally bury it into your garden for a slow release fertilizer which lasts for hundreds or potentially thousands of years.')
