It means that instead of providing builtin interfaces for existing primitive types, Go asks its users to list the primitive types in user defined interfaces. This will not go well if at some point in a future, the Go team want to add a new primitive type because the user codes will need to be upgraded.<p>And not providing inference when directly referencing a function is a weird choice (see section Type inference for generic function arguments).')
