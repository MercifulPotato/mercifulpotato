We&#x27;d really need special locations to be setup to administer the vaccine, unless it&#x27;s viable for some reasonable period of time at higher temperatures. Even something like 24-48 hours, so it can be transported on demand from centralized locations to doctors offices, pharmacies, etc.<p>Otherwise, medical cryo storage is highly specialized and expensive equipment. Definitely not what you&#x27;d find in a doctors office or pharmacy. It might be a more convenient option if the vaccine remains viable at much colder temperatures. Somewhat cheaper (though still not cheap) LN2 transport containers ~180C could be used to deliver it to locations, provide a supply of LN2 to keep it cold, and then warm on demand.<p>The point is, this isn&#x27;t going to be a rollout that can be done without a lot of infrastructure planning way up front. If the data here is validated and it looks like it&#x27;s going to get FDA approval, we need to begin planning that stage ASAP.')
