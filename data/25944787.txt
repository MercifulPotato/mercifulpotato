One proof of his whereabouts was an iPhone picture of his crypto seed he took while in another country. Bad opsec, ugh.<p>The child was running a nothing special b&amp;m chain business, but they had a “loan” from the billionaire to acquire and expand the business.<p>I’m like, okay, at least a loan has to be paid back.<p>Then half-way through the article, there’s a shareholder agreement involved and I’m like, <i>it doesn’t even need to be paid back!!!!</i>, ugh.<p>How is Joe Schmoe supposed to compete in a sector where the competition has that kind of financing?')
