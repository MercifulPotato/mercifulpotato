It mainly handles smoothing of corners so I can still apply textures adequately, not a perfect by-the-book implementation. Very performant in the browser across thousands of vertices. Was very grateful for this work!<p>(Note: I&#x27;m a SaaS company founder, not a game developer, so forgive the rough edges.)<p>Edit: If you notice lagging, it&#x27;s actually synchronous Voxel &#x2F; terrain generation, not the rendering! Never did offload it to a separate thread like I had planned. Built this during the start of the pandemic in a weekend or two.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.sunfall.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.sunfall.co&#x2F;</a>')
