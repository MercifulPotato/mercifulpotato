And you need durable writes so you can crash recover (kube has a gaping hole today in that a restore from an earlier time point breaks many controllers until a reconcile is performed).<p>Note that Kubernetes <i>requires</i> a total ordering of writes (which simplifies how hard it is for us puny humans to reason about) AND requires strong consistency in order to provide guarantees like “this pod only runs on one machine at a time” and “PVs aren’t released until the pods are really stopped”.  Leaderless is a simple tradeoff - singleton or three instances.  That’s the best possible choice in the world and it’s etcd and it’s relative simplicity that make it possible.<p>I’ve never seen a production Kube system with HA etcd go down due to non-human error, so I don’t believe single instance is going to give you better availability when single machine faults happen (they happen frequently; about 0.5-1% of the machines in the OpenShift fleet - cloud and on-premise - are down at any one time due to power, software, or hardware issues).  Almost all of those clusters tick along fine when they lose that machine.')
