He lucked out getting into a FAANG company when he did (albeit at a lowly position).<p>Someone of his means can not snap their fingers and get a gig in FAANG.  With those gates up, he is just marinating in the culture which is accessible.<p>Also, being in that culture, he sees opportunity when he lands at Apple.  Plenty of other people who worked alongside him qprobably saw it as just a data entry opportunity to pay rent.<p>While Mondo 2000, Wired etc. may have been forced, I don&#x27;t think they were completely fraudulent.  The people and subcultures they covered already existed, they just kind of cobbled them all together.  Of course the editorial biases put a slanted tint on things - the average hacker is not as libertarian as Louis Rossetto envisioned or as into extropianism as RU Sirius imagined.  But those magazines put people on their covers who were not on magazine covers before as far as I know (example - free open source pioneer and Cygnus founder John Gilmore).<p>The zeitgeist was created by the media, but not out of whole cloth, there was something going on and raw materials to work with.  In retrospect, the media in the center of it got some things right and some things wrong.')
