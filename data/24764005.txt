Item(by='NumberCruncher', descendants=None, kids=[24765640], score=None, time=1602583655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763165, text='&gt; I find the question really odd. It is like asking why people create new recipes<p>This analogy missed the point. It&#x27;s about recipes written in a new language barely spoken by anyone, like elvish or klingon. Writing Romulan ale recipes in klingon is totally fine if you are targeting people on a star-trek convention, and want to start a romulan-klingon fight. But writing the only one documentation of a critical system in klingon at a public company sounds crazy, even if you can reduce the LOC (lines written) by 10% due to the nice and unique grammar of klingon (I mad this one up, I have no clue about klingon). Guess what, no sane person would want to work with that documentation, unique klingon grammar or not.<p>You just have to take a look at Esperanto, the &quot;an easy and flexible language - created by Zamenhof - that would serve as a universal second language to foster world peace and international understanding, and to build a &#x27;community of speakers&#x27;, as he believed that one could not have a language without such a community.&quot; After 130 years still no one speaks it, and English is the common language in the western world. Which - considering its shortcomings - is like if everyone of us would mainly code in COBOL, just because everyone can code in COBOL.<p>tl,dr: normal human beings don&#x27;t want to learn 2 new languages every year, just because [put a random argument here]. Why should we?<p>[edit: typos]')
