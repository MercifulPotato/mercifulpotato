Carlin was talking in vernacular and so I think it&#x27;s safe to assume he was not necessarily talking about IQ tests.<p>Even though IQ is designed to be normally distributed do you really think it actually is a normal distribution?  It&#x27;s a lofty goal and I&#x27;m sure it gets as close as one can but does this perfectly match up with reality? I have my doubts, hence my claim that there&#x27;s a decent chance Carlin&#x27;s comment is wrong.<p>Yes, median and mode are averages but few people mean those when they say &quot;average&quot;.  I doubt Carlin was statistically sophisticated enough to use average instead of median.  Had he meant the median I think it reasonable to assume he would have said median.  Do you commonly say &quot;average&quot; when talking about the mode or median?  I doubt it.<p><i>Maybe don&#x27;t be so quick to criticize next time.</i><p>Perhaps we could both benefit from this sage advice.')
