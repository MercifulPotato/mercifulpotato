The confederate flag claim was also retracted, although the person then claimed they  had seen confederate stickers. It was established some club members wore camouflage though, and one member said there might be occasional racist comments. It&#x27;s definitely not the kind of group I&#x27;d ever want to be around, but it seems some of the claims may have been exaggerated or fabricated, and the person who made them does not come off as very credible in the report.')
