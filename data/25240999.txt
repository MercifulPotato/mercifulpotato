There&#x27;s not much cosmopolitan about Dushambe.<p>Also, if you learn to speak like a Tajik, Iranians will probably think you&#x27;re dim, or at least sound like it.<p>But yeah, I remember eating out alone in one of my first nights in Iran, so already marked as a weirdo, of course, and the waiter says &quot;Qabel nadare!&quot; when I ask for the bill, and I&#x27;m very confused, and I get out my dictionary because I don&#x27;t know the word, and he just starts repeating the phrase louder and louder at me like they joke about the English doing when someone doesn&#x27;t speak English... it just wasn&#x27;t a good time for anyone. I did pay, though.')
