Would like to get your take since you clearly know something about what’s happening.<p>The whole point of the article is saying 80% of bands only make £200 a year.<p>A band only needs a few hundred fans to easily get above that.<p>My attempt at some math:<p>100 fans listen to a band 5% of the time.<p>100 fans x £10 x 12 months = £12000.<p>Your 5% of their listening gives them £600.<p>3 X higher than 80% of bands. And with only 100 fans. And only listening to your music 5% of the time!')
