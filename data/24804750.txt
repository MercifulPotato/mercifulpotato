Your kid picks a book a few times, next thing you know the parents are emphasizing IS THIS YOUR FAVORITE BOOK? There&#x27;s a themed birthday party with the characters. That becomes part of the child&#x27;s identity.<p>I&#x27;ve found it helps to not hold any of your kids preferences static. If they like something now, don&#x27;t assume they will still like it 2 weeks from now. Consciously give them the space to change their mind.')
