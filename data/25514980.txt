I don&#x27;t know of any services that specialize in nit-picking through the use of an authorized signer however part of said hypothetical service could be to bond &#x2F; insure that the secondary signer doesn&#x27;t take some sort of negative action that leaves the account&#x2F;owner in bad standing.<p>But again you&#x27;re running into the ultimate question of why isn&#x27;t your bank &#x2F; credit card taking care of you...maybe it&#x27;s because the bank &#x2F; CC just make money off of the fiduciary mishaps of the owner when they don&#x27;t have 20 minutes to wait on hold.')
