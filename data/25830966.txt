Taking power out of the hands of elected officials and placing that power in the hands of professional administrators reduced the voice of the politicians and in turn reduced the voice of the people. Centralized decision-making by trained experts and reduced power for local wards made government less corrupt but more distant and isolated from the people it served. Progressives who emphasized the need for efficiency typically argued that trained independent experts could make better decisions than the local politicians. In his influential Drift and Mastery (1914) stressing the &quot;scientific spirit&quot; and &quot;discipline of democracy&quot;, Walter Lippmann called for a strong central government guided by experts rather than public opinion.<p>At first I thought, well hell, of course these people are constantly at odds with each other. Then I discovered this on the dangers of decentralization:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decentralization#Criticism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decentralization#Criticism</a><p>&gt; Other challenges, and even dangers, include the possibility that corrupt local elites can capture regional or local power centers, while constituents lose representation; patronage politics will become rampant and civil servants feel compromised; further necessary decentralization can be stymied; incomplete information and hidden decision-making can occur up and down the hierarchies; centralized power centers can find reasons to frustrate decentralization and bring power back to themselves<p>It turns out the answer to this has been studied and sounds like it&#x27;s somewhere in the middle:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20150211220702&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;61430&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_61430.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20150211220702&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.un...</a><p>1.
