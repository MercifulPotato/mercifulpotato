Python won scripting because it offers a sane way to do sequential, shell-ish things, without having to wade through &quot;man bash&quot; or searching stack overflow for the umpteenth time about the syntax to do something that should be trivial but is anything but.<p>Saying that younger devs only know python is like a FORTRAN engineer in the 90s saying young devs only know java. No one needs to apologize for growing up learning <i>better mature readable</i> shit.<p>The number of gotchas and tricky nonsense in bash could (and probably does) fill books (array indexing, string comparison, quoting, toggling &#x27;set -e&#x27;, many more). I don&#x27;t doubt that there are clever grey beards that are wizards that know the arcana. That doesn&#x27;t mean arcane should be what you build an engineering culture around.')
