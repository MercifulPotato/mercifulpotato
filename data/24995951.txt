I love how you can do abstraction in Haskell based on the minimal interface. If it&#x27;s &quot;ring-like&quot; or whatever you can define matrix multiplication. That can often come up useful, extending the power of existing functions.<p>But it means your web scraping code, crud app, {some other boring everyday app} or whatever is now adorned with all this deep mathematical complexity that if you just used nodejs or something it would be easier to understand.<p>Premature optimization is probably a good term for it, because the good think about haskell is it is easy to make refactoring. Make things specific now and more general later, and it should be backwards compatible for the most part.<p>But making things into &quot;arrows&quot; is part of the sport I think.')
