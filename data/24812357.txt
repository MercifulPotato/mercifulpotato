There are a bunch of companies that effectively give you ACS access, but they tend to have low limits due to KYC concerns. There&#x27;s wire transfers, but those are pricy ($50&#x2F;transaction is normal) unless you have very large deposits with the bank. Most banks will let you do transfers online, but often only to other account holders at the same institution, or else with Zelle or one of its clones, usually with the aforementioned ~$2k limit.<p>The use case here is paying rent. I write exactly one cheque a month, and I haven&#x27;t found a better way to do it that wouldn&#x27;t either be expensive or require action on the landlord&#x27;s part to set up a portal or something.')
