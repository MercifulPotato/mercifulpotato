I know some folks will point to a dictionary, but we live in a post truth world. It&#x27;s odd to me that I&#x27;ve seemingly encountered every other usage of gimp, either personally or in media, but never an offensive usage. A horse with a gimp leg in the wheel of time, gimp the string at summer camp arts and crafts, a gimp suit in the tv show Archer, and gimp the image editing program as a teen. Language fundamentally means what we think it means - if nobody uses gimp as an offensive word, it&#x27;s not offensive.<p>Have you ever heard it used offensively? If personally so, can I ask where (what county &#x2F; cultural context)? If in media, can you name the work?')
