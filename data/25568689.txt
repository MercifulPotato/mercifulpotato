I find this food either in the nature (you gotta search a bit) or at local farm<p>I used to eat a lot of honey, completely stopped, not even talking about other stuff like chocolate, or other processed products&#x2F;meals, I stopped a long time ago, the cooking is done is my belly, no need for fanciness!')
