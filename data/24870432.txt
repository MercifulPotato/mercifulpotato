Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603466632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870065, text='&gt; part of the motivation for a GUT is that it would be a huge help towards making a theory of everything. And a TOE is precisely a unified treatment of the standard model forces and gravity.<p>A GUT is specifically the part of a TOE that has nothing to do with gravity... A TOE is a GUT + a theory of quantum gravity.<p>If we had the Standard Model + a theory of quantum gravity, this could be a complete theory of the universe (pending explanations for dark matter, dark energy etc.). These could very well be completely separate phenomena, there is no reason to believe they reduce to a single phenomenon - that there exists a TOE.<p>&gt; The measurement problem isn&#x27;t a physics thing, just like naturalness that&#x27;s more of a life-style choice. In fact, the only reason to have problems with wave-function collapse is precisely a naturalness reasoning, technically it makes very accurate predictions just fine.<p>This isn&#x27;t entirely accurate. There is a very clear quantitative question behind the measurement problem: what kind of system constitutes a measurement device, in the sense of invoking the need for the Born rule? There must be some precise size&#x2F;kind of system that, when a particle interacts with it, you can no longer use Schrodinger&#x27;s equation to predict its movement after that interaction - you must apply the Born rule. We know that this doesn&#x27;t happen after a particle collision, but that it does happen after a collision with a &quot;detector&quot;.<p>This is a clear empirical question (you don&#x27;t need to call it a problem), well within the realm of physics. It may be extremely difficult to answer, but I see no reason to imagine it is a priori impossible to resolve.')
