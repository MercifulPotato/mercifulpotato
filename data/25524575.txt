You basicly trick your brain, but it takes sometime to be able to do that.<p>Also, maybe seek some spiritual guidence or even meditation if it helps. We program our brains daily, you programmed yours for fear. Now you need to fix that somehow. Another idea, try doing any sports or excersies if don&#x27;t already. This helps to regulate your body&#x2F;brain properly.<p>&quot;I am asking this on HN because this to me is the most accessible community of people who are very smart and a lot are much smarter and more educated than me.&quot;<p>Thank you, but don&#x27;t put yourself down saying you are not smart. Don&#x27;t kick yourself, lift yourself up!<p>Btw, I&#x27;m not an expert in this. Best seek professional help! But I hope some of what I said helps you :)')
