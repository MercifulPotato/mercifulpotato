If Pandoc didn&#x27;t sell me (user of many languages over many years, a true believer in functional programming, and someone that writes solo projects for personal use) on Haskell, I don&#x27;t think it can be done. The Pandoc source is literally just a big blob of uncommented gibberish to someone that&#x27;s not already a dedicated Haskell programmer.')
