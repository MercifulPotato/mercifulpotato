It obviously isn’t, it can be worth a ton. It’s the instruments that VCs and founders use to offer early stage equity to employees that is worthless. That is a huge distinction that’s worth emphasizing because when people say “oh it’s probably worthless” it’s not just saying that the company is unlikely to succeed, but that if it does succeed you will be scammed out of its value via exercise windows, dilution, getting common instead of preferred shares, etc')
