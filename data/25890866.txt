But it&#x27;s more than enough to make me skeptical that you should be grateful that you&#x27;re being interrogated by an american officer rather than an european one...<p>Very anecdotally, I&#x27;ve watched&#x2F;read a lot of american news during the elections and the idea that they are &quot;more robust&quot; or more impartial than european news makes me chuckle (at least western europe as it&#x27;s what I know, and not pretending that our journalism is laudable either)')
