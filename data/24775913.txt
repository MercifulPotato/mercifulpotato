Moderating posts 20 or 30 years after the fact seems ill advised. If you modify the content in any way, at least put a prominent notice so that people don&#x27;t get confused by the website name.<p>Also, it seems that your parsing process strips headers and that you don&#x27;t keep the raw messages, however I remember that on some newsgroups people used to pass secret messages in headers that only those &quot;in the know&quot; would look for, it would be a shame to lose that. Access to posts in raw format would be nice in this scenario.')
