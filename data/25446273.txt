I understand how RPG progression works, and my criticism was about the <i>mechanics</i> of the combat (stealth, gunplay, hacking, etc).<p>The simplistic AI behavior makes stealth unengaging, the hacking feels really disappointing (why don&#x27;t cameras or turrets get harder to hack?), the cover system is worse than Mass Effect, and gunplay is middling at bestâ€”better than Fallout: NV, but worse than Fallout 4 or Destiny.<p>Notice how I only compared it with other action&#x2F;shooter RPGs? Clearly RPG progression isn&#x27;t my issue with it.')
