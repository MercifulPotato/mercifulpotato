If you prefer containerd over Docker also good.<p>What I am saying is which orchestration and deployment system does favor single executables atm and has a huge ecosystem? You still need to create images and do double the work. I like real binaries like Go creates but repackaging the run-time doesn&#x27;t sound like a sophisticated idea but rather making the black box even bigger.<p>As a sibling said, for client side&#x2F;3rd party apps, yeah this might be a nice-to-have but this space has rather other challenges.')
