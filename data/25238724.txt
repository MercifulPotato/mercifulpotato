The idea that eliminating coupling is inherently good is an unsound premise. There’s no proof that coupling is bad, and even if there were, there’s also the conversation to be had about which things <i>should</i> be coupled, which is surely a subjective conversation.<p>&gt; design improvements resulting in edge cases being obviated<p>I guess this one is slightly closer to being an objective good. Though even still, I think this is linear thinking at its finest. You may be getting rid of <i>some</i> edge cases but introducing others. Every design is a trade off, and evaluating tradeoffs is a subjective act.')
