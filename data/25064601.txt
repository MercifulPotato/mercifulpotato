Or another article a couple days&#x2F;weeks ago discussing why an advertiser might want to include&#x2F;exclude certain groups from ad targets.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s <i>ALL</i> about value.  I think general brands might be better served with more generic reach than we typically see though.  I&#x27;d like to see ad networks that only try to bid 2-3 levels and fallback to generic quickly (even if less profitable) rather than go a dozen layers of IFrames in the browser.  I think browser vendors could help with this by disabling scripts after 2 layers of IFrames and I&#x27;ve said this for a while.<p>edit: of course the fact the biggest advertising company is also the biggest browser vendor prevent this from being realistic.')
