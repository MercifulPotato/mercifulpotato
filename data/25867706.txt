Or Xiaomi Roborock vacuum cleaners, which are sold in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, but send Wi-Fi SSIDs, passwords, GPS, and floor maps back to their server with no option to disable that behavior and no option to request deletion of user data.<p>They mostly target Silicon Valley companies and don&#x27;t seem to particularly care if other countries&#x27; companies violate GDPR.')
