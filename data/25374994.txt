They&#x27;re hired for outcomes.  It&#x27;s their job to make it happen, not make it make sense.<p>&gt; A bunch of people got promoted. We all breathed a sigh of relief. The 90 work weeks stopped for a few weeks.<p>When you move up, you move on; issues from then on are the next guy&#x27;s problem.  Exec dynamics are often &quot;gather successes to me and push off failures to others&quot; - sounds like some exec won.')
