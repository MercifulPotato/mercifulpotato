Item(by='bdowling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611088531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836637, text='Technically, the code is alleged to violate <i>copyright</i>, not DMCA. A DMCA notice is just the process that copyright owners use to tell service providers about allegedly infringing content.<p>The argument is for contributory copyright infringement via inducement, ala <i>MGM v Grokster</i> 545 U.S. 913 (2005) or <i>Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Fung</i> 710 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2013), the isoHunt case. Inducement occurs where someone distributes a device with the intent of promoting infringement and actual infringement occurs. Here, the argument is that nyaa intends to promote copyright infringement because it provides a tool that is tailored for copyright infringement. The notice letter cites various references in the code to nyaa.si. Exhibit A of the letter comprises &quot;a series of screenshots taken from the Nyaa.si website for the Project that include images of copyrighted works available through the Project.&quot; The implication here is that the devs here are encouraging similar use of the code for infringing copyright.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree with it, but that&#x27;s their argument.')
