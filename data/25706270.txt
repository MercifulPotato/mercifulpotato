I use a similar amount in the evening. I no longer combust any flower and breath much easier because of it. I did use RSO an edible concentrate on the begining to get through the pain in the evening I was eating 150mg-200mg thc in a gelcap in the evening. Vape cartridges are an option but I&#x27;ve never found one I liked. It&#x27;s fair to not I have a very high tolerance and most people would not know I was under the influence, most people could use far less.')
