The M1, being a mobile friendly chip, <i>is</i> addressing the larger market. People may not care about power usage from the wall, but they do care about battery life.<p>Also, the fact that the M1 is even being mentioned along with a desktop powerhouse like the threadripper says it all. The M1 is the lowest end mobile Apple Silicon. We know higher end mobile chips are coming along with desktop ones.
