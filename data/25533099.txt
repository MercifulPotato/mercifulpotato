The other products I tried weren&#x27;t so effective. If, as I suppose, this type of functionality requires a significant investment to develop, then it&#x27;s out of reach for non-very-well-funded open source development.<p>Dehazing was another typical example of LR functionality: it&#x27;s stupid simple (a slider), and does effectively what&#x27;s supposed to do for a casual user.')
