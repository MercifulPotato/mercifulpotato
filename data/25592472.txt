Why would you ever want to run CPU bound tasks in python?  I&#x27;m sure there are arguments about the huge ecosystem, not having to rewrite code in another language, etc.   But most of the widely used stuff in python already has underlying compiled code for the heavy lifting.  Also, given the large amount of parallelism in modern hardware architecture,  and python&#x27;s lackluster concurrency support, I just don&#x27;t see a reason for using it.')
