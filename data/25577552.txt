This is especially true the higher up you go. There&#x27;s a reason that the vast majority of the richest people in the world are men.<p>These purely social barriers are slowly but surely being eroded as women rise higher in the economic hierarchies. I&#x27;d like to see that hierarchy destroyed, but if it has to exist, it must exist on more ethical terms.<p>&gt; The rest of your argument is a strawman. Quit catering to toxic femenist propaganda.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed that you were unwilling to put your bigotry aside and approach this rationally. All the best.')
