New build homes down here are heat traps.  We have two portable units for the summer and are going to get a full unit next year.  We need it.  Our house gets to 30C inside and stays at that through the night.<p>At least one of my neighbours has air-con that I can see, and a couple of re-builds in my town that I can see from the road have them too.  My utterly unscientific estimate would be 1 in 500 houses in the SE now have aircon.')
