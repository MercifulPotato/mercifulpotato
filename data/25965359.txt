Basically combining the civility of HN, the breadth of content of Medium, and the crowdsourced moderation and badges&#x2F;point system&#x2F;gamification of Stack Overflow.  Something like the following:<p>-You can post any content you want.<p>-It must be civil in tone.<p>-Other users can tag your logical fallacies.<p>-If their tags are accurate, your article is downvoted.<p>-Downvotes <i>only</i> happen if your article contains logical fallacies or violate the civil discussion standards.  You can’t downvote someone without tagging a logical fallacy.<p>-You explicitly cannot downvote or tag someone’s content simply because you disagree with it. You can try of course, but if your tags are found to be consistently inaccurate, you get shadow-banned or something.')
