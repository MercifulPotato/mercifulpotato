Item(by='arrosenberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607136774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311047, text='That seems like a straw man of my position. Suggesting that we tax the wealth of the <i>richest person in the country</i> is not a radical idea, nor is it equivalent to &quot;taxation is an unalloyed good&quot;. Likewise, nothing I said conflicts with the idea that private ownership of property is good, generally. Just that inequality is bad, and taxation is a primary way to address it. If you don&#x27;t think taxation is theft, then it&#x27;s just negotiating the number, and I don&#x27;t understand what point you are trying to make other than &quot;government bad&quot;.<p>&gt; Do you have any actual plan for how to spend all this money you propose to collect in taxes, or do you just want to throw more money at the people who are currently doing a bad job with the money they already have?<p>Sure, but I&#x27;m not running for office, because &quot;small government conservatives&quot; and their presumptions make it absolutely miserable for anyone who would do a good job of it. You can burn the money in a furnace for all I care, as long as the ratio between the richest and poorest goes down substantially.')
