But only “certain types of mouthwash and toothpaste”, mind you, so better go out and buy those.<p>&gt; But based on tests so far they can’t definitively say how long the benefit would last or what impact coughing would have. That makes it hard to judge how useful oral-hygiene products could be in curbing transmission.<p>&gt; (…)<p>&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson, owner of Listerine, said lab-based findings about oral-care products and the virus, while high quality, aren’t sufficient to advocate the use of mouthwash as a prevention measure.<p>So the article has zero value apart from furthering profits for those companies, based on unsubstantiated claims made by the companies themselves, with a lot of asterisks to allow them to deny any wrongdoing while keeping the profits.<p>What’s surprising to me is that the author seems to be aware of this, considering the sarcastic title. Yet they opted to write and publish it all the same.')
