I didn’t suggest that he contributes anything to society.<p>&gt; Have you thought that maybe all those material accomplishments made under capitalism have less to do with the system itself and more to do with the fact it’s the only one around? Pretty sure many of today’s tech is founded as much on innovation that came out of Soviet labs as anybody else’s.<p>It’s (mostly) the only one around because the others all failed spectacularly every other time. Not only did states collapse, but about 100 million people died. It’s amazing that you’d use the Soviet union as an example, considering where they ended up.<p>&gt; Also, incidentally, current day capitalism is at the beck and call of one of the last remaining communist countries. Just a curiosity<p>China is the least communist of the remaining communist countries. And do you happen to know what major change allowed their GDP to explode and make them soon-to-be the biggest economy in the world?<p>Even ignoring that, do you really want to live somewhere like China? If you think poverty and working conditions are bad in the US, just you wait!<p>Unless you meant one of the other examples, like Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam or Laos. I’m guessing not.')
