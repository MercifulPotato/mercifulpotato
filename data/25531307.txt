Item(by='Red_Tarsius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608843265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531181, text='Emily translated the first line of the Odissey as &quot;<i>Tell me about a complicated man</i>&quot;. She almost went with &quot;<i>Tell me about a straying husband</i>&quot;. Neither <i>complicated</i> nor <i>straying husband</i> appear in the original text. Pope&#x27;s description (<i>The man for wisdom’s various arts renown’d...</i>) is closer to the epithets we are taught at school (<i>ricco d&#x27;astuzie</i> or <i>dal multiforme ingegno</i>). πολύτροπος means resourceful, of many skills, well-travelled.')
