In total, the project cost \\$300 million. The result? They can send information in 13.3 milliseconds round trip, 3 milliseconds faster than the competition at the time. So we can see that a 3 millisecond edge is worth at least \\$300 million.<p>I understand the motivation and rationale and that my take here is subjective, but I take a pause at how sad it is that we&#x27;re literally boring holes through our natural mountains in order to flip bits 3ms faster in the name of high frequency trading.')
