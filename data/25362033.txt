This is not a conspiracy. This is the product of the rule changes put in last moment in many of the states. Rhe conspiracy is not being able yo check signature to verify the ballots. If this was done to levels approaching the previous elections, Trump would win. Btw, at this point Texas and several other states are bringing suits. So you can not claim its a wacko conspiracy made up by basement dwellers')
