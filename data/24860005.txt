If you want to describe kubernetes resources in such a way that you can deploy the same resources to many environments with subtle differences between them (e.g., namespace names, DNS names, etc) you want something to let you abstract so you aren’t manually trying to keep disparate copies of thousands of lines of frequently-changing config in sync.<p>The reason you don’t use regular languages for this task is because you want to enforce termination (programs can’t run forever without halting, allowing someone to DoS your system) or reproducibility (the config program doesn’t evaluate to different JSON depending on some outside state because the program did I&#x2F;O). If your use case involves users who can be trusted not to violate these principles, then a standard programming language can work fine, but this frequently isn’t the case.')
