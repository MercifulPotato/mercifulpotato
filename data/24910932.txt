A lot of drugs and behaviors are addictive, and in all cases there are users who are, nonetheless, not addicted.<p>So caution is still indicated, but the situation is not as pessimistic or as inevitable as you paint it to be.<p>In particular, losses are not inevitable. In a bull market, there will be more gains than losses, by definition, in a bear market, the opposite.<p>The market is more bull than bear, fairly consistently, due to a combination of inflation and economic growth. Past performance is not indicative of future results...')
