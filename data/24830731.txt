Item(by='franga2000', descendants=None, kids=[24831297], score=None, time=1603139815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829343, text='&gt; I&#x27;m OK with Nvidia fading on Linux into irrelevance with their blob - good riddance.<p>The vast majority of Linux use is on servers. When servers need GPUs it&#x27;s usually for machine learning or other computation. Nvidia currently holds almost all of that market.<p>All dropping Nvidia support would accomplish is forcing everyone in that market to switch to Windows. Cloud revenue would drop significantly for Linux companies like RedHat, which would in turn mean they have less spare money to work on desktop distros. So as much as I despise Nvidia, until AMD&#x2F;RTG get their shit together AND (yes, we need both) Intel&#x27;s dGPUs come out (and don&#x27;t suck), we desperately need Nvidia support.')
