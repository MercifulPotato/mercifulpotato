This is not a black and white issue. Or should we go to the 90s where you could be fined because you &quot;hacked&quot; a MS webserver by typing &quot;..&quot; in the URL bar and the webserver dutifully responded by showing you dir contents _outside_ the web root? Something which you could do almost by accident with a poorly managed copy &amp; paste.<p>There&#x27;s not that clear balance between &quot;the door was locked and I broke in&quot; and &quot;you were not even trying to secure this&quot;, and I would bet that most of these hospitals tilt to the later (MUMPS comes to mind), up to the point you can cause great havoc just by accident. So I would definitely argue against any absolute &quot;everything is a malware attack&quot; classification.')
