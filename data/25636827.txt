Some farmer living in Nepal might as well say, &quot;Imagine driving a car just to buy a dozen eggs because you don&#x27;t want to walk - isn&#x27;t this a sign of mental illness?&quot;<p>However, Americans do it all the time, not because they&#x27;re exceptionally lazy or mentally ill, but because the driving infrastructure is so exceptionally good that there&#x27;s no reason not to use it.  Driving is just what you do every day, without much thinking, instead of something that must be deliberately planned and executed.<p>(Whether that&#x27;s a net plus to America as a whole is, of course, a different question altogether.)')
