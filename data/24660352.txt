But everything else costs the same. An iPhone or a Honda Civic costs the same everywhere in the US.<p>Leaving the Bay Area will lower your housing costs, but everything else you buy will take up a larger percentage of your income than it did before. Plus you&#x27;ll be making less money -- in some cases, a lot less. Run the numbers and you might find out that even after paying for a Bay Area mortgage you would have more money in retirement in California than you would in a cheaper place.<p>Don&#x27;t move for cost savings. The economic benefits are not as strong as they appear to be. Only move somewhere if it&#x27;s actually where you want to live.')
