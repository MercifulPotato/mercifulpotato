The people of Latin America speak Spanish (and perhaps Portugese), and the Spanish word &quot;America&quot; means what it does in Spanish. But in English, the word &quot;America&quot; refers to the USA. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to complain about words in other languages that you don&#x27;t speak.<p>You acknowledge what America means when you use the English word &quot;Americas&quot; to refer to the regions within North and South America, because in English that is the word to use and has the other meaning.<p>The same logic applies to &quot;football&quot;, btw. The vast majority of English speaking people refer to soccer as soccer. That people who speak other languages use a word in their language that sounds like &quot;football&quot; to refer to soccer does not give them standing to sound off on what Australians, Americans, and Canadians call soccer. There is room for the British to bicker about it, but they are a distinct minority among English speakers.')
