Only Gender Identity Disorder -&gt; Gender Dysphoria happened in the last 2 decades.<p>CBT is great and I personally benefited from it, but it&#x27;s not a recent phenomenon and its effectiveness is very hard to evaluate.\nThere was a meta-study analysis in 2015 that pointed at a decline in its effectiveness between 1977 and 2014. \nI wonder whether it&#x27;s because studying anything to do with a human brain is hard and we can&#x27;t trust the numbers or if it&#x27;s because of changes in society that caused people&#x27;s personality to shift in a direction which makes CBT less effective.<p>Autism and schizophrenia were differentiated in 1980, so that&#x27;s not in the last 2 decades.<p>Homosexuality stopped being a mental illness in 1973 (or 1987 if you include sexual orientation disturbance), so that&#x27;s not in the last 2 decades. This was a great success, there were studies that pointed at a marked decrease in suicides among people in same-sex relationship over time.<p>Gender Identity Disorder stopped being a mental illness in 2013 but I think the issue has been politicised and the outcome doesn&#x27;t necessarily make a lot of sense. I can bring a personal anecdote from a friend of mine who started using a female name for a period and wanted to perform a reaffirmation surgery, who later changed his mind.<p>- Most kids who experience gender dysphoria before puberty grow out of it.<p>- Suicide rates are high even after reaffirmation surgery and even in western societies, which are accepting of transgenders. Moreover, if discrimination was the cause of suicide rates, I think we would see a high suicide rate in minorities. There is way more discrimination towards people of color than towards transgender.<p>- If Gender Identity Disorder is not a mental illness, shouldn&#x27;t we be consistent and label Body Integrity Dysphoria (aka people who believe they&#x27;re amputee) as diversity and approve of cutting off of healthy limbs?<p>I&#x27;m skeptical on including this as a win for the field.')
