This article touches on some the things that kept me away from it for so long - the mechanical nature of what is regarded as &quot;good&quot; playing, the focus on training up finger strength. But if I&#x27;m being honest, the number one thing that kept me away was that piano just seemed so... uncool.<p>Watching youtube vids with killer piano covers of songs I actually love (ex, this cover of Toxcity: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O1g2c2760oM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O1g2c2760oM</a>  ) has been helpful in disabusing me of that bias though. I watched a few of Glenn Gould&#x27;s videos and they were pretty great as well, but for whatever reason classical music never seems to do as much for me.')
