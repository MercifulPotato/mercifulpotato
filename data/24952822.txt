Item(by='bdowling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604162243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948624, text='&gt; The Kryoflux company claims ownership of all images created with Kryoflux hardware.<p>From the links provided, the issue is regarding documentation of the image “flux” file format and the availability of software tools to manipulate the images. Jason Scott probably doesn’t want to use a proprietary format for archival of disk images, and that’s fine. For someone to say that Kyroflux is claiming ownership of images created by its customers, however, is just misleading.')
