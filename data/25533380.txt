He looked at multiple scenarios and broke them down into thin slice moments. I’ve been pulled over seven times since reading that book. I know better about what the police officer may be anticipating , and more about their training. So when they approached my vehicle I watch their body language very carefully, and I remain “as calm as a Hindu cow.” For whatever reason, being extremely calm, and saying nothing unless I’m asked the question, throws them off so much that you can see this doubt come across their face. Like, did I pull the right car over? Did I read that wrong? Basically, teaching me to be extremely aware of the police officers behavior and body language has helped me positively navigate seven traffic stops')
