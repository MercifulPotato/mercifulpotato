In some ways your question is an oxymoron. You&#x27;re misunderstanding the term and have asked a bit of a silly question by accident.<p>If you explained why you think it needs to be static, we might be able to explain what you&#x27;ve misunderstood.<p>Ultimately some part of your system will need to be dynamic to get the data and transmit it across the internet. A static website can technically use JavaScript to call a dynamic one using an API, and then display data, but part of the overall setup is still dynamic. A normal website is still involved, that has to talk to the db. The setup is just more complicated.<p>As for the actual question, pick any framework (Rails, Django, etc). Follow the tutorial for beginners, they cover how to access the db within an hour or so.')
