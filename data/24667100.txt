I mean, this is basic biology that we probably all learned in middle school, and certainly had to learn in chemistry class. But I think we just fail to put 2-and-2 together, even the teachers. I think I was in my late 20s when it dawned on me that I was exhaling the food I ate. But I came to that realization in a matter of seconds based on first principles--principles learned in middle and high school.<p>Economics is similar. Almost every undergraduate students take economics. And Economics 101 is a pretty simple topic. But very few people learn to &quot;think like an economist&quot;, even many economists. I guess alot of subjects are like this--real life isn&#x27;t like the examples in textbooks, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the rules and principles don&#x27;t apply just the same. They do apply. Things can quickly get more complicated than in the textbooks. Perhaps we translate &quot;complicated&quot; to &quot;it doesn&#x27;t apply&quot; rather than what we should be thinking: it does apply just the same, but so do other dynamics, and the interactions can produce counter-intuitive results.')
