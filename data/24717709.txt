Item(by='hobofan', descendants=None, kids=[24718057], score=None, time=1602152130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716433, text='&quot;The bulk&quot; is hard to quantify, but looking around for technology in my apartment (and whatever else I use outside of it on a daily basis), I wouldn&#x27;t say so. A lot of it was previously available for well-off (not rich) households, and then became cheaper mainly due to scale. That doesn&#x27;t seem to be a direction they are going with a low passenger count plane that has the biggest benefit for people that spend a lot of time traveling between continents (like regular high-stakes business trips).<p>More importantly most of those things don&#x27;t inconvenience the people around me. If I use my computer or my kitchen-aid (high-price items in the past), it doesn&#x27;t disturb my neighbors (or would have in the past when they were still in their infancy).')
