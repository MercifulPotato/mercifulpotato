Society is becoming much easier for people with dark triad traits to navigate. This is due in part to the loss of community boundaries mentioned in the article. One aspect not yet mentioned is the information overload, in which case multiplying scandals is a perfectly rational strategy.<p>2. Anecdotally I&#x27;ve found that the &quot;lovable rogue&quot; type tends to be more popular than the person who follows the rules all the time. You want to project a sense of liveliness to be appreciated. Think of the kid from your school days who was often disruptive or naughty but followed the rules once in a while and still managed to win everyone&#x27;s hearts. Ironically, rogues like this are rewarded for their partial rule following as it is seen as a special effort coming from them. Rule followers are taken for granted.<p>3. Charisma is more important than any trait you could have. It&#x27;s not just charisma but a sense of being life affirming and owning your own personality and situation, like the rogue described above.<p>4. As soon as you apologize, the house of cards comes tumbling down. Just imagine what would happen if Trump were to apologize even once, for instance. It would be the last thing his base would tolerate. Cultivating your base is far more important than trying to appeal to lukewarm moderates. You must find the people genetically and culturally predisposed to like your style.<p>5. In the attention economy, attention becomes far, far more important than any other factor. Maybe 90% of your efforts should be placed on getting some if it&#x27;s a factor in your success.<p>6. Social norms are changing at an ever faster rate, but the basic drive for relative status is still there. There will always be a competition, just that you may be left bewildered at the criteria used. It&#x27;s important to adapt quickly and avoid expanding your identity to the point where you can no longer accept social changes.<p>7. In the end, the shameless individual is the most free. Shame is an ugly emotion, because social norms are often ugly and limiting. The sensitivity to shame is a strong character flaw that must be overcome. In the end, if you are just a host for ideas as mentioned, why not pick the path of self-affirmation? As the Greeks said, the person who does not belong in the polis is either a pariah or superhuman. By simple logic, very successful people generally have to break social expectations in some way.')
