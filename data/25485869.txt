I ducked out of Windows when Win7 support ended early this year and loaded Ubuntu on my aged laptop. My experience was ok enough. When it finally died in the summer I bought a well specced laptop loaded with Ubuntu from a Linux specialist (Entroware here in UK), and even now I am knocked out by how great the experience is. Now I would never want to go back to Windows.')
