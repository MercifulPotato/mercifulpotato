CEOs may or may not be psychopaths, but afaik it is not illegal to be a psychopath? Nor does it imply such a person will do evil things?<p>I personally think that the &quot;successful pyschopaths&quot; meme is also way overblown, but I don&#x27;t really know. I think being a psychopath is actually a deficiency, not a super power. Also in business I think people who help other people tend to be more successful overall than the stereotypical ruthlessly selfish people.<p>Edit: I think you added the link later on, that cites 21% of CEOs to be psychopaths? I would wait for replication on that one. It reminds me of another thing I read where reading about economics allegedly turned people into psychopaths (which is of course bullshit - just because you learned about rational decisions, as perhaps most CEOs do at some point, doesn&#x27;t mean you are a psychopath). I suspect the questionnaire or the study they used to determine the &quot;21%&quot; number may in fact be motivated by politics.')
