CEOs may or may not be psychopaths, but afaik it is not illegal to be a psychopath? Nor does it imply such a person will do evil things?<p>I personally think that the &quot;successful pyschopaths&quot; meme is also way overblown, but I don&#x27;t really know. I think being a psychopath is actually a deficiency, not a super power. Also in business I think people who help other people tend to be more successful overall than the stereotypical ruthlessly selfish people.')
