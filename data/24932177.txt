Can&#x27;t find it now...<p>What stuck with me was his disappointment that the wider torrent community simply relied on the pirate bay always making a return. There was no real effort to go beyond resilient hosting. No producing facts by superior technology. It was just a bunch of copy-cats playing whac-a-mole with the copyright industry. To paraphrase: &quot;I went to jail for this stuff, and you don&#x27;t even care enough about it to follow up on it in earnest?&quot; At least that&#x27;s how it read to me. As I said, it&#x27;s been a while.<p>Hosting torrent platforms and such on namecheap, cloudflare (no really!) and all the other mainstream platforms seems like such an <i>obviously, deeply stupid choice</i>. There&#x27;s only very few projects (that I know of) that are really addressing resilient, organized, curated content dissemination, and they&#x27;re essentially divorced from the pirate scene. Too bad I guess.')
