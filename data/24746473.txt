I was actually looking at the Arducam lenses last night because I&#x27;d love to build my own webcam capable of a good image for light content creation, but that I could throw a 90 or 100 degree FoV lens on for calls with groups. I was starting to get a sense of the limitations you listed here and now I&#x27;ll probably keep looking at some other options like re-purposing a used GoPro with a camlink, spending way more for a DSLR, or really cheaping out on a couple different lower quality cameras. If I can&#x27;t figure anything out, maybe I&#x27;ll revisit in 6-12 months.<p>I think the article&#x27;s author is right that today&#x27;s webcams are boring. But I would go a step further and say that the webcam market really needs some of that patented disruption that people keep talking about.')
