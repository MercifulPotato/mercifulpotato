They also make guarantees that the ground pins are first to connect, and last to disconnect.<p>My guess would be that you disconnected your laptop while it was pulling lots of power. The pins got disconnected in the wrong order, which resulted in the electronics in the dock getting fried or a high voltage line for power delivery got momentarily connected to a data line, and fried something.')
