The issues that occurred are now widely known about and pilot training will include dealing with an MCAS issue, so an exact repeat is incredibly unlikely.<p>Although the FAA and EASA have certified the Max as safe to fly again, it will only be for airframes that have had the required modifications to prevent the runway trim and only once operation instead of continuous. They have also allowed the pilots to override by the stick which they weren’t able to do before.<p>Statistically it’s highly likely that there won’t be any further occurrences of this issue with the 737 Max again.<p>Depending on when you are doing it may be that the airline won’t have time to train the pilots in which case they won’t be flying it at the start of next year. However I expect that to change over the year and that most 737 Max flights are back in operation by the end of the year, or at least as many as are needed to fly in the reduced circumstances of today’s pandemic.')
