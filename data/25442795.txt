That prevents me from selling or transferring my crypto, but I&#x27;m still allowed to buy more!?  Their automated verification tool fails for my driver&#x27;s license, and despite multiple support tickets I&#x27;ve gotten no human response.  My takeaway from this is that Coinbase isn&#x27;t mature enough to be trusted.')
