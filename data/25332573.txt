I’ve hurt plenty of people with my episodes but I’ve lost few friends.<p>It is not the worst day that matters to most people but what you do after that worst day.<p>I try to make things right. My friends know who I am at my heart. They know my episodes are beyond my control. As a result, most of them stick by me because I will take responsibility for the damage my actions and words have caused.<p>I also plan in depth for episodes. My friends have my permission to intervene, even if I try to push them away or refuse to accept help. Most of these measures have never been used but they are there.<p>My friends trust me because of this.')
