This has happened multiple times already with extensions in the past.<p>This idea that we need to keep locking down markets because one day things go bad is really really not good. We should not deny ourselves software because there are bad usages of it.<p>These fear-inducing scenarios are all bad because they are low information marketplaces. The consumer has no idea what extensions really do, they don&#x27;t see when major changes happen to the software they use, they don&#x27;t see ownership changes, they don&#x27;t see what data is gathered, they don&#x27;t see where data goes. And yes, we can&#x27;t expect consumers to watch &amp; attend all of these things. Which is why it&#x27;s important consumers be able to rely on each other, to have some way to signal danger &amp; emergencies to one another.<p>Instead of trying to create a marketplace where information &amp; understanding can flow, instead of allowing genuine competition based on markets, we continue building markets assuming every buyers is &amp; forever will be a totally blind idiot with no help, no friends, no other voices to help them make their decisions.<p>I&#x27;m so fired of Fear Uncertainty and Doubt. The security apparatchik of the web today terrifies me. Deny deny deny. Close down close down close down. Severe connections, pull up the draw bridges, flood the moats, send out the alligators. I tire of these defensive wars, I tire of giving up ground, because the web has some pretense of being a perfectly secure place. I would much rather us be intertwingled, allow bold exploration of systems, mingling together, &amp; while doing that figure out ways forward that permit some risk.<p>Extensions are the most vital &amp; powerful capability on the web. They are what make it better than everything else. Keeping the user sovereign, giving them amazing mind blowingly powerful extensions, is how the web keeps from becoming just another app. Those great powers can be abused. But we need to find ways to permit these powers to exist anyways.')
