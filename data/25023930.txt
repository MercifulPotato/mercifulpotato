Adobe wants to tightly control the experience, record how you use the software, display their own branding, try to upsell you on their other products and services, etc etc.<p>Software businesses care about controlling the UX&#x2F;branding&#x2F;etc. tightly, because that&#x27;s where the money is - not selling &quot;menus of filters&quot;. That&#x27;s why every webpage is nowadays is a SPA that hijacks standard browser features like scroll and copy paste and no one looking to make money was ever interested in the semantic web.<p>I&#x27;m very aligned with the views exposed in the article and your comment, and have been working on some open source approaches to it in my free time for a few years now. I figure that the only way that it can maybe work is to make something for myself that I love using, and maybe some other enthusiasts will like it too and it can grow a bit from there. But there&#x27;s probably no way it would ever meaningfully compete with Photoshop, because it goes against every economic incentive that software companies have.<p>In parallel, I also suspect that that&#x27;s why the design&#x2F;UX of open source applications tend to be extremely poor in general - great, tight design is expensive and needs strong economic incentives.')
