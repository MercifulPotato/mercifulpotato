Paying a woman to act as though she&#x27;s interested in you is the commoditization of an innate yearning for companionship.  It&#x27;s turning something that poems are written about into mere transaction.  And it&#x27;s baffling to me how people who tend to be &quot;against capitalism&quot; somehow rally to the free market when it comes to selling sex.')
