One of the creators of the Lambda Fellows program here.<p>We were trying to crack several problems with Fellows:<p>- The current hiring process in our industry is broken. Interviews represent a point-in-time measurement of someone&#x27;s talent when you should be &quot;hiring for slope&quot;, it introduces bias, and it&#x27;s time-consuming and costly. It also unnecessarily punishes Junior engineers.<p>- The best learning experience for a Lambda engineer is real work. We&#x27;ve done our best to design an educational program that simulates real work, but it&#x27;s still just a simulation. &quot;If you want to learn how to do a thing, the best way is to do that thing.&quot;<p>- 1-to-1 mentorship from a more experienced developer is a powerful learning too, but it&#x27;s rare. It best occurs within the context of a shared work product where comments are not abstract and squishy but focused and tactical.<p>- Despite placing over 1,000 Lambda engineers at top companies around the industry, there remains skepticism about their ability to be productive and ship software.<p>We think Lambda Fellows is the best of both worlds: it&#x27;s an unparalleled learning experience for Lambda grads (real work + mentorship) while providing companies with an accelerated onramp to experience junior talent on their team while allowing them to give back to develop the next generation of software engineers.<p>I&#x27;ll hang out here for the next hour or so. Feel free to ask any questions you might have.')
