Support is generally pretty good, there&#x27;s a dedicated community that has been very active pushing upstream[1].<p>Except the ARM G51 Bifrost gpu, which has only recently started to see viability[2] thanks to one hacker&#x27;s reverse engineering. If you want to read a lot of words, there&#x27;s a status report from the libreeelec Kodi-based media player distribution distribution that&#x27;s a year old, that lays out a lot of what needs be done, from a very video-intense perspective[3]; this is before recent reverse engineering efforts, &amp; largely discusses uses closed proprietary blobs, but still interesting. Most recently &amp; very interestingly, there are signs that ARM itself may be willing to start helping out the reverse engineered development[4], which would be a new potentially interesting state of affairs.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux-meson.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux-meson.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Bifrost-Gallium3D-Most-GLES-2.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Bifrost-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.libreelec.tv&#x2F;thread&#x2F;21134-what-aspects-of-hardware-is-supported-under-amlogic-mainline-at-the-moment&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.libreelec.tv&#x2F;thread&#x2F;21134-what-aspects-of-hard...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Arm-Panfrost-Going-Official" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Arm-Panf...</a>')
