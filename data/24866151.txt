Or someone who&#x27;s in your life for half an hour. It does seem you have no idea how bad bullying often is. I&#x27;m sure my case wasn&#x27;t particularly bad, but it was bad enough for your apparent promotion of exposure to bullying as a good, character-building thing to seem oblivious to the problems a lot of people have with it. Bullying isn&#x27;t part of my success story, it made me miserable for years. And the people doing it were seemingly happy about that.<p>I had dozens of bullies for years in high school - that combined with mostly very bad teachers made the experience one I could&#x27;ve done without. I never told any adult about the bullying or tried to do anything about it. Maybe because my father bullied me at home also, and I guess that was life. Eventually in my 20s I somehow healed myself, thanks to a self-help, psychology and spiritual books of all kinds and a lot of..inner work.')
