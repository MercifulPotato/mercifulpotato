I really enjoyed Caliphate; it was fascinating, and I trusted the NYT to be able to vet its claims. Now I know I enjoyed a piece of nearly-fiction, and I feel cheated, because I still want to know about the subject matter.<p>I&#x27;m not sure retracting a years-old podcast is going to be enough to rebuild trust. I need to hear how the NYT is going to engage some actual experts on this, and I want to hear their perspectives on the story Calpihate presents. The fundamental questions the podcast asked are still very live: What was it like to live under ISIS? How did that organization operate in the areas where it had control? And so on.<p>Editing to add: I&#x27;m not sure how to trust further work from Rukmini Callimachi. The fact she&#x27;s still working at the Times, with no information on how they&#x27;ll be vetting her work, is concerning.')
