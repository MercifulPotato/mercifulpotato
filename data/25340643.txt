Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25341320], score=None, time=1607392347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25337961, text='If anti-cheat is the thing that cares about whether windows is running without driver signature enforcement then anti-cheat is the thing that&#x27;s blocking me.<p>My own example: I have an xbox 360 dancemat, which is unusable with the official drivers (they map the arrows as axes, so treat left + right as nothing). So I have to use the open-source XBCD, which frankly I&#x27;d treat as more reputable and better code quality than most signed drivers. But since no-one&#x27;s paying the $100+&#x2F;year to sign it, it&#x27;s not signed. And while I understand why Microsoft wants someone to have skin in the game before they issue a driver signing certificate, they really need to find a way to ensure that reputable, established open-source driver projects get signed if they want users to accept driver signing; I wouldn&#x27;t even mind being stuck on an old &quot;certified&quot; version or something.')
