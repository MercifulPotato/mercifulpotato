I get what you&#x27;re saying, but I&#x27;m also pretty sure that the people you&#x27;re calling hypocrites have a more nuanced view than that and differentiate based on context and cause and don&#x27;t consider &quot;white supremacist Q-conspiracy-lie-believers rioting&quot; (which this was) to be equal to &quot;people rioting because police officers keep killing in circumstances that don&#x27;t warrant it without serious repercussion&quot; (which the BLM riots were).<p>We can also note that many of the BLM riots only turned violent _after_ local police started shooting gas, pepper balls, and rubber bullets at crowds. But even if that weren&#x27;t the case, the causes and contexts would still be different.<p>It seems to me like the people you&#x27;re talking about are in fact neither anti-extremist nor pro-extremist. They&#x27;re anti-white-supremacists and anti-police-getting-away-with-murder. Those are not contradictory positions.<p>&gt; <i>groups screaming about the DC riots</i><p>I haven&#x27;t seen anyone screaming about context-free &quot;DC riots&quot;. I see people screaming about &quot;white supremacist Q-anon-lie-conspiracy-believers rioting in DC trying to capture or kill congresspersons and overthrow a (mostly-if-you-ignore-voter-suppression) fair democratic election&quot; and I think that makes a big difference.<p>It&#x27;s not the riots that these people are worried about. It&#x27;s the reason for the riots, and the reasons are not equal.')
