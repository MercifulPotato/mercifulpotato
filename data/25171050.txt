And that they be called &quot;selfish&quot; for thinking so.<p>People working and making material sacrifices over their lifetimes only to see those burdens lifted for others are not a small edge case to be brushed away.<p>How about if I put it in a HN-relevant case (and to paint it in more obviously judgemental terms to make the point).<p>You and a colleague are given a 2-week deadline to deliver some code.   It&#x27;s a tough deadline.   You are diligent and work day and night, overtime, missing your kids birthday and having your spouse mad at you, to meet the deadline and deliver your part.  Your colleague has been a low performer consistently, asks your help to finish the work, doesn&#x27;t actually finish it by the due date.   Your boss, at the delivery meeting, says, actually, this was just a motivational exercise to get us to practice coding and teamwork, and didn&#x27;t really count after all.  She won&#x27;t even bother looking at your work because it was just for your personal development.  We&#x27;re a team.<p>How do you feel?  How about we run that again the next 2 weeks.  What are you going to do?  Feeling good for your colleague who was about to get in some trouble, but luckily it all turned out ok?  Your wife and kid will be glad for that I&#x27;m sure.<p>And aside from all that, my points about the unintended incentives of such a policy remain.')
