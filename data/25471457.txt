Why would you whine about your game ? Just. Get. A. Refund.<p>If you start the game, even for a second,  Sony will refuse a refund on a digital download.  CPDR would not allow footage of the game on PS4 to be shared, and called rumours of poor performance &quot;fake rumours&quot;.  If you boot the game up and within minutes find it an unplayable mess, there was no remediation.  (Of course, now Sony has offered blanket refunds for the game; I&#x27;m just providing context for the  outrage over the anti-consumer behaviour.)')
