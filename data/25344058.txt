Symptoms set in days after exposure, and transmission is uneven at best.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve had covid.<p>We assume we were exposed at the clinic, where our kid needed emergency medical treatment. But if so, only one of us was with the child indoors -- in a cleaned room with a doctor in full PPE and us in masks -- and treatment lasted less than 5 minutes.<p>But by the time we experienced onset of symptoms, days later, we had been in close proximity with my in-laws (they need care and were part of our bubble) for over 24 hours. Luckily, they developed no symptoms and tested negative.<p>So 5 minutes of exposure to an asymptomatic carrier at the clinic likely transmitted the virus to us, but 24 hours in close contact failed to transmit the virus to my in-laws.<p>The delay of onset and inconsistent transmission patterns make this virus exceedingly difficult and expensive to track.
