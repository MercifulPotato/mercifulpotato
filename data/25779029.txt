As a Greek i can assure you that almost all the wars of Greece to everyone else, and of Romans, were the result of gaining profit. Just like slavery stopped because of education, and educated capitalists with well trained human workers amount to thousand of times more wealth than any amount of slaves, the same holds for wars. We live in a low-war environment because invading in another country and stealing fridges and cars is just unprofitable.<p>With the current technology, computer, genetics, and just the sheer creativity of the human mind, any country can contribute to the world trade, and start making bricks from sand using bacteria, any amount of food if they plant pine trees or palm trees which they both have an edible and highly nutritious bark, poison free too. The bark of these trees diminish the thirst so humans need a lot less water, contrary to, say producing livestock for meat. It is not economically viable any more, to create an educated and highly productive population, just to send them killed in a moments notice.<p>I am all about occasionally suspending the peace for a war, for one philosophical reason. The only truth in the world, is death. Someone can bribe a basketball team to lose, but not an army. No one dies for money. When one male kills another in a fight, we all know the dead gave it all to stay alive. When there is too much unhealthy peace in place, people start believing in lies.<p>That recent covid hysteria, i think it proves me right.')
