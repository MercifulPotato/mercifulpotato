Where would that MVP come from? For complex software it&#x27;s either an internal project spun out from a unicorn or a labor of love from a gentleman hacker. These are pretty limited routes; it&#x27;s much easier to start an open source startup with the caveat that the community will probably never emerge later because the startup will be moving too fast for outsiders to jump in. Now startups feel they have to use &quot;innovative&quot; licenses to be successful but the powers that be are deriding these licenses as &quot;fake open source&quot;. We&#x27;re setting ourselves up for an OSS winter where sophisticated developer tools or installable infrastructure software just won&#x27;t be created.')
