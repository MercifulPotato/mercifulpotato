Again, every single electric car(including my own) has a regenerative mode, where the car applies gentle resistance to the electric motors when you lift your foot off the throttle - I can absolutely guarantee that if you drove one you wouldn&#x27;t see any difference between this and engine braking with a manual. It provides the same level of safety in slippery conditions as a manual would.<p>The reasons why trucks don&#x27;t usually have automatic transmissions is that the torque needed to move such a huge mass would destroy nearly every traditional hydrokinetic transmission, only recently dual clutches have started getting good enough to be installed in trucks, and indeed most new tractors you can buy now from Volvo, Mercedes or Scania are all automatic. It has nothing to do with safety, it was a technical limitation. And for braking trucks have a separate engine retarder that has nothing to do with the transmission.')
