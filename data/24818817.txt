Most easily as a course-grain polyglot (combining large chunks of such code), and increasingly speculatively as grain size decreases (eg different languages in the same file, or function, or expression), or as language options are pruned (a manticore - representational redundancy is removed as a feature present in multiple languages becomes only available in some&#x2F;one of its forms).')
