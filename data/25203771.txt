It&#x27;s true, though, that the computer could still be stuck even though it updates the spinner. This is a hard problem to solve.<p>Abusing progress bars are not a good response to this, though. I would rather trust progress bars for what they are meant to show rather than as an indication of true activity. After all, you still can&#x27;t tell whether the progress bar kept moving, but the process is stuck in a loop.')
