Duff&#x27;s device creates an unstructured control-flow graph (a loop with multiple entry points), which is going to cause several optimizations to bail out, and will absolutely prevent any loop optimizations (such as vectorization) from kicking in for that loop. In hardware terms, for tight loops, the entire loop in regular terms is probably going to be in a hardware loop Âµop cache, and the loop branch predictor will probably predict the loop exit condition with 100% accuracy.')
