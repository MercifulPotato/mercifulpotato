And it&#x27;s consistent with what I wrote - GDPR law does not require consent for such cookies. So the regulator is ok with no consent.<p>Apart from GDPR law, there&#x27;s also separate EU Cookie Legislation which was passed before GDPR. This regulation require clear user notification (not consent) that cookies are used.  As far as I know (but I might be wrong, I don&#x27;t follow it) this law is still in place and GDPR did not replace it. So that means you still need cookie notification banner (but not with &quot;I accept&quot; button but with &quot;I understand&quot;).')
