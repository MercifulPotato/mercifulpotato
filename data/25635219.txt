If BTCs future is in using it, it has to convince the future companies and stores to not use other coins or services. Or to a buyer today to still have as much demand even after the speculation is gone (which is currently its main&#x2F;only function).<p>Wallets, miners, etc won&#x27;t really matter at all if Square and Amazon etc have a plugin that uses a stable coin of each currency along with BTC. The world will have infinite transfer capabilities of other &quot;scarce&quot; non-fiat and fiat pegged coins without BTC (including other electronic currency based services).')
