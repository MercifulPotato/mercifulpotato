Privacy laws there are much looser, but this is offset by much stricter government control and much less recourse by companies like WeChat to the courts. Hint: if WeChat doesn&#x27;t toe the PRC government line, it will run into... problems.<p>Suffice to say that Asia, and particularly China, has a different approach to governance, privacy, and (broadly) the welfare of their citizens.<p>However, given the enormous rights corporations enjoy in the West independent of the government, it&#x27;s important that we don&#x27;t use SE Asia or China as a model, and ensure that proprietary platforms don&#x27;t have too much power over small businesses. Luckily, most small businesses in the West know this already, otherwise AOL would still be doing gangbusters business.<p>PS. Something that&#x27;s often missed about small businesses in Asia doing business solely on WeChat is that <i>informal</i> trust networks forged by &#x27;contacts&#x27;, are a huge thing in Asia. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the seller of really cheap phone covers just has a WeChat ID if a respected merchant vouches for him. And platforms like Alibaba and Taobao exist for people who reach the limits of these informal networks and want to go to the next level.')
