Probably helped that there was only extremely slow and expensive legitimate distribution channels and actual work was required to make the content accessible in other languages.<p>Rakuten&#x27;s Viki service is another interesting model - they license content, then give people early access and crowdsource the translations, where the only benefit of translating is getting the $5-10 monthly service for free.')
