At least at a conceptual level something like diw is basically a function (d) applied to data (iw). Vim is completely scalar. The type of all the functions is more or less something like string â†’ string. Kakoune is the APL of text editors. Multiple selections are an array of strings to operate on. It automatically maps the function (editor commands) over every selection. I find this extremely attractive and powerful.<p>At least for me kakoune blows all other editors out of the water. It really is quite good.')
