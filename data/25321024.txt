And if the medical system collapses under strain, a mob will be at public health officials&#x27; throats screaming bloody murder. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you shut down restaurants when you could?&quot; I don&#x27;t envy their position.<p>I worry that this will end up being counterproductive, though. Probably the net number of people meeting other people will go down. However, of those who still meet other people, they will likely meet somewhere indoors (someone&#x27;s home for dinner), which is much more dangerous than outdoor dining.')
