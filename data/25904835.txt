Depends on how easy&#x2F;cheap to replace all the parts are - seats will wear out, the headliner will have accumulated all kinds of stains and grease, random electronics (a modern car has ~100 microcontrollers) might fail and be hard to access, AC might be expensive to fix, maybe the battery dies and (even if the batteries are cheap by then) the mechanic charges 1k for the replacement...<p>At some point it&#x27;s probably cheaper to buy another used 8yo EV than continuing to maintain an 18yo EV.')
