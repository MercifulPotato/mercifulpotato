In practice not having a NAT makes &quot;automatic&quot; internal protection of web services hard to impossible.<p>&gt; If you want to secure your servers, use a firewall. Maybe it&#x27;s a host-based firewall.<p>Firewalls do not solve this problem because a you <i>do</i> want service to service communication.  What you do not want is code that crawls to user supplied URLs to access your internal services.  Do you need application level protections.  With IPv6 you&#x27;re basically forced to declare your CIDR explicitly whereas with IPv4 you could easily achieve a secure by default system.')
