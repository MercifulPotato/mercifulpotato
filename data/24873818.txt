They may or may not get reencoded using the ffmpeg integration before retrieving as well.<p>YouTube&#x27;s web interface is basically useless for me on a slow link, not to mention it&#x27;s incredibly obnoxious with all its recommendations and other unmanagable propaganda delivery.<p>Youtube-dl&#x27;s ability to retrieve titles and descriptions without showing me anything else and before retrieving any video content alone make youtube&#x27;s opaque hashed URLs usable for me.')
