In Japan you don&#x27;t consider someone senior after 3-4 years working. Most of my mid-level dev friends working locally make in the $60k-$80k range, and I know 3 senior devs making $100k+ (I work for a US startup so I am excluding myself).<p>The longest open jobs in public boards are unsurprisingly those devs don&#x27;t want because they pay too little. So if you try to estimate pay based on those boards I&#x27;d say you are under-estimating it.')
