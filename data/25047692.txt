While the software probably does a good job of correcting it under a wide range of <i>normal</i> operating conditions, can it deal with evolving or <i>abnormal</i> operating conditions? Will the software still be able to compensate if the pitch-up moment is artificially increased by, e.g. the roof turning into a scoop, or flaps jamming, or a small piece of wing trim breaking? Would Aloha Airlines Flight 243 still have landed safely after the roof came off, becoming a scoop, if it were instead a 737Max?')
