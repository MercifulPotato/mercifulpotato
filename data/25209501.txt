In the past, the files had to be fetched from a tired server far away in Russia, the speed can be as low as 0.5 Mbps in my experience (depends on your ISP and connectivity), now it can be lightning fast thanks to P2P, 2 Mbps+, more than adequate to download a 100 MiB+ file. You don&#x27;t even have to install IPFS (but you probably should, to maintain decentralization), books can be downloaded straight via HTTPS from Cloudflare&#x27;s IPFS reverse proxy (called a &quot;gateway&quot;), cloudflare-ipfs.com.<p>The IPFS network itself cannot be taken down, but I wonder when will the publishers discover IPFS web gateways, and start filing DMCA takedown requests against them, and what are the gateways gonna do? Will Cloudflare implement a huge copyright blocklist or even terminate its service (or worse, send a list of IP addresses to Prentice Hall or Elsevier)? What about the semi-official ipfs.io gateway? And the smaller independent IPFS gateways (there are currently 10+ on the public web)? Will they be DMCAed out of existence?')
