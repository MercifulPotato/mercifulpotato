And Australia had counted on the &#x27;Motherland&#x27; to take all those exports.<p>There was the silly situation of British housewives paying only half as much for a pound of Australian butter as  Australian housewives.<p>Then, all of a sudden, Australian markets and profits were lost. And it took about 10 years of Australia promoting and selling to the Asian markets to regain the levels of exports that it had lost overnight.')
