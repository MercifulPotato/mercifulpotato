It frustrates me to no end (add in how IDEs will auto-complete parentheses and I&#x27;m constantly lost in a complex decision tree of how to recover from being one key off) and I can&#x27;t seem to build muscle memory well like this. The other symbol keys are also a wash. Particular offenders are y and z, ? and -, &quot; vs Ã„ vs @, as well as + (who came up with the idea of requiring shift for that?!).<p>I just can&#x27;t intuitively keep up with what layout is active and&#x2F;or how to adjust my typing, even if it&#x27;s always the same for the same application. Frequently I settle for &quot;try one thing and correct if necessary&quot;. Obviously slows me down a lot.<p>Any suggestions welcome.')
