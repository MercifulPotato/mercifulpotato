Sure she frequently procrastinates, but having a teacher send &quot;don&#x27;t panic, here are 4 hours of homework due tomorrow&quot; has literally put her in the situation of sitting on her computer from 8PM till 2AM a number of times now. Plus she is burning ~8 hours on the weekend with homework too.<p>So, I guess that is the price of being in a top tier highschool taking AP classes. When I was in a similar situation I probably only spent on average an hour a day on homework.')
