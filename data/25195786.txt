A few days later, the police find someone sort of matching the description I give with a few hundred dollars cash in his wallet. He has an alibi, though not very solid proof, and a few details don&#x27;t line up. The jury doesn&#x27;t convict him. Am I entitled to the money out of his wallet on a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard? It&#x27;s only money.')
