That’s 400W just for these 3 most power-hungry components, under high load&#x2F;maximum brightness.<p>Lower-end office PCs often ship with ~500W PSU. Gaming PCs typically include 700W PSU or even more. For instance, nVidia recommends 750W PSU for their released but unavailable RTX 3080, that GPU itself is rated to 320W. Display ain’t included as it has a separate power plug.<p>When viewed as a heater, computers are almost 100% efficient. Almost all electricity they consume becomes heat. The exceptions are light from display escaping through windows, and radio from WiFi carrying energy through walls, both negligible.')
