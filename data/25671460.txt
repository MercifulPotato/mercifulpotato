Being able to write some code on a simpler problem vs real-life code is an equivalent of a 40 yard dash vs rushing for a touchdown (or whatever). Being able to find special cases, or design, or figure out a simple algorithmic puzzle is the equivalent of the same for larger problems. The alternative is letting the candidate talk about their projects or to have some hand-wavy design exercise, something too easy to BS.')
