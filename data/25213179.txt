The lasers are acting like spark plugs, triggering the fuel to release all its energy at the top of each cycle.<p>In other words, the French strategy is &quot;build a miniature sun&quot;, the American strategy is &quot;build a miniature hydrogen bomb&quot;. In theory, it should be easier, hydrogen bombs already exist after all, but to trigger the reaction, you need to find a way to squeeze a lot of energy into a really small space to make the hygrogen atoms kiss, and you can&#x27;t use the traditional method of &quot;put a plutonium bomb next to it&quot; for obvious reasons.')
