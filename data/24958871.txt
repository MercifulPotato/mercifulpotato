Item(by='chousuke', descendants=None, kids=[24961244], score=None, time=1604231851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957927, text='null is not a very good default value in most cases though, since the operations you do with values of &quot;real&quot; types will not work on null. Therefore actually using your &quot;default&quot; value is pretty much guaranteed to be a bug, identical to using an uninitialized variable.<p>It would be better to just error out and not allow the uninitialized usage at all, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not possible in Javascript.')
