Because after-hours aren&#x27;t going through the &quot;markets&quot;, but through Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs). The rules are different (Fidelity requires all orders to be limit orders, for example). So the best summary answer I can give is: &quot;it&#x27;s not 24 hours because normal trading and after-hours trading are on separate platforms, rather than after-hours being an extension of normal trading&quot;.')
