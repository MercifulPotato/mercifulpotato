In general I don&#x27;t mind doing that. At the end of the day I work for money. The question I&#x27;m asking myself is at which point that might be.\nSadly when interviewing I&#x27;m not in the position to point out architectural pain points. It feels impossible to argue against k8s. Every time I tried that I get some unreflected cargo cult answer. The people I interview with already invested in k8s so it seems pointless to indicate that there are some massive downsides.')
