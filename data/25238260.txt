What I&#x27;m interested in is how this will be regarded by Rust programmers as time passes and how it will continue to be supported.<p>It would be interesting for example to see if e.g. the 2015 edition will still be usable&#x2F;used 9 years later (like C++11) or even ~20 years later (like C++98) but we have some way to go before we can find that out.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s something exciting about being on the bleeding edge. Right now I&#x27;m using C++17 and would probably jump on C++20 when it becomes widely available. But having the knowledge that I have the rock-solid C++11 at my disposal and knowing that it will likely be there for decades gives me a feeling of security that&#x27;s hard to beat.')
