Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24662241], score=None, time=1601627505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24659522, text='It&#x27;s a bit more complicated:<p>If they die in time for whatever the ballot cutoff is in each state, the parties can select a replacement, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that time has passed (it must have where ballots are already being cast); they may do so later, but this will have different effects in different states.<p>After the people have voted (even before the electors cast their ballots) faithless elector laws come into play, and 14 states cancel votes of electors that do not cast their votes for the pledged candidate, and AFAIK none of those 14 states have post-popular-vote change of pledge rules. Conceivably, electors in the other states could change their votes (some with some penalties, but not vote cancellation), whether or not the party directed them one particular way before or after the people voted. But any votes that are out of line with the outcome of the state vote, even if by reason of the elector choosing an alternate because of candidate death, are outside of the safe harbor law (which is probably not enforceable, but that just means other votes within the safe harbor could in theory also be at risk) and potentially subject to challenge and potential cancellation when Congress <i>counts</i> the electoral votes. Congress may, in this case, also accept offered <i>competing</i> electoral votes, if such exist.<p>But if no candidate receives the required majority of available (not tallied) electoral votes for either President of VP (or both) <i>as judged by Congress</i>, the succession rules for that office come into play when the term starts with the office vacant.')
