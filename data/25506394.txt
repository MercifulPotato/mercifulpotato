Apple had ditched Motorola for cpus for 2 years by the time the iPhone came out.<p>Motorola had no clue about Apple making a phone, and Apple wasn&#x27;t getting phone-making knowledge from them.<p>If you mean about before, their single phone collaboration with Motorola was just a 100% Motorola phone design running an Apple-provided music player part.<p>Motorola didn&#x27;t collaborate with Apple on the design of that phone or anything, Apple didn&#x27;t get any IP or copied any elements, and nor was the iPhone anything like it.')
