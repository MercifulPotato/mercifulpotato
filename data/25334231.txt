At a very basic level, it&#x27;s much faster for me to write &quot;p-4&quot; than &quot;padding: 1rem;&quot;.<p>A big benefit I see is the constraints it introduces. If another developer comes along, they know there are a few options for padding. Rather than guessing and setting some pixel value (or should it be in em, or rem?) or having to refer to other code or documentation, they can just look at a design document and say &quot;that looks like a p-4&quot;, done.<p>Tailwind also makes things much more flexible than using inline styles: I can add a brand colour to my Tailwind configuration, and I immediately have utility classes available for text, background, fills, hover and focus states, etc. I can update one hex value rather than refactoring every inline style in my app. You could do this with custom classes, but frameworks like Tailwind mean I can hire a new developer and they don&#x27;t have to look through a stylesheet and memorize potentially hundreds of style definitions and class names. I think this standardisation can be very useful.')
