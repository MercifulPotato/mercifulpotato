REUTERS&#x2F;Hill family handout<p>Makes his criminal activity sound like an inconvenience to himself.<p>Simplest way to avoid dying in jail is to not be a criminal because the reality is you will not be treated like a human being.  But that should be implied because society has deemed your life better spent locked away in a cage out of sight out of mind.<p>Source I found states ~2.3million currently incarcerated, 700,000 of those for violent crimes.  .2% mortality rate actually quite impressive to me considering the circumstances and I would guess of those 5000 the one the article references is an outlier considering the events leading to the death seem a bit suspicious - enough to write a story I guess.')
