It&#x27;s mind-boggling to think how Microsoft was able to dominate for so long with clearly inferior technology, while vastly superior tech (NeXT, Amiga, BeOS) lost out.<p>There are many such unhappy stories, and I often think about the millions of hours spent on building tech that should have conquered the world, but didn&#x27;t.
