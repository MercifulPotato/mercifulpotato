I&#x27;d wager that a dynamically typed languages such as Python has quit a few more pain points at scale than a more principled language such as OCaml.<p>I love Python&#x27;s bignum arithmetic when I write small prototypes for public key cryptography. I love Python&#x27;s extensive standard library when I&#x27;m scrapping a couple web pages for easier local reading. But I would never willingly chose it for anything bigger than a few hundred lines. I&#x27;m simply not capable of dealing with large dynamically typed programs.<p>Now if people try Rust or OCaml with the mentality of an early startup&#x27;s Lisp developer, they&#x27;re going to get hurt right away (&quot;fighting the language&quot; and &quot;pleasing the compiler&quot; is neither pleasing nor productive), and they&#x27;re going to get hurt in the long run (once you&#x27;ve worked around the language&#x27;s annoying checks, you won&#x27;t reap as much benefit).<p>If you&#x27;ll allow the caricature, don&#x27;t force Coq down Alan Kay&#x27;s throat, and don&#x27;t torture Edsger Dijkstra with TCL.')
