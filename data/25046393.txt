Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605018973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041264, text='&gt; high-stakes mass testing (entrance exams etc.)<p>That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s done wrong.<p>There are countries where they simply sort by descending scores on whatever standard test they came up with to admit. As if the test was perfect and results could be compared at an infinite decimal place (hint, stats and physics disagree with that!).<p>So the test basically becomes a measure of how someone is good at taking the test and you start to see min-maxing behaviors. It&#x27;s a contest to see who can pour the most time into maximizing its results. The incentives for cheating are simply so high. The downside of cheating is that you don&#x27;t really learn, but since the only skill these tests teach you is taking the tests, you are really robbing yourself of a skill that becomes useless 3 minutes after the test.<p>My advice is to throw these tests in the trash.')
