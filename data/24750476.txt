That&#x27;s what Satoshi used if I&#x27;m not mistaken[1], or at least I remember this being used before blockchain.<p>If you want to do it the other way around, you needed a trusted third party up until Bitcoin came around and there was a method that did not rely on a single third party.<p>One issue I see with blockchains is that they require a running and ongoing service to prevent backdating. A witness also works, but is just moving the problem (it can be a solution, but it&#x27;s not a <i>general</i> solution that works in every situation). To me it still seems that the easy way around is the one that is solvable with an ordinary newspaper.<p>Edit: I see in your GitHub bio (sorry for the stalking, I was curious about your age since you seem to consider blockchain to be the more generally available than newspapers, whereas to (perhaps older) me, newspapers are the generally available method and blockchain novel) that you describe yourself as a &quot;Applied Cryptography Consultant (what the cool kids call &#x27;blockchain tech&#x27;)&quot;. I suppose that explains why we see this as opposite.<p>[1] Also looked up the newspaper that Satoshi used. Wikipedia says: `Embedded in the coinbase transaction of [the genesis] block was the text: &quot;The Times 03&#x2F;Jan&#x2F;2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&quot;` <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Satoshi_Nakamoto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Satoshi_Nakamoto</a>')
