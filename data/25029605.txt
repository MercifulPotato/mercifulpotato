Take out the handful of &quot;Big Tech&quot; FANG types and JPMorgan and what is left? Is this not then exactly a list of consulting firms importing cheap international labor and then farming them out at their true worth?<p>1   Cognizant Technology Solutions  28,526<p>2   Infosys 21,473<p>3   Tata Consultancy Services   11,868<p>4   Google  10,577<p>5   Ernst &amp; Young   8,893<p>6   Capgemini   8,411<p>7   Deloitte &amp; Touche   8,258<p>8   Amazon.Com Services 7,705<p>9   IBM 7,237<p>10  Microsoft   6,041<p>11  Accenture   5,654<p>12  Hcl America 4,688<p>13  Wipro   4,291   $77,533<p>14  Tech Mahindra (Americas)<p>15  Larsen &amp; Toubro Infotech    3,625<p>16  Facebook    3,212<p>17  Wal-Mart Associates 2,277<p>18  L&amp;T Technology Services 2,117<p>19  Syntel  1,893<p>20  Jpmorgan Chase  1,796<p>21  Salesforce.Com  1,722<p>22  Amazon Web Services 1,711<p>23  Apple   1,708<p>24  Intel   1,683<p>25  Compunnel Software Group    1,667<p>Tata explicitly advertises their services are &quot;Onshore-Offshore&quot;.<p>When a FANG like google hires an H1-B employee, their average salary is $143,373. When Tata or Cognizant hires an H1-B employee, their average salary is $86,453. If we take the number of H-1B visas sponsored per year at Tata and Cognizant and compare their average salaries to their FANG counterparts it suggests a short changing of $2 billion per year.')
