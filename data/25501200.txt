A prominent American news outlet&#x27;s AMP pages have Google ads obscuring the text of the article. In the last week AMP added an additional click before you can get the actual URL of the article to be able to read the text. The additional click takes the form of a fake sharing menu in the browser. It&#x27;s sort of understandable that they would want to add this given that Android&#x27;s built-in sharing menu takes multiple seconds to load on Google&#x27;s flagship phones, but the fake menu lacks &quot;copy to clipboard&quot; so it cannot be used to go to the actual article.')
