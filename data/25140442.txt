But that does not mean that all design choices are equally good when goodness is measured by pleasing the greatest quantity of users by the greatest amount.<p>Ice cream flavor preference is subjective too, but if your ice cream shop only sells &quot;sawdust sprinkles&quot; and &quot;frog&#x27;s blood&quot;, business isn&#x27;t going to go well for you. Or, perhaps closer to home, the choice of keywords in a programming language is entirely subjective. The compiler does not care if you use &quot;while&quot; or &quot;rkdhx&quot; for loops, but good luck convincing programmers to adopt a language that chooses the latter.<p>Designers have laboriously learned the aesthetic principles that align with how our visual system works and with the expectations users have coming from our shared culture&#x27;s graphic history. That&#x27;s what they mean when they say something is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, and they have a lot of expertise to back it up.')
