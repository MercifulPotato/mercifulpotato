But people buy the devices knowing that that&#x27;s not an option. It&#x27;s not like Apple locked down these devices and changed them after people bought them. You can absolutely jailbreak your device and put whatever you want on it and I fully support that. That doesn&#x27;t make Apple&#x27;s behavior monopolistic or an anti-trust violation.<p>Your Keurig example isn&#x27;t relatable or similar at all since Keurig both <i>did</i> have a monopoly on single-use coffee pods and that was the single purpose of the device. An optional App Store is not the same thing at all.')
