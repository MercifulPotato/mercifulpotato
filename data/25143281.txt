I even sold some games I made on cassette tapes.  My parents were really distressed that I was wasting my time.  But-- surprise-- I had&#x2F; have a long and successful career making video games.<p>Now I am a parent and I tend to let my kids play a lot of game on their computer.  But it is different.   In the old days computers weren&#x27;t really that entertaining except if you programmed them.  Now they have a lot of passive entertainment value.  It&#x27;s a lot more like watching television or talking on the phone then the engaging hobby I had as a child.  I tell them it is important to create media as well as consume media.')
