There is a virus, and it is causing mass panic. It dislodges your ability to index on your physical experience of self and replaces it with an externally reflected one transmitted through language and filtered through an ego that has been isolated and fed like a foie gras duck or a veal calf. Whether you want to call it evil, a virus, society, or poor upbringing, doesn&#x27;t matter. If it&#x27;s words, it&#x27;s a filtered reflection, and very likely a simulation for the virus to propagate its primitives and make a place for itself in your mind.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this view could be any crazier than the ones causing people to wreck their own relationships and societies. If you can, help others step back.')
