These dedicated sites are literally 100% concentrated insight into these communities<p>Authorities in particular, I&#x27;m supposed to believe the folks at Homeland Security can&#x27;t go to Parler and do some open-source intelligence and we need to let the trolls on Facebook instead? It&#x27;s not like we accidentally pushed the perps into the scary darknet and need the IT guys from CSI, they were literally announcing this stunt proudly to the world, I just don&#x27;t follow the argument at all.<p>In fact if the riot hadn&#x27;t been successful I&#x27;d have said Parler is a honeypot because people registering with their ID posting openly that they&#x27;re starting an insurrection is just too absurd.')
