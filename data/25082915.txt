In a society where people would not have any existential fears, employed or not, Uber would not get away with what they&#x27;re doing anyway. But I think the argument is orthogonal to what I meant.<p>In context of the system that Uber drivers are living in right now, Prop22 is a step in the wrong direction: it gives affirmation to companies that actively deprives gig workers of the rights we talk about above.<p>Of course it&#x27;d be better to solve this problem at a higher level, but I&#x27;m happy to argue against proponents of steps in the wrong direction (e.g. Prop22).')
