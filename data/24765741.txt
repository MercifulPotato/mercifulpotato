Emotionally I feel the fact that (big) cooperations can own seed varieties (nearly like with patents) to be quite literally something that makes me boil.<p>In general I do not like the fact, that it is easy for others to claim something that replicates itself as &quot;their own&quot;&#x2F;&quot;their property&quot;.<p>On the other hand I saw a small tomato grower who developed and breed their own tomato varieties being ripped of by a bigger player, because they just couldn&#x27;t afford to register a variety they painstakingly developed over years. The bigger player came, bought their seeds, grew the plants and two years later registered this variety as their own under a very, very similar name forgoing the necessity to develop the variety themselves. At least they did not push the other. smaller player out of the market - but they could have probably.<p>I would love a system that enables some kind of (short- to mid-term) protection for the development effort of new varieties. But I also feel it is a right of the people to grow from their own seedlings. Something that even hybrid varieties do not offer.<p>It is a difficult topic without quick and easy answers I fear.<p>But for me - we buy heirloom seeds mostly locally&#x2F;regionally, grow them, keep our own seeds every year and regrow from that. We also share with other hobbyists.')
