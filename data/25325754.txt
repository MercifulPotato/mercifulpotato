Technology suffers from a plague of bloat, and it&#x27;s getting worse as high level languages pile on the dependencies and abstractions, all the while justifying the waste with &quot;quality is overrated&quot;.<p>I find it hard to believe that you can ship a high quality product without caring about the quality of the components going into it, or that this won&#x27;t cost you down the line. It only takes a few &quot;good enoughs&quot; in terms of probability theory to end up with a multitude of poor product tail results.<p>It&#x27;s also not enough to get the job done, you need to maintain what you ship. You don&#x27;t need to choose the absolute best tool, but choosing quality tools pays dividends over time.')
