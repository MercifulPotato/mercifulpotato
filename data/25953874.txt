A concerted effort to whisper to many people in an effort to manipulate the market would be fairly easy for the SEC to uncover in an investigation.<p>A single false statement or two, said to a reporter as a confidential source, would be much more difficult to prosecute. The reporter might not willingly give up their source, and the company could deny everything, fire the person who &quot;inaccurately represented our position&quot;, and claim the party acted of their own volition. Modest fine, at best.')
