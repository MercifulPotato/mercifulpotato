It&#x27;s particularly useful since large organizations want to minimize their risk of, for example, a Docker Hub outage preventing an emergency hotfix. In Artifactory you can setup &#x27;remote repositories&#x27; which are then overlayed on top of your own repository within Artifactory. Docker provides the `registry-mirrors` setting which then will automatically redirect all pulls to Artifactory rather than Docker hub. There&#x27;s no need to change your manifests and&#x2F;or FROM stanzas.')
