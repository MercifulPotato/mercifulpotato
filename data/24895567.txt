For example war crimes.<p>To be honest, because of the devastating long term effects of environmental pollution, and the deaths it has caused, I would quite happily argue that laws applying to it could be ex post facto. Crimes against future generations.<p>I remember covering this in my philosophy degree and you can argue about it for hours.
