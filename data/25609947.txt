Either they did this to martyr themselves in their community (&quot;they are arresting me for what I did, aren&#x27;t they evil?&quot;) or they thought they&#x27;d be seen as a hero (&quot;I saved 500 people from harm, worship me!&quot;).<p>There&#x27;s something about the medical and it&#x27;s peripheral communities that attract what I call &quot;Jesus&quot; egos; people who think they alone have the power to save humanity, <i>if only humanity could just see the light</i>. Sure, they&#x27;ll do the work, like be a pharmacist, but behind the scenes, they&#x27;re cursing everyone for not believing what they believe, even when all the facts are against them. Frustration builds and then the ego acts out and does something stupid like this.')
