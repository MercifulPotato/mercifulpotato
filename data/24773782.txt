I use my phone far less nowadays because many of its functions are served by other hardware at home, so the most important function left exclusively to the phone was the Wallet&#x2F;Apple Pay. I would have preferred a better camera, but Iâ€™m not out taking nearly as many pictures as I used to, so the camera is fine. Post-pandemic I can always swap out my phone for a newer one, or rather I look forward to it.')
