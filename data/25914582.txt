And once you&#x27;ve been vulnerable like that, it never goes away.  There will ALWAYS be a part of you that remembers it and it will affect you for the rest of your life.<p>That alone is enough vulnerability.  The fact that the LGBT community still deals with a lot of verbal and physical assaults as well just makes things worse.  And yes, this is still an issue in the UK, in Norway, the US, and other western countries.')
