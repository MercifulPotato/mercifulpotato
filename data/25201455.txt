Some negatives too of course, but a big boon for me in learning Rust was realizing i didn&#x27;t always have to reach for the biggest tool. Sometimes a simple Clone or [A]rc was perfectly okay, especially when comparing it to Go - my benchmark.<p>Rust became as developer efficient for me as Go was, and then more so when i leveraged the huge surplus of code locality tools like Iterators and various functional patterns (.map, etc).<p>Plus, now i get to play with new toys like WASM without a GC or game engines! I miss almost nothing from Go and gained so much power when i want to reach for things. Most of which, like Iterators, are power with little to no cost.<p>I&#x27;ve been a Rust fanatic for a couple years now, and C&#x2F;C++ were not even in my toolbox. I think Rust can hit a lot of sweet spots for a very very wide range of people, eg non-C&#x2F;C++ domains. Which isn&#x27;t an argument for its usage, but an explanation for its popularity.')
