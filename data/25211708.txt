I&#x27;m sick and tired of the victim mentality and hyperboles. Every time something inconvenient happens, people scream and shout at the top of their lungs like the world has wronged them.<p>NO, YOU DID NOT GET SCAMMED BY AMAZON BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SERVICE OUTAGE.<p>Simple as that. People need to calm down and stop acting like the world owes them something. Unforeseen events happen. Take a breath, no one scammed you. If you have an SLA and contract, follow the steps and process to get reimbursed. Anything more is just worthless bickering and victim mentality complaining.')
