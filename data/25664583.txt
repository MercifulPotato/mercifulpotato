Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25664815], score=None, time=1609977364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664409, text='&gt; Teachers are overworked and underpaid, they can&#x27;t afford to go far beyond what curriculum says they should. Parents demand schools prepare kids well for their adult life - which for almost all families means primarily preparing for a decent job. Thus the labor market is indirectly but strongly influencing the curriculum. Labor market demands a way to sort people, so standardized testing and pressure to choose your career at even earlier ages appears. On the other side, governments are embedded in the market reality, they need to manage their budgets and seek savings, so their prioritize, tightening the school system to provide what the market demands.<p>If there&#x27;s no slack in the system then how do you propose to expand the scope of function provided by a system running at its limitations?<p>&gt; I could go on and draw some other feedback loops. But the point is that you can&#x27;t disentangle schooling - or anything government - from the economic reality, and that this economic reality is sufficient in explaining the shape of education system. No conspiracy, or ill will by any rich and powerful agents needed.<p>I agree with this, which is why I questioned you. A free market in education would do a lot to empower educators to offer real, functioning education because they&#x27;d be able to charge what they needed and compensate their teachers appropriately.')
