If you base your research around this, youre missing the point of how the criminal justice system <i>by its very design</i> predates on poor people and minorities.<p>Court dates cant be rescheduled.  you cant show up 2-3 minutes late like you do to an office job or youll walk into the courtroom and go directly to jail.  You cant call in sick to a court date, and in many cases your bail or release is contingent upon attendance.  Youre pretty likely to miss a court date if youre poor, have one or more kids, or 3 jobs because missing the jobs means you cant feed the kids, and not taking care of the kids means the state takes the kids.  Public transportation is also an excellent way to miss your court date, because it never runs on time.  its a state-provided service causing your state-mandated court attendance to fail.<p>You can send me all the texts you want, but if my kids sick or i have to fill in a 16 hour shift at bloaty&#x27;s pizza hog because my 19 year old coworker decided to road trip to Coachella this week and mandatory overtime is legal in the US, im still going to miss my court date.<p>texting someone their court dates is also predicated on the idea that the person has &#x27;minutes on their phone&#x27; because poor people (surprise) dont whip out an iPhone 12 when they sign up for these alerts.')
