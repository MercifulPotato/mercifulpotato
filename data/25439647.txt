This persuasion can be purchased by the highest bidder to subtly influence public opinion in a way that is counter to it&#x27;s own interest. Ultimately, this can weaken the marketplace of ideas, rational discourse, and consensus.<p>My idea is an app, forum, or social group which pairs individuals to discuss issues in a manner that builds consensus. \nUsers would identify their position on issues as well as how strongly they hold that position. They would then be offered the opportunity to discuss and issue which they care deeply about with someone who is indifferent.<p>This could yield a high persuasion return for time invested, and help build consensus. This could have an effect similar to door to door campaigning, but with the ability to target politically active individuals who a with high impact topics. One thing that I find particularly attractive, is that it would focus the discussion on individual issues, opposed to platforms or parties.<p>What do you think?')
