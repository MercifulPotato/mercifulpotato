We just refer to that service generically as an “oil change”. And we get that service based on mileage rather than annually.<p>Also, all Europeans go back to the dealership for periodic maintenance? There are no independent shops that do this? Nobody does it themselves? So if you have a BMW you have to take it to the BMW dealer in particular? Sounds like lock-in to me.')
