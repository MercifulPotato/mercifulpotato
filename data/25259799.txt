Preventing repair (as Apple does) generates more e-waste. There really is no way around that fact.<p>&gt;What matters environmentally is aggregate device lifetime, so you get the most use out of the materials. Apple devices use a minimum of materials and have industry leading usable lifetimes. They are also designed to be highly recyclable.<p>Reuse and repair is FAR superior to recycle - which actually wastes a lot of energy, in addition to generating e-waste for the parts which are not recycled.<p>&gt;Greenpeace rated Apple the number 1 most environmentally friendly of the big technology companies.<p>What good does it do? They are still harming the environment.')
