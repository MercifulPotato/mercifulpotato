Which showed me, above all, that the people who write dictionaries aren&#x27;t qualified to write about terms from physics.<p>I also see that effort it takes to get started on a thing as similar to &quot;excitation energy&quot; in chemistry -- that discrete amount of energy, below which, the system will not change, and above which, bam! it all happens!<p>By understanding the &quot;next action&quot; you&#x27;re lowering the &quot;excitation energy&quot; requirement. But that&#x27;s not a great metaphor to use with the general public. This is why James Clear writes the books, and I just writes the comments.')
