And it seemed everybody had the utmost respect for the history of the scene. Demosceners were all about &quot;old school&quot; stuff and the old Amiga days. Hacking ezines and forums retold the tales of Captain Crunch and other legendary hackers from yore. And the open source community was still full of completely antiquated practices that some would have question but nobody would have dared to disrespect.<p>Only when I started programming as a job did I encounter people who, strangely, had no interest for such things. There was plenty of enthusiasm for new languages, but little for their genealogy. It really seemed odd to me and I think the lack of love for the &quot;craft&quot; and its history is ultimately what drove me out of industry and to academia.')
