I’m not blind but it always seemed weird to me to try and retrofit visual abstractions to someone who may not be as comfortable with those abstractions then to build an experience directly to that user.  Mobile sites often have different experiences than desktop sites, and we would say that’s an experience customized for a small screen, not separate but equal.  Wouldn’t designing a separate experience from the ground up built for someone with visual impairment be better than fitting them into a system that’s probably wasn’t set out for them in the first place?  You’re hampering the experience because you’ll always be biasing for the sighted, unless your ux lead is visually impaired.')
