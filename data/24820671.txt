It’s not like the environment cares! It’s just there.<p>Again, we already have solutions.<p>What happened to tech people’s DRY and KISS, don’t be clever, mantras?<p>Legislative capture is the engineering problem. Forcing Machiavellian machinery on society seems to be the only answer our dimwitted hierarchy can ever come up with.<p>It’s Jesus! Obviously it’s capital trade! Obviously it’s statistical!<p>Never, obviously it’s just people and I’m merely one of them.<p>How much longer is the aristocracy (including this scene since it’s wealthier than most and leverages that to export its expectations on others) expecting billions facing environmental collapse to nod and smile for a bunch of “godheaded” normies?<p>You all are LARPing nonsense in a very subtle way. Contorted language and made up objects conjured by clearly senile, puerile, selfish, ignorant leaders.<p>Controlling governments directly is the only real solution to any problem you bring up due to the never ending issue of legislative capture.<p>For a forum of supposedly bright, clever minds, repetitively iterating on the edge of what societies leaders “allow” seems self defeating and lazy.<p>If the result of all this work for a mercantile scoreboard exacerbates a real problem, technical engineering is a non-solution.<p>You all are risking your future by putting the next generation in a even more precarious position.<p>Ageism &amp; guilt by association to our contemporary economic agency is going to bite the grown ups of today in their twilight years.<p>Look how indifferent we are about cohorts that statistically fall off our radar.<p>What the hell are they going to care about a bunch of gerontocrats who make up a smaller percent of the population than the 20-30yos and their young?<p>Obviously the environmental concerns for them are not there in you, tacitly supporting this.<p>And I am doing my part to make this happen by explaining this to kids, my own and others; when we’re old, shovel us into the bay. We’ll have earned for being the first form of society to leave behind such a mess.')
