You cannot normally legally publish hacked or stolen photos of celebrities. The personal, intimate, or family photos of Hunter Biden almost certainly do not meet the bar for public interest.<p>Twitter is not liable here. But as a private company they&#x27;re allowed to have a policy against linking to hacked or stolen material on their platform. It&#x27;s the NY Post that&#x27;s in a grey area.<p>&gt; Of course your original comment said nothing about the accuracy of the reporting and instead only made the claim that there was a legal gray area around publishing hacked materials like these, which is simply not true.<p>My original comment was in response to someone saying Twitter blocked it because it was Russian propaganda, which is simply not true.')
