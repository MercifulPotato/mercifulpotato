My experience with Haskell went like this.<p>1. Interested in Haskell. Learn the language, read papers, enjoy the PL concepts and interesting academic work.<p>2. Does it scale? Implement small program in in C++ and Haskell. Optimize as best I can. Talk to people who work on ghc who happen to be in my lab. Further optimize. Everybody agrees, no further clear way to optimize the Haskell program.<p>C++ implementation remains several orders of magnitude faster.<p>If it were a time and space trade off, laziness would lead to good performance. But it doesn’t. It tends to produce stupendously bad cache behavior.<p>Haskell is a lovely platform for understanding some recent PL theory. It is possible to write the sort of obviously correct programs that make it so desirable.<p>It isn’t resource efficient. Worse, laziness means that performance tends to be chaotic. Small seemingly unrelated changes can change the execution order and change your profile a lot. Similar challenges exist in logical programming.')
