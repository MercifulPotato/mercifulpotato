In the virtual world, I&#x27;m open to 7 billion potential attackers. In the physical world, I&#x27;m open to a few. That leads to very different security practices.<p>If I leave my front door unlocked for a week, the security risk is minimal where I live. Casual security is good enough. If I leave my computer with even a pretty obscure vulnerability connected to the internet for 5 minutes, odds are pretty good it will be compromised.<p>Clipboards+lanyard+high viz vest is imperfect security (and I chose the example deliberately to illustrate that), but it is good enough security to practically prevent physical compromises in most instances. I won&#x27;t run a military base that way, or a HIPAA-compliant data system, but it&#x27;s good enough for 95% of uses, including, for example, a university physics department&#x27;s research data system.<p>Even a military base doesn&#x27;t have perfect security; a well-resourced attacker can compromise it. In contrast, in the virtual world, I want cryptographic protocols where I can prove perfect security, at least given a relatively small set of assumptions.')
