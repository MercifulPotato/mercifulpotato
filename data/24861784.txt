The file format uses GUIDs internally for most changes and most conflicts are easily merged&#x2F;fixed. The fact that it is synchronized as files gives a lot of flexibility in options. You can use whatever cloud file sync provider you trust that month, and you have the flexibility to switch providers as your trust model and&#x2F;or threat model change.<p>Mobile OSes are finally making it easier for arbitrary &quot;file&quot; sharing between such apps. (The iOS Files app is finally &quot;decent&quot; for this compared to just a few years ago.)<p>A similar file sync option to Syncthing I like to point out is Resilio Sync, a P2P device-to-device &quot;torrent-like&quot; sync tool. Among other things it also supports &quot;encrypted shares&quot; that cannot read inside the share but can still participate as a &quot;seed&quot; in the torrent-like share. Resilio Sync is relatively a lot more closed&#x2F;commercial than Syncthing, but it&#x27;s torrent-based underpinnings make it sometimes much faster with large shares. (As with everything, trade-offs to be made based on your personal threat model.)')
