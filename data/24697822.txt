A shorter time means a faster person, no exceptions.<p>There is no such academic test, so there&#x27;s always a gap between &#x27;test prep&#x27; and &#x27;learning&#x27;. The best prepared student may not be the best student.<p>To me at least, there&#x27;s nothing depressing about working hard for some goal. There is something depressing about learning something ultimately meaningless (the contents of a test) so you can make the test itself meaningless.')
