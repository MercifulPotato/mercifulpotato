Even barring classification mistakes, cross-species breeding across genus is not impossible, it&#x27;s just very less likely to produce viable and&#x2F;or fertile offspring.<p>A classic example is the breeding between Equus Caballus (horse) and Equus Asinus (donkey): it works and you get a Mule.<p>The genetic difference between the horse and the donkey is non trivial, they even have a different number of chromosomes (64 vs 62). Since the offspring gets half of their chromosomes from the father and half from the mother, the mule gets an odd number of chromosomes (63) which clogs the gamete production machine and renders the animal sterile.
