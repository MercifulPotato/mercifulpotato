Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=[25927405], score=None, time=1611748912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926166, text='When I was in primary school, handicapped was going out of fashion in favour of disabled (wikipedia tells me we were 10-15 years later than the US on that one, culture wasn&#x27;t so instantly global then). A large part of this was that handicapped had been repurposed as an insult so there was a need for disabled (as happened for the previous terminology for mental disability, also). Of course even &quot;disabled [person&#x2F;people]&quot; is heading into the &quot;maybe don&#x27;t use that&quot; territory these days<p>It&#x27;s clear why this happens, having difficulties is viewed as undesirable, most people would choose not to have them if they could (I&#x27;m aware some people with disabilities have felt it made them who they are and wouldn&#x27;t change it, but they aren&#x27;t the people to start using terms in a pejorative manner). As long as there are real negative attitudes against black people and real negative effects on black people, this is likely to be the same for terms used there also.<p>I feel the only reason person centered language like &quot;people of color&quot; and &quot;person with disabilities&quot; has lasted so long as the acceptable phrasing is simply because the more wordy phrases are harder to turn into a playground insult&#x2F;drunk jeering&#x2F;etc.')
