Slack is used by workers for personal social interactions as well. For many workers Slack is as much a social media tool as it is a work tool. Many workers actually <i>prefer</i> to have slack open during off work hours to share memes with their work buddies.<p>Even for workers that donâ€™t engage in social activities over slack normally might install it to their personal devices during a conference because that is where their colleagues are conversing, and then simply forget to uninstall it after the conference is done.<p>A workplace has to be aware that this is how normal people use this tool, and needs to make sure that no one misuses this access to workers during off hours.')
