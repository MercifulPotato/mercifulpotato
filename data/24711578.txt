Item(by='foldr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602097988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710616, text='&gt;For all visa applicants, including H1B, there is a presumption that the person is an immigrant, and they cannot obtain non-immigrant visas until they convince the admission officer of their non-immigrant intent, see section 214(b) of INA. Crucially, you need to argue that you have no intention to abandon your foreign residence. Dual intent have nothing to do with it, this is true for all kinds of visas.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is right. Section 214(b) indeed says that there is a presumption of immigrant intent, but for dual intent visas, such as the H1-B, it&#x27;s not necessary to demonstrate that you don&#x27;t have immigrant intent.<p>It also seems wrong that applying for a green card could ever not constitute evidence of immigrant intent. Do you have a citation for that?')
