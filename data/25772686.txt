What are they getting from this? I think you need a credible explanation of the payoff to justify such an enormous investment of manpower and time.<p>From another view, if you have the standard where way you claim that the ROI of remote viewing programs was so low there was no point to them (when in fact there&#x27;s declassified documentation of them being a reliable intelligence source commensurate with other sources, as well as it easily observable reality of various subreddits dedicated to people practicing this and getting results) then it seems doubly true that you know the return on investment of such a massive disinfo program, where there is no documentation of payoff and there&#x27;s no obvious payoff, is unimaginably low.<p>it&#x27;s basically a sort of insane elaboration that doesn&#x27;t pass the Occam&#x27;s razor test the simplest explanation is that these are simply reports of real things that happened. so definitely there will be disinformation because that makes sense from a narrative management point of view but I think it&#x27;s becoming crazier and crazier to deny the simple and obvious explanation that all of this documentation describes something real.<p>However....One thing I do wonder about though, and I think is a bit odd is why is all of this so-called UFO and disclosure information promoted by mostly white American men. Where are the women where are the black people (besides Billy Carson) where are the Asian people where are the Chinese coming out with their disclosure information...that seems weird to me but I think if you wanted a credible program you would probably you know enlist people from other countries just like you know regular you know counterintelligence disinformation campaigns do. So it&#x27;s weird to me that it&#x27;s so heterogeneous. if there is a secret space program where are all the female whistleblowers coming forward.')
