It&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve, either you lock it up and get no exposure or you get robbed.<p>His work will still be there years from now, the poorly proofread copies likely will be too.<p>I made that original comment in the last thread, it was only speculation but it&#x27;s an easy, low cost strategy to deal with this.<p>Let it get popular on HN with no proofreading, it gets copied, then fix it in a week or two and keep the version more likely to stand the test of time.')
