Sadly it doesn&#x27;t stay in the ground without a pipeline.<p>However, Canada should get smart here and do what Norway does with their oil profits. Invest it in a sovereign wealth fund that&#x27;s diversified away from oil. Because the oil age is ending and it will hit the most expensive producers, like the oil sands the hardest.<p>That seven billion spent on converting to renewable energy might have made more sense.')
