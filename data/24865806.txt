Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[24865845], score=None, time=1603423911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864264, text='I haven&#x27;t done it, and the e1000 driver is pretty big, so it&#x27;s hard to scan quickly, but the general shape is you&#x27;d need to support the kernel functions the driver calls, and setup compatible kernel structures for the driver. At least the parts of the driver you call.<p>Things like kernel malloc to setup pages and what not, mapping the device address, allocating interrupts, DMA (maybe), PCI, logging, maybe locking, basic c library stuff (memcpy etc). Some of those, you can probably just stub out, but some if it you have to do (badly or not). Some of that you probably need or want to build anyway.<p>It&#x27;s a fair bit of work, but if you want to support a lot of hardware, it&#x27;s probably less work than porting a bunch of drivers.')
