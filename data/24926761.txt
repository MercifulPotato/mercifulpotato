You can even do it on the job with some afterwork study.<p>To me the problem is the emphasis some companies place on knowing specific tech.<p>&gt;Must have five years experience in Web development with a focus on front end frameworks eg react&#x2F;angular and cloud experience (aws preferred)<p>VS<p>&gt;must have two years experience with the following; asp net 5.0, aspnet mvc 5.0, automapper, xunit, tiny ioc and azure Webapps<p>However, typical the good companies have the former. So you can spot it out pretty easy. Although I fear the industry is moving more to specific skill sets and certification. The certificates trend is being pushed harder as it makes a lot of money for these companies.')
