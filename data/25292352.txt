Not of just the American market, but the... global ~~supplier~~ market.<p>I&#x27;m not a drug expert, but I seem to recall island nations of S. East Asia being a large exporter of cocaine, too. It was on one of those drug Vice series.<p>Specifically coming from the &#x27;golden triangle.&#x27; I&#x27;m not savvy enough to know if it was all just synthetic versions of it or simply product from Columbia that is re-packaged&#x2F;cut for the Asian Market.<p>Personally speaking, I dislike all amphetamines but some people are equally as addicted to caffeine as they are to cocaine, I&#x27;ve worked in 2 Industries where both are consumed in large quantities on a daily basis. Which is why I personally want nothing to do with them, but if consenting adults are willing to take on the responsibility and we get one step closer to ending all of the cronyist BS that comes from the drug war than I hope it happens.<p>Especially if it gives subsistence farmers in Columbia a cash crop they can increase their standard of living from and sell in open market trades rather than in some clandestine cartel operation.')
