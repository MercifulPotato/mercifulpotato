Better than Pfizer, though we need more data to be sure.<p>+ no significant side-effects.<p>+ no special deep freezing. -20C is good for 6 month storage, -2 to -9 for 30 days comparing to Pfizer -70C all the time.<p>Not so good:<p>- two doses needed, 4 weeks apart, immunity after one and a half month from first dose. Slow rollout. Pfizer results were after one month.<p>Still long-term immunity is a question for every vaccine. Luckily, if two vaccines works then likely other attempts will be successful.')
