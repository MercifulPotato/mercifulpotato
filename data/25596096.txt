Item(by='guenthert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609442468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595363, text='&gt; My identity isn&#x27;t wrapped up in programming.<p>Fair enough and quite common I suppose.  Generally for some a job is just that, for other (perhaps just some lucky few) it&#x27;s a calling.  I&#x27;d think the share of the former was large among programmers (&quot;coders&quot;) in the early days of computing, when that wasn&#x27;t a highly regarded job (seen alike data entry).  Then a few years after the micro computer revolution, many of those who grew up and where fascinated by home computers entered the work force.  Those you essentially just needed to feed and perhaps point in a direction.  Then the Internet bubble happened and many realized that there was hard cash to be earned.  There we have the career IT guy (who&#x27;s just as happy to do something else which pays at least as much).  It&#x27;s not that they perform worse (in situation where discipline and organization is paramount they can be expected to outperform geeks), but the work style is quite different.<p>&gt; We need to get rid of this wild west mentality where disorganization is lauded.<p>I don&#x27;t think people celebrate their lack of discipline, but rigidity stymies creativity (and don&#x27;t ask me how long it&#x27;ll take me to fix a bug).  I don&#x27;t think Silicon Valley happened accidentally in California rather than in Prussia.')
