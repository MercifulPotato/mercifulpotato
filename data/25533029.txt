That in 2020 we don&#x27;t have an electronic document format which has modern animation support:<p>- WTF happened to .mhtml&#x2F;.eml ?!?<p>- .odt : the least bad I guess, but is still a bit heavy, clunky, and uses discrete pages without reflow by default. Also, the underlying language isn&#x27;t designed to be tinkered with, which is a critical shortcoming in many situations.<p>- .pdf : inconsistent .mp4 reader support, discrete pages with fixed layout.<p>- .epub : no .mp4 support<p>I guess the patents associated  with .mp4 might be to blame? I  can&#x27;t wait for AV1 then! (And bring mhtml back!!)')
