I said:<p>&gt;  ... and that&#x27;s ignoring that we were worried about running out of hospital capacity.<p>Anyways--<p>&gt; 10% less hospital stay, means 10% more patients able to get help.<p>This isn&#x27;t true.  It&#x27;s only true at steady state, but if there&#x27;s an exponential process you get a smaller benefit.  (E.g. take the ridiculous case that 100% of patients show up on one day-- obviously a shorter stay doesn&#x27;t improve the number you treat in that case).')
