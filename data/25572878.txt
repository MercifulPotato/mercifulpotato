They also point out that access to healthcare is required for a diagnosis that would place someone in the high-risk group. This is something you&#x27;d want to consider if you are in any way interested in evaluating institutional racism.<p>I think it is entirely fair to consider whether a policy institutionalizes that a person at high risk because of age is more important to save than person at high risk because of undiagnosed condition. .... or whether the groups that society expects to go to work in person should be protected over groups who have already been given social benefits that are intended to enable them to avoid going to work.<p>This is, as the powerpoint outlines, a purely <i>ethical</i>, and non-scientific evaluation of the situation.  The scientific arguments are in their respective sections.<p>&gt; But its recommendation is that &quot;Ethics&quot; outweighs &quot;Science&quot; (their terms, not mine)<p>I don&#x27;t see this anywhere in the document.')
