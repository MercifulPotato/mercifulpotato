If a certain customer&#x27;s behaviour is alienating or obstructing other customers, then that customer gets cancelled, because they are having a negative impact (on the business - not the users!) that is larger than the benefit they provide.<p>That&#x27;s a net positive result.<p>Ignoring your whole concept of &quot;mean&quot;, it is 100% up to the company to decide what the negative behaviour is, which is part of the problem.<p>Sure some of it might be &quot;mean behaviour&quot; and so we look at it as Google doing a good thing perhaps.<p>But what if you went around Google&#x27;s services and informed people of better alternatives to their services, and you started to actual gain traction and cause people to stop using Google?<p>There&#x27;s nothing mean about that, in fact you&#x27;re providing a good service to those people.  But in Google&#x27;s eyes your actions are negative, and they could just cancel your account at their discretion because they don&#x27;t like what you&#x27;re saying.<p>That is the kind of thing that regulation protects from, when dealing with essential services - and I think there&#x27;s a stronger and stronger case to be made that these large providers are in fact essential services.<p>p.s. Devil&#x27;s advocate: the theoretical actions I described above (recommending alternatives) could so easily cross the line into spam.  But who decides where that line is, if Google was to be regulated?')
