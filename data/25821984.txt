I don&#x27;t think that the world should necessarily &quot;burn&quot;, I just think that real change has to come from the changes in societies. People demanding change.<p>The last decades have created such dramatic changes that people have yet to realize and truly comprehend the magnitude of what&#x27;s going on and how it affects their lives. My hope is that in the coming decades all the issues (free speech, privacy, etc) that the information age touches upon will be a core part of political discussion.<p>The existence of law doesn&#x27;t necessarily solve the problem. Otherwise, the US wouldn&#x27;t have a systemic problem of racism and discrimination, they certainly have laws against discrimination, and yet their police (and not just the police) do what they do.')
