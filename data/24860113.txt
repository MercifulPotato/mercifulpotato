The time dimension is oft forgotten aspect of accessibility.<p>You may be able to get somewhere, but if it takes several connections and a transit time of over 1 hr, you&#x27;re not likely to do it frequently.<p>There are invisible barriers to connectivity that are time-related (or more broadly, friction-related).<p>As a younger person my time was worth less so I thought nothing of trading off time. But I&#x27;m older now, and I realize in order to get more done, I need to get to more places quicker.<p>(Anecdotally I hear people forgoing dates because they don&#x27;t think they can sustain a relationship with someone who lives one borough too far away. Almost no one owns a car in NYC, so the MTA is generally the only option, and getting from Queens to Columbia University say can take an hour.)')
