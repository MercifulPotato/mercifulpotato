We cannot say &quot;X is strongly typed&quot;, we can only say &quot;X is more&#x2F;less&#x2F;very&#x2F;not very strongly typed&quot;.</i><p>I agree with your overall argument, but in this conclusion I subtly disagree: it implies that we could come up with some linear quantitative scale from 0 to 1 of how strongly typed something is. I don&#x27;t think we can, it&#x27;s a composite of qualitative features that defies that approach.<p>It might even be a somewhat rock-paper-scissors like kind of thing where also we cannot really value each feature because their positive or negative value greatly depends on the presence or absence of other features.')
