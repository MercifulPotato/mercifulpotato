Item(by='CraigJPerry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607679013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383526, text='You should have picked better examples like the censorship of the photos of inside the detention centre used to keep the now-orphaned kids that the US split from their parents at the Mexico border and now can’t find the parents.<p>Or the US involvement in civilian deaths in Yemen.<p>Your examples both got proper smack downs. My examples are still censored - you or i have never seen pictures of the conditions the kids are stored in (and if you think you have, double check its authenticity). Would be reporters for the Yemen are suppressed well before there’s any risk of them deciding to just skip mainstream media and post online instead. End result is an information vacuum and we can’t have an informed discussion because neither you nor i knows what’s actually happening.')
