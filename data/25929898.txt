Notably, Twitter&#x27;s secret sauce is addiction, thus it&#x27;s inherently difficult for many people to choose the healthier option (at least in a long-term capacity). Moreover, as a platform, Twitter can provide <i>an audience</i> a lot more readily than SubStack. I&#x27;m concerned that there&#x27;s enough of SubStack&#x27;s model that Twitter can copy without compromising their addiction-peddling business model that they will be able to out-compete SubStack, to the world&#x27;s detriment.')
