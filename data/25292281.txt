We did this partly for environmental reasons, but mostly for &quot;meat packaging gets really stinky in your garbage can after a few days in a small apartment&quot; reasons.  After awhile, we decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the headache to us.<p>In NYC (and California too I think?), they&#x27;re starting to encourage bringing your own bag instead of buying them at the register, so I might retry this experiment again.')
