Otherwise, you can keep it forever, sell it, lend it to others, sell it overseas (subject to any import&#x2F;export laws, of course).<p>This is not the same with a CD for a video-game, for example. I still remember that my copy of Starcraft had a note that I should notify Blizzard if I indended to lend the CD to any of my friends!')
