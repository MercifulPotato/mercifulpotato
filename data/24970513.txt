Right now there are many fast fill gas pumps in my little city. If everyone is charging at home there is less demand and so those pumps go away - even for the rare long distance trip where the slow recharge isn&#x27;t an option.<p>95% of the time you are correct, it would be just fine to charge in my garage and who cares if it takes 12 hours as the car isn&#x27;t moving anyway.  However a couple times a year I - like most people - take a longer trip and depends on the infrastructure that allows me to refill my car in a few minutes and get on my way.')
