For example, the left made quite a kerfuffle about &quot;Trump&quot; separating families at the border, but the truth is the separation policy was preexisting and what changed was only how many detentions there were when he started to detain everyone crossing the border illegally. They also like to play word games, like saying &quot;no existing policy of separating all families crossing the border illegally&quot; which is intentionally misleading when what changed wasn&#x27;t the separation of those in detention but rather the detention of everyone crossing the border illegally.<p>Which isn&#x27;t even to say that family separation was a good policy, but the persistent implication that it was a policy established under Trump is ridiculous and politically-motivated.')
