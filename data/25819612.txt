Doing some fasting will teach the difference. One is a feeling of withdraw, not unlike from an addiction, we know there is food available and that it is pleasurable and our mind tells us to go and grab it. The second one is more physiological, a very different sensation and comes from the core&#x2F;stomach. You feel like a black hole in your core.<p>When you eat at very specific hours you&#x27;ll get an urge to eat around that same hour even if you took a big meal a few hours before. That&#x27;s the addiction speaking.<p>What you are mentioning is the first one, cravings, these can be biased&#x2F;manufactured by society and ads. I suspect that if we only really ate when we are physiologically hungry there wouldn&#x27;t be any overweight issue.')
