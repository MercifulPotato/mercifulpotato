But for frequent cycling, lead acid is more expensive. Lead acid also requires occasional maintenance to keep the acid levels topped up.<p>But if you want to rig you leave own setup with lithium ion, scaling up and down with smallish individual battery units over time, those are available for sale. The list prices I&#x27;ve seen are pretty high, about $700&#x2F;kWh, however.  An integrated unit can be cheaper. And as lithium ion battery prices plummet over the next two years, and factories scale, the home storage market will hopefully start to get access to $300&#x2F;kWh products or cheaper.')
