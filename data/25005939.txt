There should be a more laws preventing this from happening for large corporations.<p>We now see that Google Search is turning more and more to AI. Perhaps if Google didn&#x27;t buy DeepMind, but some other smaller competitor did, they could&#x27;ve turned that into an advantage against Google.<p>Either way, it was a loss for the market for DeepMind to be bought by Google instead of forcing Google to come-up with its internal competitor.<p>Companies with billions in profit should be &quot;incentivized&quot; to use that money to create their own competitors against threats - not buy them all out (often just to kill them). I think we can all argue that large companies buying out small competitors is a net negative for the economy at large.')
