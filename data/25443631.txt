I ended up building a 2D interpolator for GAN generated outputs. Since the control was 2D, I figured it would be fun to add a fluid simulator that tracks your mouse. And now it&#x27;s become a fun interactive toy all on its own.<p>The way it works is by taking a 3x3 grid of GAN outputs, applying a gaussian kernel for blending that maximizes total variance, interpolating the frames and then finally producing a video file. As you move your mouse, it seeks to various points within the video.<p>I have started with cats here because all great things on the internet lead back to cats, of course. But this can work with any GAN that can be interpolated. In this case, it is Stylegan2.<p>There are some easter eggs in here as well - see if you can find them :)<p>Feedback is definitely appreciated. Thank you for taking a look.')
