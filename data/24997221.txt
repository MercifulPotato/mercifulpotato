That&#x27;s not how containers work at all, and that&#x27;s not how Docker promotes the service, and that&#x27;s not how anyone uses it. Nothing in your comments is even remotely compatible with basic notions of CICD.<p>Apparently you&#x27;re so out of touch with containerization and CICD and devops workflow that you&#x27;re even entirely ignorant of basic concepts like what a latest tag is supposed to represent and how tags are used to update apps.<p>The fact that you try to pass off that absurd assertion in such absolute terms makes it quite clear that you have absolutely no idea about what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Hell, your claim can only possibly be made by someone who never even registered a user account in Docker Hub. Please refrain from speaking about stuff you know nothing about.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re using it for basically passing your own images between CI workers or whatever other workload that requires you to constantly be pushing and pulling<p>This mindless statement just makes it clear as water that you have no idea of how containers are used.  At all.  And yet here you are degrading the signal&#x2F;noise ratio by blabbering about stuff you know nothing about.')
