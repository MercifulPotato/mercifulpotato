If that&#x27;s what you want - e.g. big integer or fixed point arithmetic - there are other types you should be using. So the takeaway is not that JS has a &quot;glitch&quot; or is messing up - but a misunderstanding of the guarantees of numerical methods.<p>Also, the suggested solution to compare actual vs. expected value by having their absolute distance be less than some epsilon is half correct, but what you really should be looking at is the relative error, i.e. the absolute error divided by the magnitude of the number.')
