Same effect can be seen by just replacing random pixels with their grayscale equivalent.<p>Something like:<p><pre><code>    width, height, _ = bw_img.shape\n    pixels = int(width * height * .5)\n    xs = np.random.choice(width, pixels)\n    ys = np.random.choice(height, pixels)\n    bw_img[xs,ys,:] = img[xs, ys, :]</code></pre>')
