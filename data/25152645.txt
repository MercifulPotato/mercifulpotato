This would actually allow small investments from mom and pop (a good thing with other safety rules), and prevent the moderately wealthy from losing everything (a la Lloyds “names”). Most people are 100% exposed to their job and perhaps their home, and I think it would be good if they would also invest small amounts long-term in businesses directly (rather than indirectly via bank savings).<p>&gt; Employees of investment funds can be accredited for purpose of investing in their employers fund<p>This is a bad precedent. The biggest danger with investment is lack of diversity. Investing in your employer severely increases your risks (albeit increases rewards if you win). A great gamble when you win (startup unicorn) but a terrible gamble when you lose (company bankruptcy =&gt; lose job and lose retirement fund. Game over: play again?)')
