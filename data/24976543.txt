Also, technologies such as HDCP, Trusted Execution Environment prevent the decrypted and decoded frames from being leaked. At least, that&#x27;s the intention.<p>And the CDM vendors are Google, MSFT, and Apple. There&#x27;s no way they are going to leak their code :)<p>What&#x27;s really strong is the rotation of decryption keys.

Nothing is impossible :)')
