It&#x27;s also limited in what airports it can operated out of.  I&#x27;m sure there is some route out there where it will end up as an ideal freighter when they start retiring from passenger service, but it is not very flexible.  Definitely not where you&#x27;d want to start building out your cargo fleet.')
