Avalonia focuses on using its controls, not native ones (although support for native controls is WIP I think)<p>This line remembers a constant pitch i see here on HN, where people ask for native controls to be rendered for multi-platform UI sdk&#x27;s that i think go on the &quot;faster horse&quot;(Ford) sort of misdirection.<p>The problem with the &#x27;faster horse&#x27; paradox is that the only way to make people forget about wanting a faster horse is by showing them the car.<p>I think a platform like Flutter get this right, as do HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS, because theres no way to get really consistent if you have to use the platform native controls. It will also be messy for the developers, requiring a lot of effort and money to make things partially right.<p>I bet with you that most of these people asking for this use a Mac, and while Apple is more or less half of the market of US, in the rest of the world Apple have much smaller deploy base.<p>So sometimes, you need to be careful because even HN can suffer from a bubble social effect, that will misguide people that actually listen what they are asking for.<p>In the long term there&#x27;s already a multi-platform UI paradigm there is set to win, and its called HTML..<p>Native UI platforms had a sort of comeback because of the iphone revolution, but in the long term, they will not be the winners, because Apple is doing the same mistakes they did in the eighties.')
