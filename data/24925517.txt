If you are using Python for anything other than a server or CLI, Golang is not a very good replacement for Python.<p>Some of Python&#x27;s strengths that I work with regularly are dynamism, easy data exploration, visualizations, succinct &amp; customizable syntax, extremely strong data science libraries, REPL&#x2F;Jupyter, C bindings, easy to use packaging solution via PyPi (bet some people are going to disagree with that one), quick to prototype code. If you really need performance in Python, you can probably get it out of the box (if you can run deep learning with Python, performance isn&#x27;t a limitation).<p>I love Go and use it for a bunch of projects, but I&#x27;ve only once wanted to move a project from Python to Go and that was a performance-centric CLI that was only written in Python originally because of how quickly it let us prototype in comparison to Go.')
