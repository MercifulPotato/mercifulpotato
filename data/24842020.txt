This is typical for C++ as well- trying to interop with mangled C++ names requires a lot of coordination across the toolchains and so even the examples you cite don&#x27;t work without a lot of pain.<p>If you do wind up exporting the same name twice, you just get a linker error, because Rust doesn&#x27;t play the same games C++ does with linkage. (This is also true of C++ FFI- the problematic ODR-violation stuff tends to involve more complex language features than `extern &quot;C&quot;`.)')
