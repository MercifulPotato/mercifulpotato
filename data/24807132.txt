Item(by='dmitryminkovsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602903671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803566, text='&gt; There is no one true yourself, just many different versions and possibilities<p>At the anecdotal, personal experience level, I noticed that many of the people I met in college who were depressed or otherwise somehow stuck were stuck “looking for themselves” to the point that I decided the cliche that we should all find ourselves should be considered harmful. There was just so many of these people out there.<p>Around that same time I came to believe, as a countervailing measure if anything, that to the extent possible, in the absence of other direction or desire,  people should do what they are good at. Being good at something and doing it feels good and will in time become what you like and “who you are.” You’ll be good at it, and everything will be great. If you’re not good at anything, the challenge, then, is to find something you’re good at. But drifting from thing to thing trying to find yourself is way harder and less reliable, and I think this is because as this article says, there is no yourself to find.')
