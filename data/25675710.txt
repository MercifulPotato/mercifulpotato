They reimburse all ATM fees, checks are free, and it’s trivial to move money between it and your brokerage, investment, and retirement accounts. They don’t support Zelle, so if you need that P2P instant payment functionally, you’re better off with Ally (I keep a high yield savings account at Discover Bank as a Zelle slush account).')
