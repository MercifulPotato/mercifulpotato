Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25053871], score=None, time=1605052984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053780, text='&gt; And it&#x27;s baffling to me how people who tend to be &quot;against capitalism&quot; somehow rally to the free market when it comes to selling sex.<p>People that are against capitalism on the left tend not to be against volintary exchange of labor for money but the power relations between capitalist and laborer in capitalist industry. That&#x27;s not an issue with individual sales of labor on the marketplace direct to end consumers of a service, which seems to be the issue here. The fact that the kind of service involved is sexual is beside the point.')
