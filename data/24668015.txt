They are no frills and cheap.  Plug in a $30 roku and hook it up to some decent speakers and you are good to go.  I’ve had two of them going on 8 years strong now.  Loads of connectivity to.  From vga to dvi to component&#x2F;composite, 1&#x2F;8” audio in&#x2F;out, spdif, hdmi, etc, etc.<p>On the other hand the power supply in my (former) LG plasma tv died after 1.5 years.  I DIY replaced that with a ~$100 part.  Then 6 months later it broke down with large green vertical lines interrupting the screen, at which point I gave up on it.<p>So for me it will be no frills cheap TVs from now on.  If it breaks in a few years I can replace it without feeling as much of a hit to the wallet. And the external streaming boxes will always be better, faster and more flexible for me than the inbuilt “smart” software that stops getting updates after a few years.')
