Item(by='kemitchell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610566997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758496, text='Reading your post reminded me of a common social conundrum among lawyers who negotiate deals.<p>Sometimes I will run into a businessperson, on our side or the other side, who loves to send follow-up messages, or even makes calls, demanding progress reports or turnaround times. Almost never do these messages have even the slightest effect on how quickly I get to a job, or finish it. I have a to-do list, a calendar, and a list of priorities. Their content-free follow-ups affect none of them, unless it includes genuinely new and relevant information. Very, very, very rarely does an ongoing deal slip my mind.<p>It may be that I was right in the middle of finishing a turn of an agreement when they interrupted me. I had no way to know their message wasn&#x27;t reporting some important new development in the negotiation. Having stopped to check, I&#x27;ve broken focus, and will probably take longer to finish what I was doing.<p>But from their point of view, they&#x27;re reinforced every time they send a low-effort follow-up message and see progress a relatively short time later, whether the two were causally related or not. Even if the message actually <i>delayed</i> delivery. This leads to yet more follow-up messages, both later in the current deal and in other deals.  It leads to disappointed expectations when mashing the lawyer&#x27;s button doesn&#x27;t make them scribble faster.<p>Anecdotally, I see this most from people with strong sales backgrounds. Either way, I almost always find it worthwhile to cut it off preemptively, by making it very clear that I&#x27;m an organized professional, and not a rower in their galley. I have threatened to fire a client for putting me in their CRM for automated follow-ups. Things got much better, for both of us, from there.')
