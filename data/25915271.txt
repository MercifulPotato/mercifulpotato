It&#x27;s basically neutral, or in a few countries cheaper.<p>Custom fees are the big problem, which is basically profiteering from Royal Mail and co. I really doubt it costs Â£8-12 to clear a small package through UK customs (especially long term when the systems are bedded in more). For example, Amazon doesn&#x27;t charge customs duties on goods from the EU coming into the UK, so my guess is it is actually very low cost. My hope is that over time there will be some competitiveness on customs fees.')
