Is it mostly JS on the client or Java on the server? When I ran my own Confluence server on a Digital Ocean VM, it was slow but not unbearable. I assumed it was Tomcat&#x27;s fault* or the fact that I wasn&#x27;t using a &quot;real&quot; database on the backend (a configuration Atlassian frowns upon).<p>*Confluence is built on Tomcat. Don&#x27;t know if this is also true for Jira.<p>Now that my Confluence server is on Atlassian&#x27;s cloud, it seems much slower still. So I have to assume it&#x27;s not client-side JS because that hasn&#x27;t changed much; there&#x27;s some kind of resource starvation going on with Atlassian&#x27;s servers.')
