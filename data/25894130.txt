There are many fundamental changes.<p>The fact that people seem to complain exclusively after Python 2&#x27; end of life a year ago feels a little telling. Perl&#x27;s community roffle stomped their previous vision for Perl 6. Python community wasn&#x27;t vocal about this being a bad change. Rather the opposite, very loud support.<p>Keep in mind, I dislike Python either way, but I&#x27;m not one of the devs that complains about continuing education requirements, or language adding things over each 10 year period. I can work in Python just fine, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it feels nice &amp; hygienic to use for me personally.')
