I don&#x27;t work in video production but I know several people who do, and I&#x27;ve watched some documentaries on this -- in that case, the proportion of Apple machines seems to be even higher than the already quite high proportion found in audio. Never seen a professional or semi-pro using a Linux box. I&#x27;m sure they exist, but this doesn&#x27;t track at all with what I know about this industry.<p>Sometimes a DJ or bedroom producer is using Windows. So it&#x27;s quite surprising to hear you say that Linux is the standard.<p>Can you point me to any producers, artists, sound engineers, studios, or production houses that use Linux? I would love to know...<p>I have never seen anyone using CALF tools in this profession. Looking at what that does - the functionality is available in a number of rock-solid applications native to Apple (MainStage, Ableton, Logic, etc). So there&#x27;s no reason why it would need to be ported to MacOS.<p>How are you measuring audio stack superiority? And in terms of &quot;stack&quot;, are you talking about something separate from the suite of professional audio &#x2F; MIDI tools that come standard on every Apple computer that don&#x27;t seem to have any comparison on Linux or Windows?<p>Are you taking into account the availability of hardware drivers on these different platforms? What is your experience in setting up a Linux-based audio production system with a lot of outboard gear? This is one area that seems to be a major source of headaches and motivation to not use Linux for producers and engineers.<p>Even looking through the comments on this page - there&#x27;s people talking about the difficulty of setting up a functional audio production environment in Linux compared to Apple. I&#x27;ve noticed this sentiment is repeated over and over again on HN (going back to previous articles on audio production, Ableton, etc).<p>This topic stands out to me as I&#x27;ve sincerely wanted Linux to be much less of a headache with audio so I can get off the Apple ecosystem entirely.')
