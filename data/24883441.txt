For example:<p>1. GitLab lets you have pages generated from private repo(free) and have fine-grained control over who can view them.<p>2. The CNAME file is a mess. Every time you generate your site with Hugo etc., you need to copy-paste it and GitLab has a much nice interface to manage domains and subdomains with a lot more control and options.<p>3. You can have a single repo for your actual site and pages are published from the CI pipeline and let you use any method to generate HTML. On GitHub, you need to maintain two repos if you are using static site generators. It&#x27;s just not clean.')
