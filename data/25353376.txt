Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[25353440], score=None, time=1607471829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25353175, text='I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite right. I will absolutely defend that the Second Amendment was crafted so the citizens retain the power to take up arms against the state, but that is a very different thing from &quot;extrajudicial reprisal.&quot;<p>The Second Amendment absolutely protects the ability of citizens to declare their government invalid, set up their own, and defend themselves. It does so because citizens <i>already have</i> that right - as argued in the Declaration of Independence (&quot;<i>it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government</i>&quot;), and later codified in things like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The task of the Second Amendment is not to codify that right; it is to codify a right to a <i>mechanism</i> by which the citizens may protect the right to self-determination of government, which is more fundamental but only theoretical if an unwanted government comes at you with guns.<p>There is no right to extrajudicial reprisals against individual members of the government. The Second Amendment does not recognize one, nor does anything else in the Constitution, nor does any other well-accepted document about rights. There is a right to invoke the structures of the government to redress grievances and to hold judges and other officials responsible for abuse of their office, and there is a right to oppose the government wholesale if they refuse. But that is still a <i>defensive</i> right. If a corrupt judge wants to take your land, and corrupt police try to make it happen, you need a means to defend yourself, sure.<p>But I cannot find any reason to believe that the authors of the Constitution would have said that an appropriate check on government power is the risk that members of the government would have their family members killed in reprisal - the risk that people would be deprived of life (or even liberty or property) without due process of law.')
