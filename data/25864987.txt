Legally, I don&#x27;t think it does. I don&#x27;t see any good reason why AWS shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to selectively enforce their ToS.<p>Well, first off, it&#x27;s not necessarily the case that AWS&#x27;s contract with Twitter is the same as AWS&#x27;s contract with Parler.<p>But more importantly, whether or not a company chooses to enforce violations of contracts with third parties has no bearing on whether it can enforce violation of contract against you. The best you can argue is I think equitable estoppel: by not enforcing it on others, maybe they gave you a reasonable impression that your conduct wasn&#x27;t violating. But AWS has a clause that says effectively &quot;we don&#x27;t waive any rights by not enforcing terms against you&quot;, and furthermore, AWS and Parler were already in communication about Parler&#x27;s issues complying with the terms, which destroys any equitable estoppel claim.')
