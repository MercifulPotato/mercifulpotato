Most schools teach mandarin over cantonese. Also most people who speak cantonese speak English or another common language. And the learning resources out there for it aren&#x27;t very good compared to mandarin. Most of my nephews and nieces don&#x27;t speak it either. With every new generation I see less and less native speakers. It&#x27;s kind of a shame')
