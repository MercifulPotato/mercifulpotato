US also has much better opportunities for entrepreneurship and other things in my opinion. Simply due to scale of English speaking crowd and of course people there are more likely to buy things.<p>But it would require coming out of my comfort zone so much. I have a girlfriend here, family, friends and much more.<p>I have calculated that I could &quot;FIRE&quot; in US so much faster compared to where I live. Especially if I did some years of work in USA and then &quot;FIRE&quot;d at some low cost of living country.<p>But I think I&#x27;m not going to do it for now. Luckily the company pays well in my country too, just not as well. But I do have a lot of regrets that I&#x27;m not using my potential to the fullest.<p>Why do you think US has so many big tech firms compared to Europe and other places? And why is there so much war between tech companies specifically in US?')
