My 14 year old has started solving medium level leetcode problems (which I am happy about).<p>Talk to them often about code, technology etc.One thing that helped IMHO spending a lot of time in solving math problems (AOPS) , which made think through hard problems and had to grind through solutions which took time. My kids love Big Bang Theory and anything that is geeky. I talk to them about the latest things that are happening in tech like the recent hack and the malware.<p>I recently read this book <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00F25LEVC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebo...</a> and sat and drew with my kids and,or , xor and nand gates.Building Mindcraft MOD can be another fun project.<p>Be patient and it helps a lot IMO.<p>Good luck :)')
