The radar showed the &quot;UFOs&quot; coming from the area of San Clemente Island.<p>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a coincidence though, because there&#x27;s nothing on that island except for one of the Navy&#x27;s UAV airstrips. They even warn that the UAVs are very small and hard for other pilots to see, so they have a safety perimeter around the island.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scisland.org&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;usageGoogle&#x2F;safety_zone_info.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scisland.org&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;usageGoogle&#x2F;safety_zone_in...</a>')
