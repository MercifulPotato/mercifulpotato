If I attempt to visualize a cube from the corner, I can maybe say I can see the corner and three edges leading from it (to be honest, it&#x27;s hard to say that I truly see it, but maybe a vague outline of three lines). I don&#x27;t see the remainder of the cube.<p>If I try to imagine a cube, and then mark the edges into thirds, I cannot imagine what remains when I cut off corners back to the mark. And the cube itself is more of an idea of a cube rather than visual representation.<p>I cannot mentally rotate the shape as I do not see a shape.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hard to believe, but trust me, it&#x27;s hard for me to believe people can visualize in the way people describe.')
