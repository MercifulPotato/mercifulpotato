Japan hoped the USA would be like Russia in 1905, in that once it became clear that regaining a lost fleet would take years Russia lost the will to continue the war.  The US was ready structurally and politically for a long war of attrition.<p>At the time the Japanese did not know that the USSR would overcome Germany.  An invasion of Midway, with US CVs sunk to boot, would give Japan at least another year of offensive operations.  They could have used that time to threaten Australia, incite insurrection in India, secure ocean supply lines and train pilots.  The US and the UK would have the means to resist and the US would certainly still have the means to overcome Japan eventually.  But with all those challenges ahead-- in Europe and the Pacific-- maybe the US would negotiate.')
