If that article contains libel, NBC is the one on the hook in court, not Twitter. (However, if Twitter discovered the article was very likely libelous then it would be both reasonable and responsible to restrict sharing the article).<p>GP is really making one of two authoritarian arguments:<p>a) Platforms are not allowed to make broad decisions about what sorts of content they want to host. Presumably GP would then also agree that YouTube&#x27;s ban on pornography means that YouTube is a &quot;publisher,&quot; and that every time Reddit remove a racist subreddit that it is acting like a &quot;publisher.&quot;<p>b) If a platform does not want to host the president&#x27;s dishonest re-election propaganda, they should expect to face financial and legal consequences.<p>Of course nobody would really say &quot;b&quot; out loud, hence the word games about &quot;you see, Mastadon is a <i>platform</i> but Twitter is a <i>publisher.</i>&quot;')
