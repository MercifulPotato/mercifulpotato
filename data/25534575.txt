I think the problem is no one has figured out a way to make them &quot;work&quot;.<p>Or not even that they don&#x27;t function but you need a way to demonstrate that such things are &quot;really good&quot;, that they solve real problems that neither &quot;business logic system&quot; (the real existing remnant of GOFAI) nor neural networks can solve. And the key both logic systems and neural networks have is how they pretty standardized. logic systems are like regular programming and neural networks have their train&#x2F;test&#x2F;verify cycle understood (and even with that, they&#x27;re probably overused&#x2F;misused at this point given the hype).')
