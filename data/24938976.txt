Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604030046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937713, text='&gt; my feed is nothing but wonderfully enriching videos all tailored to my hobbies and interests<p>The ad part I agree quite well with. However, I find that Youtube&#x27;s recommendation algorithm is quite lacking. I mean this is also the case with Netflix and other social media I have used so not just Youtube&#x27;s fault (only one that sticks out as better is TikTok).<p>For me, it tends to simply repeatedly recommend  <i></i>way<i></i> too similar videos. If I somehow happen to watch a video about aa tech review, my feed will be tech reviews and that&#x27;s it. Heaven forbid I make the mistake of clicking some random political video, and I am now in a hole where my feed is full of right-wing, anti-vaxxers, and conspiracy theorists and so on.<p>In general, it seems like Youtube&#x27;s algo gets quite quickly to the local minimum&#x2F;maximum but then struggles to look around or away from it. This leads to very a insular and locked-in-your-own-box experience.')
