I&#x27;m already $100k up on that and I predict I&#x27;ll make even more as the stock price drops.<p>I also shorted via short term puts a few days ago, when the price spiked a bit on the hopes of new GM deal. I&#x27;m betting that the stock price will drop tomorrow due to expiration of a lock up period which will unleash millions of new shares. I&#x27;m already up 100% on that and hoping for at least 500% (although if the stock goes up, I might loose 100%; will know by Friday).<p>What you call &quot;market has already priced in&quot; is people like me, who acted decisively and took the risk. The information was there, I (and people like me) didn&#x27;t have any secret info. But unlike those other people, we had the courage of conviction and risk tolerance to take on high risk &#x2F; high reward bet.')
