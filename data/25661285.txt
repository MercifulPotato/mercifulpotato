Come on now, you know what I meant.<p>Email is like getting mail in your postal box. It has no real protections except for people saying &quot;yeah, I won&#x27;t read your mail&quot;. Thus, if something is important enough, don&#x27;t use it for that.<p>If you really need to do something privately there are better equipped avenues; if you&#x27;re worried about tracking, it doesn&#x27;t matter because<p>- any service mailing you will try to track you<p>- if you email with anybody from Google&#x2F;MSFT&#x2F;etc, your email is on their servers anyway.<p>It&#x27;s a lost cause. It has been for some time. Keep a strong password on it and 2FA and such, but otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth the time to care about.')
