Item(by='Traster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607892645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407743, text='The article does a <i>terrible</i> job of considering the downsides. It includes comical phrases such as &quot;Bitcoin has never traded down over a 5 year period&quot;. Bitcoin is 12 years old. It also talks about what happens if BTC goes down, and says MSTR could service the debt- which misses the point that if BTC goes down MSTR&#x27;s <i>value</i> goes down. Sure, they won&#x27;t go bankrupt, they&#x27;ll still have a bad invesstment.<p>Let me spell out a clearer downside:<p>If Bitcoin goes to 0, you&#x27;re left holding a boring business analytics company that punted off its entire cash balance on a risky bet.<p>Or another downside: The SEC launches a <i>second</i> investigation into the CEO. After the last settlement the CEO of this company saw his net worth drop $6Bn which is double the market cap of MSTR.')
