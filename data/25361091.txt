I mean, either money becomes worthless to have or the stock market goes back up.<p>To me, it seems the upside of _not_ trading is much smaller than the upside of betting that the market will go back up eventually like it has every time so far.<p>I have a very tiny (10 shares) amount in cruise lines. The shares were $150 &#x2F; share pre-COVID, I bought them for $30 &#x2F; share. So my downside is $300 (minus tax benefits) but my upside is $1,200 (minus taxes). Nothing changed about those companies except having to weather the pandemic.<p>I even made $70 on call options in a week for the same company. Definitely not trying my luck again but it was an education.')
