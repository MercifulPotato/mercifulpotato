We have an accounts table with 20 secondary indexes defined for all the possible sort fields<p>What makes you think you&#x27;ve imagined a good CRM schema here?<p>One problem with this article is that it doesn&#x27;t have any code. You&#x27;d think it would, right? You&#x27;re selling this thing to developers and architects. Why aren&#x27;t we linking to a supplementary repo with the examples used for this application for both DynamoDB and Fauna?<p>One possibility is that the example DynamoDB design is a very bad one (I mean, you&#x27;re actually using all 20 GSIs; what?), and that anyone familiar with DynamoDB would say &quot;Actually, you can cover all the query patterns with 3 GSIs if you do it this way.&quot;<p>Why do this? One possibility is that the ways that Fauna actually is better than DynamoDB are too subtle to get anyone&#x27;s attention. They&#x27;re real and useful, but not ridiculous. The people who actually use DynamoDB at massive scale might understand them, but also probably won&#x27;t want to change up.<p>So you go after people who aren&#x27;t using DynamoDB at massive scale. Say, early-stage startup founders who want to be on DynamoDB from day 1 because someday their product will be Web Scale. But don&#x27;t have a lot of time to carefully evaluate claims like this. They just say &quot;10x cost reduction? Wow, Fauna is the new best DB!&quot; Most of these guys fail, but a few of them are a runaway success (and would have been equally so if they&#x27;d used DynamoDB), are now stuck with Fauna whether they like it or not (but let&#x27;s assume they like it as least as well as DynamoDB, maybe even slightly more), and are now listed as large scale users of Fauna on their website. You too could be a unicorn startup! Start using Fauna today!<p>Basically, I think the makers of Fauna are trying to con you with this article. It&#x27;s not that their product is bad, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re trying to get you to buy it for reasons other than that it&#x27;s good.')
