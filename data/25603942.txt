But at a macro level, Obamacare has a rule that insurers can have a maximum profit margin of 20%. So you have two ways to increase profits in the long run:<p>1) Increase number of subscribers. Possible to do, but the market is pretty saturated.<p>2) Raise prices of healthcare overall. 20% of larger costs is more than 20% of smaller costs.<p>Intuitively, lowering costs would seem to be a money-making proposition, but if you are already at the 20% margin, it doesn&#x27;t actually help you.')
