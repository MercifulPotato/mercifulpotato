There is a pandemic going on and my former social life outside is frozen, there were positive and inspiring encounters through dating apps and I even met a few friends there over the years. I am glad that more opportunities to meet new people online are slowly emerging (or more people discover them) such as zoom&#x2F;gathertown meetups, discord groups etc, even as they can&#x27;t replace dancing.')
