It doesn&#x27;t offer a solution but it neatly highlights the problem. A lot of attention is being paid to things like keyboards, mice, software used to write code and I never understood that fetish. These are just tools, tools aren&#x27;t the job.<p>Pretty much every dev I know has a history with or knows of a manager who optimized metrics that were easy to optimize (bugs closed, LOC written, code coverage numbers) instead of looking at some elusive &quot;big picture&quot;. We recognize these typically aren&#x27;t good performance metrics. The same people would agonize over the type of keyboard switches and vim configurations and boast that they can write more code faster.')
