You can simply test the reliability of the quantum circuit by running it multiple times and checking that the outcomes behave as you expect. For example, if your circuit is supposed to generate the entagled pair [00 or 11 with equal probability] you would expect measurements to either be 00 or 11 and never 01 or 10.')
