However removing one lightening rod will not make the lightening disappear it will just find another path.<p>I do not have a solution to those cultural problems either, and that is even more worrisome than Twitter censoring people, which honestly I wish they would have done in 2016 as twitter would be a less relevant platform today which is why they did not in 2016 they need Trump just as much as Trump needed them<p>i do know that censorship (private or public) is not the path to unity,  it as never worked in history so there is no reason to believe it will work in the current year..<p>EDIT:\n------------------\nSince I have now been throttled for having incorrect opions allow me to respond to the below comment here<p>&gt;&gt; @krapp says &quot;That&#x27;s why the First Amendment only applies to Congress&quot;<p>That is a very simplistic take, and I never once said anything about the 1st Amendment.<p>Free Speech is a natural right of human&#x27;s which is protected from government infringement by the 1st amendment, but the 1st amendment does not grant or bestow this right upon us,  we have simply by being alive<p>This is also called the Lockean understanding of Rights.<p>You have also conflated Free Speech and the Right os Association, another natural right everyone has. The right of association is what gives twitter the ethical foundation to ban or refuse to publish the words of anyone they choose<p>Which I 100% support,  however the fly in the ointment is the fact that congress has given special legal liability protections to Twitter where by they will not be held liable if they choose to associate with the public at large as a platform.  IMO granting these liabilities shields to twitter, twitter should also have to accept they will welcome all legal protected speech.  They would also be free to choose to reject that liability shield and retain their right of association.')
