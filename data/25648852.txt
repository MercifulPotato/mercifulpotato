It&#x27;s an infuriating listen.<p>But not only is it a very real substantive issue, it&#x27;s a characteristic issue of the academic&#x2F;expert institutional class. An obsession with the theoretical that ignores pragmatic reality. These are the experts that suggest a plan that <i>requires</i> 100% compliance and works against every human instinct. That&#x27;s intelligent?<p>It&#x27;s a group of people divorced from the experience of average people. E.g. all these advisors forcing everyone into isolation but breaking the rules for themselves and their own family (look at Birx, Newsom, etc., the list is horrendously long).')
