It&#x27;s all well and good to paint the situation as one of petrol vs electric, but if the issue is actually private vs public, and the later is generally more efficient, then applying a road-tax on both petrol and electric vehicles makes perfect sense.<p>And it&#x27;s not like the remainder living out in rural victoria (where there is no PT infrastructure) are going to be picking up EVs en-mass, so it probably doesn&#x27;t effect them in any fundamental way.<p>edit: oh wait,  you mean to imply that EV vehicles don&#x27;t have the CO2 impact of ICE vehicles,  and thus there&#x27;s not an incentive to switch to public transport? I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s still wrong (in that our mass transport is still more efficient overall).  But there&#x27;s also other pollution issues aside from CO2, and the general efficiency in terms of distance travelled and efficient use of space and traffic issues that come from preferential PT use.')
