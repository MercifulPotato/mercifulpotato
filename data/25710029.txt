According to this logic I should invest $.01 in BTC and then to borrow from a funny commenter in this thread, $.01 in Dodgecoin, $.01 in Ether, $.01 in baseball cards, $.01 in wine, $.01 in beanie babies, etc etc etc etc etc - that basically any investment that exists deserves my dollars.<p>I disagree. There&#x27;s plenty of stuff one &quot;could&quot; invest in and very few one &quot;should.&quot;<p>I look at it on expected value basis and then, risk adjusted. Because I have a short case on BTC, I expect any investment in it to have expected value of 0 so any $ allocated to it would be wasted. Instead I spread my money in investments I expect to have positive value, and I invest in many of them for diversification benefits (which may be is what you were getting at?)<p>But the point of diversification is to secure uncorrelated positive returns. A negative return on the other hand is just a negative return. I totally agree with you that I could be wrong in my short case on BTC, my logic rests on it.<p>And just in defense of my case - I think about markets as someone who&#x27;s studied and worked in them for 18+ years. Doesn&#x27;t mean I am right and I have an open mind. So whenever I encounter someone who has the opposite view, I explain to them my case with the hopes that they can point me to what I am missing, but I always walk away with the impression they hadn&#x27;t thought about the issue deeply and with nuance. Again, I could totally be wrong, but as an investor if it seems like I did my homework and the others are driven by hype&#x2F;FOMO&#x2F;not understanding then I am gonna sit it out :)')
