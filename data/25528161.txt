I did learn of lot of piano theory and I can easily read sheet music and learn&#x2F;play simple songs (left hand chords + right hand melody) in a few minutes.<p>&gt; Does the app correct your position (important if you don&#x27;t want to get fatigue and cramps), your volume, fingerings, etc?<p>Yes, the app does constantly reminding you to have the correct position, shows fingering but does indeed not test for volume. It&#x27;s obviously not as good as having a teacher constantly watching you.<p>I have also recently started some lessons with a piano teacher for more in-depth music theory and checking my current progress, she didn&#x27;t have too much stuff to correct, so the app wasn&#x27;t that bad and the stuff that I learnt was actually correct and usable. One thing that the teacher was a lot better at than the app was explaining how more complex musical concepts are linked together and how focusing more on the basics is more important that learning specific things&#x2F;progressions.<p>&gt; connect it to an el cheapo midi keyboard<p>I use the Yamaha NP 12 (it costs around $200), it sounds amazing but it does have only 61 keys and it&#x27;s semi-weighted. I still think it&#x27;s good enough for learning how to play.<p>One thing that you might be missing is the fact that most of the people wanting to learn the piano don&#x27;t plan on becoming a professional, they just want to be able to learn and play a few songs or improvise a bit. In order to do this usually &quot;good enough&quot; is good enough, you don&#x27;t need the best equipment or the perfect technique. It&#x27;s also important, as you mentioned, to know what to expect and what you are missing out on by using the learning methods you do.')
