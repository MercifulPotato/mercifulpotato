Someone can critique a person without condemning them. One can say that PG&#x27;s opinions shouldn&#x27;t be taken seriously without saying that he&#x27;s a &#x27;wrongthinker.&#x27;<p>The internet gives a mouthpiece to many, many people; not everyone&#x27;s opinion should be considered with equal weight. The essay&#x27;s author uses the example, &quot;EARTH HAS 4 CORNER SIMULTANEOUS 4-DAY TIME CUBE.&quot; It is content that someone put a lot of time and effort into. How should I use the ideas and world view found in the timecube website to forge my own?<p>Probably not much. That&#x27;s what I equivalate with &quot;taking seriously,&quot; and a &quot;serious public intellectual&quot; is someone whose opinions I would probably consider when forming my own.<p>I don&#x27;t think the author is tearing PG down to try and oust him from his material wealth; just saying, maybe what he writes in his essays shouldn&#x27;t be taken as seriously as some of us thought.')
