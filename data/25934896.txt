For typing an Umlaut I type instead Opt(Alt) + &#x27;u&#x27; to get an   ¨-sign, then I type a&#x2F;o&#x2F;u to get the letter. The same with ß - just Opt + &#x27;s&#x27;.<p>It is maybe a bit annyoing if I have to type in german a lot on some days, but it is less annoying then to keep an extra layout. And since I sometimes have to type in french and often in russian... well, you get the idea, it would be a mess of 4 keyboard layouts. With special characters I can push the amount of keyboard layouts just to colemak and russian.')
