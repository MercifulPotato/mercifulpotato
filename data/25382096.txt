Attempting to tap on the round circle and pulling it to slide does not work.<p>I tried again on Firefox and if I very carefully tap on the line, I can set the slider. But touching the circle and sliding does not work. So, Firefox is more sensitive than Chrome when it comes to determining whether I am touching the line or not.<p>I presume this is due to how Windows interprets touch events and passes them on to the browser, making the sliders hard to work with in my case.')
