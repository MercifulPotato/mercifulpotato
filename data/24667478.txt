Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=[24670195], score=None, time=1601676198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24666995, text='I&#x27;m not an anarcho-capitalist if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re asking. Anarcho-capitalism is a great idealization but remains unsuitable for the real world.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to discuss the State without referencing Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, etc. Over the past century min-anarchism (of which I at least consider anarcho-capitalism to be a variant of) in general has not offered anything convincing to solve the issues they raised. I&#x27;m not optimistic it will do so in the next century either. I&#x27;m open to having my mind changed though.<p>How does one assure security with a minimal &quot;night watchman&quot; State? Note that security does not just mean physical security, but also an intangible feeling of safety in the sense that one can go outside without fear of anything untoward happening to them. And I&#x27;m well familiar with Ben Franklin&#x27;s aphorism. Nevertheless it is a real issue and one that the U.S. Constitution solved reasonably well.<p>Edit: Also I find it hard to take seriously anybody that references &quot;neoliberal policies&quot; as that article does. What does that even mean? Free markets? Property rights? Movement of capital? All those things are ingredients to prosperity, in my view. Often &quot;neoliberal&quot; ends up just being those parts of capitalism that one doesn&#x27;t like. And of course everyone has their own subset. Mass confusion, non-stop arguments over I&#x27;m not sure what exactly ensue.')
