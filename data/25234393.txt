It’s provides such wonderful moral clarity and said clarity is surprisingly effective at rooting out the sort of poisonous people who ruin friendships, companies and societies. I’ve dealt with numerous McKinsey consultants over a 30 year career. I’ve collected enough data points to feel safe in concluding the following:<p>• McKinsey is a vile organization without any redemption.<p>• That they are not condemned as such speak volumes about both our societies’ moral failings and more broadly, our individual failure to care about the people McKinsey helped murder.<p>• That last point bears repeating: McKinsey will happily and knowingly murder people for money. That only seems like a preposterous or exaggerated statement because we are not accustomed to hearing someone be impolite to evil people in a position to pay us well.<p>• People who work for McKinsey are sociopaths. Not occasionally. Not sometimes. In all cases. The only exception being people recruited directly from college who quit that firm within a few years of joining.<p>• Many here are in a position to punish McKinsey alumni. If you are asked to interview someone with McKinsey on their resume, I believe you should absolutely state that they performed terribly regardless of what occurred. I personally find it rewarding to repoer that their interview behavior during the interview seemed erratic, to the extent that I questioned their sobriety. If your sense of humor is as dark as mine I highly suggest this approach. If you have hire &#x2F; fire authority, it’s much simpler. Don’t hire, do fire.<p>• Organizations like McKinsey exist because we collectively accept their behavior. When we stop doing that, McKinsey will stop addicting broken, damaged and hurting people to opiates.<p>Stopping McKinsey is up to us. I make an argument from the left. But I think there are also compelling objections to these parasites that can be made from a position far to the right.<p>This doesn’t and shouldn’t be a left&#x2F;right thing. Because it is absolutely a parasites vs producers thing. And everyone, regardless of politics, will be healthier freed of this particular tapeworm.')
