A federal judge agreed with the government.<p>The involvement of state secrets is what is preventing discovery of whether or you were targeted by the government, not whether or not they are allowed to kill you. This seems very different from the government\n provably killing someone, and then claiming &quot;state secrets&quot; as a defense for being allowed to do it.<p>True, it may not be provable that you were targeted if &quot;state secrets&quot; prevents evidence from coming to light, but this is orthogonal to whether or not killing you is legally allowed, which is what the headline is suggesting.')
