They only sold what&#x27;s on the DVDs. They didn&#x27;t sell the other stuff, so people don&#x27;t have a right to that stuff.<p>Now, that is not to say that the products couldn&#x27;t be different in the future. It might turn out that movies which include a footage &quot;parts kit&quot; do better in the market place, so much more so that it becomes the normal way of doing business and is what is the ordinary and expected product at the ordinary price. But there&#x27;s no reason to expect we have any particular rights to stuff other people did, or that they can&#x27;t carefully parcel out the rights at prices that they set.')
