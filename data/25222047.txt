Item(by='zackmorris', descendants=None, kids=[25222685], score=None, time=1606412534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221331, text='Thanks for that! The only error I see in their implementation is that we can&#x27;t use variables for the name like:<p><pre><code>  $name = &#x27;foo&#x27;;\n  myFunction($name: &#x27;bar&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nThankfully, we can still pass an array with the spread operator like:<p><pre><code>  $name = &#x27;foo&#x27;;\n  $array = [$name =&gt; &#x27;bar&#x27;];\n  myFunction(...$array);\n</code></pre>\nI wonder if this would work:<p><pre><code>  $name = &#x27;foo&#x27;;\n  myFunction(...[$name =&gt; &#x27;bar&#x27;]);\n</code></pre>\nThankfully it&#x27;s rather unlikely that someone would use a variable for the name anyway.<p>Where this will bite people is when they do meta programming with functions that process functions and function signatures.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but I find this to be another tragically missed opportunity. It&#x27;s just unnecessary friction where there didn&#x27;t need to be any, which makes me sad. At least they can add variable name support someday, because it&#x27;s easier to allow something restricted than restrict something that used to work. Hopefully there is a &quot;good reason&quot; for this oversight.')
