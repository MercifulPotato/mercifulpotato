Obviously you think you&#x27;re not a below average driver.  But everyone does, and lots of them are wrong.<p>The part that isn&#x27;t is that you&#x27;re imagining a non-linear distribution where a significant fraction of accidents are the fault of these identifiable &quot;bad drivers&quot; and that the MEDIAN human driver is actually better than the average&#x2F;median SDV.<p>To which I ask: is there evidence for this?  It&#x27;s a new argument, and I haven&#x27;t seen it made before.')
