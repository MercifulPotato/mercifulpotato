But since the mid-50s, at least two major powers have held the capacity to destroy earth in its entirety and have hitherto failed to do so.<p>Since then, we&#x27;ve built the World Wide Web, established a global world governing structure (UN, and it&#x27;s instruments)... Co-operated on a whole host of humanitarian projects. Ronald Reagan ordered the GPS system to become open to all, in order to protect humanity from air disasters.<p>That said, disputed evidence for the existence of aliens exists all over the place. People &quot;know&quot; about Roswell. Countless people have seen UFOs. And sceptics have simply said &quot;now now, don&#x27;t be silly. There must be other some explanation&quot;. That&#x27;s hardly proof, but there isn&#x27;t a complete <i>blackout</i> of information out there. Whether you dismiss it all as a collective delusion (also feasible, considering The Mandela Effect, and other similar phenomenon)... Or the leaked whispers of a genuine conspiracy. If mankind can keep the secret of how to saw a lady in half on a stage, it can keep this one.')
