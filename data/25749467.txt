It isn&#x27;t the government&#x27;s fault that Orkut and MySpace didn&#x27;t compete well against Facebook, or that Parler entered a service contract with another corporation that decided their TOS was violated.<p>This will all be sorted out in the courts, interpreting contracts which are the ultimate source of truth in the libertarian world view. Fear nothing, justice will prevail. If Parler was not in violation of the contract, they will be compensated. If they were, too bad, they failed to adhere to the contract they agreed to. They deserve to fail and the NEXT competitor to take up the mantle will have incrementally better information and chances to succeed.')
