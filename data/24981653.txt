For example, lambda doesn&#x27;t make sense without IAM, VPC, etc and you often want things to hook to it like SQS, API Gateway, database, cognito, etc.<p>Instead of lockin, you can run serverless in your own framework though, such as Kubeless or Knative, which could be deployed on prem or in a more generic cloud deployment.')
