They interviewed a bunch of experienced backcountry (out of bounds) skiers and the various tricks you&#x27;d learn for avoiding dying in avalanches.  Most of them had been caught in avalanches and described a complete loss of ability to do anything.<p>At the end of the video they list all of the interviewees, all of whom had subsequently died.  If you think about the amount of mass in the snow 9+ rocks, trees etc) and the churning dynamics you realize all those &quot;techniques&quot; you might learn are mumbo jumbo.<p>We show this video to our students (it&#x27;s so old it&#x27;s on a DVD), while teaching them how to avoid  likely avalanche zones in the first place.  Despite that I still carry an avalanche pole and beacon.')
