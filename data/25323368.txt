We want to do comparisons, and it is quite difficult to download much of the software and datasets.<p>For example, we are in the process of writing a paper for the compression of proteins. There are a few papers about this problem, but only one working compressor that we could find. Even more problematic is when the papers in question claim very good efficiency and we are always left wondering if we are missing something, or if the data they used isn&#x27;t the same data we have access to etc. In that regard, GigaScience is great, because it places a lot of importance in reproducibility.')
