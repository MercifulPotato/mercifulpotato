An off-the-cuff approach might be to have the core define a canvas interface with the rendering primitives it desires, and provide a suite of functions that will translate user input actions to canvas rendering primitives.<p>A purely functional approach would involve a core of functions taking in a current state and returning an updated state and a list of canvas actions to take.<p>Functions might include &quot;select ellipse tool&quot; and &quot;set pen width to 5&quot; and &quot;click on canvas at point (3,15)&quot; and return canvas primitives like &quot;render ellipsis from (3,15) to (47,99) with stroke width 5, stroke colour black, and no fill&quot;.<p>Unit testing of the core should obviously be quite simple to do, being totally independent of the GUI system.')
