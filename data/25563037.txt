With rental property you get a pretty good signal on an ongoing basis - the rent! So investment real estate is based quite strongly on the Net Operating Income, and the value is the net operating income divided by the sale price which gives you what is called a capitalization rate (how much money you get coming in for how much you had to come up with to buy the place.) cap rate is impacted a bit by market and a bit by segment (upscale property vs housing for lower income folks) but it is mostly impacted by current interest rates. Cap rates can be like 4%, or where the sales price is like 25x NOI. So, at a 4% cap rate, differences in rent have a 25x impact on the value of the property (big expenses like property management costs tend to be proportional to rent, etc.)<p>So now that you know about how NOI is the thing that drives property value, some other practices make sense — “concessions” (free months of rent) are only sometimes valued as part of the rent roll, but usually ignored unless the property has a pattern of excessive turnover. This is why landlords are more likely to give you free months rent instead of lowering your rent!<p>Anyway, it’s all a game that serves to transfer wealth from workers to capital holders and our tax system incentivizes this in many ways. Used to be that people spent way less a portion of their income on housing, but the move to create an “ownership society” actually made it way more expensive relative to wages, to the benefit of land owners. This also explains a large part of the wealth gap between white people and Black people with redlining and refusal to loan for black neighborhoods, etc.')
