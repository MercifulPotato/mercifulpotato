The US constitution gives state legislatures virtually unchecked authority to choose their own electors regardless of what state laws or courts say, without needing any other justification (eg. no evidence or even claims of fraud required).<p>Some, if not all, of the legislatures of PA, MI, GA, and WI will be sending their own GOP electors.<p>Those electors arguably take precedence over electors chosen by other legal processes, like democratic votes, according to the US Constitution. Because this issue does not concern state laws (or fraud allegations) whatsoever, the matter will go directly to federal courts.<p>Looking past the smoke screen of poorly supported fraud allegations and popular reporting&#x27;s misdirected focus on the obvious lack of merit of said allegations, last night&#x27;s impromptu PA legislative hearing was a major turning point in this situation.')
