The opposite of it would be &quot;looks tired&quot;.<p>At our office, we have the more normal term of &quot;easy to communicate&quot; and &quot;good culture fit&quot; and so on.<p>&quot;Culture fit&quot; seems like a slightly more convenient term for applying ingrained racist and sexist biases, but I guess saying any applicants who don&#x27;t match your racial or socioeconomic background seem &quot;tired&quot; works well too!<p>I think &quot;looks tired&quot; is also even more convenient for ageism than the usual &quot;that old person didn&#x27;t seem like a good culture fit&quot;.<p>I know this is a really negative interpretation of what you&#x27;re saying, but in my experience those sorts of things really are used to filter out people who aren&#x27;t like you. People of different races, people who have young kids and are thus naturally tired, people who have lazy eyes, people with minor speech impediments.
