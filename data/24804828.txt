That&#x27;s the standard you want to apply to anyone running any forum anywhere on the internet? That every comment has to be carefully prescreened for legal compliance? And even then you have to operate under a substantially increased risk of lawsuit.<p>Maybe you prescreen every comment but you make a bad call and something defamatory gets through. Or maybe someone sues you under bad faith and you have to pay to defend it or settle.<p>This is a very bad future for the internet. It&#x27;s an internet where the powerful, who have the full support of publishers, will get to have their voices heard loudly. And the less powerful, who do not have teams of lawyers willing to fight on their behalf, will have a very hard time getting their voices heard.')
