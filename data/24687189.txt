Item(by='CGamesPlay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601901732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686698, text='I&#x27;m probably 75&#x2F;25 on this. 75% of the time I&#x27;m gonna squash, because my entire commit messages is along the lines of &quot;got to this point&quot; or &quot;fix frotzolate when x=7&quot;. 25% of the time my first round of squashing yields good commit messages that are isolated and complete, so it&#x27;s better to leave those as separate commits when merging into the mainline.<p>I also aggressively reorder my commits. When it gets to yak shaving you basically develop in a stack, so you end up with a half-functional commit to system A at the top, then a complete commit to system B, then the finishing commit to system A, so it&#x27;s better to just rearrange it so that you have one system B commit followed by one system A commit.<p>But I do routinely read the commit history (using git blame) and no I don&#x27;t want to see the &quot;complete story&quot; of my past self having &quot;got to this point&quot;--I want the documented MR commentary.')
