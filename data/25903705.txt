I only have 2-3 apps on the Home Screen and a 6 app “Siri suggested” widget that cycles the apps based on how I use my phone. These means I’m training the iOS algo to “prompt” these healthier app uses and they show up.<p>It seems silly, why not just put those apps on the Home Screen? For me, there’s something to the passive nature that reinforces the “this is what I do” vs “this is what I <i>have</i> to do” that keeps me on track.')
