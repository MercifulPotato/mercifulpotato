It’s 24-week limit on abortion for economic reasons is the longest in the EU. In the US, abortion was legalized by the Supreme Court. 24 weeks is a fairly typical limit in the US—a country that’s more religious than Poland (where abortion is illegal). The 12-week limit in Denmark or Germany or France, or the waiting periods that were place in France until 2015, would be unconstitutional. Germany’s abortion laws (where the constitutional court found it unconstitutional to legalize abortion so it’s still just decriminalized under 12 weeks, and where there is a counseling requirement) would be unimaginable. Indeed, at the same time as the Supreme Court found a constitutional right to abortion, the courts of Canada, Austria, and France found that it was a matter for the legislature to decide.<p>Indeed. To provide background for others, by the early 1970s various US states had legalized abortion. In <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, however, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was a constitutional right, abruptly legalizing it nationwide with more or less no restrictions whatsoever; even many abortion-rights supporters believe that the legal theory behind the decision was faulty (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roe_v._Wade#Legal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roe_v._Wade#Legal</a>). The result was so across-the-board that, among other things, the US still allows abortions to occur later than anywhere else.<p>Preventing the full political debate process from occurring is why abortion remains so controversial in the country almost 50 years and counting. <i>Because</i> such issues are polarizing and partisan, they need full discussion in a legislature, as opposed to unelected judges unilaterally short-circuiting the debate.')
