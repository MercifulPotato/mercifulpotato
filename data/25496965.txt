The Sigmas felt different, and the pictures they produced had a different &quot;look&quot; for what was supposed to be an equivalent lens.  My eye isn&#x27;t trained for these sorts of things, so I was never able to quantify it.<p>What is it that Sigma does that makes its lenses cheaper than the others?')
