By my path, using the 7&#x2F;4 approximation for sqrt(3), the ratio between X and Y directions is 12:21 which is much harder to do in your head than the 3:2 that a square grid gives you.  However, a simpler approximation of (5:3) with acceptably low error came out.<p>Math (see diagram below)<p>Normalizing your 1.75 approximation to 7 &quot;units&quot; then the sides of the hexagon are of length 7, the distance from center to corner is length 7, and the distance from center to side is 6.  This gives a distance from A to other points as:<p>B: 12 (Center -&gt; Side -&gt; Center)<p>C: 12 (Center -&gt; Side -&gt; Center)<p>D: 21 (Center -&gt; Corner -&gt; Corner -&gt; Center)<p>Given that the actual value of A-&gt;D is ~20.784 that suggests approximating A-&gt;D = 20 alowing us to reduce as follows:<p>B: 3<p>C: 3<p>D: 5<p>This has a ~3.7% error in the horizontal direction.<p><pre><code>       ______            ______      \n      &#x2F;      \\          &#x2F;      \\     \n    &#x2F;    B     \\______&#x2F;          \\___\n    \\          &#x2F;      \\          &#x2F;   \n      \\      &#x2F;          \\      &#x2F;     \n        ----      C       ----       \n      &#x2F;      \\          &#x2F;      \\     \n    &#x2F;    A     \\______&#x2F;    D     \\___\n    \\          &#x2F;      \\          &#x2F;   \n      \\      &#x2F;          \\      &#x2F;     \n        ----              ----       \n      &#x2F;      \\          &#x2F;      \\     \n    &#x2F;          \\______&#x2F;          \\___\n    \\          &#x2F;      \\          &#x2F;   \n      \\      &#x2F;          \\      &#x2F;     \n        ----              ----</code></pre>')
