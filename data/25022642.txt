You would specifically &#x2F;not&#x2F; expect per-state error to be evenly distributed because the nature of the error would have similar impacts on similar populations and there are similar populations of people that live in different states in differing numbers.<p>You should review the literature about the nature of the (fairly small) polling misses that impacted the swing states and thus disproportionately the outcome in the 2016 election. You will probably find it interesting.')
