Otherwise you should probably work on documentation&#x2F;testing&#x2F;refactoring and&#x2F;or porting to another language.<p>2to3 transition was handled badly, up to about 2.7 and 3.4 or so, but the pains described here seem mostly self-inflicted, and I don&#x27;t see it as an argument against the needed changes.')
