Ah well. This one is definitely on Intel &#x2F; AMD&#x27;s fault for being slow on the uptake.<p>DDR4 had largely the same power-draw of LPDDR3 (but was missing sleep-mode). So I think CPU makers got a bit lazy and felt like DDR4 was sufficient for the job. But LPDDR4x is leapfrogging ahead... the phone market is really seeing more innovation than the laptop &#x2F; desktop market in some respects.')
