Yes, a chess game could well be OK at 5fps, but no-one&#x27;s going to find any game with action playable at 5fps.  Of course playability is a more subjective scale, but having read some of the table, this looks much more disappointing that I was expecting - for instance considering being able to play &quot;among us&quot; as a win seems to be a very low bar!')
