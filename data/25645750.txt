Almost all of the Apps I have on my Android phone are installed from F-Droid, and I try to avoid installing any Apps from other sources, exceptions force upon me by my social circle, like WhatsApp.<p>I have a PinePhone but it is not yet ready as a daily driver, and also the difference in hardware performance between my Android phone (which I bought this year) and PinePhone (or even Librem) is abismal. I wish there was at least one (or many) linux phone ready to be a daily driver and with hardware comparable to modern Android phones (or iPhones), but unfortunately that is not yet the case, although the community has made a massive effort this year to advance the state of linux on phones, at least for PinePhone...<p>I use a MacBook for work and same thing, almost all the apps I have I installed using homebrew (and the UI apps, with brew cask)<p>EDIT: I see that, at least for now, it&#x27;s optional and you can un-enroll, which is good.')
