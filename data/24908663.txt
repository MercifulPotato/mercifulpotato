Better keep those ML engineers handy.<p>If you think this isn’t a concern, I’ve already seen it happen with my own eyes, rather than hearing about it second hand. They encouraged someone to make a writing tool. That someone then spent roughly six weeks prototyping, iterating, and giving constant feedback. All signals from OpenAI were “Yes, awesome!”<p>Then one day they simply declined to let them ship. Anything. Anything even resembling “a tool to generate huge quantities of outputs.” Which was, you know, the whole point.<p>You play, you pay. And I hope you’re ready to pay, because you won’t have your magical genie unless the magical genie’s caretakers believe you are sufficiently worthy.<p>I cloned as much of OpenAI’s API as I could: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theshawwn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312299759592333318?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theshawwn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312299759592333318?s=2...</a><p>All that’s left is to reproduce a substantially similar model.
