It&#x27;s always good to see people testing their site on non-mainstream user-agents.<p>Some other terminal user-agents to try:<p>rdrview, go-readability: these are CLI utilities that use Mozilla&#x27;s Readability algorithm to send HTML of just the article to stdout. Pipe that into w3m&#x2F;lynx&#x2F;links to read articles in the terminal. Testing in these ensures that your website will work in Firefox&#x27;s Reader Mode. I also like to diff my website&#x27;s HTML against the HTML output of these tools, just to see how much extraneous HTML I have.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s Readability is written in JS; these tools are written in C and Go, respectively. With the exception of a few whitespace characters, their output of both seems to be identical.<p>=&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eafer&#x2F;rdrview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eafer&#x2F;rdrview</a> rdrview<p>=&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-shiori&#x2F;go-readability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-shiori&#x2F;go-readability</a> go-readability<p>Edbrowse is a line-mode browser that supports JavaScript via Duktape.

I test with pandoc&#x27;s strict markdown output and make sure the resulting markdown is readable:<p><pre><code>  pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com\n</code></pre>\nNone of this is a replacement for real a11y testing; most a11y technology leverages mainstream browsers (Chromium, FF, Safari, et cetera).')
