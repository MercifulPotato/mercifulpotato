I admit, it is a bit of a troll question. I, and most Americans, believe that the reason that Biden appears to have won is because he won the most delegates who where selected based on a majority of the legal votes in their corresponding states. One of the reason that I trust the result of the election is because throughout history people have questioned the results, passed laws allowing many observers from all sides, kept a paper trail, and preformed recounts when the result was close and questioned. If, however, we are no longer allowed to question if the election is free and democratic, then I will no longer trust the results.')
