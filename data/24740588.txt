Because I think that people who do not understand that free will is an illusion underestimate how much their decisions are influenced by the information they are exposed to.&quot;<p>I  find this sort of ultra deterministic take on things renders articles like these pointless. I mean, what are we supposed to do now, &#x27;choose&#x27; to expose ourselves to different information? Isn&#x27;t too late, in a way before we were ever born kind of way? Wouldn&#x27;t our &quot;underestimating&quot; be an imperative beyond reproach. Not to mention that free-will is not a factor in our being influenced by information. This is true in both cases, free-will and not.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m a non-compatibilist but believe the jury is still out on determinism. Despite having lots of evidence in support of it, I think there is still a lot of room for conformation bias, simply because the scope of such claims is so large. Overall, it takes a lot of hubris to make the claims stated in this article.<p>Also as a sort of pseudo-biological question: What would be the purpose be of evolving an illusion of free-will?')
