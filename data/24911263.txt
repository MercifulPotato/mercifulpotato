The competition costs more or at least similar to starlink, but delivers a lesser product, i know from my own hellish experiences of living in rural America. I honestly think all but the most impoverished rural homes will considered starlink affordable and reasonable.<p>That being said, your question sparked my interest, so here is some back of the napkin math.<p>Currently spaceX launches 60 satellites per launch. \nEach satellite is estimated to be roughly $250k (Exact cost not known), \nAn estimated rocket cost of $50m (for used) \nSo roughly $65mil per 60 sats, or 1.08mil per sat cost. \nEach sat has an estimated lifespan of 5 years<p>So 65mil &#x2F; 60 &#x2F; 5 = ~$217,000&#x2F;y per sat, not including personal costs for support, ground base stations, etc.<p>Currently there are 900 sats in orbit, I believe they are currently approved for 12,000 sats, but want to go up to 30,000 sats.<p>So for the current constellation they need $195mil&#x2F;y or just under 165,000 customers at the $99&#x2F;m (165,000 * 99 * 12)<p>For the 12,000 cluster, they would need to make 2.6bil per year, or 2.2mil customers at the $99&#x2F;m (2,200,000 * 99 * 12)<p>For the 30,000 cluster, they would need to make 6.5bil per year, or 5.5mil customers at the $99&#x2F;m (5,500,000 * 99 * 12)<p>For comparison, comcast has roughly ~28mil customers for internet.\nRural america is ~60mil people in total (census.gov) (not counting vacation or secondary houses from non rural americans)\nso starlink&#x27;s break even on rural subscribers only would be just under 10% of rural America. (lets call the cush government contracts a wash for operational costs for people and hardware on the ground?) \nNote that ONLY 5.5mil Americans ( &lt;2% of Americans) would fund all of the hardware cost and launch costs. Every other person in every other country around the world would theoretically be profit?')
