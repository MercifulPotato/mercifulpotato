Perhaps they exist, but I&#x27;ve never seen one. The $250-300 chromebooks are much weaker than an iPad.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed, but Apple <i>did</i> release iPhone SE2 which is an almost-flagship at medium price. An iPad with a slightly different iOS and a cheaper than $129 keyboard (there are $50 bluetooh keyboards that work with the iPad, not by apple, that are comparable to the keyboards that come with $300-$400 laptops), perhaps they&#x27;ll call it &quot;iMac SE&quot; or &quot;iPad SE&quot;.<p>The processor inside last years iPad is a slower, more limited version of the M1. Apple could, and I believe would, release a cheaper Mac-compatible machine, just like they did with the iPhone SE.<p>It made no sense to do so before the real Mac switched to apple silicon (Intel&#x27;s offering are both expensive and inefficient for this use). Now it makes perfect sense. It make take a year or two, but it&#x27;s the logical progression.<p>Apple are playing the very long game. Saying &quot;you barely have multiple windows&quot; is indication you are not looking farther than the end of 2021.')
