If it&#x27;s fast back-and-forth messaging, that could be fine to save time typing.  Otherwise, people are very good at seeing long names as single &quot;symbols.&quot;<p>For example, I don&#x27;t use &quot;CI&quot; for &quot;confidence interval&quot; in reports.  I just write both words every time.  No confusion, and I doubt there&#x27;s a difference in reading speed.<p>Obviously, there are exceptions when space for text is limited (presentation slides, labels in a chart).')
