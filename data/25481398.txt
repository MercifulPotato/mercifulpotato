I think kindness doesn’t have to be in personal interactions, especially in a business context. I’m perfectly polite, but also very honest. I still use empathy to understand where people are coming from. You have to learn to give unconditionally without becoming a doormat. It’s tricky. I think you have to be purposeful with how you give to others. I also help people out and do my best to be kind in my private life (charity, supporting local food banks, etc). I think you can generalize this kindness is healthy thing way to far. For me the reward is helping people and making their lives better. In a business context I think your examples are very different from the more intrinsically rewarding giving and kindness.')
