This is the kind of talk that happens on these platforms every single day. You&#x27;ve just had a violent insurgence on your capitol and you still think the solution is to ask these people to be nice? It&#x27;s CLEARLY not working, and it&#x27;s time for social media to rid themselves of open calls for violence and the conspiracy theories that fuel them.<p>People on the left have also been suspended for similar issues, and rightly so. If your movement cannot remain on a platform without adhering to a policy as simple as &quot;do not threaten violence&quot;, then your ideology has a fundamental problem and deserves to be banned to the fringes of the net.')
