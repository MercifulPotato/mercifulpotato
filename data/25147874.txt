It&#x27;s also the reason why a lot of donors are Russian or Arab.<p>If you could actually buy anything but an ear for your complaints access would be a great deal more expensive. That’s not to say this petty corruption of the democratic process is right but it’s like how a Russian would burst out laughing at the idea of a politician with bricks of cash in the freezer. In Russia the Chief of Police lives in a palace he obviously can’t afford on his salary and it’s very public, not something he tries to hide. In the US or UK if you have a freezer full of cash the police are going to get you eventually.<p>Take no small or secret bribes.')
