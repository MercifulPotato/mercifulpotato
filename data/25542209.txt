The software is never &quot;installed&quot;. It&#x27;s only unzipped to scoops install directory (usually home&#x2F;scoop&#x2F;...)<p>Then it adds the install directory to the PATH and it&#x27;s done. The copied executables have never been marked as unknown by windows in my experience.<p>Admins could of course lock down systems to only allow executables with specific hashedls which are manually whitelisted by the admins, but just disallowing installs won&#x27;t help at all<p>Disallowing powershell or scripting altogether makes it impossible to use as well.')
