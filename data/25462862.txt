I already have this problem with services that decide they really need to send me some code by email because they don’t recognize my device (because it’s been more than 30 days and Safari killed their cookies). And then every once in a while the email doesn’t show up for 45 minutes for some reason, leaving me with no recourse.<p>But for certain things that I need to do say once a year (let’s say renew some kind of registration or insurance) I wouldn’t mind it. Because chances are I already do this because I forgot to save the password in my password manager last time and now I need to do a reset password flow anyway.')
