Americans view property as an investment while also wanting it to be affordable. These are mutually exclusive. If you want something to be a good investment you want it to become less affordable over time.<p>This comes up a lot, but is false. It&#x27;s easy to have every single home become more expensive over time while the average unit remains affordable. Let me paint a picture of how it would work in a city where you can actually build new housing at higher density.<p>Family buys single family home in year A for $100k. Lives there for a while, then sells in year B for $200k. The buyer is a developer, who then constructs a larger building on that same lot consisting of 4 apartments that now each sell for $100k again. Original family gains in wealth, developer makes tidy profit, new families can still buy a place to live for $100k. All numbers inflation-adjusted, you pick A and B to make whatever return you think is reasonable.<p>This is how density increases happened almost everywhere, until zoning laws became the new way to keep racial minorities out of white neighborhoods, roughly mid-century, after restrictive racial covenants (i.e., &quot;when you buy this house you agree not to sell it to anyone non-white&quot;) became illegal.<p>Note what you don’t get out of this arrangement: a neighborhood that doesn’t change for 40 years; the ability to live in the same type of house your parents did, in the same neighborhood, for the same price. But you could have the same amount of (indoor) space they did, and outdoor space through public parks and the like.<p>What’s not sustainable is everyone having a suburban style detached single family home without increasing density in perpetuity. That is what leads to this contradiction.<p>The non-density alternative is sprawl, where prices rise in long-established neighborhoods, and outlying new developments are where you can buy new houses for less—which is what you observe all over California.')
