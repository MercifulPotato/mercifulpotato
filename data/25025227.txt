I don&#x27;t know why you want to impugn my motives in this discussion.<p>I think there are a multitude of smaller problems to solve and smaller steps to take that would be utterly uncontroversial to the wider public. But they will not be considered because both sides are pushing for their big thing and locked into combative attitudes.<p>Same goes for immigration reform for that matter. There&#x27;s plenty of low grade nonsense to clean up with legislation but the culture of controversy derails trying to find where consensus actually exists and acting on it.<p>A good positive example would be how criminal justice reform was actually attempted recently.')
