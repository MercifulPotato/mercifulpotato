They do not have expectations of being censored. The items you mention are paid services. Facebook isn&#x27;t for most of its users.<p>I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I don&#x27;t use Facebook because I find its business model to be exploitative and invasive for a whole host of reasons.<p>FB users may treat it as a public forum, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it is a public forum.<p>There are a number of reasons (this is <i>not</i> an exhaustive list) why FB users might think it is a public forum:<p>1.  They never read the terms of service;<p>2.  They <i>assume</i> that they have free speech rights on the platform -- see (1) above;<p>3.  They don&#x27;t recognize that FB exists to make money selling advertising, and that advertisers are their customers, not them (again, see (1) above).  Advertisers are notoriously picky about what sort of content they want their ads seen next to. And the customer is always right;<p>4.  They don&#x27;t think about the fact that Facebook&#x27;s servers are the private property of Facebook, and Facebook can do (or not) whatever it wants with its private property[0].<p>[0] I&#x27;d point out that this is a <i>very</i> good thing.  Because if Facebook doesn&#x27;t have private property rights, then neither do you.  Or me, for that matter.  And if that&#x27;s the case, I can come over to your house and project gay, furry porn in HD at full volume, on your walls -- all night, every night.')
