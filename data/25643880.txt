I&#x27;ve been wondering for a while if I should do my own but I&#x27;ve been living fine with my StackOverflow CV. Nonetheless I have created a CV there on read.cv&#x2F;jpic and tried all the features and have a couple of ideas:<p>- I tried &quot;Print to file&quot; to export a PDF because a lot of times sites ask you to upload a PDF, it turned out only the first page got out, this might be a bug, another thing is that we don&#x27;t see the picture and there&#x27;s not much colors<p>- It would be great to be able to create several CVs, when I apply to a corpo dev job I show a corpo dev CV and when I apply for a freelancer job I show a freelancer CV and when I apply to a corpo management job I show another and so on')
