For that I used ActivityWatch on my personal laptop (which I use for all non-work related matters) in order to have an automatic way to track my time and, at least for me, figure out how much time I&#x27;m wasting on time wasters like social media, Youtube, Hacker News and so on. It was interesting to see the difference between the time I think I&#x27;m spending and the time I&#x27;m actually spending.')
