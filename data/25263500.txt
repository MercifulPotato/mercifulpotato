Item(by='throwaway9d0291', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606811393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262171, text='Yes, I have a bunch of Apple devices as well.<p>I find that iOS itself and its first-party apps are fantastic from a privacy perspective, especially compared to Google. Most of the apps I mentioned using on Android have an Apple-provided alternative that&#x27;s vastly superior to Google in regards to privacy. For example Apple asks you when you set up your device whether you want to allow analytics and easily allows you to opt-out. Apple also allows you to use basically every service other than Siri and the App Store without storing any data on their servers.<p>It&#x27;s not all sunshine and rainbows though. Unlike Android, there isn&#x27;t a strong open-source&#x2F;privacy culture among iOS developers, so there are few privacy-respecting or open-source third-party apps (while on Android, F-Droid is full of them). And there&#x27;s no app sideloading and the OS itself is locked-down and closed-source.<p>Still, I&#x27;d say that as far as stock mobile OS go, iOS is the clear winner in terms of privacy.<p>When it comes to non-stock though, Android is much better, with the right device. There are devices (mainly Nexus&#x2F;Pixel) that allow you to re-lock the bootloader after flashing a custom ROM by adding your own system verification key. With these, you can build AOSP, LineageOS, GrapheneOS or whatever takes your fancy, sign it with your own key, flash it to your device and then bootloader lock it. GrapheneOS also has verifiable builds.<p>With that, you get all the advantages of a locked device but you don&#x27;t have to accept the backdoor that is Google Play services.')
