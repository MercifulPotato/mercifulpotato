This is not true and there have been precedents where a valid and successful relicense was done with much less (if I remember correctly I learnt this from a comment somewhere hidden in that same Github issue)<p>b) The other project contributors would not necessarily agree with the relicense. Which was not the case: the most prominent contributors showed up and explicitly gave the author ownership (or free license) over their small parts of the code.')
