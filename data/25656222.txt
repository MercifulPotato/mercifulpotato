Item(by='tannhaeuser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609927081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25654822, text='I get your point, but Prolog is by no means an esoteric language. It (or derivatives such as Datalog) has been the lingua franca for logic and constraint programming since about the mid-1970&#x27;s, is an ISO-standardized language, and has more implementations than most programming language out there, including shells, JavaScript, BASIC (but probably not as many as historic LISP derivatives lol), has inspired the syntax of Haskell and Erlang, has been used to prototype languages (Erlang, again) due to extremely convenient built-in parser construction capabilities (operator precedence, recursive descend), etc. It&#x27;s used behind the scenes in many, many apps, including financial optimization&#x2F;allocation apps, logistic scheduling, or other discrete optimization, config management, combinatorial test case generation, graph&#x2F;logic DBs including the so-called &quot;semantic web&quot;, controlled language applications and other non-ML natural language apps, medical and system diagnostics, medical and legal taxonomies, formal specification&#x2F;verification, simulation, DSLs, parsers and compilers, type inference and other decision problems in programming languages, layout algorithms and data representation in hypermedia formats, modelling in database theory including variant CAP and OT approaches, games, etc. etc.<p>Sorry for ranting and unfairly picking your post for replying, but I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed to see the clueless and roundabout reaction of HNers here who, rather than sticking to the topic of Prolog, see stories like this as an invitation to advertise their fringe language, their not-quite-Prolog language, or their personal pet peeve.')
