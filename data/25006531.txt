Something Servant (Haskell) does a clean job of. But you can never completely do away with static heavy lifting<p>This one takes a more modernized Rails or Elixir&#x27;s Phoenix approach which is really interesting and looks highly usable.<p>Community size and quality is everything for real life software (something I remember Clojure had early on and now Rust has in spades, best of breed sort of libraries to choose from) so I hope it gets some adoption to see where it goes. I&#x27;ll give it a shot to toy around with when I get some time.')
