Empower your users instead of taking features away. Make it modular with the default modules being the old interface. Make reporting spam <i>actually useful</i> instead of feeling like it gets ignored. Make it easier to manage a list of _thousands_ of filters. Provide better IMAP integration instead of the half-implemented crap that it is right now. Hell, just make it so that I can encrypt my emails.<p>Serious blowback happens when you break something for some segment of your users. You don&#x27;t have to break things to provide new features.')
