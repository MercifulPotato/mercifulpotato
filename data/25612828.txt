Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609595582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612700, text='By law Companies House requires that &quot;Persons with Significant Control&quot; be listed. PSCs are small numbers of specifically humans (not corporations) who, somehow, in effect control the company. The PSC entries are supposed to list all such humans (assuming any individual humans have &quot;significant&quot; control which they wouldn&#x27;t at e.g. a publicly traded company) and only those humans.<p>The law is in practice fairly toothless, Companies House has typically insisted that it simply doesn&#x27;t have the funding to pursue errors even though it&#x27;s illegal to make false filings - despite a large volume of obviously bogus information in their system every year.<p>It did find the money exactly once in recent years, to prosecute one person. That one person was making a point of how toothless it is, by creating bogus data that was embarrassing to named politicians. What an excellent way to make their point for them.')
