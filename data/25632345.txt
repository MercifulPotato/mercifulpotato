Voting doesn’t lead to better policy decisions, just freer ones.<p>Of course the best performing companies aren’t managed in an “authoritarian” manner in the usual sense of strongman rule, because one person (or even a small group) doesn’t have all the answers.  Labor&#x2F;management collaboration and recognition of the importance of human capital is essential.  This is why management doesn’t have as much power as it used to in modern industry:  it is dependent on human capital retention in its labor force, which is very expensive to replace (far more than just skilled labor).<p>At the bigger picture, life is a lot bigger than missions or profit, and democracy is essential.   (Unless one’s mission is to own the libs, then I guess democracy isn’t so important)')
