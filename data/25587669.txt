And this happens more often than I&#x27;d like - I was second in a set of pedestrians about to cross the street (two lane arterial with a 25mph limit - heavily used by both cars and peds - at a cross walk I use several times a week) - the guy in front of me and I both judged that the driver was looking in our direction (it was dark admittedly but street is well-lit) and the car slowed in a fashion that led us to think it was going to stop.<p>The fellow in front of me steps in front of the car which suddenly accelerates and hits him knocking him down. Immediately before impact it decelerates and comes to a stop.<p>The fellow ended more shaken up than anything else, but it was a very near thing and a reminder that it&#x27;s precisely that assumption of the predictability of human drivers that fails in many crash situations.<p>In other words, your judgement that you understand what other drivers are going to do is more fragile than you imagine.')
