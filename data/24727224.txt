That&#x27;s a good point.<p>But, I&#x27;m not convinced because the pipe doesn&#x27;t seem all that dissimilar to the &#x27;target container&#x27; that the explosive is placed in prior to legal use.<p>From the Tannerite website, these are the instructions for use:<p>1. Start by emptying the contents of the target into the mixing container.<p>2. Next, open the packet containing the catalyst and pour it into the mixing container.<p>3. Secure the lid and shake the container until you achieve a uniform color throughout the mixture.<p>4. Then pour the combined mixture back into the target container until it completely fills the target container then secure the lid.<p>5. Always place TanneriteÂ® Brand targets at least 100 yards away from the shooter and&#x2F;or spectators.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tannerite.com&#x2F;binary-target-faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tannerite.com&#x2F;binary-target-faq&#x2F;</a><p>What is the difference between a capped pipe and the &#x27;target container?&#x27;<p>Legally, what makes the leap from legal, to &#x27;destructive device.&#x27;')
