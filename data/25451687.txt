Prime Video and YouTube were unavailable on each other&#x27;s devices for years, Apple TV briefly wasn&#x27;t carrying Netflix, Apple services are paywalled behind Apple devices, etc. Additionally, the ones that <i>do</i> work still depend on access to integrations for features like voice control, leading to scattershot functionality across any from third parties.<p>And that&#x27;s before you get into the interop for <i>purchases</i> within these ecosystems, because under the DMCA you can&#x27;t legally do anything about the incompatible DRM schemes, even for media that other devices are more than technically capable of playing.<p>Another, related issue is that the additional set of proprietary APIs on top of AOSP amounts to an Android ecosystem that&#x27;s &quot;open,&quot; but renders any implementation that they haven&#x27;t blessed as a second-class citizen. This has tangibly impacted compatibility efforts by other vendors, ranging from Amazon (Fire devices) to Huawei (loss of Play Services via the ban) to Microsoft (Project Astoria) -- for reasons that, in part, involved maintaining a walled garden of complementary hardware.<p>Tbf this one&#x27;s not <i>strictly</i> that cut and dry, as the ability to leverage vendors with Play licensing has also forced widespread adoption of solutions like Treble. But over time, large sections of the OS have been abandoned in favor of proprietary Google apps, and the API incompatibility hampers the growth of alternative ecosystems, even if you&#x27;re another FAANG that can bring your own cloud and develop your own hardware.<p>And while personally my general viewpoint of the pending SCOTUS case is that Oracle is engaging in brazen trolling, it&#x27;s, uh, not great optics for that whole argument that API compatibility is fair use when Android apps across several different categories will break just because updating your EOL&#x27;d device or getting rid of manufacturer bloatware will trip SafetyNet -- or because your vendor is a competitor and your device just isn&#x27;t allowlisted by SafetyNet in the first place.')
