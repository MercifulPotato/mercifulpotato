Item(by='jorangreef', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609696885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622115, text='Yes, that&#x27;s the point I want to make.<p>Zig the language, and Zig the std lib have two different sets of documentation. The former is really, really good, and I wouldn&#x27;t say lacking at all, considering Zig is still pre-1.0. Take a look here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;master&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;master&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s the Zig std lib auto-generated documentation (i.e. I&#x2F;O things like epoll and io_uring and much more) that is incomplete, and to which most of the &quot;documentation is lacking&quot; and &quot;read the std lib source&quot; comments relate.<p>It&#x27;s only if you want to know how to use Zig for things like I&#x2F;O, then you&#x27;ll need to read the std lib source (and the growing number of blog posts and talks etc), in the same way that K&amp;R is also not always helpful as a guide for these things (and others) today in C.<p>But the Zig language itself is pretty easy to grok from the excellent language documentation and examples already linked to.')
