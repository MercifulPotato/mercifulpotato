That doesn&#x27;t even get into the fact that there&#x27;s often a labrynthe of private roads that all technically have the same name, typically given by rhe nearest large creek or stream.  Google seems to have a REALLY hard time differentiating the gated private driveways from the more &quot;arterial&quot; ungated sections of these roads.')
