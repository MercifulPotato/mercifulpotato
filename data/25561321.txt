I know they&#x27;ve tried producing a &quot;server&quot; in the past and even a server version of their operating system, but it didn&#x27;t seem to go anywhere.  Unless they had a way to meaningfully compete with Windows and Linux (really, linux) the only viable market I can see is for build systems, and that&#x27;s pretty niche.')
