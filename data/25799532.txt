And even then you may not get a definitive answer given the complexity of the situation.<p>This is not &quot;math&quot; this is the scientific method.<p>&gt;So, UBI is just a fist step outside of this wasteful system to acknowledge that economy should serve and preserve the whole human species, and not the other way around.<p>Communism was an alternative solution to UBI. In fact if you squint enough communism is UBI taken to the extreme, where all forms of income become UBI. Communism in theory works, but in practice there is no working example of a communist utopia in existence today.<p>So you want to turn all of society into some UBI utopia because it fits your political ideology? How about let&#x27;s not be stupid and run some experiments first.')
