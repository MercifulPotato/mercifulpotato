Packaging cost is just passed through the price to the consumer. Packaging and recycling are quite cheap for most products, so unpackaged goods are barely cheaper (often even more expensive, since enviromentally conscious stuff is &quot;premium&quot;).<p>It’s not a fallacy.  The tax is just too low.  Keep raising the tax on plastic until it curbs behavior, problem solved.<p>The real problem is this is an unpopular solution, as most people like the convenience of plastic, and therefore politically untenable.<p>It’s always been a simple solution.  Keep increasing tax on fossil fuels until it reduces consumption.  But that means people giving up their large spread out homes and vacations and large vehicles and plastic wrapped goods.  Therefore it hasn’t happened, and probably won’t until the environment changes enough to force people.')
