Where do you want to go? What are your long term goals&#x2F;hopes&#x2F;dreams? Is your job helping you progress toward those dreams or goals? If not, worth having a hard think about what you want from life and considering changing a few things.<p>With a relatively well paying software job, relatively low expense ratio &amp; enough luck (no surprises with large financial costs) it&#x27;s possible to funnel surplus income into investments until investment income covers annual living expenses. Then you can wave the day job goodbye and do whatever or switch to a new career that&#x27;s more lifestyle focused and less of a grind, or have a solid foundation for taking a lot more risk (let investments pay you a basic income while you start a business that might take a few years to grow before it can generate you a decent wage).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;networthify.com&#x2F;calculator&#x2F;earlyretirement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;networthify.com&#x2F;calculator&#x2F;earlyretirement</a>')
