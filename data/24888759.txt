Unless your paper has a lot\nof math in it, I have no idea why anyone would subject themselves to this form\nof torture. Let me be the one to tell you that you are no less smart or tough\nif you use Google Docs. In fact, some might say you’re more smart, because you\ndon’t let command-line ethos&#x2F;ideology get in the way of actually getting\nthings done… :)<p>I really don&#x27;t understand where this is coming from. It sounds like the\nreaction of someone forced to do something difficult and time-intensive for no\ngood reason other than because someone thinks it&#x27;s &quot;the right way&quot;, which I\ncan get behind. But, from what I can tell, it&#x27;s just doing a &quot;git add&quot; and\n&quot;git commit&quot; every once in a while. Does that really require &quot;command-line\nethos&quot;?<p>This maybe because I don&#x27;t really understand how using git to track changes to\nyour code or text helps <i>reproducibility</i>. Once you have your experiment and\nplotting scripts where you want them, reproducibility should be a matter of\nmaking those scripts available to others. Before you are at that point, using\ngit is useful because you can un-screw mistakes caused by big changes or\nchanges two or three versions of your code ago. It doesn&#x27;t help reproduce your\nwork, just organise it so you don&#x27;t end up making a big, steaming mess of it.\nSo maybe I don&#x27;t understand what the author means by &quot;reproducibility&quot;?<p>Finally, all the same points the author makes against using version control\napply to software development also, or anyway I don&#x27;t see why they shouldn&#x27;t\naply to software development also. Yet, an entire industry seems to agree that\nversion control saves butts much more than it wastes time and one would\nprobably be very hard pressed to convince software developers that they don&#x27;t\nneed to use version control. So either there&#x27;s something that entire industry\nis getting awfully wrong, or software developers like to &quot;torture&quot; themselves,\nor the author is missing something, maybe?')
