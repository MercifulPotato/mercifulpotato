If you have a look at the fineprint of the blender it will say something in the line of &quot;For private use only&quot;. This is not just because they want to extract more money from restaurants, it&#x27;s because the engine is so poorly cooled and low quality components that it will melt if you run it longer than 10 minutes without letting it rest.<p>So yes, the customer can go home and make their own milkshake (unless they are on a trip and can&#x27;t go home to make milkshake). But the store owner can&#x27;t depend on a consumer grade blender to make 50 milkshakes in an hour.')
