In 2014&#x2F;15 when I as working on DigitalOcean we decided to switch to Stripe, based in NYC I went to SF to meet the Stripe folks and get to know them a little. They partnered me with Michelle who not only went out of her way to spend an afternoon with me, feeding me lunch, and telling me anything I needed to know about Stripe, but also as a talented engineer; made me feel really confident that moving to Stripe was the right thing to do! Shout out to Michelle.')
