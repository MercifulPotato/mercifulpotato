Bumble got popular because Tinder was not successful in helping connect people for meaningful relationships. Tinder works exceptionally well for keeping you engaged, and for a subset of users, good at fostering some sort of connection.<p>As you are aware, Bumble&#x27;s <i>only</i> innovation over tinder was requiring women to initiate the first message after matching.<p>In their S1 filings, note they do not list any sort of relationship based metrics, rather all usage based.<p>They are not in the business of helping people find love.<p>As other products come on the market, users will eventually migrate away to services that are vested in creating long term partnerships.<p>In my opinion, dating apps still have not solved the fundamental problem for straight couples--for a majority of women, they are overwhelmed, and for men they are lost in a sea of choices.<p>But...that said, I have two dates this weekend from Hinge. Highly recommend Hinge over Bumble.')
