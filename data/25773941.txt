Even more significant, approximately 50% of the 700 missions produced usable intelligence.</i><p>Note that 50% is not &quot;no better than chance&quot; because the data produced are not binary selections, but things that other intelligence sources give, such as structure layouts, facility purposes, machine blueprints, site and personnel locations.<p>The FOIA documentation is overwhelming in its confirmation of this as an intelligence sensor on par with other sources, which leads me to believe that the AIR report (which you can also search for online) was partially disinfo designed to soften the blow of releasing that this is possible, and I&#x27;m quite sure that government and corporate use of psi continues to this day. Perhaps the FOIA release was also part of a limited hangout designed to yield some control over the narrative and provide a pretext for dismissal to protect ongoing classified programs.<p>Here&#x27;s a MS Strategic Intelligence thesis from the Defense Intelligence College that gives a good overview:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;readingroom&#x2F;docs&#x2F;CIA-RDP96-00789R002600250001-6.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;readingroom&#x2F;docs&#x2F;CIA-RDP96-00789R0026002...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;readingroom&#x2F;docs&#x2F;CIA-RDP96-00788R001700330003-6.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;readingroom&#x2F;docs&#x2F;CIA-RDP96-00788R0017003...</a>')
