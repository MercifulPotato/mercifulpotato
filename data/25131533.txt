I&#x27;m pulling the data about the icons from Firestore which include a URL for the png and the .icns file. Right now I&#x27;m looking at alternatives, I&#x27;m aware this is not the most efficient thing, but I just haven&#x27;t had time to change it since it blew up last Friday. For reference, last week we had a little less than 1000 icons, and today there&#x27;s almost 2000.')
