Your tech choices should be driven by your business needs. Some startups can get by with nothing other than Wordpress for a while. Others may need all the tools above.<p>I will say as far as Auth that if it&#x27;s going to be important to your business and you are planning on having a ton of users then you should either choose a platform with it baked in or you should leverage a provider such as Auth0. Auth0 cost-benefit will be positive for almost any business except one that registers a ton of low-value users.')
