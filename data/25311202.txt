But I&#x27;m somewhat confused -- it&#x27;s actually perfectly possible to pre-generate UUIDv1s, I do it in my applications <i>before</i> the query. I&#x27;m not sure what HiLo actually improves upon other than that.<p>So basically that leaves COMB, and as I&#x27;ve said -- I don&#x27;t feel the need to use COMB if UUIDv1 is good enough.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typeorm&#x2F;typeorm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typeorm&#x2F;typeorm</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npgsql.org&#x2F;efcore&#x2F;modeling&#x2F;generated-properties.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npgsql.org&#x2F;efcore&#x2F;modeling&#x2F;generated-properties....</a>')
