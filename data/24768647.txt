A &quot;wireframe&quot; in graphics is a 3D model where only the edges are shown. This use of &quot;wireframe&quot; means something else entirely. In publishing, that&#x27;s usually called a &quot;layout&quot;.<p>In graphics, &quot;rendering&quot; refers to the final steps which generate the actual pixel values to be displayed. The web crowd uses &quot;rendering&quot; to mean creating the DOM to be displayed, which is still a long way from the pixels. Graphics people would call that creating the scene graph. This appears to be a concept created by Google.[1] For scraping purposes, Google runs most pages in a headless browser to build the final DOM. Then they scrape that. Thus, the Javascript gets executed before scraping. Google refers to that as &quot;rendering&quot;, even though they don&#x27;t take the last steps to generate a pixel image.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webmasters.googleblog.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;rendering-pages-with-fetch-as-google.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webmasters.googleblog.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;rendering-pages-wi...</a>')
