The precision you want, the slower would the refresh rate be.<p>If somebody is old enough to remember, (saying this as a 30 years old is indeed amusing to myself) the last active matrix monochrome LCDs had 8 bit, and more of gray resolution, but they are all discontinued now, or cost an arm, and a leg as &quot;medical imaging&quot; specialty.')
