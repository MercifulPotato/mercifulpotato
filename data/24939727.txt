Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604039771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24939510, text='&gt; I guarantee you would fail a blind test on which one is which, or if the cups of coffee are even different.<p>Oddly enough, I&#x27;ve actually done a blind taste test on multiple coffee systems systems: drip, aeropress, chemex (pour over), italian percolator, french press, keurig, manual espresso machine, and real espresso machine. We controlled for water temperature and mass, steep time, coffee type, coffee grind (with exceptions for specialized filters), coffee mass, packing pressure (similar pressures for similar types of brew methods).<p>There were ten of us in the test. We each did three tastings of each brew, with a 10 minute break between each round of tasting. Each round we wrote down guesses at brew methods, how much we enjoyed the taste, how much we enjoyed the smell, and the coffee&#x27;s were shuffled between each round.<p>Analyzing the results was interesting, and gave some insights into similarity categories between them. For example, everyone identified the espresso brews correctly, but some people misidentified the percolator brew as being an espresso brew during the first tasting, then correctly identified the espresso during their second or third. The aeropress was also misidentified as both the manual espresso and the percolator.<p>There were a few more interesting conclusions, but the total average accuracy was something like 70%.')
