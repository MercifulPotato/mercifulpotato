Even if the Universe is 100% deterministic, it would take a computer the size of the universe to predict anything. Therefore, determinism may or may not be true, but from within the confines of this universe, we will never be able to observe it fully (e.g. there does not exist the possibility for an Oracle who could predict every action).<p>To prove this consider the opposite: If such an Oracle was able to exist, you could simply ask it whether you would select Red or Blue next, then do the opposite of whatever it predicted.')
