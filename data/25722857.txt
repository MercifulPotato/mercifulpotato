It isn&#x27;t &#x2F; wasn&#x27;t. You might&#x27;ve missed it, but the USSR wasn&#x27;t exactly a bastion of environmental conscientiousness. This problem is caused by people wanting better lives and &#x2F; or more stuff. This is not a unique property of capitalism, this is a result of humanity at scale. You are confusing correlation with causation. Of course every problem is correlated with capitalism, almost every society on earth is now capitalistic so any problem is &quot;capitalism&#x27;s fault&quot; â€“ except it&#x27;s not, because the problems would still exist with any other economic system we&#x27;ve tried, as is clearly demonstrated by every non-capitalist society that has ever existed which invariably used lots of fossil fuels if they had anywhere near a decent standard of living.<p>You rightly point out this is an energy problem. That is why we need to go full tilt on nuclear. Nuclear can generate vast amounts of energy with near zero CO2 emission and also without requiring vast swaths of land (solar), localized geological features (hydro), etc.<p>Finally, I haven&#x27;t proposed we &quot;solve this with capitalism&quot;. Please go back and re-read my first comment, where I say we need to solve this with:<p>1. Electrify everything.<p>2. Lots of nuclear (fission), with fusion sooner rather than later.<p>3. Carbon capture.<p>Nowhere is capitalism stipulated. Of course, I do actually think capitalism is the way to go, because it is the best system we&#x27;ve ever invented for promoting efficiency, which is obviously a good thing in this discussion. But that was not the point I was making.')
