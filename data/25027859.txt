For his supporters, what he lacks in speaking ability is made up by his ability to plainly state the issues and communicate them without political speak.<p>For instance Biden&#x27;s speech last night was a great speech at face value, but it&#x27;s also a return to the usual platitude-filled politician speak. Trump just identifies problems he see&#x27;s and (sometimes controversially) describes them in a matter of fact way.')
