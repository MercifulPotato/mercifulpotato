If anything it makes things worse, because it lets congress off the hook, and that&#x27;s exactly what happens in the US - lots of congressional powers are abrogated to the executive, which is essentially a monarchy that hasn&#x27;t devolved into a dictatorship simply because of tradition and popular unease at that route - but it&#x27;s really unsafe.<p>The real protection here is that a simple majority can&#x27;t throw out the minorities voice entirely.  But <i>that</i> doesn&#x27;t require the separation of the executive to achieve, it merely requires either a supermajority, and&#x2F;or a differently composed senate (which doesn&#x27;t need to be unrepresentative either, the differing election schedule would suffice, and it doesn&#x27;t even need a veto - an election-cycle delay would be enough).<p>Incidentally, from memory, all sliding-into-dictatorship democracies I can think of did so behind a strong &quot;executive&quot;.  Empirically at least that would suggest that simply not having such a strong executive sounds like a sound protection against despotism.  Intuitively, that would suggest that it&#x27;s pretty hard to rally a country behind a dictatorship that originates in congress; a powerful figurehead matters.  Finally, I&#x27;m not really sure to what extent a constitution really can or should protect against popular despotism - at best it can delay the process; but part of the point of democracy is self-rule; and taking away that rule to avoid despotism also takes it away for other reform - and it&#x27;s not really going to work anyhow, because if enough people want to dump the laws, they will, even if the letter of the law begs to differ.')
