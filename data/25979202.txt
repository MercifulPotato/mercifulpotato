I&#x27;ve never been really satisfied with any software noise reduction system, but this sounds like a phenomenal improvement.<p>Tried installing it on Ubuntu LTS via latest pulseeffects, but it seems like it switched to pipewire 0.3 which is not available yet so I can&#x27;t really run it.<p>My solution so far has been a headset with a boom microphone, like the CoolerMaster MH630 (one of the better boom mics, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;cooler-master&#x2F;mh630" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;cooler-master&#x2F;mh63...</a> for a sound demo at the &quot;Recording quality&quot; section). When it comes to noise reduction, bringing the microphone as close to the mouth as possible is a really good way to get an amazing SNR boost immediately (even for omnidirectional mics). Unfortunately that&#x27;s a pain with large capsule condenser microphones (unless you&#x27;re ready to have a large boom arm hanging about on your desk and accept view obstruction, and you add postprocessing to remove the very bassy proximity effect)<p>Another benefit of headsets with boom mics is consistency (without DSP). No matter how you move, the distance and angle to the microphone is always identical, and therefore the sound is very consistent (save for your own personal loudness)<p>You can of course add DSP (limiter, noise reduction etc) to that, but the better input you provide, the better output you get.')
