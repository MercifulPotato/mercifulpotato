It has a static font of &quot;15px&quot; which is an odd decision since browsers default to a 16px.<p>I would love to see it updated to us em instead.  Since I actually have tweaked my browser settings to by default use a larger font that statically defined pixels don&#x27;t listen to.<p>Once I zoomed the blog to 125% I was able to read it just fine but read it at 133% since it was more comfortable for me.')
