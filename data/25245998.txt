Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606666340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244812, text='&gt; There are indeed theories about a secret organisation plotting to take over the world, and if we were rigourous that&#x27;s the only time we should be talking about &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.<p>No, not really.<p>There is a constant stream of idiotic and entirely baseless and outright irrational conspiracy theories popping up all the time, which is proportional to the amount of stupidity and ignorance in the universe.<p>Take for example the ridiculous conspiracy theory of how &quot;the masked singer&quot; is a psyops project designed to manipulate people into accepting mask usage. No one in their right mind would be pushing that gem of idiocy. But here we are, with lunatics selling that off as true.<p>&gt; (...) It&#x27;s a concept that prevents you from thinking rather than helps you think better.<p>It really isn&#x27;t, and you are not helping your case by trying to shamelessly misrepresent your point and move the goal post.<p>The key aspect that you are trying to disregard and avoid is the fact that conspiracy theories share a common trait: misrepresent baseless assumptions and unfalsifiable assertions as unquestionable facts, no matter how silly or ridiculous or crazy they are.<p>That&#x27;s what separates mere hypothesis or suspicions from  the crazy train which are conspiracy theories: how they push baseless allegations and unverifiable brain farts as undisputable facts.<p>To make matters worse, the loons pushing conspiracy theories use all sort of sociopath tricks to force their conspiracy theories onto others, including but not limited to attacking those who dare point out logic flaws in their craziness.<p>That&#x27;s the touchstone test that separates the conspiracy theory loons living in crazy town from those living in reality which recognize the fact that conspiracies do exist: how facts and hypothesis and proof are treated differently.')
