Which is why they are typically written for libraries and used in application code.<p>For example parametrization and modularization are used to keep code DRY and separated at a functional level.<p>However this can only get you as far as you still write ceremonial repetition around using those functions&#x2F;modules&#x2F;objects. Macros can get your code to that extra level of brevity and clarity.')
