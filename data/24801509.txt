Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=[24801802, 24802948], score=None, time=1602860733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800947, text='&gt; Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water)... Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng&#x2F;kg Escherichia coli endotoxin).<p>&gt;  In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.<p>Sounds like the research is promoting <i>third eye meditation</i> rather than measuring the contribution of each specific technique. Hyperventilation followed by breath holding is what free divers do. Immersion in ice cold water is extremely unpleasant and non-trivial for most people to do regularly. I wonder how the degree of inflammatory response using this technique compares to typical activities like strenuous exercise.')
