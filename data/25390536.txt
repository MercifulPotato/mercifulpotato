I tried writing a basic C like language for it with 16 pointer support (see LDA ($ZP),Y), and came to the haunting realization that function calls require pushing the de-reference of zero page pointers to the stack which change their de-referencing address space from 0-255 (eg. main) to 256-512 for subsequent stack frames.<p>I then realized that at a speed of 1MHz, that the pointer de-referencing, the stack frame magic, and endless copies to just parse basic expressions just made 6502 a pointless target for a C like language.<p>It was fun though.')
