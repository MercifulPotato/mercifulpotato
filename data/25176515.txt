The system was designed and implemented completely differently from today&#x27;s use. The server had fonts and the client asked to get characters drawn. Or arcs. Sending pixels was a big exception for rare cases and it was far too inefficient for the machines of the 1980s and 1990s.<p>Nowadays the main usage is over a little corner case of the protocol and implementation. The bigger part of code is just collecting dust, bitrotting, a maintenance burden, probaby a vector for security attacks (though not very bad ones, because they typically require local access to the workstation computer). For this reason X is being replaced by Wayland for over 10 years. The speed of adoption seems to be &quot;twice as fast as IPv6&quot;... As IPv4 continues to do the work for the majority of Internet usage, X continues to do the work on the majority of Linux desktops.')
