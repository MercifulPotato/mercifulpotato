In a playground full of millionares and billionaires developers are an enabling piece of the puzzle.<p>The rest of the world doesn&#x27;t have such extreme market forces, and there are even subsets of the software market in the US that also can&#x27;t afford to pay at that level because they have more traditional business models.<p>You could say wages for devs in the US are more closely tied to the value they provide to the tech bubble and it&#x27;s inflated economics, not the value they provide to society in traditional business models.<p>This is also why there are more &quot;family owned&quot; style small software companies in the rest of the world. A single SV wage would be more than some companies yearly revenue.')
