Glucose signals your brain to  refill the energy expenditure risk capacity. With ADHD your brain isn&#x27;t normal. It&#x27;s more active, it burns more and has less capacity for risk in energy expenditure (putting off reward). You need a steady stream of fuel. (Not a giant load, slowly sip on some orange juice or even lemonade when you work your brain). Look up Russell Barkley lectures on youtube. He&#x27;s generally regarded an expert in the field.<p>Yo. And check out &#x2F;r&#x2F;adhd! You won&#x27;t learn how to cope there, since everybody just shares their &quot;successful&quot; techniques that they got going for a week ;)\nBut it&#x27;s super helpful to see how other people are like you, that it&#x27;s actually not your fucking fault (pretty much saved my life...), that you&#x27;re not lazy, and so on. ADHD also comes with a burden on your social life, from coming late, being impulsive and too easily aborting friendships (the radicalism on alleged principles, which I mentioned at the learning part) and so on, so it&#x27;s good to untangle all that in the stories of others. Also that sub doesn&#x27;t try to sell you ADHD as a blessing, which is good. You may &quot;benefit&quot; from divergent thinking and creativity at times, which come with the loose and jumpy  focus, but ultimately it&#x27;s a heavy burden, which has a toll on your life and health.<p>Daily exercise lifts your dopamine &quot;base level&quot;.<p>However, if you really got ADHD you  wanna try Ritalin, or Vyvanse. These stimulants work differently in ADHD brains than normal ones. To give you an idea: Some people take a small dose Ritalin right before bed, to calm their thoughts. I was skeptical about meds, but then I read in ADHD these stimulants actually &quot;normalize&quot; the brain as a long term &quot;side effect&quot;. How often do you read that about psycho-pharmaca? They come at cost tho, of course, first medication I got with &quot;sudden death&quot; as a side effect... I also have trouble holding my weight (going too low), which started to scare me a little.')
