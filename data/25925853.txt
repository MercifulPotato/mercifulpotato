This was coined during Nazi time, but also used to describe part of the opposition during socialism in East Germany.<p>What it basically describes people who:<p>- are opposed to the current political system (originally the Nazi regime)<p>- cannot speak their opinion for fear of repressions<p>. cannot or do not want ot leave their country<p>- do not want to adapt to the political system<p>Currently we have inner emmigration among conservatives. It is almost impossible to speak out as a conservative without fearing consequences. People are not revolting, but they are bascially done with the political system.')
