The value would only be justified if Tesla is essentially expected to monopolice the global car market.<p>Tesla doesn&#x27;t have any technological secret sauce. Their battery technology is all from Panasonic, and their self-driving technology is behind Waymo. Other car makers have access to most of the same technology and much more experience mass-producing vehicles. I&#x27;m sure Tesla is worth plenty of money, but not several times Ford.')
