If you have 172.16.10.0&#x2F;24 that you are accessing via a wg peer at 172.16.1.10, then that peer needs to have both the 172.16.1.10&#x2F;32 and the 172.16.10.0&#x2F;24 in that peers allowedips. Then you can set a kernel route of 172.16.10.0&#x2F;24 via 172.16.1.10 an the routing should work correctly.')
