Maybe you think it was!  But they don&#x27;t.<p>Right, and this is the core of the issue. They were. That&#x27;s a fact. You&#x27;re saying &quot;kowtow to people who are unwilling to accept reality and instead grasp onto increasingly violent conspiracy theories&quot;. I don&#x27;t know what to do with that.<p>Conciliatory approaches haven&#x27;t worked, in fact they&#x27;ve made things worse as they&#x27;ve allowed people to further radicalize.<p>&gt; Completely insane people like Lin Wood are now where these people will be getting their information.<p>He was their source of information prior to any deplatforming. They were <i>already</i> only listening to the most insane voices. That&#x27;s how we got here.<p>Removing the most insane elements <i>is</i> deradicalization.
