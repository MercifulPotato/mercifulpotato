A lot of developers use libraries as an excuse to NOT THINK about the issues and ignore their existence not to save work. There&#x27;s a fundamental difference between &quot;I understand the problem and I know that library X will give me a good solution with low amount of work&quot; and &quot;This problem is hard, I&#x27;ll shovel in another library and keep my fingers crossed that it does a good job at it.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s saving work vs. saving thinking.
