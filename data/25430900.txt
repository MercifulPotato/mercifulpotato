It&#x27;s really weird but I started to have an adverse reaction to all the companies that actually advertise and I&#x27;m always on the look out for companies that use few ingredients and in general have no commercials.<p>And this has changed me so much. Even seeing that stereo typical hot-rod style cars that you are clearly described as attracting women - I actively dislike people that show off even. I have never had an FB account.<p>I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m going with this but yeah, cognitive biases and such and controlling people. I guess just trying to say, it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone - not identically and as expected at least.')
