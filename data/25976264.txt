And it’s a 2 way street of dysfunction:<p>- Many fed agencies have little tech savvy or ability to evaluate solutions<p>- Feds can have complex, mandated processes for software procurement, development and deployment that must be followed. This drives up the cost and limits the companies that choose to bid.<p>- There’s not much of a “get sh*t done” attitude. There’s little consequence for the individuals that managed a failure on both sides. Usually “oh well, another day at the office!” is the norm for many federal agencies&#x2F;contractors.<p>- buzzword chasing tech ignorant administrators that consulting firms readily take advantage of - “yes! But does it have machine learning!?”<p>- there’s many fiefs at these agencies that must be navigated: “Oh! Wow - you spent 6 months building and it’s time to deploy? The security team really hates CYZ tech and we’ll have to escalate this to the director”<p>- so many g-d stakeholder to please and woo: from managers to administrators to political appointees and congresspeople. The relationship cost can be staggering.<p>These stereotypes aren’t always the case - some govt groups can actually execute really well. But many of these points dominate sadly.')
