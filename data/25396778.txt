The strains aren’t functionally different, with the possible exception to the one that spilled back over from infected mink which was slightly less responsive to human antibodies in lab experiments. Unless there’s more significant change the vaccine should work for all the different variants.<p>EDIT- Be careful reading too far into statements like “XYZ mutation makes it easier to bond to ACE2 therefore it’s more contagious” Infection is more than just binding to a receptor, even if lower quality preprints jump the gun in their conclusions')
