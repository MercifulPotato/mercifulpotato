These are for reference.  Whenever I&#x27;m in the mood to check for delivery slots (which have become scarce), I click through each of them, login and check if there&#x27;s a viable delivery slot available.  The set of tabs is a reference to remind me of the list of 10 or so shops to check periodically.    I might forget some of them otherwise, because they are not all ones I use regularly; they are only in the list to improve my chances when slots become hard to obtain.<p>Then I&#x27;ll use the same tabs for convenience rather than reference.  Muscle memory and visual location.  If I found a slot, I might place an order in stages over a few days (one to book the slot, then adding items over the coming days if I realise I need something, finally to amend the order to fit my needs shortly before the delivery date).  Then it&#x27;s useful to have the tabs in use in a convenient location.  Their visibility as a pinned tab also serves as a reminder until the shopping is finished (typically ~3-12 days) in case I forget to amend the order.<p>I have a similar thing going on with financial institutions.  I have about 20 of these in use, counting both personal and business use (I run accounts of two businesses), banks, credit cards, and tax pages.  From time to time I&#x27;ll want to peruse them and check in on balances and pending tasks, occasionally download a statement.  Then it&#x27;s useful to have a list in one place, similar to with shops.  without a list I&#x27;d probably miss one.<p>Both of the above could in theory be replaced by bookmarks, but there&#x27;s a bunch of UX reasons why bookmarks don&#x27;t work so well.  One of them is that we really need a &quot;live bookmarks folder&quot; for each group.  If I open another shop&#x2F;institution tab, I need that to remain in the &quot;persistent&quot; set by default.  Using a normal bookmark group, I&#x27;d open the group as tabs, then half an hour after I open something else, I&#x27;d have to remember to add that extra item to the bookmark group, and just that item.  But after an hour of browsing and having visited maybe 250 pages, I&#x27;m likely to forget which open tabs are already in a bookmark group and which one&#x27;s aren&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s too much work to step through and compare item by item by hand when I&#x27;m done and need to move to another task, so I end up taking new &quot;snapshot&quot; bookmark groups rather than managing the existing bookmark set.  This gets messy fast.  In practice it&#x27;s easier to just keep a set of tabs open, and delete the ones which are no longer required.<p>Also in my tabs are the articles (many from HN) that I collect into a knowledge base.  Tabs aren&#x27;t a great way to save these, but neither are bookmarks.  Ideally I&#x27;d want something that saves them with tags and brief notes.  For now, I send tabs from my active window over to a dedicate HN window, where they form a long queue of things to go through in a systematic batch at some point and group, sort, categorise, filter, and take notes on the salient points I want proper notes on.  They are a kind of research multi-queue.  You could think of them as a set of about 50 long-term tasks that are likely to take years to produce the results I want (which are for actual tech developments, not reminiscence).  From time to time I&#x27;m tempted to batch convert these to bookmarks, but doing so makes them unusable because it loses scroll position and text highlight, so it&#x27;s labour intensive having to take notes instead.  I guess people use &quot;web clipper&quot; software for this kind of task.  I haven&#x27;t found something I&#x27;m happy with yet, but I haven&#x27;t tried much either.  I wouldn&#x27;t be happy locking so much long term research into proprietary software though.  On my phone, I use &quot;Share to Orgzly&quot; to capture such things, rather than tabs.')
