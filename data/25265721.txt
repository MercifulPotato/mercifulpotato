These insanely expensive defense projects are wealth transfer programs that make contractors like Lockhead and their many sub-contractors rich, and also create jobs in these communities.<p>I agree with this.  I&#x27;ve been saying for years that our military programs are giant socialist jobs programs in disguise (that unfortunately have the side effect of propping up the military industrial complex).  If we were honest with ourselves and re-allocated that money to actual jobs programs we would get a much better ROI.  Given the obscene amount of resources wasted we could reallocate a significant chunk of it without hurting our military preparedness one bit.')
