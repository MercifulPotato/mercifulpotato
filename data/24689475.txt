There are 7 billion people on the planet. Even if you organized to have enough Americans self sacrifice (needlessly) why would you ever expect the rest of the world, in particular the developing world who are trying to raise their living standards, to do the same?<p>This is not a solution. It’s dead on arrival but it keeps getting rolled out. End this distraction. The year is 2020. Forty years ago France decarbonized its grid in a decade using serialized production of nuclear power. We know how to do this. There is a solution that we have done. We know how it works. It doesn’t require some impossible utopia of self sacrificing humans. Everyone can keep turning on the lights and running their heaters.')
