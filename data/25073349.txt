Literally too cause a lot of games have been ported to iOS and now you can easily run them on Macs that were not possible before (Final Fantasy franchise for example). People can now play PUBG (although the mobile version but still). Fortnite (which have been removed but if you have downloaded it before you can still play it). And so many other games. I think the whole thing is not just a step but a huge leap forward. I really wonder what the future holds, just looking at the performance of the M1 chips. Wishful thinking but the fact that the Switch is also on the ARM platform I hope we will see more games on Mac. This feels like the 2007 iPhone moment again.')
