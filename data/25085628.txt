That fact though doesn&#x27;t make them less valueable, relevant or required  for the free society to function.<p>May be for you it&#x27;s not even crazy to regulate what kind of paper person uses for own notes because who knows, may be he will bring those notes to the public one day. But for me this communist and totalitarian way of disrespect to personal rights and freedoms is crossing the red line. I&#x27;ve been in such situations and I saw in person the results of such disrespect therefore I think those who are willing to attack personal freedoms should learn some history and shouldn&#x27;t be surprised about what people can do to protect their freedoms when words do not work.')
