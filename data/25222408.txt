The second only matters if you have actual parallel signal flows, which many people do not. The third is only possible if you run JACK2 in non-sync mode, which adds an extra cycle of latency.<p>JACK1&#x27;s continuing benefits over JACK2:<p><pre><code>   * integration of a2jmidid so no need to use separate tools to make MIDI devices visible\n   * integration of zita-a2j making it easy to use multiple audio devices from a single JACK instance\n</code></pre>\nI believe that Filipe, the current maintainer of both JACK versions, plans to unify these features.')
