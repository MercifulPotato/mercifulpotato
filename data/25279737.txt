Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=[25281120], score=None, time=1606934410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279397, text='&gt;<i>Starlink will never() directly compete with most of the in-ground Internet providers.</i><p>It only has to compete with in-ground Internet providers that don&#x27;t provide internet in-ground. There are a lot of them.<p>StarLink will do for the Internet what satellite dishes did for TV and radio in many, many parts of the world that only had access to government controlled broadcasts. Satellite dishes allowed these people to have access to other cultures and become aware of things their governments were hiding from them.<p>The reason I say StarLink is underrated is that SpaceX is a U.S. company providing internet from space. Pretty hard for a government body, or a government, to control this. Even if they try, there definitely <i>will</i> be a black market for the receivers and people <i>will</i> get them where they need them. There <i>will</i> be customs agent who will take a bribe from someone importing them illegally.<p>That&#x27;s without even addressing the fact that some governments spy on their citizens and arrest them. Granted, nothing guarantees that a StarLink customer won&#x27;t have U.S. intelligence deep packet inspect the heck of their traffic, but the bigger threat for these people is their own government, and serious jail time for nothing. The lesser of two evils will play a role in adoption.')
