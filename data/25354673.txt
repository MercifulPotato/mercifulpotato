Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607481574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349847, text='&gt; I think these studies are all significantly flawed because successful people with dark personality traits learn to cover up their dark traits.<p>Disagree, people like Napoleon, Stalin, Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton, Putin,Zuckerberg,etc were highly succesful and very high in dark personality traits. If anything I find very difficult to find a highly succesful or powerful person who does not have them. I read once an article about Angela Merkel (A politician widely regarding as one of the good ones, a dove) it was eye opening, she is ruthless, she back-stabbed her long-time mentor and crushed her political enemies with no remorse.')
