He wants you to know how much power he has.  He wants you to remember that, even though you voted him out, he can still spoil the party.  This is about his ego and his power.  He has an army, and that army can shutdown the government.<p>It&#x27;s sad to see people enabling him.  He won&#x27;t win.  The nation is stronger.  He probably thinks he&#x27;s winning right now though.')
