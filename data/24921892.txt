Architecture is your opportunity to choose which problems will be easy and which problems will be hard. For example, a microservices architecture makes HA easy but global consistency and data locality&#x2F;caching hard. A centralized database architecture is the mirror image.<p>The article discusses architecture in the abstract, which sounds more like a programming model or paradigm (OOP, functional, actor model, imperative), or maybe a pattern.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be weird to discuss building architecture in the abstract, without a notion of the site to build on or the purpose of the building?')
