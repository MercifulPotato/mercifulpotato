Item(by='basch', descendants=None, kids=[24758650], score=None, time=1602529229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757134, text='&gt;prioritizing economic health<p>I sense that everyone fairly well off sort of ignores how quickly poor economic health translates into poor social and biological health.  We like to act like the economy is this nice to have extra that can shut down, and everything will go on as normal, except our luxuries.  But then you realize, you cant shut down ports, railroads, roads, trucking, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Target, every grocery store.  And suddenly all the interconnected everything requires all the software companies to stay running.  All the power companies.  They all need their supplies.<p>&gt;we cannot go full &quot;save every possible life&quot;<p>Where is the calculation of life lost or years lost of lifespan, because the economy wasn&#x27;t there to support life.<p>&gt;thus the term &quot;flatten the curve&quot;<p>I understood the context of flatten the curve to be in that we needed to buy time to prepare hospitals, manufacturing, and as a tool to prevent ICU overflow.  It&#x27;s now been co-opted to be used in a &quot;until the vaccine&quot; sort of way, which is not how it was used initially.  You can see how people might have agreed with it before, but not now, and still have a consistent unchanging view (its the usage around their view that changed.)  It&#x27;s also very frustrating to hear rate statistics used out of context, as if the instantaneous rate is what matters, without the understanding that their denominator, time, extends into the future, and with part of the denominator in the future, the numerator is not very useful.')
