Guess what, the media isn’t either, so I don’t know how they can keep claiming this election is accurate before everything is investigated and audited.<p>Not to mention the really weird things happening like states deciding it’s not important to verify signatures. Sure they might have passed laws before the election that makes it legal to not check signatures, but does it make it right? I don’t think so.')
