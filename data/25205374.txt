M1 is simply making that more efficient by doing retain-release faster. But I agree that should not change total memory usage.<p>But I think in general you could say  that Apple has focused more on optimizing their OS for memory usage than the competition may have done. Android uses Java which eats memory like crazy and I suspect C# is not that much better being a managed and garbage collected language. Not sure how much .NET stuff is used on Windows, but I suspect a lot.<p>macOS in contrast is really dominated by Objective-C and Swift which does not use these memory hungry garbage collection schemes, nor require JIT compilation which also eats memory.')
