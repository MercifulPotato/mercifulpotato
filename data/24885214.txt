It won&#x27;t last 10k years anyway. If nothing else, the glass will probably degrade over a long enough period of time. There&#x27;s also a constant chance of a freak mutation destroying the equilibrium of the system.<p>In outer space, cosmic rays will make this process faster. Also, in outer space, it will need a constant source of light for biological reactions, and also just to keep from slowly cooling down to 0k through heat emission.')
