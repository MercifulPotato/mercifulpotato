I&#x27;ll try and give some answer from the point of view of a Swede who is a serious &quot;USPhile&quot; in many ways (and someone who in his younger days wanted to move there).<p>- Parental Leave: When I got my first child it&#x27;s hard to understate how much being able to be off work for 8 months with ~80% of my full pay. I&#x27;m now going off for 6 months with my second child in February. And I can save up parental leave for a long time meaning I can take longer vacations to spend summers with them as well.<p>- Healthcare: Again once you have experienced the true value of universal healthcare you will not want to go back. My second son go a bad infection and had to spend 2 weeks in the hospital with his mother. Cost (excluding what we paid in taxes of course...): 20-30 bucks for buying candy (i.e it could have been 0 ;)).<p>- Education: All higher education is of course free for all EU citizens. It used to be free for everyone in the world but the unfortunately removed that a few years ago.<p>- The everymans right: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_to_roam#Sweden" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_to_roam#Sweden</a><p>There&#x27;s of course a lot more one could point out (like for example high speed internet access pretty much everywhere, good mobile connection speed pretty much everywhere).<p>Of course this comes with a cost of paying more in taxes (happy to do it!). I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of snow as well.')
