I&#x27;m not sure what gave you that idea in this thread.<p>I think you misunderstood me there. Of course permission systems are going to stay, who in their right mind would give up this crucial innovation?<p>But free-as-in-freedom implies that I, the owner and user, can do whatever I want, including triggering all sorts of footguns – if I get tricked into installing CriminalBankrobberApp and giving it all sorts of permissions because I believe it legitimately needs those and won&#x27;t abuse them, it&#x27;s game over. A non-free iOS can simply make this impossible or so inconvenient that I&#x27;ll never bother – an app that actively attacks banking apps on my device wouldn&#x27;t even get on the App Store I guess – but I don&#x27;t think a free-as-in-freedom iOS could possibly keep that sort of tight control, not with a 30%-of-revenue economic incentive for everyone else to normalize arbitrary distribution channels.<p>&gt; That doesn&#x27;t mean that it shouldn&#x27;t be possible to install through different avenues as well (still requiring the users permission).<p>How does the user know what avenues are safe and what aren&#x27;t? Isn&#x27;t this just a rehash of downloading software from arbitrary websites, just with lots of app stores instead?<p>&gt; but the apple store quality would probably increased significantly, because they could deny significantly more apps<p>And lots and lots of others, big names too, would decide to forgo the App Store entirely (even assuming some loss of visibility, those are some really easily-earned (30-x)% in revenue!), so you&#x27;d end up with an Epic store and a Steam store and a EA store and a Facebook store and an app store for each media outlet (NYT Recipes now at the NYT App Store!) and possibly for each bank and national app stores and regional app stores and a CoolBeansAppStore with neat UI tweaks and skins and a SuperDuperAppStore with all sorts of small indy apps and a SuperSecureAppStore that distributes copies of other apps with added tracking and tons of Indydev Inc App Stores, and FreeXXXAppStore that has some well-known copyright-agnostic porn apps and absolutely no rules at all and all kinds of malware and scams... pretty much like the internet back then, but with much leakier sandboxes, because there are lots of things apps must be able to do if allowed to that websites pretty much never need(ed?) to do ...<p>And good luck with crafting a permission system that makes all of this really transparent and clear and actionable and still isn&#x27;t a huge hassle that everyone just clicks through and works even for disinterested, impatient laypeople ... That&#x27;s reducing the depth of security to pretty much this single thing that people hate in its current form already.<p>I mean, really, I am sometimes struggling to tell what&#x27;s safe and what isn&#x27;t on the web, and I should tell, I&#x27;m building some of the stuff that&#x27;s on the web – how is someone who&#x27;s busy being a lawyer, or is elderly and kinda struggling with the latest generation of gadgets, or a stressed-out parent with zero time for ITSec studies on top, or 15 years old, etc. pp. supposed to make that call that in a similarly confusing environment, on similarly bad data – possibly worse data.<p>The only reason this works on Android so far is probably that the UX of using other stores or sideloading is so bad; some have tried to establish their own, but churn is just too brutal for next to everyone.<p>I&#x27;m not saying free and open mobile platforms cannot be done, or that there&#x27;s absolutely no way to open up iOS without wreaking havoc, and I&#x27;m definitely not saying that wouldn&#x27;t be really worthwhile, because I think it would be absolutely fantastic to have an open and free mobile platform – but I believe that&#x27;s going to be much, much more difficult than just throwing out all the restrictions and calling it a day, because we&#x27;ve been there in the early internet and security-wise it was an absolute nightmare.')
