If a background music player can get one or two slow background cores while you&#x27;re using your device for some heavy workload you&#x27;ll see fewer context switches and better optimized L1 cache for your main task.<p>My computer has 12 cores but runs 118 processes even when idle. Phones probably run maybe half that, but even still a high core count for even sub-gigahertz cores could bring a noticeable benefit if the OS&#x27;s scheduling algorithm would be able to optimize for them.')
