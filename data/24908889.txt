I actually really like them, because if you use them well, they can be helpful for visually parsing through a bunch of pages quickly. You can use them as kind of &quot;categories&quot; (e.g.: :ladybug: for pages&#x2F;database items that are about bugs) or to delineate which pages in a set of them are for different things while having to look at the least amount of information. (e.g.: :tear-off calendar: for calendar&#x2F;todos&#x2F;meetings, :desktop computer: for technical articles maybe, etc.)<p>Emojis that are more for adding flavor to conversations would be more stuff like: :shrug:, :thumbs up:, or :D. Though even there the thumbs up could potentially be used as a quick signal of approval in some way in tickets or documentation or whatever else. Visual aids are honestly great! I think they should be embraced more, though not going too far because little aids are helpful but tons and tons of stuff all over the place can get messy. As with pretty much everything, moderation is extremely helpful.<p>EDIT: HN seems to have eaten my emojis? Adding in text bits to the original post to indicate what I was trying to use.')
