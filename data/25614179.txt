The subtext here is that European workers can&#x27;t be paid more because of overhead of various public services, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. If there were a few big European companies closely located that were hiring as much as SV tech hired, I think wages would go up. Not matching US salaries, but some.<p>I really don&#x27;t know anything, but I guess Germany where I would expect that to happen. If some self driving car related company funded by idk, BMW or Siemens or someone tried to scale up really fast.
