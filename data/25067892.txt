I think SEO is to blame as well.. For instance, if I search something like “avoid pressure to succeed”, search engines return lots of blog posts like “why millenials feel more pressure to succeed”, “dealing with pressure to succeed in high school”, etc. etc., but none of those are real first-person experiences..<p>It took me some time to notice that I wasn’t getting anything out of these web searches, so now I look for things such as “avoid pressure to succeed hacker news” so I can read first-person experiences from comments in hn.<p>Basically, hacker news is the only website that I still think I can get something out of it.<p>For things like programming languages, I believe that it’s better to find the best 1&#x2F;2 books and read them instead of disjoint blog posts..')
