Everyone has seen a wish ad by now - at this point there are only 2 segments: those willing to give it a shot, and those who have decided not to.  If those that were in the first camp don&#x27;t keep buying because the experience is terrible then you are spending progressively more to try and convert that second camp as things go on.  I don&#x27;t think they have a future-secure business model.<p>edit: a quick review of their s1 shows they spend 100% of their profit on marketing, and that aside from coronavirus bump they have not grown either in margins or growth since 2018.')
