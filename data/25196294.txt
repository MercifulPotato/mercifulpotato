But shipping of $11 (though looks like I accidentally selected courier shipping so it&#x27;s more like $50) brings it up closer to parity with the TS-100 kits you can get on Amazon for the TS100s.<p>I&#x27;m still really excited about the Pinecil though!  I don&#x27;t solder a lot, so I&#x27;m looking forward to having a quick kit I can whip out instead of my whole toolbox of soldering tools with my ancient but trusty Weller.')
