But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that simple.<p>In Massachusetts, we&#x27;ve been wearing masks, consistently since May 6th (as per governor&#x27;s order).  Our case numbers over the summer had been &quot;ok&quot;, but not great (despite being 3rd in the world per capital bad in April).   We&#x27;ve never been anywhere near close to &quot;zero&quot; as Melbourne is now seeing after their lockdown and I think we&#x27;ve only had maybe 1 day with 0 deaths since March.  Now we&#x27;re back over 1K new cases per day, 3x what it was 2 weeks ago and it looks like it&#x27;ll keep going up.<p>Our lockdown in March-June was actually pretty complete, it wasn&#x27;t troops-on-the-street &#x2F; roadblocks, but almost everything was closed and the reality was there was literally no-where to go and absolutely nothing to do.  People just stayed home.  We may never had an official curfew here, but again the reality is there&#x27;s no one out and about after 9pm anyway (even now).<p>Today, we still have universal masking in public, significant restrictions on office occupancy, indoor dining, gyms etc., most schools are either hybrid or remote.  We lead the country in testing capacity and we currently have 2000 contact tracers in MA according to MA-DHHS Sec. Sudders.  We also have some of the very best health care in the world and in general a well educated populace.<p>So how did it go so wrong in MA and so right for Melbourne? (good on you guys in Victoria btw, well done!).<p>Asking for ... a &quot;friend&quot;.')
