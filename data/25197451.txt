My battery levels are still at 100% although I know that is not a reliable indication.<p>One thing to note with the new model, the Bluetooth messages are encrypted and a device bindkey is needed to read the temperature values. Fortunately there is a great project over at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atc1441.github.io&#x2F;TelinkFlasher.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atc1441.github.io&#x2F;TelinkFlasher.html</a> which can pair with the device and retrieve a bindkey from within the web browser. Then you just need to plug the bind key and MAC address into ESPhome and you&#x27;re good to go.')
