More than 2 seconds sounds pretty unreasonable to me (possibly should be even less), for a service that is willing to no-op give up when there is no network. Someone would have to do some reverse engineering&#x2F;debugging maybe by observing&#x2F;manipulating network traffic to be sure what is going on there, unless Apple wants to tell us but I suspect the suspicious wouldn&#x27;t believe them.<p>Missing or too-high timeout should be fixed, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;d be enough to to satisfy critics in this thread? Would it you?<p>[Not setting a timeout on a network request is a common bug in, say, web development. It does make me lose some confidence in Apple&#x27;s technical abilities if they make that bug in a place with such high consequences. But that&#x27;s different than ill-intent or a privacy violation]<p>People seem to object to the basic idea of OCSP, which I think means objecting to the basic idea of app signing.<p>App signing seems reasonable to me (although it is important to me there be a way for users to choose to launch un-signed apps; there still is in MacOS).  And OCSP seems important part of a app signing implementation. Improvements to the particular OCSP implementation for both privacy and performance may be advisable though.')
