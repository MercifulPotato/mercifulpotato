Indeed, in my experience too <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;lisp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;lisp&#x2F;</a> and Freenode #lisp channels have active and supportive CL communities.<p>• 89% use SBCL. This is not surprising. SBCL has been the most popular Common Lisp implementation for a long time.<p>• 48% are 32 years old or younger. This is going to help the CL community to stay active for, I believe, at least another 20 years and perhaps even beyond that if the community can attract more programmers to this language. It is a beautiful language that is a joy to program in, so I do wonder why it isn&#x27;t more popular.<p>• 31% are from the US. Countries like China, India, Netherlands, Poland, etc. have less than 3% respondents to the survey.<p>Incidentally, a bunch of us from Freenode IRC are doing a Common Lisp Programming Challenge this month. The objective is to help beginners get started with learning the language while being a part of a community. You don&#x27;t have to join Freenode IRC to join the challenge.
