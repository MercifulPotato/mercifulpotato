It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with how companies or private citizens respond to your words.<p>You&#x27;re (usually) legally allowed to say you&#x27;ll fuck my mom but I don&#x27;t have to bring you over for family dinner.<p>One could contend that apple&#x27;s refusal to host this app on it&#x27;s store is in itself free speech.<p>Either way, the government jasent gotten involved so nothing here treads on free speech issues.')
