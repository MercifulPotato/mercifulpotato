We have one dedicated Mac, and about 5 VMs on a second Mac that we use for building our software. Keeping everything up to date is a pain.<p>So if we could just rent Mac VMs that would be nice. But this is pretty much useless. You get only a single machine for a really high price.<p>Theoretically I could run VMWare on the rented machine, to run multiple virtual copies of macOS, but then I&#x27;d be doing all the maintenance that I don&#x27;t want to do.')
