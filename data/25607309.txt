I know this is Conor Mcgregor&#x27;s approach, he&#x27;s very much systems over goals (in Adam&#x27;s vein, and explicitly so) but is deliberate about the specific talent stack he&#x27;s working towards. Ironically it is all done towards a specific goal (to be the best fighter) although the path towards that goal is underspecified.<p>Here&#x27;s a very common talent stack here on HN that works pretty well: math + CS + data science + one domain (e.g. finance or biology).')
