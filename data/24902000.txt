What confused some people is that the old website for the semi-free JDK is now for Oracle support customers who pay for support (even though that page directs non-customers to the free version) and Oracle provides the free JDK over at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;</a>')
