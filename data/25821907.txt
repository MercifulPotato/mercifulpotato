I&#x27;ve got a friend who isn&#x27;t allowed to drive a car because of bad corneas. He also got repeatedly rejected when trying to apply for a donor organ, because he is still far from blind, so his inability to drive is classified as a comparatively mild inconvenience. I&#x27;d just have thought that someone who actually <i>is</i> effectively blind would be able to get one. I&#x27;m sure my friend will be thrilled to hear about this development, he&#x27;s been waiting for something like this for years, nay decades! When production ramps up he might finally be able to get his full eyesight back!')
