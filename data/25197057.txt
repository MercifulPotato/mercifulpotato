Case closed! Until the Epstein story happened, Clinton&#x27;s name was on the flight list several times, and the media acted in actual unison by ignoring this case.<p>Er, the Epstein and Clinton connection first arose <i>before</i> Pizzagate, and it covered in the mainstream media. It then arose again when Epstein was charged the last time, and even more widely reported by the mainstream media. And it arose <i>again</i> very recently in the context of the Ghislaine Maxwell case, and, is <i>right now</i> being extensively covered in the mainstream media. This isn&#x27;t a matter of cherry-picking facts to spin a conspiracy theory around and just ignoring facts that contradict the theory, it&#x27;s inventing false facts to justify a conspiracy theory (which is then used to place blame for belief in <i>other</i> conspiracy theories.)')
