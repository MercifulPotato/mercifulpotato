Their answer: &quot;the window object&quot;. a) Yeah, okay, if your code only runs in the browser. But not nodejs. And b) if anyone uses a top-level &quot;this&quot; it&#x27;s an instant reject in code review from me.<p>Ultimately, a lot of these interviewers are waving huge warning flags saying &quot;stay away!&quot;<p>Even FAANG. Every single algorithm there is a &quot;trick&quot; to it. Once you memorize that trick, every leetcode becomes trivial. But it took a guy like Knuth some 30 fucking years to come up with that &quot;trick&quot;. It&#x27;s so goddamn stupid memorizing bubble sort when every language has a built in sort you&#x27;re going to use. And if you ever see a developer writing their own algorithm for bubble sort at work, you&#x27;re going to think something is wrong with this person. What the fuck are you doing guy? You&#x27;re going to get it wrong and there is a library for all of this, used by thousands of people with hundreds of bug fixes.')
