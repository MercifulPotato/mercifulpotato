Both bookmarks as well as\npersistent tabs are not something you&#x27;d use in incognito mode.\nAlso, if you use incognito mode for anything that should survive\na crash you&#x27;re probably using it wrong. Firefox and Chrome let\nyou use separate profiles for a reason.<p>&gt; 300 tabs! I guess there is nothing more to discuss.<p>No need to be condescending. Especially not considering a few\nyears ago I also thought it&#x27;s crazy. Truth is, it&#x27;s simply how\nbookmarks should have been designed from the start. If you\ndisagree that doesn&#x27;t bother me, but your point about browser\ncrashes is still not accurate.')
