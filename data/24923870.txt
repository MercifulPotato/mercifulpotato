As far as I know, your OS doesn&#x27;t need to recognise the root certificate to authenticate yourself towards a web-server, the web-server needs to know it.<p>At least when I was working with client certificates, I was working with a self-signed one, and I didn&#x27;t need to register my CA, I just dropped it with the web-server, which was doing the validation.<p>I tried it now with a MacOS, and the certificate is marked as not trusted, but I can present it to the server, and it validates it.<p>&gt; Indeed, the &quot;personal&quot; certificate is invalidated each 4 years and you have to visit the police to get a new one.<p>As I read it, you can renovate it online 60 days before expiry: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sede.fnmt.gob.es&#x2F;en&#x2F;certificados&#x2F;persona-fisica&#x2F;renovar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sede.fnmt.gob.es&#x2F;en&#x2F;certificados&#x2F;persona-fisica&#x2F;...</a><p>Also rather with the AEAT, if you prefer.')
