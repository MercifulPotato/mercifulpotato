I do think cultures do exist and have an impact even after they&#x27;ve lost their community (ie, how the great works from hellenistic culture and Roman culture continued to influence later scholars in the west), but you&#x27;re right that they must ultimately be able to co-exist and progress with their own community to be relevant. That said, I happen to think that NC Culture has managed to progress and has the capacity to remain meaningful.<p>The fact that our culture is young and highly syncretic (as many cultures are) does not delegitimize it at all. The Scottish have an influence over certain elements - but so do the descendants of various African cultures, the English, German Moravian settlers, and local tribes like the Cherokee. It doesn&#x27;t matter when my ancestors first decided that the label of &quot;North Carolinian&quot; suffices to encompass all that and more - it just matters that it happened - or rather, it matters that we believed it happened and acted accordingly.<p>As far as impact the US Senate can make on the state of NC, here are a few I can think of:<p>- Federal laws about cigarette labeling were very impactful to NC, since our tobacco industry was historically a huge piece of economy (and it remains significant today, though not as powerful).<p>- Laws that relate to climate change and rising sea levels - The NC outer banks is a fragile ecosystem and is already eroding.<p>- Funding for interstate transportation infrastructure - which cities should have priority to be put on future interstate routes? This is huge for tourism.<p>- Rural Broadband expansion - there are parts on the NC mountains, such as where my grandparents live, that STILL don&#x27;t have high speed internet connection. In fact, the crazy pants representative my district just elected (Madison Cawthorn), despite being a &quot;small government republican&quot;, made rural broadband core to his platform - because it&#x27;s that important here. If NC can ally with other states that have underserved populations on this, then maybe we can get an &quot;internet new deal&quot;.<p>Fwiw, your examples of Texans being Texan first, and American second is exactly the norm in the south that I&#x27;m talking about. I didn&#x27;t even grow up in a particularly southern-culture dominant part of the south, but I only lasted for 5 years in Seattle before I got my behind back to NC. It wasn&#x27;t just that I missed the trappings of home (though I did), but I still felt that I couldn&#x27;t relate to how most people there were thinking and acting, and I felt like an outsider. I could have tried harder to change myself to be more like them I guess, but I don&#x27;t think I would have liked myself as much. The other part of it was, the state of NC played such a big role in making me who I am - that I do feel that I have the duty to help NC as well.<p>I totally see what you&#x27;re getting at and respect it - but it&#x27;s just not in line with how I&#x27;m tuned to operate. As I said before, I&#x27;m probably just a hopeless idealist :)')
