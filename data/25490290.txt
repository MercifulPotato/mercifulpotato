Item(by='dotancohen', descendants=None, kids=[25492159], score=None, time=1608504176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490209, text='<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt; There exists a medical controversy over the effects of MSG.\n\n  &gt; Thatâ€™s not true.\n</code></pre>\nOf course it&#x27;s true. Otherwise why would the fine article exist?<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt; most potent yet least expensive flavour enhancers available\n\n  &gt; Salt is approx 1&#x2F;4 the price, as is sugar.\n</code></pre>\nBoth of which are also overused in the American food industry. Every new tool (flavour enhancer) enables the creation of new snacks. Do you think that Doritos would be as popular if they were all salt and no MSG?<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve inadvertently done the double-blind &quot;Is MSG harmful&quot; test too many times\n\n  &gt; Cheese, tomatoes, it would be hard to avoid it. What kind of restrictions do you need to follow?\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t eat cheese anyway, so I didn&#x27;t even know that cheese is an issue. I do eat small amounts of tomatoes, and have never associated tomatoes with symptoms, but from what I&#x27;ve read here it&#x27;s &quot;heirloom tomatoes&quot; that are maybe problematic? The tomatoes that I eat are pretty much water packaged in a red skin, mostly out of Turkey. My country does not have &quot;Chineese restaurants&quot; like those in the US, but any restaurant that I go to I have to specifically talk to the person preparing the food to ensure that I won&#x27;t get MSG. Of course snacks such as Doritos are right out. Soup powders are the absolute worst, and are sometimes hard to avoid when eating at friends&#x27; houses.<p>My children are not sensitive, and I don&#x27;t know anybody else who claims to be MSG sensitive. I&#x27;m sure that MSG is fine for the vast majority of people, just like gluten is fine for the vast majority of people. In fact, I know a few people who claim gluten intolerance who I serious doubt are celiac based on the things that I see them eat.')
