I&#x27;ve got no problems dropping 1200 on a phone when I know it doesn&#x27;t have ads, yet that&#x27;s slowly not the case with iPhones anymore. I&#x27;ve got a bunch of my own recordings on my laptop I want to listen to on my phone, yet the only solution Apple has is for me to subscribe to a paid service (Apple music&#x2F;iTunes whatever) or <i>use a USB cable and manually copy the music to my phone</i>. Then when listening to said recordings on my phone, the music player tries to upsell me with Apple Music.<p>Or Apple TV+ - I&#x27;ve already got the subscription, yet half of the stuff it shows me on the front page is actually movies I still need to pay extra for, and you don&#x27;t find out until you try to watch the movie in question.')
