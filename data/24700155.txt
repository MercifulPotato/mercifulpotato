But – there is always a but – I also dislike some other things:<p>Fix procedure signatures → Why is there &#x27;remove&#x27; and &#x27;delete&#x27;? Scheme is not statically typed, but strangely enough, this fact in not exploited often. There should be only one word with the meaning &quot;delete&quot; in the programming language.<p>Fix argument positioning → The order should always be: proc-name, main-object, arguments... Ideally one should be able to guess the name and arguments of a procedure.<p>Fix procedure names → Some procedure names are too long or have strange names. List procedures should have a list- prefix, only Transducers or generic procedures should have no prefix.<p>Also maybe stop supporting a :key argument and design everything to use lenses to target sub-structures.<p>Some handy general purpose procedures are missing here and there, so an improved prelude should come with them, too. I don&#x27;t want to import multiple string&#x2F;list&#x2F;whatever-libraries to handle a task. The nice thing about Scheme is, all of this is doable.')
