You&#x27;re right that it wasn&#x27;t exposed by conspiracy nuts, but that&#x27;s because it was a real thing and the people with flimsy evidence were ignored.  That it wasn&#x27;t exposed by people with flimsy evidence is my point.  In a different context and with different laws they would have the circulated the story and it would have gained attention, credibility, and scrutiny.  There is a reason why &quot;Grooming gangs&quot; are common in the UK compared to the US.  I think the suppression of speech is one of those reasons.<p>It&#x27;s basically gaslighting to praise the work of the government by saying &quot;It was exposed by real investigative journalism and law enforcement work&quot;.  Absolutely not.  Multiple victims reported it to the government and were turned away.  The government and journalists ignored it for decades.  That&#x27;s hardly &quot;real investigative work&quot;.  The government and journalists managed to detect the organized rape of hundreds of children after only 30 years!<p>The other reason to bring up Rotterham is to point out that conspiracies like this aren&#x27;t purely fantasy.  Sometimes the government is involved in the organized rape of children.  Prohibiting people from talking about the possibility because you feel their evidence is insufficient is not a trade off I think should be made.')
