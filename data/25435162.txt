Less than 10% of the community is in SVâ€”it&#x27;s all over the world and has tons of different &quot;very specific parts of wider society&quot;. That&#x27;s one reason why people argue so much about this stuff. If you think the HN community is SV-friendly or even startup-friendly, it may surprise you that many people in those communities feel like it&#x27;s exactly the other way around.')
