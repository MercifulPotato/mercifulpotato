Even payloads lower than the constellation (and there aren&#x27;t many) would only see very small beams, and would pass through them quickly. And the laser system, I think you&#x27;d basically have to be co-orbital with them to work.<p>That would be a better product for the traditional GEO comsat operators, but apparently there&#x27;s not enough market there for them to bother. NASA already has a system for that, TDRS. I wonder how busy it is nowadays?')
