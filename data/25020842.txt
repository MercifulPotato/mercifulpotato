Pulling demographic data like that is challenging and we should all take it with grains of salt.<p>But you and I are not having the same type of argument that Trump is having.  You are taking a reasoned and skeptical position.  Trump is not.  Trump is not going in front of his rallies and saying, &quot;While the evidence doesn&#x27;t yet support it, I believe for this and that reason that Mexico is sending rapists and such across the border.&quot;  As far as Trump is concerned, no research is required.  He already somehow knows, and he knows with such certainty that he will happily make unmoderated statements to thousands of people, over and over.  To him it is self evident that the Mexican illegal immigrants are largely rapists and assaultive criminals.  If he paid attention to the same evidence you do, he would moderate his statements--which he does not.<p>That fundamental disconnect with factual or consensual reality is why I find Trump abhorrent.')
