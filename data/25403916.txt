That&#x27;s why we talk about atomic physics, astrophysics, dynamics, optics, nuclear physics, quantum physics, and for that matter, chemistry, and inorganic chemistry.  Each of these is a discipline with its own nomenclature and epistemology that enable practitioners to home in on the elements they study in sufficient detail, with an efficiency of language.<p>Similarly, politics.<p>To answer the question, what is your hourly rate of pay and why is it so, we have to turn to politics.  Physics won&#x27;t help us, nor will chemistry.  Politics is the appropriate discipline, because in politics humans are the atoms, and their interactions are described by the laws of politics.<p>Your hourly rate of pay is a function only partially of the legislation enacted by your elected representatives.  Your state legislature may set a minimum hourly rate of pay.  Whether that rate applies to your job, and to you personally, depends on a number of other human interactions, both in the present and throughout history, which occurred independently to the legislature.<p>And whether you have your job, which pays $X per hour, or another job, which pays $Y per hour, is a function of... that&#x27;s right, politics.  Or more precisely, labor relations, market forces, race relations, immigration, what school you went to, how much funding your school received, what companies your local layers of government attracted to your area.  These factors are in turn influenced by taxation, investment law, transport infrastructure, natural resources, environmental regulations... everywhere you look for the answer to the question What is your hourly rate of pay, you encounter a different sub-discipline of... politics.')
