It must be management failing Boeing style.<p>My understanding is that Intel believed EUV would be very late.  As such, it committed to Intel 10nm (TSMC 7nm) without EUV, which turned out to be too complex.  At the same time, TSMC banked on EUV early.  This gave them a headstart over Intel once Intel started down the EUV path.<p>The tables could have been reversed.  EUV could have been very late, and 10nm non-EUV might have worked better.  Hard to know these things when you are making plans 3-5 years ahead.')
