But that wasn&#x27;t the case and we honestly should have predicted it given my own experience: as people did better, they unsubscribed. Unfortunately, the opposite was true as well, if folks weren&#x27;t doing better, but were giving it a good shot, they would stay subscribed longer.<p>So in order to continue Quirk, a future Quirk would need to make people feel worse for longer, or otherwise not help the people we signed up to help. If the incentives of the business weren&#x27;t aligned with the people, it would have been naive to assume that we could easily fix it as the organization grew.
