They&#x27;re not that meaningful as they&#x27;re only estimates of <i>reserves</i> with no regard for production. Prices of platinum group metals are what they are because known reserves are limited and production even more limited. If you suddenly increase the supply of PGMs they&#x27;re now much less valuable and their price drops. Extra supply doesn&#x27;t automatically create extra demand.<p>But that&#x27;s besides the physics problems. It&#x27;s not in any way <i>simple</i> to attach an ion rocket to an asteroid and change its orbit. Today&#x27;s <i>best</i> ion engines used on probes deliver fractions of a Newton of thrust and requires several kilowatts of power to do so. That&#x27;s just to accelerate a relatively small spacecraft (Dawn is a bit under 2 tons).<p>Adjusting the orbit of an asteroid of a non-trivial size with an ion engine would take orders of magnitude more fuel, power, and time than the Dawn probe. Even if by some magic you managed to mine the fuel from the asteroid itself, a technological feat unto itself, you still need power and time.<p>Power and time are doubly impacted because most asteroids rotate. Unless that axis of rotation is perfectly aligned with the desired trajectory you can only apply thrust for <i>at best</i> half the asteroid&#x27;s rotation. Rotating is problematic for power generation. If the asteroid miner is solar powered it&#x27;s panels would be in shadow half the asteroid&#x27;s rotation so it needs extra mass and complexity for power storage. If it&#x27;s nuclear powered it&#x27;s radiators are in continual sunlight for half the asteroid&#x27;s rotation so additional mass and complexity is needed to rotate them parallel to the bearing of the sun to remain effective.<p>Even with all that it could take <i>centuries</i> to move an asteroid of any significant size with ion engines. Even if it only took decades that is still a huge initial outlay with zero payback for decades. The only way that&#x27;s even remotely sane is if you spammed every asteroid with probes to assess their composition and knew you were pulling in the Comstock Lode. But then you depressed the price of all the material and the whole effort barely pays for itself.')
