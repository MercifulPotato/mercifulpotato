Carbon dioxide is 27% C, 73% O (one C atom to two O atoms). So the output of one ton of hydrocarbons (coal, gasoline, paraffin, it doesn&#x27;t matter) is three tons of CO2.<p>Some of the rest of the 14 parts air goes to burning the H atoms, which don&#x27;t weigh much, and producing water. Most of it is nitrogen which isn&#x27;t burned.')
