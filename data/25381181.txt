The EU (Italy&#x2F;France) have let clandestine immigration go rampant so that their low-cost industry remains competitive. It also helps that these people have no papers and can be deported at a moment notice. It is slavery with some cash and with the benefit of blaming these people for all the problems they self-inflicted on themselves.<p>It is why some countries are racist: Poland&#x2F;Hungary are unfriendly to illegal immigrant because they don&#x27;t need them. It is also why Italy has recently become strict with illegals: They don&#x27;t need that many workers now, so they are not welcome and they are ramping up the extraditions.<p>Illegal immigration is very easy to solve: You have all workers register with the government, you then put big fines (and jail) for those who hire non-registered people. But the current fines for hiring an illegal are a joke. You can simply pay the fine and hire another the same day and still be more profitable than going by the law.')
