New account setup is extremely simple. Are you thinking of how some servers require some advanced setup for your account? Adding a new member to a server is also just sharing a link.<p>&gt; Paid hosting<p>While I do wish a self-hosted option were available, I can&#x27;t see it being a draw for the platform, especially as it would mean releasing a server application to end-users who might not have a good understanding of how to correctly run it. At this point, I&#x27;d gladly pay for Discord Nitro if there were any benefit I could get from it.<p>&gt; Unclear benefits<p>Most of these are going to be situational based on where your group is coming from, but Discord was the only competitor that really worked for my group. Cross platform, message reactions, reliable, intuitive. Personally, we switched from Facebook Messenger, which despite facebook&#x27;s atrocious policies, is the most usable&#x2F;convenient chat application in the world (imho).<p>&gt; Weird ideological reasons<p>It was upsetting to lose the functional benefits of being on a facebook platform (real names, communicating with nearly anybody I know on the fly), but we all disliked facebook on an ideological level. That made the switch easier, in the end. Other than that, competitors like Skype and Teams are software dumpster fires, while Slack, Signal, and Telegram are extremely restrictive to users who don&#x27;t care too much about their particular features.')
