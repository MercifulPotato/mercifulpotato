Even more important, what about Governor&#x27;s pardoning powers? Those have been used to positive effect many times, should those go away too?<p>Its an imperfect system, just following the script that law provides will lead to injustices. Having an escape hatch is a good thing, even if it is occasionally abused. I would support federal&#x2F;state congresses overturning pardons though.')
