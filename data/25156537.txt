Google already measures cumulative layout shift: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;vitals&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;vitals&#x2F;</a>.<p>I think it&#x27;s clear from everything Google has done and how they&#x27;ve pushed AMP that one of their goals is to get people to use AMP in particular, as opposed to get people to make mostly static, fast websites. And as we&#x27;ve seen, if huge swathes of the web feel compelled (or forced) to use AMP, it affords Google a massive amount of power over how people consume content on the web.')
