Ultimate&#x2F;Gold&#x2F;whatever includes price increases for features, as well as not having to pay for accounts for people who don&#x27;t really use GitLab much at all.<p>I strongly suspect the Ultimate tier is geared towards large companies who&#x27;s primary line of business is not technology.  They have a lot of people who need minimal access to GitLab, and a small number of people who need to access GitLab a lot.  It wouldn&#x27;t be super surprising to me if the difference in cost between Silver and Gold is minimal for someone like Walmart or P&amp;G because they can stop paying for accounts for PMs, helpdesk workers, the people that actually use the software, etc.<p>It&#x27;s probably not really of much interest to a tech company because so many people need access to GitLab that you get very little gain from free Guests.')
