SPACS are not stocks, not sure what the other replier is talking about (they&#x27;re SPVs).<p>If a SPAC doesn&#x27;t find a company to merge with you get your money back and some interest. If a SPAC finds a company, you have the choice to (1) stay invested in the SPAC and therefore the company or (2) refuse the merger and get your money back with interest.<p>Interestingly when you invest in a SPAC you actually get two things (1) the option to invest in the company they find, and (2) a warrant to buy even more stock. What&#x27;s even more interesting is that you could actually sell this warrant while keeping the option to invest in the company the SPAC finds.')
