I imagine we&#x27;ll hear more about it, but I would be surprised if it was a co-ordinated effort in concert with the rioters (I don&#x27;t know what to call them).<p>The footage of police opening barriers and stuff, and taking selfies is however a bit more worrying. I think it&#x27;s pretty well known that individuals within the police could identify or sympathise with Q or the far right - so if it turns out that this footage was exactly what it&#x27;s seems to be (and we know how easily things can be misrepresented and shown out of context) then I imagine some cops are gonna be in big trouble.')
