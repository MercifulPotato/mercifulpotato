So just speculation for now:<p>I&#x27;d think AVX512 would still be advantageous for gemm kernels. If you use a 16 x 14 microkernel instead of an 8 x 6 microkernel, you&#x27;ll reduce memory bandwidth by halving the passes over the cache-sized blocks in memory.\nWell optimized implementations don&#x27;t really have a problem with this (getting close to the CPU&#x27;s peak flops on AVX2), but it still seems better than not doing it, and is an advantage for code with register tiling more generally.<p>I suspect that it&#x27;d help people using Tullio.jl in Julia, for example.')
