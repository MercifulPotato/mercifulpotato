The message against Trump after his election was &quot;resistance,&quot; a message which <i>accepts</i> that Trump won the election, but sought to keep people engaged to try to minimize what he could do.<p>I challenge you to find those people you think were continually organizing events to get Trump&#x27;s election overturned.')
