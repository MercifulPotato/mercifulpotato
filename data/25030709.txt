I didn&#x27;t know about the MCM&#x2F;70  (and, aside: interesting that Wikipedia calls this article &#x27;70&#x27; which is in the &#x27;MCM&#x27; directory).  Another was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SCELBI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SCELBI</a> and I suppose anybody could have strapped on enough batteries in 1973 and called it a Portable.  Still, Osbourne seems to have been first with the concept:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Osborne_Computer_Corporation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Osborne_Computer_Corporation</a>  The Osbourne 1 was in 1981, 8 years after the MCM&#x2F;70 and SCELBI.  It&#x27;s that 8-year-gap that I find fascinating.')
