I think we would be more likely to agree that things went from unusably bad or impossible to usably good, but imperfect in a lot of consumer categories in the last five years due to ML and deep learning approaches.<p>The more clearly &#x27;solved&#x27; cases of previously open problems (Go, protein folding, facial recognition, etc.) are mostly not in the consumer space.<p>As far as the gpt-3 bit I encourage others to read that excerpt, they explicitly state they excluded the problems they asked from the test data so it&#x27;s not memorization. The types of failures it makes are failures like failing to carry the one, it certainly <i>seems</i> like it&#x27;s deducing the rules. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens in gpt-4 as they continue to scale it up.')
