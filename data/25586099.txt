But we are employed here. I did look at Finland and their tech-hiring program a bit back during the pandemic, but they ended it. America is just short-sighted. For all the good things here, there is so much that is simply broken and for no good reason other than &quot;NIH&quot;. If I could convince my spouse to move to Finland or Norway, I would do so in a heartbeat, but with 11 years as a doctor here, and with kids... I&#x27;ve been given the green light if I can make it work, and trying I am. I&#x27;d like Americans to have access to quality healthcare, great schools, and the lot, but apparently they don&#x27;t want it because it&#x27;s &quot;socialist&quot;. The percentage of taxes that would be raised is still far less per person than anyone pays monthly for health insurance.')
