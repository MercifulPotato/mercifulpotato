It seems to be a signal of a group membership and a creed validator.<p>Who cares though? Why does &quot;correct pronunciation&quot; matter? Linux is nowadays used by many more non-native English speakers who will pronounce it very differently.<p>This attempt at correcting others seems like gatekeeping and, to me personally, feels like a very anti-inclusive thing to do.<p>Tangentially, the fact that some of the pronunciation is so non-intuitive (e.g. &#x2F;etc -&gt; etsy) should be a bug, not a feature and pride point. Can you imagine if you reported that a workflow is non-intuitive in a piece of SW and the devs told you &quot;we know, cool, right?!&quot;')
