Only three states even have stay at home orders. From California&#x27;s: &quot;<i>Nothing in this order prevents any number of persons from the same household from leaving their residence, lodging, or temporary accommodation, as long as they do not engage in any interaction with (or otherwise gather with) any number of persons from any other household</i>&quot;. Despite the headline of &quot;stay at home&quot;, you&#x27;re free to go out whenever you&#x27;d like. There is no lock down.')
