It is another of those nonsensical things that keeps getting repeated all the time by some Go programmers.<p>That line of thinking promotes workarounds over long-term solutions. If your team has people who are abusing tools (like types, abstractions etc), the solution is to teach them how to not do that. The solution is NOT to remove the tool itself! That is like saying that a drilling machine is easier to misuse so &quot;only the hammer is a tool for teams&quot;. Ugh.<p>Go is awesome because of things it _can_ do (it has the speed of C and enough libraries to write full-blown webservices with it). Please don&#x27;t encourage the whole marketing agenda of touting its shortcomings as advantages. It doesn&#x27;t work. All it does is it turns people away from the language.')
