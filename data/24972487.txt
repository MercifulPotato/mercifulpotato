That&#x27;s how a &#x27;build for now&#x27; station looks like.  It is a total shitshow during rush hour, and especially during holidays.<p>Everyone in NYC hates it and we are currently building an extension at the old post office, as it is not fit for usage anymore.<p>The old one (the one that got demolished in the 60s) was miles ahead in both space and aesthetics.  Also, almost nobody hates the Grand Central Station, even though it gets overran with tourists as it is a beautiful peace of work.')
