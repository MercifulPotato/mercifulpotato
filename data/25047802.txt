Good for him.<p>However, no matter how much money General Catalyst or Bessemer made last year, I would not want to invest with them going forward.  I get that this is only money on the margins, and they get a benefit from a write off.  Still, how hard would they have had to fight to get some of their money back?  It sends a disturbing signal to me to write the whole thing off.<p>Someone will reply: &quot;But they made $10b last year!  You don&#x27;t understand the business.&quot;  And I am sure I don&#x27;t.  But the world is full of people who made a lot of money or were in the process of making a lot of money and then get careless.<p>Or reply: &quot;It&#x27;s part of the model!  If they don&#x27;t get 10x-100x they just want to write it off as fast as possible.  That&#x27;s what there investors want.&quot;  Sure, but if you are careless people will take advantage of you.  Also, I just don&#x27;t buy that all institutional investors that back VCs are that savvy.  A lot of them are just following a trend and over funding an asset class.<p>Tell me I am wrong.  I am no expert.')
