I&#x27;m not saying it would be trivial, but it wouldn&#x27;t require writing an entirely new compiler.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve implemented programs similar to busybox before by merging programs originally intended to be compiled separately, albeit on a smaller scale than an entire Linux distribution.')
