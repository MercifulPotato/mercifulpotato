The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the openpilot ALC action at all times.<p>While changing lanes, openpilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it&#x27;s safe to do so.<p>Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:<p>Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.\nThe road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.\nObstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.\nThe device is mounted incorrectly.\nWhen in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.\nIn the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.\nWhen driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.\nExtremely hot or cold temperatures.\nBright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).\nDriving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.\nThe list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver&#x27;s responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.')
