Based on the homework we&#x27;ve done, C-Corp is a cost- and paperwork-competitive choice if you want to leverage equity for funding or employee incentives.<p>In terms of changing from LLC to C-Corp, statutory conversion is relatively straightforward especially if you structure your original LLC with future conversion in mind (choose a state that supports statutory conversion, understand how membership interest will convert into shares). I _think_ Stripe Atlas might still offer an LLC with an easy conversion path.
