I currently use stumpwm (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stumpwm.github.io" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stumpwm.github.io</a>), which others interested in EXWM  would likely find interesting.  A Raspberry Pi running stumpwm and emacs has been my standard PC (well, that plus a bunch of AWS VMs for services and testbeds) for several years now.  There&#x27;s a chance my stumpwm (which is really just there to launch emacs in X mode) will get replaced.')
