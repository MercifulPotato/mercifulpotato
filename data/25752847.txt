I had been remote all along, which meant I was left out of many discussions. Chat was my lifeline, because it was the only thing both I and others on the team used. When everyone went remote, we had an opportunity to make a change for the better, but instead <i>nothing at all changed</i>. Meetings were done via video chat instead of in person, but they were just as un-findable and ephemeral as before. If you mapped out the lines of communication before and after, there&#x27;d be no difference. In person vs. online matters far less IMO than ephemeral and closed vs. open and permanent.<p>The irony is that the company happens to be the world&#x27;s largest platform for easily findable&#x2F;joinable permanently archived conversations. Go figure.')
