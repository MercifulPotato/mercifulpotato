By that I mean a viewpoint that is at least tolerant, if nothing else.  If the argument against deplatforming is that people should be allowed to heap hatred on gay people or other minorities, then it&#x27;s not a particularly strong argument.<p>Maybe this is just inherent to a conservative viewpoint, I don&#x27;t know.  If progressives are pushing for more freedom, more tolerance, then to oppose it you have to, by definition, advocate for less of those.<p>I like a spirited discussion, but I believe that intolerance is the one single thing we cannot tolerate.  It destroys everything else.')
