Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=[24831045], score=None, time=1603098878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823179, text='&gt; And yes California is proceeding with a high speed train despite the anti-train hit pieces from the LA Times.<p>So far the high speed train has been a boondoggle, not a good example of a success. It will be decades before it goes anywhere useful.<p>&gt; Or finding a public park since the land was all sold to private developers. That’s not how urban planning works in functioning cities like San Francisco.<p>Have you ever actually lived in San Francisco? A significant chunk of it (and 95% of the rest of the bay) is not walkable. And there is no functional urban planning in San Francisco. A policy of rejecting every new substantial proposal is not “planning”.<p>When was the last time they agreed to allow dense housing to replace single&#x2F;multi-family homes? When was the last new BART line added? When were new commuter rail lines added in?<p>I lived in the Bay Area for over a decade now and this fantasy you have of a functioning local government doesn’t exist. The only people that make good enough money to be worth it are senior software folks. Everyone else is better at their slightly reduced equivalent wage anywhere else in the US (aside from maybe NYC).<p>Tax money is absolutely being pissed away at an alarming rate based on what citizens get here. The schools are frequently garbage, the public transit is useful for maybe 5% of the population, and the homeless problem is as bad as ever. All of this for the low price of one of the highest income tax states + sales tax.<p>I chose the bay because of the tech economy and nice weather <i>in spite of</i> the blisteringly incompetent government. I don’t think any of my friends or coworkers are in SF or the wider bay because they think it’s a good governance model. The thought is likely pretty laughable to most residents.')
