It is much less picky than BIOS, for which the El Torito standard had to be invented, and can be implemented easily on disks that use that format for dual-use. I haven&#x27;t encountered UEFI implementations that don&#x27;t support optical disks but I imagine it is possible there are some laptop vendors that might not have implemented optical drive support.')
