Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609752469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25628867, text='&gt; and why are there charts following the cleavage line<p>I always believe that these girls&#x2F;boys who are dancing semi-naked, at the age of 10-17 need their parents&#x2F;guardians removed&#x2F;imprisoned (or worse). It cannot be that (in this example) Britney Spears was clearly being sexualized while underage. This can only cause issues later in life (if not early in life too), and for the example of Britney Spears we read about it in the news.<p>Yes, &#x27;normal&#x27; (not exposed to such degree) also may go off the rails and shave their heads, sue their dads, etc. but we (as a society) need to protect children better from unecessary exposure and hurtful exposure. And social media definitely do NOT help to improve things.')
