And the wasm init add at least 100ms to each request even when &quot;hot&quot; in cache.<p>Also, out of a cost perspective, running a VM with SSD for cheap with SQlite will give much more requests than a CF worker for much less.<p>Adding writes to this is also very limited due to the max 1sec write per KV key limit.')
