And they&#x27;re substantial features, too! The sculpting tools and the holdout option for grease pencil look like they&#x27;re going to be really useful.<p>And the release page is performant and pretty, and it works without Javascript but it still has all these great little diagrams and demo videos for each feature. Like, you can look at this page and even if you knew nothing at all about 3D modeling you&#x27;d still want to go download this thing immediately.')
