We measured 50.00% flips for heads and tails, and continue to see the 0.99 correlation with the initial orientation. The 1% of the time that the correlation doesn&#x27;t match, it doesn&#x27;t seem to show any bias for one side or the other.<p>So after an &quot;infinite&quot; number of tests, we continue to get 50.00% frequency of heads, but with an 0.99 correlation with the orientation when loaded into the machine.<p>Now I load a coin into the machine and ask you to name the true probability that the result is heads. I don&#x27;t tell you the initial orientation, but I know it privately.<p>What&#x27;s the true probability of heads? Our testing found precisely 50.00% frequency of heads. But are you still sure the probability is an intrinsic property of the system, rather than a property of <i>your state of knowledge</i> of the system?<p>We can continue the pattern; maybe the 1% error itself correlates to 0.99 with someone running the microwave in the kitchen. This drops the line voltage and causes the servo to impart a little less momentum to the coin, causing it to flip one fewer times on average. Neither of us have currently checked that the microwave is running... And so on...')
