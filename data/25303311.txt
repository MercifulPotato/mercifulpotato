You don&#x27;t pay them. You&#x27;re not their customer. There is no SLA.<p>Just host it yourself, or us a CDN you pay for. Why depend on an external service with no SLA, just for a little speed boost? If they&#x27;re down, you&#x27;re down. Break those dependencies on external sites when they&#x27;re not necessary.')
