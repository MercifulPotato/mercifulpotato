A lot of them have little in the way of prospects. Drugs are an escape from the hopelessness in a lot of cases.<p>If our society had a better social safety net combined with education about drugs that is based on facts&#x2F;truth (there&#x27;s plenty of truth about heroin&#x2F;meth that would put off most people from ever trying it - but for a long time a lot of lies were told about other recreational substances.) it&#x27;s likely that usage would go down organically.')
