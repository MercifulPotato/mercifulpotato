It is around about 30% except for EPIC.<p>Your list is companies being paid an affiliate rate.  If I start linking companies that don&#x27;t do affiliate stuff, they charge a lot less.<p>Which is to say that 30% could be a reasonable amount if you had any choice in the matter of what services you want to purchase from apple.<p>&gt; It was never 90% rate. Apple has had the 30% rate since 2011.<p>All that matters is revenue vs. cost.<p>Apple&#x27;s app store brings in about 80 billion a year right now.<p>In 2013 it was 10 billion.<p>People made apps in 2013, even though 70% of 10 billion is less than 10% of 80 billion.<p>They&#x27;d make apps for 10% of 80 billion and they&#x27;d definitely make apps for 25% of 80 billion.<p>&gt; If everyone did it all at the same time as a protest. Apple would have to respond and everyone certainly would.<p>Everyone standing up and refusing those billions of dollars in solidarity is more outlandish than anything I&#x27;ve said.<p>&gt; So you are saying paying the 30% on the App store is worth it as you get a larger paying market. Which is what makes the 30% reasonable because it is worth it.<p>It&#x27;s much easier for a fee to be &quot;worth it&quot; than to be &quot;reasonable&quot;.<p>If an airline started charging a fee of $5 for &quot;Breathable air or whatever, screw you.&quot;, it would still be <i>worth</i> buying a ticket, but the fee would not be <i>reasonable</i>.')
