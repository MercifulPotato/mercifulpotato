Some ballpark numbers.<p>A &quot;first year&quot; partner may have to pay ~$150,000 into the partnership, on perhaps a $300,000ish a year in profit sharing. Usually this is just a reduction in the profit sharing (or perhaps a multi year loan, i forget). Its not uncommon to earn less as a first year partner than your last year as Managing Director. \nYou are not longer an employee, but part owner. You move onto a totally separate HR system (Benefits, etc.).<p>Relative works with mostly senior partners, multiple of them are making $1 million+ a year. That&#x27;s not common, but as you move up the ranks of partnership, that&#x27;s not a crazy salary. They work a lot, are all divorced, don&#x27;t seem to even have time to enjoy the $$ etc. Listening to the details, I&#x27;m not super jealous.')
