Maybe publishing personal information should be allowed.  The point is that there is an intelligent human being weighing tradeoffs and trying to make a good decision as we muddle our way through the 21st century.<p>Infrastructural changes, on the other hand, aren&#x27;t as reversible.  Screwups are more likely to be permanent.  You&#x27;re flipping a switch that can&#x27;t be flipped back.  That is the point I was trying to make by mentioning terrorism--there can be unintended consequences which you don&#x27;t necessarily anticipate, so retaining flexibility is good.')
