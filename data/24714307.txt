I was very bad in English at school and just got better in the last 5 years and I&#x27;m 35 now.<p>On a side-note, I&#x27;m learning Spanish right now with Duolingo (as some kind of social media detox) and I like it. Every now and then I can understand more Spanish Tweets and the lack of grammatical explanations in Duolingo often helps to get &quot;a feeling&quot; for the language instead of really learning the principles. Wouldn&#x27;t have imagined les explanation could be better.')
