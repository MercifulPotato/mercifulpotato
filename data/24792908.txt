It&#x27;s no secret that etcd is a key part of why Kubernetes is complex--etcd scaling&#x2F;securing&#x2F;recovery is really hard.<p>I think Kubernetes would do well to make swapping out the storage backend possible without having all of these forks.  Kubernetes is too tightly coupled to etcd, and for little benefit.  I would wager a lot of customers would trade the guarantees etcd provides for a simpler deployment.')
