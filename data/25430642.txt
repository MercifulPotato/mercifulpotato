Amdahl&#x27;s Law, eh?<p>Don&#x27;t worry though, I&#x27;m sure Apple Silicon is coming with many more cores. Amazon&#x27;s Graviton2 shows how ARM can perform with massive core counts...<p>As to the current Ryzen (5000 series), it&#x27;s a great chip and what I&#x27;m planning to use in a new build, but it also has a 105W power budget. We&#x27;ll see what Apple produces for its desktop entries soon enough!')
