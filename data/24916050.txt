Janky doesn’t even come close to describing the user experience of Figma, and I’m on a 2019 16” MBP. In my opinion, Figma really is that bad. On the flip side, Sketch Cloud sucks rocks so we share our sketch assets via git. I even pay for my own Sketch license so I can use it at work; for the quality and productivity, it’s a steal.')
