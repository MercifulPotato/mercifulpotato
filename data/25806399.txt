While you could have these in a bash script as well, there&#x27;s a standard convention for variables in Make[1].<p>In my experience, Makefiles are usually better documented and follow more conventions than scripts. There are of course many exceptions to every rule.<p>Make files are very similar to bash scripts, and while I would prefer a Makefile any day, it&#x27;s really a matter of preference.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;prep&#x2F;standards&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;Makefile-Conventions.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;prep&#x2F;standards&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;Makefile-Conven...</a>')
