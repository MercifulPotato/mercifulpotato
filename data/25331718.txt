Totally secret.  Don&#x27;t tell anyone, Bloomberg!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epsilontheory.com&#x2F;why-am-i-reading-this-now&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epsilontheory.com&#x2F;why-am-i-reading-this-now&#x2F;</a><p>Reminder: it was also Bloomberg who ran that very likely bogus and unsubstantiated story&#x2F;psyop about the scary backdoor chips on the SuperMicro boards, and refused to retract it.  When they do very obvious marketing fluff pieces like this, they lose even more credibility as a &quot;legitimate news source&quot; in my view, even if this ad they&#x27;re running for Apple&#x27;s upcoming hardware is 100% factually accurate.')
