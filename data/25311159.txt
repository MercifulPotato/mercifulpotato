Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607135885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308496, text='They are secret. &quot;Secret key&quot; is a technical term in cryptography, and there are thousands of research papers published with this term [0], including a paper by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir on &quot;Differential fault analysis of secret key cryptosystems&quot;. Using you believe that you are more knowledgeable in crypto than Adi Shamir (The &quot;S&quot; in &quot;RSA&quot;) and insist on using an alternative definition of &quot;secret&quot; not accepted by cryptographers and infosec researchers, there should be no problem using the word &quot;secret&quot;.<p>Otherwise, <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, Following the same line of logic, all cryptography is &quot;security through obscurity&quot; because there exists a secret key, which is not incorrect. The practice of hiding the design of a system is obscurity, the practice of hiding a specific key to a ciphertext is security, not obscurity, as long as the method of generating and using it is publicly available. If there&#x27;s nothing to reverse engineer, there can be no obscurity. The method of finding a symmetric key or finding a RSA key is well-known, not obscured, it&#x27;s simply the size of the problem is not computationally tractable in practice by today&#x27;s computers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?q=secret+key" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?q=secret+key</a>')
