So to me that goes against the hippocratic oath. At a minimum they should have to disclose they are not vaccinated so patients can choose not to be around them. Though as others have said it sends a bad message to others that need it more. E.g. if I am a 25 year old that doesn&#x27;t want to risk the side effects, 70 year olds with a heart condition and asthma that also decide against it with a very different risk profile have made a decision based on the young health worker...<p>That being said certain people like the pregnant woman that feels we don&#x27;t have enough data if there are any I&#x27;ll effects on that particular group seems relatively valid.')
