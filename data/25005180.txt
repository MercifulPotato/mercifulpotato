This is not simple, and is certainly not the most sensible solution. The simple and sensible solution is to just use v6.<p>&gt; The biggest most canally disgusting thing about ipv6 is that it will render dns based ad blocking a thing of the past.<p>This claim is completely nonsensical. DNS-based ad blacklisting works just fine in v6. None of the problems you list with it exist.<p>I suggest you unblock v6 and use it. You&#x27;ll find it works the same as v4 does, just without the added complexity of NAT.')
