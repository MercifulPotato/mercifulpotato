You want to maximize trust with the public, not engagement, if you want your media company to survive <i>if its value proposition is providing journalism and the usual benefits that come with a free press.</i><p>That&#x27;s a big &#x27;if&#x27;. The &#x27;media&#x27;s value prop is not to promote a free press. Those that believe that to be the case are quickly going extinct.<p>&gt; This does mean that there&#x27;s a huge opportunity if you assume trust is something people will pay for. [...] I think the market will correct this error<p>If it&#x27;s true (I don&#x27;t think it is), and to the degree that you can sustain a business over many years. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even possible to be true, because the money itself is corrupting. The market cannot correct what doesn&#x27;t require correction.<p>I think where your analysis fails is that you presume that the media has shifted their position on their own. They haven&#x27;t; they&#x27;ve reacted to the public. It&#x27;s actually a positive feedback loop, not negative -- it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s positive in the direction you dislike. We cannot depend on or hope for market correction. A free press in modern times requires public funding.')
