The only way we have to motivate them is to give them food directly after completing a small task, and that motivation doesn&#x27;t really work in the long run. You can&#x27;t make them do an hour long task and then give them something.<p>Edit: Humans however have been shown capable to toil away with no reward whatsoever for years just to achieve some arbitrary goal or reward they believe exists. If this was just a question of degree then it shouldn&#x27;t have been hard to get monkeys to do a days work with no rewards. Humans aren&#x27;t a thousand times smarter than monkeys.')
