Being atheist, I opted for philosophy, and while I certainly felt they were a waste of time way back when I was 19, but there are a few things that have really stuck with me.<p>I wish I remember the name that the professor used for this concept, but essentially, he argued that the same activity might be ethical or unethical depending on ease and scale.  For example, I&#x27;m allowed to look at license plates in public.  If I happen to see my neighbor&#x27;s car (with a memorable license plate) when I&#x27;m in town, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with noting that and making small talk next time I see the neighbor (&quot;Hey, I saw you were down in town on Friday!&quot;).  If I put plate readers everywhere I can, and accumulate and sell that information, enabling wide-spread location tracking, that&#x27;s arguably unethical, even though those license plates are displayed out in public.  There&#x27;s something that changes when certain activities become scaled up and automated.')
