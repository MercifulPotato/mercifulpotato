We can try to correct for the biases you name without setting numerical targets. The thing is, there  isn’t any correct number to aim for. For instance, some cultures emphasize STEM education&#x2F;careers and it isn’t surprising or incorrect to see them represented in tech at numbers higher than their makeup of the general population. Setting targets like proportional demographic representation for blacks or any other racial group ultimately amounts to racist discrimination against those other races.')
