I hope that this means we&#x27;ll get some hardware vendors roadmapping encoding support. AV1 is great and will likely replace things eventually, but holy hell encoding is slow right now. At the moment it only seems worth it if you have limited content but immense traffic. \nThere are things I&#x27;m really excited about with the format though. The forced 10bit support is a big one. A unified format is also nice (i.e. not having to worry about png for screenshots &#x2F; jpg for photos). Obviously file size improvements are great too. Overall though the format has a few years to go before it&#x27;s production worthy except in niche circumstances.')
