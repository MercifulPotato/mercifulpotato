Potential is just a guess. Nothing more. I&#x27;m also a disappointment to myself in various ways, but that&#x27;s all it is. A feeling. It comes and goes like any other feeling. Sometimes feelings linger, but that&#x27;s a choice. My enjoying life doesn&#x27;t depend one bit on it.<p>Perhaps I could have enjoyed life more if I reached my potential, if the guess was correct, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that life can&#x27;t be enjoyed. It takes almost absolutely nothing. It just depends on your sense of appreciation.<p>Even &quot;bad&quot; things can be appreciated and enjoyed. I&#x27;ve let sorrow linger in times of mourning, for example. It&#x27;s fine. Others can appreciate their misfortunes, because it&#x27;s an opportunity to gain experience, character, or something else they can take pride in.<p>&gt; And if you talk about potential, I&#x27;d also argue that no matter how much waste there is, there&#x27;s enough numbers in the world to take it&#x27;s place readily.<p>That about a person with potential being replaceable I agree is fact, though I&#x27;m not sure why it matters. From your use of the word &quot;waste&quot; (which is totally different from the use I gave it) it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re trying to put value on a person&#x27;s life from the perspective of how much they can contribute to society, but that&#x27;s wrong. The only perspective that matters is one&#x27;s own. The value we should put on the lives of others should be through empathy, the imagining of another&#x27;s life as our own. If that weren&#x27;t the case, we&#x27;d be killing off anyone that we deemed wouldn&#x27;t produce value for society, but we don&#x27;t and I wouldn&#x27;t want to be part of a society that does.<p>&gt; Organ donation campaigners harp over and over again that one donor could give back life to multiple people. So is it a waste?<p>Oh, sure. If you mean donating blood, then by all means that&#x27;s great. I thought you were talking about donating a kidney or part of your liver or something that could decrease your potential to live a long and able life and which wouldn&#x27;t make much difference if you donate now or later.<p>&gt; It becomes more the trolley question more then anything else; if one person dying could save six others, is him not choosing the die the same as choosing to kill them?<p>I don&#x27;t see how it became a trolley question. That&#x27;s about valuing the lives of others relative to themselves. It&#x27;s not about valuing the life of oneself relative to others. It&#x27;s only in very few and exceptional circumstances where anyone would argue against always valuing their own lives above others&#x27;, and even then it&#x27;s always a valid choice to choose oneself.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. I am being selfish.<p>No, you&#x27;re not. You&#x27;re always bringing other people and society into your own life&#x27;s valuation. When valuing your own life, the wants and opinions of others don&#x27;t matter.<p>You seem confused in thinking that things have just 1 value. That&#x27;s wrong. Everybody puts value on things based on how much they personally gain from it. When valuing things in the interest of others and &quot;against&quot; one&#x27;s own, one feels a personal gain through empathy, or they can feel or imagine the love from others, or their sense of justice gives them a masochistic pleasure, or they can feel a gain in justice by making another person feel bad through that person&#x27;s empathy, etc.<p>In <i>personally</i> valuing your own life&#x27;s existence, you should only think of yourself. What do you gain? You gain everything! You gain the ability to gain! In not valuing your life and always bringing other people into the scope, I can only think that your sense of empathy is too strong. That it blinds you and prevents you from forming your own wants and appreciations of what you have. You should care less of others and enjoy whatever you can of the world for yourself.<p>Though, since you bring up the topic of potential, perhaps it&#x27;s also possible that you&#x27;re too fixated on not attaining a particular deal. Like wanting to buy something, so you save for it, then realize it was much more expensive or the price rose or something, becoming disappointed and wanting to throw that money down the gutter. There&#x27;s a lot of other things to buy! The market is vast. You just need to recognize their value. Anything is better than nothing, so use up every cent.<p>In case the reply feature here becomes disabled and you want to continue talking, my email is jol@jol.dev. That&#x27;s JOL.')
