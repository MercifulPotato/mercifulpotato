People want to work with higher-level concepts, which allows them to solve more complex problems without burning their brains out. I&#x27;d go as far as saying that the utility of a programming language is measured in its ability to compress code with abstractions. All this means you have to first understand the abstractive tooling and the abstraction itself before you can work with it, but <i>this is how it should be</i>. Most programming languages are tools, not toys.<p>The alternative would be to handicap all programming, make it impossible to solve complex problems with it for the sake of beginners, who want to get accolades without putting in work. You can&#x27;t run an industry on participation trophies. By this line of thinking, we wouldn&#x27;t have this conversation because inventing computers took work. Hell, none of us would have <i>any</i> conversation whatsoever, because <i>language itself</i> is something that takes years to learn.')
