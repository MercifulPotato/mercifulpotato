If you happen to be downtown you can get your stuff there, and then casually drop that into one of the many (much smaller) branches in the suburbs. Furthermore you can extend your loan easily and online if you need to (where the standard loan time is one month). I can live with that. Though haven&#x27;t used it since March for obvious reasons.<p>I think it depends from where and when you look at it.\nWhile for someone living &quot;out there&quot; the online stuff is an enrichment, for someone used to live metropolitan or at least some university town, it&#x27;s only so so and not really overwhelming.<p>The same is true for (good) book stores dealing with dead wood. The haptics are simply different. You can stroll along there and find something interesting widening your horizon by random chance&#x2F;serendipity.<p>The recommendations from sites like Amazon or Goodreads don&#x27;t offer that, even if they are trying to emulate that.<p>Not the same, more like tunnel vision, and if something like &quot;surprise me!&quot; is offered, it&#x27;s different from walking into some rarely or never visited part, quickly scanning a few pages and &quot;seeing&quot; how it&#x27;s like.<p>The same applies to reading &quot;on-screen&quot;, no matter which device, size, and display technology. The haptics are mostly <i>WORSE</i>.<p>Not having experienced the good parts of &quot;dead wood&quot; it may be excused, because not knowing it any better. Nonetheless there were and still are many good parts about &quot;dead wood&quot;, and the ecosystem surrounding that. Just not everywhere.<p>&#x2F;endrant')
