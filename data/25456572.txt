They are amazingly practical when you need to carry vast amounts of crap.  Neither of us was particularly interested in driving around in one though, so we optimized by carrying less crap around.<p>I&#x27;d say about 99% of our usage of our 4 door sedan or small SUV requires no additional cargo capacity for our family. For the other 1% of the time, we&#x27;re able to optimize by carrying less stuff. I think there has been 1 or 2 times in 13 years where cargo capacity was insufficient.  For us, it was a tradeoff worth making.<p>We totally respect those who make different choices, though.  Everyone has their own preferences and needs.')
