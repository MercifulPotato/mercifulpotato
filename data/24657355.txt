Some guy tried to do that akin from the scene in Mr.Robot with limited success using thermix. The only success was using a shape charge inside a desktop, but that is not possible on a laptop.<p>I like the idea of a USB dongle that is attached to the person which immediately locks the computer and erases the drive but the problem is that it takes time and law enforcement can just remove the battery to stop the erase (if battery is easily accessible).<p>Erasing the headers on an encrypted drive seems quick and effective and the way to proceed.
