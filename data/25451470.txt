But we shouldn&#x27;t forget actually you can&#x27;t, you can only do what others think you&#x27;re good at, and what the grant review panels think you can feasibly do.<p>My plan is to just use the extra money from a tech job to open my garage lab. It&#x27;s getting easier by the day. A fancy deltavision microscope costs less than a cheap boat, so it&#x27;s not even an expensive hobby if you think about it. You really can do whatever you want, you&#x27;ll just be limited by money than by other people :)')
