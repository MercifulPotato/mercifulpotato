When it is warm outside, I go on a 2-3 mile walk every day, often carrying a 30 pound backpack. On cold days, I find a TV show to stream, and just run in place and do calisthenics while watching.<p>Typically, I do this first thing in the morning as soon as I roll out of bed, so nothing has a chance to sidetrack me from getting it done.')
