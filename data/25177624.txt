Always use the manufacturer provided PSU even if it is just a USB PSU. Random chargers tend to be of inferior quality because the devices they are charging have an integrated battery that filters any noise and prevents shutdowns from temporary spikes. The usb power source being unreliable is basically the biggest reason why SD cards get corrupted in raspberry pis.<p>There is also the obvious problem the initial batch of the Raspberry Pi 4 suffered from. The Raspberry Pi foundation does not test their SBCs with anything other than the official PSU.')
