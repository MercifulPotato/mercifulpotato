Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think something like this should happen 100%.  But this seems to cast too wide a net.<p>What about my bank?  They have &gt;100M users, and with an app&#x2F;service portal, they&#x27;ll be required to be &quot;interoperable&quot;.  I don&#x27;t want my bank or my bank info to be interoperable.  I also don&#x27;t want my bank to have an interoperability interface; as an internet plumber, I fully realize the first thing you need to have a blockage is a pipe with something in it.<p>What about content delivery?  Will I be able to play music&#x2F;movies hosted by my subscription provider through a 3rd party?  This calls into question some difficult problems around licensing that may be impossible to satisfy via existing, established contracts; don&#x27;t paint a content provider into a corner of guaranteed noncompliance.<p>Where is the definition of &quot;interoperability&quot;?<p>This will be a field day for an endless bevy of corporate lawyers to say &quot;Oh XYZ isn&#x27;t a service with users.  It&#x27;s available to users of ABC service, which is fully compliant with the interoperability rules as required by blah blah.&quot;<p>I applaud the effort and think this is a priceless next step in helping define where we should go next, but I&#x27;m only hearing possibility and daydreams, not concrete implementation.')
