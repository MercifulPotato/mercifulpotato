Many do. Look at America and their second amendment: there&#x27;s no way that would fly today if it wasn&#x27;t in the constitution. Luckily it is and power hungry politicians have to accept it.<p>Same with the first amendment. Some of these are even are powerful today than before and I hope the fourth amendment will soon see a renaissance.<p>&gt; What is the mechanism for redress should it fail to do so?<p>Courts.<p>Also it affects politicians directly. There was  a petition here to give a mountain on the Finnish border to the Finnish people. Many people advocated for this but in the end it was struck down because politicians aren&#x27;t even allowed to give away land and they know it.')
