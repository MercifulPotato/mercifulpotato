This is an oddball site writing a linkbait article about one tweet.   No statement from GoDaddy seems to have been solicited.<p>And the site... is up?  What are we actually discussing here?<p>Edit: crawling around there&#x27;s some evidence that they had to get it cleaned up fast, c.f. this thread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ar15.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;General&#x2F;POLICY-CHANGE-FOR-ARFCOM-Please-Read-and-Comment&#x2F;5-2412040&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ar15.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;General&#x2F;POLICY-CHANGE-FOR-ARFCOM...</a><p>Note that there&#x27;s reference to a politics forum which doesn&#x27;t seem to be there currently.  My guess is that they did indeed have a bunch of unsavory stuff, but managed to convince their registrar they had it under control.  Their (presumably new) rules are quite clear that violent discussion isn&#x27;t allowed.  And while folks seem to be griping about that the site seems to be complying.<p>This is, IMHO, the way moderation is supposed to work.')
