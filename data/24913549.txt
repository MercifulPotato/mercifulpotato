It boils down to: for best results, we should be generally trying to address vitamin D deficiency as a means to try to halt the pandemic and not waiting for people to end up hospitalized with Covid-19 before checking their status and trying to do something about it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s &quot;useless&quot; to give supplements at that point. I&#x27;m just saying I would expect vastly better results if you have more lead up time to redress the issue rather than waiting until you are deathly ill from the current pandemic before you think taking action makes sense.')
