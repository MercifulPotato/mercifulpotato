So that means that we could give out access via CloudShell, and now those commands are gated by those same policies. That&#x27;s really nice from a security perspective.<p>In our case, since we do development in a ChromeOS environment, and the browser is relatively isolated from the Linux VM, it also likely prevents classic SSH-hijacking.')
