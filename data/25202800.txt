If you&#x27;re going to burn coal, then, yes, please do CCS, but pretty soon you need to stop burning coal. I also don&#x27;t trust that CO2 will stay underground forever; that also makes it &quot;short term&quot;.<p>That said, we do need direct air capture (DAC) to repair the damage and to provide an alternative source for CO2 and hydrocarbons.<p>...<p>To this end, I kind-of like algae as a low-tech solar-powered method:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;bioscience&#x2F;article&#x2F;60&#x2F;9&#x2F;722&#x2F;238034" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;bioscience&#x2F;article&#x2F;60&#x2F;9&#x2F;722&#x2F;238034</a><p>I feel you could do this in a moderate-sized backyard.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t want to bury the biomass directly (say as biochar) because you wouldn&#x27;t want to lose the NPK nutrients -- but the above article deals with that. It describes a couple methods to extract carbon while recycling the other nutrients. None seem too difficult.<p>...<p>In a completely different direction, nuclear-powered Sabatier&#x2F;Bosch&#x2F;electrolysis is also interesting:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrochemical_reduction_of_carbon_dioxide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrochemical_reduction_of_c...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sabatier_reaction#International_Space_Station_life_support" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sabatier_reaction#Internationa...</a><p>...<p>Either way, you have to combine your DAC with... not mining fossil fuels out of the ground. You have to do both.<p>(Note: Carbon-neutral fuels (bio-, synthesized) are fine, e.g. for air travel. You just can&#x27;t mine them from the earth. That&#x27;s the one rule. Then the cost of recapturing CO2 has to be baked into everything else.)')
