Iceland was Danish until WW2.<p>Today? Greenland and the Faroes remain (sort of) in the Danish Empire.<p>Norway, being in union with Denmark when the empire building took place, bided its time until the nineteen thirties, when a group of whalers occupied parts of Eastern Greenland, an occupation which was backed by Norwegian authorities after the fact until the League of Nations told us to snuff it.<p>The Swedes, too, dabbled in colonialism but never really putting their heart in it; the only overseas colony lasting more than a few years was Saint Barthelemy in the Caribbean, which was Swedish from the latter part of the eighteenth century until the late nineteenth century.')
