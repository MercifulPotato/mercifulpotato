There&#x27;s countless other tld thats cheaper than .com&#x27;s $8 yearly (which imho still cheap considering some tld do goes to $50-100 yearly). Check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.domcomp.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.domcomp.com</a> and see the new and renew tab then choose the overall cheapest there.<p>For email hosting, again for the absolute cheap theres actually few free service that allow custom domain, zoho and yandex comes to my mind.')
