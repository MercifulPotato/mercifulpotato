Surely if this was the kind of widespread thing you&#x27;re imagining SOMEONE would have put a camera on one of those boxes and caught someone?<p>I mean, just think about it: this is completely impractical.  To &quot;steal&quot; any one election you need to swing thousands of ballots.  Each box holds a few dozen ballots at a time at most.  You&#x27;d be talking about a huge crime spree to manage to collect and resubmit all those ballots.<p>And yet... we&#x27;ve never seen it happen.  The simple truth is that stealing elections doesn&#x27;t happen because it&#x27;s too expensive vs. just winning elections with more persuasive arguments.')
