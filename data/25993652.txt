It should have been shut down years ago, and I find it surprising in the changelog that Intel &quot;is still officially shipping chips until July 29, 2021&quot; no wonder Intel is behind on innovation.<p>I don&#x27;t think so:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pentium_4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pentium_4</a>:<p>&gt; Launched November 20, 2000<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Itanium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Itanium</a>:<p>&gt; Launched June 2001<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intel_Core" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intel_Core</a>:<p>&gt; Launched January 2006<p>You seem to be basically claiming their downward spiral started before their biggest recent upswing, which doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Itanium (and the Pentium 4) were mistakes that they managed to recover from <i>15 years ago</i>.  However, it&#x27;s only just being discontinued because Intel&#x27;s not a company that&#x27;s willing and eager to leave their existing customers in a lurch.<p>Edit: it sounds like HP was basically paying Intel to keep Itanium alive:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Itanium#HP_vs._Oracle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Itanium#HP_vs._Oracle</a>:<p>&gt; ...court documents unsealed by a Santa Clara County Court judge revealed that in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, the two companies signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium CPUs for HP&#x27;s machines until 2017.<p>According the the article, the latest Itatium processor was released in, surprise!, 2017.')
