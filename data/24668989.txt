Couldn&#x27;t a DC in a power plant do some other low bandwidth task instead?  Why is crypto a unique &quot;low bandwidth&quot; application?<p>Again, even if the hardware has a longer life due to &quot;cheaper&quot; energy why is crypto uniquely suited to take advantage of this?<p>&gt; Is new single purpose hardware being created for a purpose you don&#x27;t respect even when confronted with new information? Yes. Is the impact overblown and oversimplified? Yes. Should you make sure the reality doesn&#x27;t turn into the imagined nightmare? Yes. Remain vigilant, just have more accurate arguments so you know what to watch out for.<p>This kind of cryptic condescension raises red flags for me.  If you have information please share it.
