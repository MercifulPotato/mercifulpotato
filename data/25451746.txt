It&#x27;s kind of tiring to read comments that act like nobody else is capable of enumerating the downsides of something.<p>Why own a dog? You spend money on it, it shits, it makes noise, you have to find a caretaker when you go on vacation, it bites, it needs walks, it needs to go to the vet, your next girlfriend might be allergic to it, and after all that, it dies.<p>Do people who own dogs not know these things? Or is it that they own one despite those things and there&#x27;s a more interesting conversation to be had?<p>Comments like this make me wonder if you, yourself, are capable of seeing anything that&#x27;s improved about the web which is a much more illuminating exercise to do than enumerating just bad things, something anyone can do.')
