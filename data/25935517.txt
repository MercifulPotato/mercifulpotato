You can&#x27;t claim it would be as popular without AWS by just pointing to it&#x27;s popularity during the period of time that AWS has used it. A significant amount of it&#x27;s current popularity occured after AWS began offering it.<p>Even without that, how many would have adopted it without it&#x27;s permissive licenses? Probably none of the major cloud offerings, which would have severely limited growth given the continuing sig ificant shift from on-prem to cloud during that period of time.')
