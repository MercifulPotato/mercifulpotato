I&#x27;ll explain.<p>Truth: In theory, peoples&#x27; grievances need to be heard. Trump did not get elected simply because he is a loudmouth contrarian criminal xenophobe. He also got elected over concerns for American manufacturing, a counterbalance to extreme-leftist social changes, the hope for real infrastructure investment, etc.<p>However, in 2020, the idea of not being heard is pretty crap. &quot;Being heard&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;do everything you ask all the time&quot;. Trump has spread constant, factual lies, and as the President, incited violence at the Capitol. The people marching currently, the pretext of which is to argue that the free and fair election of Biden is illegitimate because it isn&#x27;t who they want, is garbage. That grievance does not warrant any more attention than it has been given; that there is no evidence of systemic fraud at any level, and that this is a well-vetted assertion.<p>Finally, while &quot;primary sources&quot; are nice to have, it is suspicious to me that you don&#x27;t trust the FBI on this. I&#x27;m no blind supporter of LEO (Ha!) but how are you suspicious of the claim, given the behavior and events of the past week&#x2F;two months? It makes no sense.')
