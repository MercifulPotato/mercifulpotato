What makes you think your parents don&#x27;t deserve to be trusted to use an app they want to use?<p>As for children, just don&#x27;t give out your Apple ID password. Children under 13 are not allowed to create accounts.<p>&gt; <i>I have not yet had to help one of them get malware off of their iOS devices.</i><p>This is a completely different issue. Apps can still be sand-boxed for security.<p>&gt; <i>Why did you buy an option that doesn&#x27;t have the features you want, and now you want to take away a feature many of us like?</i><p>You have nothing to lose here. I really don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re still calling this a feature.')
