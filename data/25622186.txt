Item(by='jen20', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609686860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619298, text='Your statement about providers as dependencies is inaccurate in a number of respects:<p>- Pulumi has the ability to use the CRUD logic from Terraform providers to reify resources, but that is one of a number of different approaches it can use.<p>The Kubernetes new Azure Resource Manager providers are instead built via the API specs and additional annotations, and involve no aspects of Terraform.<p>- (Less importantly, but still:) Terraform does not have the notion of “custom” providers as a technical construct - first- and third-party providers implement the same protocol and have the same capabilities. There are just “providers”.<p>Disclaimer: I have contributed to Pulumi and now use it day to day at a large company. I also was a core maintainer of Terraform at HashiCorp for several years.')
