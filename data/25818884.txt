So that&#x27;s what matters here, it&#x27;s not that 1000 deaths per year is magically fine while 100 000 per year is not, it&#x27;s that right now 1000 cases turns into 100 000 cases and deaths accordingly.<p>So <i>assuming</i> the vaccination programme is able to achieve herd immunity and maintain it either indefinitely or until the pandemic is over or border controls isolate that impact then you don&#x27;t need to try to pick some number of micro-morts.<p>This is another reason elimination was obviously the correct strategy. Zero is special. If something doubles every day then no matter your start number you&#x27;re screwed - unless it was zero in which case you&#x27;re fine because zero doubled is... zero. Elimination allowed New Zealand to not need to estimate R numbers and weigh up whether to open bars or nurseries, universities or sports stadiums, because zero multiplied by anything is zero.<p>But if you can achieve herd immunity through vaccination you get to the same place by being assured of the multiplier instead, and that&#x27;s a more practical option for countries like the US at this point.')
