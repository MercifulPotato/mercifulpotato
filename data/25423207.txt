They have simple shapes, but the color changes break the shapes into indiscriminate masses of stuff.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what animals and the military do to disguise themselves: They break their own shape and outline so it can&#x27;t be snap-recognized as being distinct from the environment.<p>Google&#x27;s new icons do exactly that, except that app icons should be snap-recognizable. Now they&#x27;re a herd of zebras where you can&#x27;t tell where one begins and another ends.<p>Someone ran a colorblindness filter on them. Predictably, they looked better because turning everything non-blue into yellow made the shapes more coherent.')
