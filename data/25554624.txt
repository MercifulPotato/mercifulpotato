SC2 fundamentally failed with their multiplayer design due to their irrational focus on the esports and competitive aspects of multiplayer.  The point of multiplayer isn&#x27;t to allow hardcore fans to find ways to enjoy the game for 10+ years.  The point of multiplayer from the developer&#x27;s perspective is to lure in casuals and create a network effect (all my friends are playing X, so I&#x27;m gonna also learn and play X).  It&#x27;s more important for multiplayer games to be accessible to new players than single-player campaigns because it&#x27;s part of your growth flywheel and repeated failures are easier to deal with when you&#x27;re playing by yourself but SC2 gets this completely backwards.  Competitive multiplayer is absurdly challenging for new players, while single-player campaigns are significantly easier even at the hardest difficulty settings.')
