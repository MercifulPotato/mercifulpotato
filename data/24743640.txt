Not in the sense that they have some worldview and understanding in political systems, they just don&#x27;t rule with religion. So, I wasn&#x27;t taught much about religion in my studying years.<p>So, claims like &quot;Arab culture doesn&#x27;t value science&quot; and &quot;translated scientific literature into Arabic for political reasons, not for the pursuit of knowledge&quot;, would require me to read a lot in history to make a judgement.<p>For example, I know that the chemistry that existed in their days was actually alchemy, so I think it was reasonable for them to reject it.<p>The part of &quot;Translations were for political reasons&quot; needs a lot of research, or maybe I just don&#x27;t know about it.<p>I also think that those boundaries between cultures are almost gone by now. While there are some extreme groups (which I believe it does exist everywhere), young people here worship Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and old people have their version of Fox News. It is the same shit everywhere. They don&#x27;t have a &#x27;culture&#x27; or some philosophy to reject science using it as you might think. They know nothing about Islam, and they know nothing about science. That is the majority of people, not all of them of course.<p>I will exclude from that most of the young people who were active during the revolution. While the revolution changed us and made us more open to the world, it was a huge shock.

But a lot of people realized now that we need a real change and they will accept a lot of western ideas more than you think. But we saw the people getting killed in the streets, and the US supported the killer happily. So I don&#x27;t really know where the situation goes from here.')
