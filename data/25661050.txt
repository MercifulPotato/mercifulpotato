I agree with you that there is nothing new under the sun; that we just cycle back through old ideas; fashions come and go and come back.<p>However, the environment changes so often old ideas go from being &quot;possible&quot; to &quot;they just work&quot; or &quot;possible but really slow&quot; to &quot;instant&quot;.<p>These environmental changes can make orders of magnitude differences, and cause old ideas to suddenly feel very different in practice.<p>When I think of programming languages for example, of the languages you mention, a lot of their design (like matched brackets in XML), were decisions that made a lot of sense when we had monochrome editors, but now with extremely fast and advanced IDEs, we can take old PL ideas from the 50&#x27;s and design languages with IDEs in mind that are a lot less cryptic and concise.')
