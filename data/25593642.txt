I know I really only learned about dedicated message queues 1-2 years into my career and felt really dumb for not having known&#x2F;thought about message queuing before.<p>One thing you might consider adding are more examples for different popular queuing systems and how they differ from one another. The software I always reach for is nsq (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsq.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsq.io&#x2F;</a>) because it&#x27;s meant to run co-located with the message producers and readers are supposed to connect to multiple instances where the messages are produced (using a lookup daemon). This is quite different from the queues on your list, so much so that I&#x27;d consider adding it just because it works so differently.')
