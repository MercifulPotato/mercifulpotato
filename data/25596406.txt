Some of the items don&#x27;t even make sense as written. The fourth item, for example, has two huge issues. 1. It&#x27;s about Confluence, which is a <i>different</i> Atlassian product. There&#x27;s some Jira&#x2F;Confluence integration, but they are not the same thing. 2. &quot;you have to save the other user changes also and while viewing the confluence, if you want to edit, the user will be redirected to other pages.&quot; That sentence is gore.')
