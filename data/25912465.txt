With optical fiber and any land based radio, there is always obstructions to bend around, physical loses, ground clutter. Basically signal to noise is way higher with line of sight.<p>Higher SNR means lower bit error rate means deeper modulation (cutting edge is like 65536-QAM and maybe higher). Noisy channel coding theorem and all that.')
