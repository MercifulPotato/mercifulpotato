RCV (or any other system) at the state level is irrelevant, even dangerously counter-productive, since the electoral college is still FPTP in the end. You get just as much of a spoiler effect. I wonder if this is why MA&#x27;s bill this year specifically excludes RCV use for the presidential election.<p>Technically I suppose a state elector from a state with RCV could decide to cast their vote as though RCV were in effect? But that seems unlikely and unreliable.')
