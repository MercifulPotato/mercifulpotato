Item(by='arp242', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610124485, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685015, text='If I look at this list then I don&#x27;t really see any evidence of the allegations in your comment, and find your list of alleged examples to be highly cherry-picked and misleading.<p>Fox News&#x27; listing explicitly excludes politics and science; it&#x27;s listed as <i>&quot;Fox News (news excluding politics and science)&quot;</i>. And Fox News talk shows are red. This sounds about right. Many other entries are considerably more nuanced; Reason, for example, is listed as <i>&quot;generally reliable for news and facts. Editors consider Reason to be a biased or opinionated source that primarily publishes commentary, analysis, and opinion articles. Statements of opinion should be attributed and evaluated for due weight.&quot;</i> Again, this sounds about right for Wikipedia&#x27;s purpose.<p>Quite a few of the &quot;non-American&quot; examples you list are explicit propaganda outlets of authoritarian governments. I don&#x27;t see the problem with being careful with those. I don&#x27;t know about the Times of India specifically, but a number of other Indian publications are listed as green, such as The Hindu and The Indian Express. There is also the South China Morning Post with the comment that <i>&quot;additional considerations may apply for the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of certain topics, including the Chinese Communist Party and the SCMP&#x27;s current owner, Alibaba.&quot;</i><p>This is for the <i>English-language</i> Wikipedia, so it&#x27;s no surprise that English publications (i.e. the UK and US) dominate the list. And besides, there are many American and British entries that are listed as red or yellow: The Daily Mirror, Gawker, AlterNet,  Breitbart News, BuzzFeed, Cato Institute, CEPR, Cracked.com, The Daily Caller, HuffPost, New York Post, OANN, The Sun, and more.')
