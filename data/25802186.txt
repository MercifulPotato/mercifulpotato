This caused a sea-change in how biomedical research was organized.<p>One might naively expect that a massive injection of money would only make research easier. However, universities reacted by expanding dramatically. Many of those new hires, especially at med schools, are on &quot;soft money&quot; contracts, where they&#x27;re responsible for bringing in enough external grant money to cover their own salary AND research expenses. As a result, it has never been harder to get a research grant: success rates that were &gt;30% have slipped into the low teens at some institutes. At the same time, the size of the standard &quot;modular&quot; grant at the NIH hasn&#x27;t changed, so people are competing harder to get less inflation-adjusted money. On top of that, science is getting harder as we discover the easy stuff and expectations are rising for what constitutes &quot;a story.&quot;<p>In short, post-doubling science isn&#x27;t a professor pottering around between classes; it&#x27;s become a big, competitive business.')
