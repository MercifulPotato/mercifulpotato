That&#x27;s what all the adults said to do.<p>I tried already before I was six. Kept trying until I was sixteen. It never worked. It only got worse.<p>I ignored them, they pushed me down a flight of stairs and then beat me when I was trying to catch myself. I didn&#x27;t respond to them trying to pick a fight, they swept my legs so my head hit the stone floor and then sat on top of me hitting me.<p>Luckily, at sixteen I started upper secondary school and got away from the problem children. It was a technology programme and people were there because they&#x27;d actually chosen it. But it took years before I could be at least a bit less withdrawn and socially awkward.')
