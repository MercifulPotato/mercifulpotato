Most progress bars are about user experience and not so much about accuracy. People just want to know that there&#x27;s a long sequence of work and that progress is being made.<p>It&#x27;s often an illusion and showing too much how the sausage is made makes the user start asking questions about what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes.<p>That said, a long task that is prone to failure due to external factors should definitely be conveyed in the progress bar. If a bad network connection is affecting a process from finishing, you obviously want the user to know that so they don&#x27;t blame the software for being slow. :)')
