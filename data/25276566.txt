But it feels like aws is selling an unfinished product and people are wasting money and time working around non issues. Aws is great for medium sized projects but as soon as your project grows, you bump into silly issues like this one. Given that s3 is more or less a file storage you don’t really expect issues such as “weak” consistency. You expect a file to be committed once written (yes aws can do queueing behind the scenes) but when it returns a 200 ok it means the file was stored. Otherwise the good folks at aws should return a 202 accepted response as all properly designed apis do and let the user know that a delay in reading is expected.')
