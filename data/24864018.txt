Because of the &quot;crisis&quot; it has gotten really difficult to get them, even for people who need them.  There are days when it&#x27;s difficult to do much more than lie in bed in agony, but nobody beyond a small community of other pain sufferers seems to care.<p>I&#x27;m at least grateful for the few good years I <i>did</i> get thanks to opioids, before they became radioactive.  I hope some day we can swing the pendulum back toward compassion a bit.<p>Everybody seems to want politicians and cops (DEA) deciding who should get them and who shouldn&#x27;t.  That may be an impossible mindset to change.')
