Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604216804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957599, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re lucky(?) enough to be behind a NAT with enough hosts to be meaningful privacy-wise (dozens? hundreds?), and whoever&#x27;s running this NAT isn&#x27;t keeping logs about it (do they? honestly don&#x27;t know), then you might be seeing a significant privacy upside.<p>I worked out of a co-working space for a while that were explicit about not logging anything on their NATed shared internet connection. I saw more Google captchas using that (without a VPN) that I’d even see with TOR.  After I left, a friend I’d made there told me they eventually found out someone there was doing seriously blackhat seo stuff and they kicked him out. Took a few months but eventually all the captchas went away.')
