I wouldn&#x27;t say evil exactly, but I certainly do question your ethics and morals a bit.<p>Now, its important to note that I do not know your personal circumstances, so I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to tell you that you made bad choices or anything like that, but I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t silently (ok not so silently now, but you did ask) question your choices at least a little bit. At the end of the day, only you can know how moral you  are as a person, but if writing drivers helps evil company maintain its evil, then...<p>&gt; Is this worthy of social outcast?<p>Of course not, we&#x27;re all humans and unless you directly do evil acts, I wouldn&#x27;t say you should be socially outcast for it. But people will form opinions based on who you work for.')
