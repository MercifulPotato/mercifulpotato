It would take an impact like the one that produced the moon to finish us off. We&#x27;re so adaptable that some of us will survive and rebuild. If we can ever get back to technological civilization without easily accessible fossil fuels is debatable, but I think we&#x27;d find a way - it would just be a lot harder and take longer.<p>What worries me is not extinction, but societal collapse. We&#x27;ve seen how disruptive covid19 was, and it was a baby event compared to things that have happened in earth&#x27;s history.<p>Climate change and nuclear war both seem highly probable causes of societal collapse. Both are preventable if we can just find a way to not be collectively stupid. I don&#x27;t how we do that, but it&#x27;s insane we&#x27;re not trying harder.')
