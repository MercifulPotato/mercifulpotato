Ride share has plenty of issues and projected launch costs of $2M for Starship are on the theoretical side of things right now.<p>SpaceX needs to set aside a considerable amount of their launch capabilities for internal purposes (i.e. Starlink) and with expected double-digit grow rates in the small-sat market, there&#x27;s plenty of room for competition.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallsatnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;an-analysis-of-prospects-for-the-small-satellite-market&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallsatnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;an-analysis-of-prospects...</a>')
