What&#x27;s the # of the one about psychological projection?<p>I didn&#x27;t dwell on my <i>identity</i> (because those aren&#x27;t the words I&#x27;d choose to use if I had to). It was a way of self-disclosure like saying if you work for the company being discussed. It&#x27;s to say &quot;while I&#x27;m probably one of the people you&#x27;re talking about ...&quot;.<p>&gt; an attack on you personally so that you don&#x27;t feel a need to defend yourself from an imagined attack.<p>Oh, no. You&#x27;re out to left field. I&#x27;m explaining, not defending, <i>everyone</i> who tends to be misunderstood. I&#x27;m trying to say that people can support a thing without being &#x27;enablers&#x27;, and that two people who both see the same problems (police violence) can see different solutions.<p>I&#x27;m sharing my personal views to help explain how, regardless of labels, that most of our group hatreds are based on intentional (by others if not us) misstatements about the others, not their own words or actual views.')
