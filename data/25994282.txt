In all fairness I&#x27;ve never dealt with DBAs - I&#x27;ve always managed to get a technological freedom and be able to design and organize my databases in whichever way I see fit. I&#x27;d generally hate to have to ask someone to clone a table for me or whatever.<p>JSON is the standard way to ship data around the internet, yes. Though grpc is catching up and more and more often I see people relying on grpc in their architecture. And grpc conceptually is a lot closer to RDBM, given that you have a code generation step and everything in your data needs to be defined(aka statically typed).<p>Recently I started several personal projects and though I struggle to find time and motivation to work on them on my own, document related databases are completely out of the question. postgre and potentially redis as a proxy for heavy loads and that&#x27;s that.
