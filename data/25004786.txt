That $100M suddenly sounds a lot better to most people.<p>We can&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s 1% or 75%, but unless you&#x27;re very smart and conspire with a very small group of people, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to catch you. At the very least, you&#x27;d be on camera visiting your post office boxes (which you can&#x27;t use to register to vote in some places anyway).<p>&gt; <i>This point will address the &#x27;impossibility&#x27; of identifying likely voters</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s impossible to guess likely voters. It&#x27;s impossible to guess <i>highly unlikely</i> voters.<p>Likely voters follow a pattern: they voted before. Once someone votes, they&#x27;re likely to vote again.<p>Unlikely voters could just start voting in any election (as they did in this year&#x27;s) without any warning. There&#x27;s no psychographic or demographic information that&#x27;s widely available to hackers to help them decide which unlikely voters will continue to be non-voters.')
