The geeks just do the thing that they think is cool. The mops are there because the geeks are there. Since the geeks just do cool things, they have no trouble finding each other and doing cool things.<p>It&#x27;s the mops who have trouble. They&#x27;re always like &quot;X place used to be cool. There were all these people who did Y here&quot;. Well, those people are elsewhere and you don&#x27;t know it because you were never one of them. You were a groupie. So the mops always get annoyed at some point not because some lower class of mop arrived but because there is only so many of them that can exist without ruining their thing.<p>So, usually it&#x27;s earlier groupies complaining about later groupies.<p>&quot;Man, Oakland used to be full of artists&quot;<p>&quot;Oh yeah?
