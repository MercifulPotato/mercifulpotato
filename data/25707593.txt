That is such a vague and expansive term that can mean whatever those in power want it to mean. There are activists today that would say I am being &quot;hateful&quot; if I am concerned about the rising trend of gender dysphoria among young teenage women or if I think puberty blockers should not be used. Far-left radicals might call that hate, but everyone else would call it common sense. And that&#x27;s exactly why we shouldn&#x27;t have platforms that are large and influential picking what&#x27;s allowed and disallowed.<p>I also find this line disingenuous:<p>&gt; You can still say what you want, but nobody has to listen to you.<p>OK, if that&#x27;s the case, why can&#x27;t people say what they want on Twitter or Parler, and you can just not view the content you disagree with?')
