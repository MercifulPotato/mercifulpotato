Theoretically, it is more interesting.<p>That particular instance of those lyrics is public domain, as are any copies made from them, directly or indirectly.<p>If you independently happened to write identical lyrics, you would have copyright on those. That would be a worthless copyright though, because it would be almost impossible to ever do anything with it (hence, why I said &quot;practically, yes&quot;).<p>If you sued someone for infringement, the defendant would argue that you didn&#x27;t independently write identical lyrics. They would argue that even if you don&#x27;t remember ever seeing the public domain lyrics or a copy of them or hearing someone sing them, it is far more likely that you did and forgot than it is that you independently happened to come up with the same thing. They&#x27;d have no trouble bringing in experts to calculate the probability which would be in the &quot;not expected to happen in the short time the universe as existed&quot; range.<p>To overcome that, you&#x27;d have to be able to very thoroughly document that you really did independently write identical lyrics. Short of you having been away on an interstellar mission and able to prove that you wrote yours while the public domain ones were not in your past light cone, this will be difficult.<p>Even if the court decides that you really did independently create them, your case is still nearly impossible. The defendant would claim that they had seen or heard the public domain lyrics, and those are the ones they actually copied. Even if you could prove that they saw or heard yours too, even before they saw or heard the public domain ones, it would not be good enough. You&#x27;d have to prove that yours are the only ones they have seen.<p>At least in this case the worst that happens to you is that your copyright is worthless. If the original was not public domain, and you really did independently create something identical, you could end up being the one sued for copyright infringement, and you would probably lose.')
