I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s because of the weird MTU and CGNAT on the connections I&#x27;d like to bond (300Mbps up and down municipal-ish WiFi).<p>I was able to get two OpenMPTCProuter installations talking to each other, but downstream traffic wouldn&#x27;t balance across interfaces, and upstream was limited to 0.25-0.5Mbps (not a typo, and the links on their own have &gt;300Mbps capability). I&#x27;ll maybe try it again, but for now I have to add this to the pile of solutions that haven&#x27;t worked for me (including VyOS WAN aggregation, ZeroTier multipathing, and Wireguard and ECMP).')
