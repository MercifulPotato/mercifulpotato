However, a lot of the aggressive, confrontational rhetoric on both the left and right implicitly pushed the more action-oriented folks into making bad choices. So many of the &quot;peaceful&quot; protestors and even folks at home ramp up the rhetoric to the point where some confrontation is almost inevitable. Trump&#x27;s rhetoric is a great example, and obviously extremely influential on the right. But while they&#x27;re not as individually influential as Trump, there are firebrands on the left who do the same (AOC, Maxine Waters, Rashida Tlaib, many more on the state and local level).<p>And then even partisans who weren&#x27;t engaging in aggressive rhetoric often excused it as understandable, which creates a nice cover for the folks engaged in violence.<p>Legal responsibility, of course, ultimately rests with the rioters who did the deeds. But moral responsibility is more diffuse. Many, many more partisans need to examine the role that they&#x27;ve played in creating the conditions for conflict, on both the left and right.')
