After all, it&#x27;s private property.<p>Suppose it&#x27;s a white family but they&#x27;re wearing MAGA hats and the restaurant denies them service.  That&#x27;s nearly acceptable among a broad swath of the population today.<p>Now suppose it&#x27;s your mom wearing a MAGA hat (you may not like that she wears one but it&#x27;s her right, no?) and she gets denied service in a Starbucks.  Maybe someone gets violent with her and knocks the hat off her head.  Maybe the server spits in her coffee.  All of which has happened. Are you still comfortable with &quot;private property&quot;?<p>Suppose you wander into a restaurant wearing a &quot;Biden-Harris&quot; T-shirt and they say &quot;Get out!&quot;  Are you okay with that?<p>I could keep going, but you get the picture.  We can&#x27;t have a &quot;freedom for me, not for thee&quot; attitude.  It has to be universal.')
