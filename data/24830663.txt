Before this thread, I have never even contemplated a period having any meaning more than the end of a though. And I certainly had no position of authority, so that didn&#x27;t affect anything.<p>I am really curious how this evolved, and how I missed it being something people think. My biases tend to lean towards viewing people who don&#x27;t use punctuation and capitalization as being less professional. I couldn&#x27;t care less in something like a random chat in discord. But for Slack, as a work tool, I prefer to stay &quot;professional&quot;.<p>I wonder what other seemingly unspoken biases are out there? Especially in a time where we are spending much more time in text instead of in person.')
