It did not correctly identify acute myocardial infarction and probable COVID-19 infection, but they were in the differential.<p>The software needs to be better at taking medical history. It doesn&#x27;t try to figure out the symptoms. I input <i>abdominal pain</i> and instead of asking where it hurts and what the pain feels like it asked me if I have dyspepsia. I input <i>chest pain</i> and it asked me if I have angina pectoris.<p>How is a patient supposed to know? These are conclusions the doctor is supposed to reach based on the signs, symptoms, physical examination and tests.<p>I clicked on the information button for angina pectoris. Here&#x27;s what it says:<p>&gt; Angina pectoris is a term that describes chest pain due to myocardial ischemia.<p>&gt; It is a common presenting symptom among patients with coronary artery disease.<p>It says nothing about what the pain is like. There&#x27;s no way a patient would know.<p>I decided to make it easy for the software by answering yes to the above question... Myocardial infarction was the fourth item in the differential! It thinks pheochromocytoma is more likely.<p>&gt; Is there enlargement of the liver?<p>&gt; Is there generalized Lymphadenopathy?<p>&gt; Is there enlargement of the spleen?<p>&gt; Is there atrial fibrillation?<p>&gt; Is there cardiac arrhythmia?<p>How would they know? Are people supposed to perform a physical examination on themselves? People go to medical school in order to learn how to do this. I&#x27;ve seen people who don&#x27;t know where the liver and spleen are.')
