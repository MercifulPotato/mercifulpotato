The JS-future for WordPress is more to do with the editing experience than anything else -- the entire rendering pipeline, backend, and rest API is still PHP, and I&#x27;m not aware of any plans to change that.<p>The main difference with the future of WordPress is that instead of templates (which describe the structure of a site) being written in PHP, they will be written as blocks so that they are user-editable. I would say it&#x27;s more apt to say that &quot;blocks&quot; are the future of WordPress. The block editing experience is written in JS, but serialized block markup is backwards compatible with HTML, so no JS is needed to render blocks once they are serialized.')
