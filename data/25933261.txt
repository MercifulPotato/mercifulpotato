You get exposure to the One True Way of doing things.<p>That&#x27;s exactly my feeling when I was watching Jon Gjengset&#x27;s Rust tutorials. I like his real reactions to unexpected problems. Really learned a lot from this kind of lengthy but realistic videos. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;JonGjengset&#x2F;featured" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;JonGjengset&#x2F;featured</a>')
