Nat:<p>* Complied with a DMCA take-down request which he had no legal reason to comply with. DMCA takedown requests are for infringing content. DMCA bans anticircumvention measures, but that&#x27;s between youtube-dl and RIAA. RIAA does that by initiating litigation, or sending a demand letter to the youtube-dl project.<p>* Took down forks of youtube-dl, which he had no reason to do. Those should have been independent DMCA requests.<p>* Threatened to ban users who forked youtube-dl, in violation of his own ToS and DMCA policy.<p>If Nat was doing the bare minimum required to maintain legal compliance, I wouldn&#x27;t fault him. Legally, he&#x27;s zealously pursuing youtube-dl and acting as the RIAA&#x27;s lapdog. At the same time, he&#x27;s publicly making statements of empathy towards youtube-dl.<p>Pathetic.')
