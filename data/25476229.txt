Every week I look through their search for words i filter on and sample all the songs (40-100 songs, maybe takes 1-2 hours at most) and download them if I like them (some weeks none, some weeks more than others), follow the artist if I like more than a couple (and what they are liking and re-posting), and occasionally pay the artist directly for files even if I already downloaded it.<p>I stream from my computer to my phone when I&#x27;m at home over the local network in the browser and thru a cheap vpn from my computer when I&#x27;m not (and&#x2F;or just copy a random sample to my phone when I don&#x27;t wanna pay for the bandwidth) if I know long enough a head of time.<p>Deff wont show up in billboards statsâ€¦ nor have to deal with the misalignment of incentives when listening to music on the soundcloud trying to push a song from their algos an artist&#x2F;agency paid them to do (or ads).')
