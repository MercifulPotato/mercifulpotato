Item(by='sn_master', descendants=None, kids=[25425203], score=None, time=1607989038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424772, text='The cop gave me a ride to the ED&#x2F;ER after the accident, and the dr literally said &quot;your x-ray is fine, take Tylenol or Ibuprofen&quot; and just opened the door and left! Didn&#x27;t talk to him more than two minutes total before and after the x-ray. They charged me 1,008 USD for that! The X-Ray itself was a separate charge by Radia and was just twenty bucks!<p>The nurse said the pain should improve within a week, but its been so already and I am still in pain even when I breath or move my arm up.<p>I&#x27;ll tough it up for another week before seeing a Dr. I can handle the pain (had double kidney stones, one in each kidney before).<p>Ah, also, FYI for folks in the US: Do not reject Personal Injury Protection. The insurance agent told me my primary insurance will cover me, but then the hospital and my lawyer said that&#x27;s false and insurance companies reject to pay hospital bills for auto-accidents. Later, they said they&#x27;ll try to get a formal denial from my auto-insurance first and then try and see if my primary insurance will pay for it.')
