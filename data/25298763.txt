Maybe Pfizer can&#x27;t because of lawsuits or something, but experts could certainly weigh in for articles like this. It seems like we&#x27;re afraid of trusting people with the best info we have because we&#x27;re worried they&#x27;ll stop wearing masks and throw parties and such. I don&#x27;t think withholding info is a great way to build trust.<p>Health experts should feel empowered to say &quot;We think X but only with (let&#x27;s say) 10% certainty&quot; because there&#x27;s no study specifically on this topic for COVID. They can always add &quot;without 100% certainty we need to all continue to wear masks because that the stakes are so severe on hospitalizations and death.&quot;<p>Instead, it seems like they hold back info out of concern the public cannot be trusted.')
