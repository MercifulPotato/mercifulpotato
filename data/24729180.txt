I made a Matt Levine insider trading game [1]. It was inspired by a Matt Levine article [2] where he mentioned how some professional traders had access to early earnings but even with that data, they were still highly inconsistent in their trade performance. The point was stock prices are notoriously difficult to predict even with early earnings.<p>So I made this app where you get early earnings and a graph of prior stock prices and you try to guess one of two paths (they were inverse of each other). Even with all of those myself (and Matt Levine) were correct about 50% of the time.<p>I emailed him and he actually told me he was worse than 50% , which seems like a good thing because then you could just do opposite of your initial guess and have a profitable strategy. He was very nice in his correspondence, although he didn&#x27;t give me a heads up saying he was going to blast it out. It&#x27;s a static site [3] so it wasn&#x27;t a problem, nor do I really care too much. But it gave me the ultimate flex when another super-fan at work spotted it and spammed it out.<p>From the article.<p>&gt; Elsewhere here is “Matt Levine’s Insider Trading Game,” though I actually have nothing to do with it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-12-16&#x2F;we-kept-almost-making-money" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-12-16&#x2F;we-kep...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insider-trading-game.netlify.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insider-trading-game.netlify.app&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-11-26&#x2F;knowing-the-future-isn-t-that-helpful" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-11-26&#x2F;knowin...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breeko&#x2F;stox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;breeko&#x2F;stox</a>')
