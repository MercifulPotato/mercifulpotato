Features&#x2F;bugs exist in a survival of the fittest world and the lowest priority ones never get built&#x2F;fixed. This was one of the big problems with &quot;hero in the back office coding for months and emerging with a product&quot;.<p>The tiny tasks model also lets you ship updates to the end user much faster and also ensures the product is never in a half-broken state. It&#x27;s also more robust when you don&#x27;t have a team of all-star programmers.<p>I agree that building big projects on your own (or with a tiny team of motivated folks and no mandated meetings) is way more fun and sometimes far more productive. But that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s important to incorporate things like hackathons and prototype phases into the engineering department. Each software development model has its strengths and should be used when appropriate.')
