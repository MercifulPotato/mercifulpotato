The continued growth of Vimeo and even YouTube show this as well.<p>&gt; Advertising isn&#x27;t the only solution but it does allow viewers to watch without paying.<p>False.<p>&gt; PeerTube needs content creators to get on board.<p>If by &quot;content creators&quot; you mean Fuck Jerry Media or whoever, then no, it really doesn&#x27;t. If by &quot;content creators&quot; you just mean &quot;those who create content without the expectation of financial gain&quot; then PeerTube is doing ok.<p>&gt; Having options for monetizing content could encourage creators to use PeerTube.<p>Again, if &quot;How do I monetize this?&quot; is your primary reason for the content, maybe the content doesn&#x27;t need to be there. That&#x27;s the point that people are missing.<p>If your goal is &quot;make money&quot; instead of &quot;share useful information&quot; then you are part of this problem.')
