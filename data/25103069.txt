Counter claiming and appealing leads to a byzantine support hell that widely favors larger content corps, much like YouTube. But even in the case of false takedowns, your only recourse is the legal system, which is simply way to expensive to access for most Twitch steamers.<p>And good luck to you if you get three of them and a ban before you have a chance to respond and appeal.
