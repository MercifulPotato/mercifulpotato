In theory it shouldn’t. However in practice it often is incredibly shameful, and we all sympathise with that.<p>Even your own internal song about a diagnosis can have vast negative consequences.<p>Friends and family can treat you like a pariah: for example many people will consciously choose not to let Reese near their kids because of some diagnoses.<p>Even worse the effects of being labelled (ignoring the effects of a mental issue) can be subtle and hard to see because they are socially hidden, or they are subconscious, so that one is left questioning why things happened the way they did.<p>I agree, it can often be positive. But I have friends that have been given labels, and who I’ve witnessed negative outcomes for them, well beyond those caused by their “illness”.<p>The idea is to get help even though it is scary... especially for suicidal thoughts. Not seeking help is very likely to be extremely harmful to many people.<p>Edit:<p>One can choose to hide a condition from friends or family, but that has other consequences, such as making one more distant or detached.<p>Yes, <i>get help</i>, but keep your eyes open and get good advice on how to share everthing with your friends and family, in the best manner you can find.<p>More positively, vulnerability often makes you closer to friends and with a small amount of luck helps you be a better person e.g. less judgemental about others.<p>All the best, there is a lot of love out there for most everyone.')
