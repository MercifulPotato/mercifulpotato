Often it might not even be possible to find an example that covers the majority of some group&#x2F;trend&#x2F;phenomenon (or know what constitutes a majority in the first place).<p>Maybe this means to be more judicious in making general statements (probably not a bad idea). But in some respects, for example a trend among recent occurrences of something, you have nothing but isolated events to discuss in the first place. Even if there is some objective quality behind it, requiring yourself to never refer to individual data points (as that could be construed as weak-manning) might make it impossible to get at the core of it. And that&#x27;s before going into how your arguments are perceived.<p>And yes, the above is intentionally (overly) general. Examples would help illustrating the argument, but are immediately subject to weak-manning. I wonder what others think on this.')
