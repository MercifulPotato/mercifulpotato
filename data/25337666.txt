Albeit highly immoral.<p>Stupid people are easier to manipulate, especially if you continue to commercially bombard them with information coming from all different sources. And if you control all the channels that they see, then they have no alternate reality. Heck, this applies to seemingly smart people also, if they don’t reach out to different sources for a balanced view of information.<p>This is now becoming very true with ad networks like Google’s ad monopoly. Regardless of what website you visit, the ads all come from the same source.<p>So now, one use case for this is political manipulation. You can start to target people of a certain IQ range, to get them to think the same way, which can then ultimately coerce them to vote a specific way.<p>So now, you have a direct pathway, from planting a seed of an idea, to political manipulation, to actual physical reality.<p>This is now starting to sound like the premise of The Outer Limits.<p>But hey, morality never stopped aspiring entrepreneurs from making a billion dollars.')
