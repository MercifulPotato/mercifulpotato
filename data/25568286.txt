Last time I&#x27;ve used IElixir (Elixir kernel for Jupyter) to give a presentation (using the Rise extension) it was actually very easy to setup but it wasn&#x27;t able to &quot;stream&quot; cell output to the UI, apparently it was &quot;waiting&quot; to have gathered all outpout of a cell before displaying it. Maybe Niex will be better at that?<p>A notebook server being a heavily asynchronous application, it makes a lot of sense to build one using Elixir. It would be a dream come true if Niex could be compatible with the Jupyter kernel protocol to integrate with kernels that already exist for other languages and also compatible with Jupyter frontend extensions. Basically it could replace the Tornado app while leveraging the rest of the existing Jupyter ecosystem. Easier said than done obviously ;-)')
