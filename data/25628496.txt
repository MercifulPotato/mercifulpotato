What’s the reasoning there? Seems slightly inconvenient to have to “hack” OBS to make the output stream work. Will FTL support be merged into OBS in the future?<p>If you’re just trying to avoid the latency of RTMP then I might suggest considering the existing SRT protocol[1]. It’s been open source for a while and is well-established(native support in OBS core and optional in FFMPEG). Seems to already solve a lot of the transport-level stuff that you’re working on with FTL.<p>[1] Secure Reliable Transport: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Haivision&#x2F;srt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Haivision&#x2F;srt</a>')
