I build models, and so used to frequent forums to post to build threads detailing what I&#x27;d done with photos, sometimes a Word doc, video, and always some plain text.<p>Problem with the forums is that they&#x27;re dated. It&#x27;s easy enough to find old content because search is usually pretty ok. Who owns content is still not a solved thing though. A forum in Germany insists you upload your IP to their servers so that your photos don&#x27;t disappear over time. Other forums let me host my hosts on my own web site with a link.<p>Facebook of course is godawful. Everybody is there, so everybody posts there. Unforunately you cannot find old stuff you know is there. Photos aren&#x27;t annotated, comments aren&#x27;t searcheable, stuff just disappears into a rabbit hole. Here today, gone tomorrow. Facebook&#x27;s content is ephemeral, so it&#x27;s groups are the worst possible forum replacement.<p>And from what I can tell (I can&#x27;t start my own group to assess features) Mobilizon doesn&#x27;t add anything to improve on what Facebook already does.<p>What&#x27;s needed is an organic heirarchical taxonomy where you&#x27;re persented with a top-level list of options. Say for instance manufacturers. You pick one, and are given a list of models. Pick one of those and you see all models in the repository for that make&#x2F;model. Lastly (in my contrived example) you might choose your favourite model maker to further narrow that list, or a date, country or whatever.<p>This is not hard to build (modellers are pretty hardcore about what they build, and so would not hesitate to add the meta data needed to drive this), and I&#x27;ve been toying with a usable UI for it for some time. Maybe I should post up a proof of concept somewhere...')
