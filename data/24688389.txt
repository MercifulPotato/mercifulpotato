An ever changing list of what, exactly, could be sold, or could not be sold, and fines for anyone who breaks it? That seems rather problematic too. Convenience stores having to tell customers they can&#x27;t buy knick knacks, grocery stores telling customers they can&#x27;t buy cards or flowers, etc. It was unpleasant enough for workers to deal with customers irate at only being able to purchase 2 things of toilet paper; I can&#x27;t even imagine what trying to prevent the purchase, at all, of things the stores stocked would have caused.')
