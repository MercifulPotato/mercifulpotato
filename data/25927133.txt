I did this in school, I did this at university, I do it now at work.<p>At some point, I think it was the second year of university, it occurred to me that I was the <i>only one asking questions</i> in my physics class. And then it slowly dawned on me that this wasn&#x27;t restricted to this particular class! Come to think of it, I seemed to be the only student doing any talking.<p>I turned a bit red in the face and realised I might have been making a fool of myself. After the lecture I quietly slinked over to the professor and privately apologised for wasting his time with so many questions.<p>He had this confused look on his face and then he very quickly corrected me: &quot;Oh no! You have it <i>all wrong!</i> We <i>love</i> it when students ask questions! That means they&#x27;re engaged and listening!&quot;<p>I actually didn&#x27;t entirely believe him, until ten years later when I was teaching a bunch of junior techs how to program in PowerShell. I was faced with a room full of blank stares and slow blinking. Except for one guy. He kept asking questions. Question after question.<p>I loved that guy: I knew he was listening. I knew he was trying to understand.<p>In that moment, I finally understood my university professor&#x27;s comment.')
