During quarantine, out of my love for motherhood and science, I created and published a science book for young kids (ages 3-7) promoting actual science activity play in real life. The book has simple, graphical instructions on how young kids can set up and play with 12 fun science activities at home - having minimal parental support, promoting independence and decision making!   A QR Code links to a Youtube video creating a holistic experience of the activity through another type of media. We use household items only providing science that is affordable for all families! The book has suggestions on how each activity can be extended and kid-friendly explanations, so even non-science related parents can spontaneously play with science activities.<p>Check it out, I hope you like it&#x2F; find it useful and if you have any feedback, please let me know:)<p>Thank you so much')
