Modern medical red tape exists because our approach to risk is extremely one-sided; we punish regulators only when something bad happens that we think they could have prevented, not when something good fails to happen that they could have enabled. For example, the FDA took ten years longer than European regulators to approve beta blockers for people at risk for heart attacks. A rough estimate is that 100,000 heart attacks were suffered by Americans during those ten years that could have been prevented. But no regulator got punished for allowing those 100,000 deaths to happen.')
