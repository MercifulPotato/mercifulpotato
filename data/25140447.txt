You can even generate new terms out of nothing (because <i>b = b + 0</i> and <i>0 = a + (-a)</i>) to obtain a specific form. The simplist example I can think of is completing the square:<p>To get minimum of <i>x^2 + 2x + 2</i>:<p><pre><code>  x^2 + 2x         + 2  =\n  x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1 + 2  =\n     (x+1)^2      + 1\n  because (x+1)^2 &gt;= 0, minimum is 1\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s important that equivalences like <i>ax+bx = (a+b)x</i> can be applied in either direction - not just in the left-to-right, <i>simplifying</i> direction of factoring, but also the right-to-left direction of expansion.<p>BTW If always &quot;simplifying&quot;, the process is contained, and the possibilities are limited.  But because of expansion and generation, it is unconstrained, and can be anything.<p>I think of &quot;definitions&quot; as defining the meanings of new syntax - in effect, they are lemmas. Can you elaborate on what you  mean by them?<p>BTW the option to automatically apply simplifications would be useful in an assistent tool. But what I&#x27;m aiming at is a facilitation of each tiny tedious step - so it&#x27;s not quite as tedious, but you aren&#x27;t skipping anything.')
