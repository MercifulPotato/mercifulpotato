They also killed off 32-bit games, which further reduced the PC game landscape on macOS.<p>However, Apple has its own massive ecosystem of game devs on iOS, and it also has Apple Arcade.<p>If a PC game isn&#x27;t on iOS, you may have to rely on cloud gaming if you want to play it on macOS in the future - which may not be much worse than the current situation of mediocre ports.')
