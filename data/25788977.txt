I am aware of what it means to speed up such an object, as you approach c you need more and more energy, it &quot;feels&quot; as your mass is increasing. What surprises me is that this effect would extend to objects outside?<p>This seems surprising to me. By the same logic, if an object moved at speed of light it would have infinite mass and unless gravity is not proportional to mass, you would have infinite gravity.')
