There&#x27;s really no substitute (in my opinion) for the experience if you watch movies and have a compatible receiver&#x2F;amplifier. A large and well-designed subwoofer is incredibly noticeable as well depending on your use case. It can easily sound better than the large majority of seats in your average theater which aren&#x27;t ideally positioned without spending too much.')
