That&#x27;s good security.<p>If a company had a pen tester send what appears to be a perfectly legitimate message to employees offering them a company bonus for responding (during a worldwide pandemic where everyone is short on money), and then says it was a pen test and they&#x27;ve failed, that company is awful and heartless.
