Item(by='Dumblydorr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608737054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25517868, text='Spotify mobile has weird issues for me. I&#x27;ll be playing podcast A, then when I switch to podcast B, the display on the bottom gets stuck on A. I can still use buttons, but unless I restart the app, it will always keep podcast A on display. It&#x27;ll even keep the timestamp I was on for A, even if I start a new podcast fresh. Mildly annoying...<p>In terms of recs, it does ok. There are weeks when every discover Weekly track is bizarre ambient music or very quiet music, like I&#x27;m supposed to be a spa owner. Then sometimes it has delivered great tracks. But as a musician, it&#x27;s very rare for me to find new gems, I&#x27;ve heard of so many via friends, class, YT, etc.<p>Overall, spotify is great, but the app and algorithm could use improvement.')
