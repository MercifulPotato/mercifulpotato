There’s a bunch of “how to” videos on YouTube plus I was anyway watching a lot of comedy.<p>The pattern I’ve seen when people start standup seems to go like this ...<p>Extroverts who are comfortable in front of people tend to try to “wing it” and don’t prepare material.<p>Introverts (like me) tend to work harder on the material and actually having good jokes. This can be advantageous but you have to put the work in preparing. If you’ve ever done a talk at a conference or otherwise, that probably helps.<p>What’s interesting about comedy is it seems to exploit a “bug” in the way the human brain works. The most basic form of a standup joke is basically; 1. Create tension for the audience, 2. Release the tension with surprise<p>... there’s plenty of material online explaining this and I even read somewhere that there are only something like 21 possible joke structures to make a crowd laugh.<p>What I love about comedy is it’s a craft, much like programming. The goal is to make a room full of people laugh at the same time but there are so many variables that can influence that, there is no single solution to the problem... hence it’s a craft.')
