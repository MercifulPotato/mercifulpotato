The stuff I listed, like addiction, other medical issues, and the failings of the system aren&#x27;t personal faults.<p>&quot;I think you are vastly underestimating how easy it is to go from poor to homeless.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve made no such claim. My claim is that finding food is probably not the main problem keeping homeless people homeless. You&#x27;re talking about poor -&gt; homeless, I&#x27;m talking about other direction of homeless -&gt; poor (in response to the parent comment). Food may be a component, but I think it&#x27;s more likely issues in the system like not hiring people with a record, medical or addiction issues, or just not being able to afford housing due to lack of good employment, property taxes. These are quite expensive compared to food and lack the level of charity and government support that is given to food (SNAP, WIC, food pantries, etc), not to mention individuals are more likely to give someone a meal than a place to stay or a job.')
