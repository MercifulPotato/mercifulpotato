There&#x27;s a core of good ones, especially those that are most commonly used, but quite a few make bad design decisions like an over-reliance on images for styling. This is often much easier to work around than is probably obvious and maybe that&#x27;s part of the problem, more experienced developers likely habitually sidestep the parts that don&#x27;t work well. But on the other hand, it&#x27;s quite a bit of work to revamp them (including documentation and dealing somehow with breaking changes it would introduce), unfortunately that has kept us from seriously addressing it so far.')
