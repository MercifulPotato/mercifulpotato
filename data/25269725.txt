[1]<p>A few things have changed. One is in choice few major metros, like SF, city councils abjectly refuse to allow new construction taller than existing construction to the benefit of landowners. This artificial supply constraint is pretty much solely responsible for the massive increase in pricing in these metros.<p>The other thing that’s changed is minimum setback rules, minimum sizing rules, and various other council ordinances - in addition to what Americans consider a suitable home for their living situation. As such new homes are on average twice as big now as they were in the 1970s.<p>Make no mistake though the average price per square foot for a home in the United States has tracked inflation almost precisely for the last 50 years.<p>This is purely supply, demand and artificial constraints - not monetary policy. Compare to Tokyo where housing downtown is a few hundred thousand dollars. I suspect if interest rates were lower you’d see smaller houses, not cheaper ones - that’s what happened there!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-homes-today-have-twice-the-square-feet-per-person-as-in-1973&#x2F;amp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-homes-today-have-twice-the-squa...</a>')
