It has nothing to do with selfishness. The government could never impose it, and they knew that. In the US many rights are near absolute in almost all circumstances, including the current ones.<p>You may disagree with those freedoms but they are a matter of law. They cannot be erased when they are inconvenient, it would render the judiciary irrelevant.')
