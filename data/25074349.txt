Linux supports this through the `ip` command (look for initcwnd). This, however, requires root rights and affects the whole network device. Google submitted a patch to the linux kernel that would have allowed tweaking the initcwn from userspace for individual connections; however it got rejected and never made it upstream (for good reasons).<p>See, the problem is, if the initcwnd is set higher on OSes by default, you risk introducing more packet loss, and at the same time reducing everybodys network throughput - if you send more data than the network path to your destination can handle (i.e. full router buffers along the way, more data than client can receive etc.). TCPs congestion control is pretty smart about avoiding congestion or increasing load in already congested networks. So yes, you can set a higher initcwnd, but if everybody was about to increase it by a significant factor, chances are networks become slower for everyone, without anyone benefiting.<p>Long story short, the limitations of TCP for HTTP are known and the major motivation for QUIC (over UDP), that will allow Browser vendors (Google) and server operators (Google, but also other large players like Facebook etc.) to just &quot;give a shit&quot; about others and put as much pressure on the network as they want in order to bring latency down. Once Chrome rolls out with HTTP&#x2F;3 support, Google couldn&#x27;t care less what the linux kernel devs or IEEE network engineers have to say.')
