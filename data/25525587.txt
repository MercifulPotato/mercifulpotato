Item(by='wruza', descendants=None, kids=[25525969], score=None, time=1608793294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524483, text='&gt;open should be preferred and promoted<p>And I’m saying that preference is a function of many parameters, and you can’t change preferences by just promoting a new parameter to the public. They’ll still have other important (to them) unrelated concerns with more weight. What we think it should or should not be is effectively irrelevant to their minds. To catch them, open IMs should have their whistles on top of regular bells, not instead. This looks like a strawman because it addresses (I believe) a wrong premise.')
