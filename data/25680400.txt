This problem can in principle be alleviated by innovative reactor types, but realistically they won&#x27;t be available for large-scale production in the next couple years.<p>You either have to use seawater uranium or use breeder reactors of any fuel cycle. If you use both, uranium will last on the order of how long the nuclear fusion fuel of the sun will last (i.e. billions of years).<p>Most importantly, you don&#x27;t need to only build breeder reactors right now. The &quot;won&#x27;t be ready in 10 years, forgetaboutit&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t really stand, especially as we look to powering direct carbon capture tech alongside decarbonizing a growing world.<p>National nuclear energy programs have always and will always consider a transition to breeder reactors essential for any meaningful long-term energy source. This has been the known plan since the mid-1940s.<p>Fun fact (pointed out to me by user pfdietz): If you dig up any average rock on earth, it has more energy in nuclear fuel (uranium and thorium) than a piece of pure coal of the same mass. WOW!<p>I wrote up a little page on this recently (featuring GNU Units if you saw that article yesterday): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020-10-28-nuclear-energy-is-longterm-sustainable.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020-10-28-nuclear-energy-is-...</a>')
