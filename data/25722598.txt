Yes those who were violent should be arrested, investigated, etc.  But I&#x27;d argue half the country doesn&#x27;t agree that the mobs intent was on killing members of congress.  And that&#x27;s the issue.  You view it from that perspective, and from that perspective it makes sense to ban everything.

That certainly seems a lot more like inciting violence than Trump saying to head down the street.  As violence started to break out Trump tweeted that they should remain peaceful.  Followed up by a video saying go home in peace.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;amp.usatoday.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;6568305002" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;amp.usatoday.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;6568305002</a>')
