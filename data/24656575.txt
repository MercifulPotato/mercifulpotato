Look up his history. Evidence speaks for itself but too many are lazy to look it up.<p>&gt; That whys he&#x27;s anti China<p>Umm. I hate to spoiler your preconceived notions but China&#x27;s method of governing is absolutely terrifying to a free society. uighur? Great leap forward causalities?<p>Aside from the gaslighting on my part, realize this. China has been <i>known</i> as a global threat for at least 20 years. I was taught this from my science teacher. He told us &#x27;two issues your generation will face; China and water&#x27;.<p>America has it&#x27;s own issues and there is a large segment of the US that believe in Isolationism. FDR led the way there (with failings too).<p>These issues are complicated and not simple but it&#x27;s still sad that we&#x27;re seeing World Police Officer be also the function of the US POTUS.<p>P.S. Since HN seems to be anti-anything related to Trump. Let me make it clear. I&#x27;m a FDR&#x2F;Bernie democrat. I voted Green Party last election and will this one too. Trump&#x27;s policies (and lack thereof) aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive to Trump.')
