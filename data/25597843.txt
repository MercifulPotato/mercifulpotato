There are security design considerations, and security <i>issues</i>.  Telnet being plaintext is not a security issue for telnet, it&#x27;s a security issue for those using telnet for something it&#x27;s unsuited for.  HTTP being unencrypted is not a security issue for the HTTP protocol, or an application that wants to support that (a browser), but it may be for an application that makes requests over HTTP instead of HTTPS when those requests require some level of privacy.<p>If an application has a design goal to be secure in some aspect, but the design they chose doesn&#x27;t accomplish that, then the design itself is a bug and needs to be fixed (or they need to change their design goals).  Buggy designs exist, they&#x27;re the designs that don&#x27;t fulfill the desired purpose.<p>All security issues in a the context of a project which intends to provide security in that aspect are bugs.')
