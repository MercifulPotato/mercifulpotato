If you ever want to change that button you can just update it and be done. If you want a button with different padding add btn px-8 and you’re done.<p>If you’re using components then you just create the button in a single place and reuse it. If you have custom requirements for the button then you override it.<p>It’s really quite simple and easy to do everything you’re describing. I’d read the docs and watch some videos on it and start working with it instead of against it.<p>Or don’t use it at all, makes no difference to me!')
