Item(by='DharmaPolice', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602177613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718378, text='I agree this is an interesting topic.<p>You&#x27;re right that the pool of moderators + meta-moderators was the same, but I think there&#x27;s value in a kind of &quot;peer review&quot; for voting. On Reddit almost everyone (who expresses an opinion) complains that people use downvotes to disagree but I suspect that even the people complaining about it do the same thing from time to time (even if they rationalise it). Sometimes it&#x27;s helpful for someone not involved in the argument to judge what you&#x27;ve done, even if that person is quite like you. It&#x27;s pretty easy to imagine excluding anyone who replied to that same thread from meta moderating (or maybe doing something more sophisticated than that). It&#x27;s not really about the trolls upvoting ASCII swastikas but the people regularly downvoting otherwise OK posts because they dislike someone&#x27;s argument or their name or what they said in a completely different conversation. Or maybe it&#x27;s about people upvoting low effort content (but for that to work, you would have different people metamoderating like you say).<p>It&#x27;s hard to judge based on outcomes but I always felt Slashdot made you think about voting in a slightly different way. The system as it was there wouldn&#x27;t work with Reddit for a variety of reasons but it&#x27;s still useful to think about.')
