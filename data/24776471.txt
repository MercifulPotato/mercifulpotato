I don&#x27;t get why American TV shows always need to be ran to the ground.<p>Like Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory are shows that should&#x27;ve gone past their 8th season. The Office  should&#x27;ve never had those abysmal last two-three seasons. That &#x27;70s show should&#x27;ve never had those abysmal last three seasons.<p>I always like it when creators and producers recognize when a show has run its course. This is why we have good memories of Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld stood to make something crazy like 5 million per episode if they had done a 10th season but he knew the show had run its course and ended it on a high note (something, btw, that was a plot point on an earlier episode).<p>Same with Breaking Bad, they knew that they had a story to tell and that it didn&#x27;t need to drag on and they delivered some of the finest 5 seasons of television drama that one could ever ask for.')
