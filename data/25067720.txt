Newest Macbooks already had CPUs and memory soldered in to the motherboard for quite some time. And this doesn&#x27;t make them unrepairable because most of the motherboard issues don&#x27;t come from a faulty CPU or memory, but from corrosion&#x2F;other kind of damage on the smaller discrete elements like resistors, capacitors or smaller chips, which can easily be replaced if you know what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s not something that you can do at home without equipment, but there are a lot of repair shops that can repair even the newest Macbooks with high success rate.')
