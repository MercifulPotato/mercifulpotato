I do believe however that we non-Americans are also to blame. We consume American media like there&#x27;s no tomorrow and don&#x27;t support our local media even barely enough.<p>The great advantage America has for spreading their culture is its single official language. It&#x27;s able to echo within the country, gain a large following and then spread outside of its borders. Europe has done nothing like that.<p>Ever since the European Union was made, there has been no successful attempt to find a common language in order to unify the countries lingually. It&#x27;s not a surprise due to the divisive history, but I strongly believe that Esperanto could&#x27;ve been that language. Of course, it&#x27;s too late now and English (especially American English) has become the virtual lingua franca, but that means Europe (and other countries) should learn from the U.S.<p>What the U.S has is practically a large propaganda machine that blasts its views across the world. The entertainment industry (film, music, news) is large and the major window into American life. It&#x27;s available everywhere at either no cost or when the demand is large, at a premium.<p>I&#x27;d say other countries should:<p>- subsidize their entertainment industry heavily<p>- expand their education to provide world-wide<p>- do away with geo-blocking and exclusivity<p>- have <i></i>free<i></i> national programs to help learn their language from anywhere in the world<p>and last, but definitely most importantly: educate their populace to think logically and to broaden their horizons to think out of the box.<p>Culture, tradition and language are in a product in today&#x27;s capitalistic world. If you do not make your product attractive, appealing, and available, people will not buy it. The U.S has understood that and are doing a mighty fine job at exporting it.')
