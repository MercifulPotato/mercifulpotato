The creative coding framework I&#x27;ve been meaning to check out for years but never have! But the things (hah) made in it have always amazed me!<p>So one bit of feedback on the site: it&#x27;s fantastic as a portfolio site. However, while it&#x27;s great for getting an impression for everything made with this framework and how large the framework is, what is missing is a big &quot;START HERE&quot; button.<p>I get why that might feel like something you don&#x27;t need: th.ing is set up differently than Processing, p5.js, OpenFrameworks or any game-loop based creative coding framework. So there is no real centralized starting point. Which is fine, but then <i>that has to be clearly communicated too</i>, and it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s mentioned in very thin fine print under the <i>How?</i> section, which is hidden under a &quot;read more&quot; link when viewing the website on mobile (also, I do get that <i>thi.ng&#x2F;umbrella</i> is kind of emphasized as an implicit suggested starting point, but it&#x27;s still a bit confusing).<p>So basically, the discoverability for how people should get into the framework could use a lot of improvement. It could use a bit more awareness of expectations of your visitors and how you either meet or break those.')
