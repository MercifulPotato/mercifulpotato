Like being able to use Git. I can confirm, for example, how long a typo has existed in my book by looking at the Git history. Maybe that&#x27;s a bit academic, but you get the point. I have the complete history of everything I&#x27;ve ever written.<p>Another example: because formatting is reified in Markdown, I can grep for it. Did I misuse italics? With one command I can find every single place where I used italics in my entire book. I don&#x27;t think you can even do that in Word. Good luck reading a multi-hundred page manuscript to find all of the places you may have made the same mistake.<p>Another example: Word provides styles, but honestly, who has discipline to use them? Most people I know manually insert page breaks, centered text, and X number blank spaces at the top of a page to make a new chapter. In Markdown, all of my markup gets converted into Word styles automatically and then I can create a reference doc to apply the style I want. I&#x27;m writing semantically correct styles in my documents all the time with no additional effort.')
