I wonder what would happen if taxes worked the same way. you have to pay the same amount no matter what (and maybe some gets preallocated towards nondiscretionary spending), but you would get to pick from a few broad categories where your tax dollars go. would probably be a disaster, but interesting to think about. from a certain perspective, it might increase the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of  government programs.')
