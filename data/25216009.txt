We have thousands of sites all around the world that transmit stuff to geostationary satellites all the time. Some of them are quite large and powerful (up to 1200W and 2000W power amplifiers on 11 meter size C-band dishes). When those signals are sent to a geostationary satellite, it&#x27;s not like the signal stops at the satellite.<p>If a big earth station dish is aimed at a specific spot in geostationary and tranmits something, 99.999999% of that signal is going past the satellite and off into interstellar space, possibly to eventually be intercepted by aliens.')
