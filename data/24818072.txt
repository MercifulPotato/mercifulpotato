Cost of solar on today&#x27;s price is already really low and the calculation is being done on prices today. Keep in mind per kW yield of solar in India is very different from in the US or further north.<p>For example, at a cost of 30,000 INR&#x2F;kW ($405), and a bid price of INR 3, assuming yield of 4.25 kWHr&#x2F;day per kilowatt, we are looking at an IRR of 10.5% over 20 years. Now add long-term debt to the mix and we are upwards of 12%. Solar doesn&#x27;t have any moving parts and this assumes operations and maintenance at 15%. If the cost squeezes further by 2024 - the IRR is even more attractive.<p>Goldman, Walburg, Pension funds, etc are deploying billions in solar for this reason - IRR upwards of 10% over 20-25 years with low risk. That&#x27;s why we started this business too :)')
