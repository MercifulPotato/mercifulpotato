It should be possible to create an online identity that is vouched for by other users in the (decentralised) system.  You could then tie your digital wallet to this, but also other less critical online assets like your Twitter account.<p>Most attacks against this system could be mitigated by having time-locks on the various assets which begin when the recovery process is started.  In particular, if some of your friends are tricked into starting the recovery process, that should be published somewhere (in a pseudonymised form) so you can intervene and get them to stop before the time-lock opens.')
