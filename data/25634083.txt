Alternative consider if the vaccinate uptake rate was 10% - then we have the opposite problem.  Demand is too low.<p>In this case, with some doctors and nurses rejecting the vaccine, it is reasonable to project that overall demand for the vaccine across the general population will be low.  This means that the date we reach herd immunity is farther in the future than if the uptake rate was 100%.')
