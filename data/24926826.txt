Trying to turn it into Java neuters some of the benefits of being hacky (I&#x27;m looking at you, Typescript).<p>But at some point, it&#x27;s neither a hacky Lisp like language, nor is it stable like Java or C++. It&#x27;s just a middle ground that does these things poorly.<p>It would be nice to have a new programming language from scratch built to handle all the async&#x2F;reactive mess. But until then JS is our best bet.')
