Even years and years later I remember that experience.<p>Since then I haven&#x27;t seen cobegin&#x2F;coend anywhere except in slides, and I haven&#x27;t seen monitor at all (If I recall correctly it was a critical section allowing only one process inside)<p>I think the library-based parallel programming scheme is ok, but it might be time to build it into common languages and tools.')
