So if ECI is <i>not</i> normalised by total economic output, I would be surprised.<p>Normalising by economic output makes it a bit of a misleading metric. Australia could have world-class knowledge and tech sectors (they don&#x27;t, but they could), and yet ECI would be low just because some low-complexity sector was booming.<p>Not normalising at all is pretty fraught too though. I guess it has the potential to mislead in both cases.')
