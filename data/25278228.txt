It&#x27;s a cool concept but comes with huge caveats.<p>I think you answered your own question here. Incrementally-maintained views in existing database systems typically come with huge caveats. In Materialize, they largely don&#x27;t.<p>Most other systems place severe restrictions on the kind of queries that can be incrementally maintained, limiting the queries to certain functions only, or aggregations only, or only queries without joins—or if they do support maintaining joins, often the joins must occur only on the involved tables&#x27; keys. In Materialize, by contrast, there are approximately no such restrictions. Want to incrementally-maintain a five-way join where some of the join keys are expressions, not key columns? No problem.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t <i>some</i> caveats. We don&#x27;t yet have a good story for incrementally-maintaining queries that observe the current wall-clock time [0]. And our query optimizer is still young (optimization of streaming queries is a rather open research problem), so for some more complicated queries you may not get the resource utilization you want out of the box.<p>But, for many queries of impressive complexity, Materialize can incrementally-maintain results far faster than competing products—if those products can incrementally maintain those queries at all.<p>The technology that makes Materialize special, in our opinion, is a novel incremental-compute framework called differential dataflow. There was an extensive HN discussion on the subject a while back that you might be interested in [1].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MaterializeInc&#x2F;materialize&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2439" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MaterializeInc&#x2F;materialize&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2439</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22359769" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22359769</a>')
