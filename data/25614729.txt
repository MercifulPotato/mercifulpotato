Python is a good way to learn the basics of programming, including basic data structures and algorithms. The key is to just start small. Don&#x27;t jump into leetcode or whatever before you&#x27;re comfortable with what a function is for, as an example. Just take small steps and build small programs. I also highly recommend finding someone in your life that already knows how to program and can answer your questions. Good luck!')
