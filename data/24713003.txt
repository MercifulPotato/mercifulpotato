OTA software updates do have their benefits, but it seems like it leads to compromising quality for pushing features of questionable utility out the door.<p>I get really disappointed when I see Tesla implementing really unnecessary features like Rainbow Road (the over-done SNL &quot;more cowbell&quot; skit) and fart mode. Focus on the reliability before making these features.')
