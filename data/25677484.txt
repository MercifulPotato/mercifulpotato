You can not trust someone just because they &quot;promise&quot;, I am not undervaluing their work, all I am saying is moving from party to party doesn&#x27;t solve the problem in whole.<p>Signal&#x27;s ridiculous marketing tricks like using quotes from Snowden, Schneier et al makes me laugh.<p>If I am given two options to choose between moving to another centralized service like Signal and staying with WhatsApp, I am okay with the latter option. Not because WhatsApp is better, but honestly as an end user I don&#x27;t see any value.\nWhatsApp requires my phone number, so does Signal. WhatsApp is centralized, so is Signal. WhatsApp doesn&#x27;t allow another client to operate, so does Signal.<p>So what&#x27;s the difference, Signal is open-source and non-profit? Nah, I don&#x27;t buy this nonsense.')
