I strongly dispute that is the widely accepting meaning.<p>My understanding of concurrency vs parallelism (this is also the definition implicit in the article):<p>* Parallel: n processes running on n physical processors<p>* Concurrent: n processes running on m≤n (possibly m=1) physical processors due to preemptive or cooperative multitasking (the latter is common in async frameworks). (Edit: Changed m&lt;n to m≤n. To be clear: parallelism is a type of concurrency.)<p>A system with a lot of concurrency might not have any parallelism but still have less overhead than a parallel system e.g. in the case the processes are IO bound rather than CPU bound and need to communicate between each other a lot.')
