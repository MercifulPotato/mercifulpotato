Binaries typically compress as well as LZMA2, averaging about a 50% compression ratio, with nearly an order of magnitude faster decompression.<p>ZSTD beats DEFLATE and Gzip seemingly in every metric. It decompresses faster than almost any algorithm out there, save maybe LZO or LZ4, and has a compression ratio comparable to much slower algorithms.<p>Arch Linux switched to ZSTD for compressing their package database at the beginning of this year, and only increased the overall average compressed size by 0.8%, while speeding up decompression several orders of magnitude compared to LZMA2.')
