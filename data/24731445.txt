That&#x27;s not the case for org.<p>Using org effectively also means using Emacs, which is a high barrier of entry for most people.<p>Jupyter notebooks have no such requirements, and anyone can get rolling by just installing some packages and opening a web browser.<p>Jupyter notebooks are also really polished, while org is more bare bones visually.<p>Jupyter notebooks also have all these tools integrated in to it (all the graphing and inline image display tools are particularly appealing)<p>Yes, you could potentially do all of these with org, but it&#x27;d  take way more knowledge and setup than is required for Jupyter notebooks.<p>If something as visually appealing, powerful, and easy to set up and use for people who don&#x27;t know Emacs then it&#x27;d have a chance of getting widespread adoption.  But that&#x27;s not org.')
