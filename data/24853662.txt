But some network nodes use visibility into things like round-trip time, data-in-flight and packet loss for each flow, so they can adjust queuing parameters to optimise for each user.  These measurements are easy to get from monitoring TCP, but not QUIC.<p>The designers of those network nodes may conclude that blocking QUIC (UDP on port 443) and forcing fallback to HTTP&#x2F;2 over TCP results in better ability to optimise network flows than allowing QUIC to go ahead.  All browsers race TCP against QUIC, so a network blocking QUIC shouldn&#x27;t significantly slow performance compared with just HTTP&#x2F;2.')
