Usually, there&#x27;s an offsetting loan the bank takes from other banks, at the inter-bank lending rate (e.g. Euribor). Then the bank lends you the money at, say Euribor + 1%, pocketing the difference. The funds for inter-bank lending come either by offsetting loans from the central bank, or from consumer deposits, both of which can be re-lended many times due to fractional reserve banking.')
