As if Virgin Orbit and SpaceX are even remotely comparable.<p>As soon as the Hyperloop concept was shown, a company pops up doing it, again making sure the name Vrigin is always mentioned when Elon Musk Hyperloop comes up.<p>Their method and approach often seem more about big hype and big money raising. These companies also tend to find financing from big money people in the middle east, where with a lot of flash and not much substances you can finance. Virgin Orbit is public and promising intercontinental flight, system they are simply not able to develop by any evidence so far, its honestly borderline scamy.<p>This plan of spending 100s of million to develop a short test track seem like the same sort of thing. If it cost this much, how much will it cost from SF to LA?<p>&gt; In a hyperloop system, which uses magnetic levitation to allow near-silent trave<p>In Elon Musk original hyperloop paper, he was explicit not using magnetic levitation.<p>Saying: &quot;A viable technical solution is magnetic levitation; however the cost associated  with  material  and  construction  is  prohibitive.&quot;<p>I hope of course they are successful, any attempted at developing new technology is great however I would never bet on them to achieve anything.<p>I still think the Hyperloop as described in the paper is mostly a good idea, but I think its smart of Elon to switch to tunnels. It makes the legal and safety situation way easier. I think the Boring company is actually developing a Hyperloop test track as well, but this is somewhat speculation at this point.<p>Here a link to the original paper:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;blog_images&#x2F;hyperloop-alpha.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;blog_images&#x2F;hyperl...</a>')
