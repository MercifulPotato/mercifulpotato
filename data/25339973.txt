The nearest exit may be behind you.<p>-- Break the rules.  Officials may try to deter you from using passages, ladders or stairwells.  Ignore them.  If you need to kick open a door or pick a lock, do it.<p>-- Be where the well-connected people are, and look&#x2F;act the part.  Try to blend into the tribe, be a part of the group that&#x27;s getting out.<p>Obviously in a modern context, these guidelines don&#x27;t apply.  Ignoring the instructions of flight attendants in a plane evacuation will get you killed.  They are trained to evac that plane in 90 seconds.  They won&#x27;t be able to do it if you still have your briefcase, or haven&#x27;t taken off your shoes as requested.')
