Item(by='mancerayder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610233316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704513, text='For years now I&#x27;ve been focusing on squat, standing press, and (when my elbows heal) pull-ups.  My variation are pause squats (3 seconds down, 2 seconds hold, up fast), front squat, and now overhead squat.  My variation for the standing (&quot;strict press&quot;) is bench press, which I do 1X a week.  I try to run 1X a week, sometimes 2X, but I&#x27;m inconsistent.  I normally do 1X a week of deadlifts and ring rows but I have an elbow flare-up at the moment.<p>I do the three main ones (squat, press and pullup) 3X a week.  No push day, no pull day, every workout is squat day.  No machines -- evah! No curls. None of that.  I do a small amount of accessory work for core, forearm muscles, and neck muscles, as well as PT work.  I also spend a LOT of time warming up, probably 30 minutes.  I&#x27;m in my lower 40&#x27;s and recently tested with pretty solid testosterone of 670, and bloodwork is all good. I look way younger for my age.  I also do intermittent fasting (really just skipping breakfast).  I do drink, however.<p>There was a period when my gym closed during the pandemic and I had no alternative.  I had to take a couple months off.  Well, the muscles remained muscles (which does not happen so much with bodybuilders, who tend to get their muscles convert to fat pretty quickly), and after a few months I&#x27;m back to squatting pretty decently (I can do 1.6X my bodyweight for 5x5).<p>I absolutely recommend strength training for the older guy.  Especially the PC nerd older guy.<p>I plan to continue weight training but cut out 1 day and instead learn proper calisthenics.')
