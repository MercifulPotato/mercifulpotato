There is no need to settle the issue globally, it&#x27;s a US-only issue. As being a WIPO member or signing a treaty doesn&#x27;t create laws. Being a WIPO member doesn&#x27;t do much of anything actually, it&#x27;s all just talk, that&#x27;s why there are so many members. Instead countries have sovereignty, pass and implement their own laws regarding copyright typically requiring elected politicians to propose them and vote on them, independently from WIPO and treaties. They also have their own judicial systems, most countries not even doing a common law style system where things can ever be &quot;settled&quot;, it&#x27;s more about court orders, rather than some clever demands written by lawyers.<p>So, when it comes to copyright, most of the world is really not like the US. A random WIPO country is likely not just lacks anti-circumvention copyright laws, but also lacks a lot of other things in them.')
