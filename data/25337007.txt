You&#x27;ve got the year digit, the decade digit, the century digit, and the millennium digit. Decades are always talked about this way, e.g. &quot;the 80&#x27;s&quot;, and I&#x27;d wager that most people think about centuries and millenniums this way. The fact that the year number is defined as the ordinal year since the approximate birth of Christ, beginning with AD 1, doesn&#x27;t strike me as particularly relevant.<p>In other words, I&#x27;m not &quot;counting from&quot; anything. I&#x27;m describing the decimal year number in a manner that&#x27;s natural for the radix.')
