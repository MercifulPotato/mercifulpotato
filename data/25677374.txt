Started discussing it with my siblings, pointed out a number of ways in which Telegram was better, asked them if they really wanted to play into the hands of Facebook (this was before WhatsApp got E2E-encryption I think).<p>Same with my wifes family. With them they suddenly just jumped at it and switched one afternoon.<p>My family however took over a year I think until suddenly my until then deeply sceptical sister told everyone that she&#x27;d leave WhatsApp and those who wanted to be along should join her on Telegram. And I said nothing and was just happy.<p>Before and in between those two events everyone else changed:<p>- church groups<p>- sports groups<p>- all kinds of groups for planning and organizating all kinds of stuff<p>Some needed a little nudge, others went all by themselves.<p>At some point Telegram became so much better as to be contagious: I heard a number of people not wanting to leave WhatsApp but after they started to use Telegram nobody ever wanted to go back.<p>Long story short:<p>Start with close friends. Start it as an experiment. Start with the young ones, let them nag their parents and coaches and everyone to change :-)<p>(For those who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about: Telegram is extremely much more user friendly and powerful compared to WhatsApp in the same way WhatsApp was extremely much more user friendly and powerful than sms.)')
