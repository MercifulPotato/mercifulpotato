Then the Xbox One has a regular sata drive, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;user replaceable&quot; - it&#x27;s very hard to access and requires a complete disassembly of the console, while on PS3 and PS4 all you needed to do was remove one screw and the drive would come out. The same seems to be true on PS5 again.')
