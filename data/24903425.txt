Timing the market almost always ends badly in the long term. The best way to come out ahead is to plan based on very long term market trends which include the recessions and stick to your plan with the understanding that there will be recessions, you just don&#x27;t know when they will start and when they will end.<p>I&#x27;m quite certain if someone simulated trading based on predicted recessions on ZH, you would end up well below market returns.')
