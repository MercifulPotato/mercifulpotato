It&#x27;s impossible to find anything because search results are dominated by absolute garbage on every retailer&#x27;s site.  They&#x27;ve taken the worst part of Amazon and latched onto it like it&#x27;s the magic sauce that&#x27;s going to make them relevant again.<p>The other thing that I find super frustrating is that I&#x27;m willing to pay a bit extra to get something better quality.  I don&#x27;t care about $10 vs $30 when I&#x27;m buying a case for a $1000 iPad.  However, on the Amazon market place that seems to translate into &quot;Hey!  This dumbass is willing to give us $30, so lets sell him the same $2 piece of plastic garbage with different branding.&quot;  It&#x27;s soooooo frustrating.')
