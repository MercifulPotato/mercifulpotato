Some even have  openly asked &quot;why do Americans find it so hard not to be racist? It&#x27;s not that hard.&quot;<p>I always respond by pointing out that the citizens of almost every country are naturally xenophobic and&#x2F;or racist, just not necessarily against people of African descent. In the case of Europe, I usually point to the Roma as an area where Europeans tend to be a bit racist. I had no idea there were huge Roma ghettos in Bulgaria, but I knew of some Roma communities when I lived in Rome, Italy. And without fail, countless Italians warned me to steer clear of the Roma because &quot;they are all liars and thieves&quot;...')
