For quick reference, check out DJI&#x27;s Agri Drones[1].<p>For context; we talked to a few tea growers in the eastern side of India. They spend north of $150,000 - $200,000 on drones and UAVs to track&#x2F;collect data over 20,000 hectares of tea farms. Our sample satellite date can do the same at a fraction of the cost though the precision drops by about 10%. The idea then now is to combine satellite imagery solution + occasional high-precision drone sweeps.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ag.dji.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ag.dji.com&#x2F;</a>')
