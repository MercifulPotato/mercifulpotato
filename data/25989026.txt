Board and executives are not more rational than employees in general, but are also as much - if not more - constrained in their actions. They can&#x27;t just do whatever they want, not if they want to keep their jobs and high salaries, or hold any similar jobs in the future. The part where a company becomes an amoral profit maximizer is a combination of:<p>- Interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders, who most likely cannot agree on most of their goals, but they will agree on &quot;money = good&quot;;<p>- Competitors who wait for the company to make a mistake they can exploit to get ahead, or possibly kill the company<p>Combined, these forces all but ensure the company has no choice but to be a amoral profit maximizer, or die.<p>A different analogy, that doubles down on &quot;corporation is essentially an AI&quot; view, but may make it easier to explain the main point: if you apply Maslow&#x27;s pyramid to companies, most of them do not have their Physiological and Safety levels met.
