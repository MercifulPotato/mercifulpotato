Not sure if itâ€™s because google is doing something nefarious or if Firefox is just not keeping up with google website technologies.<p>For a number of sites like YouTube and GMail, it&#x27;s because of Google. If you change your useragent to look like Chrome, you get served a JS payload that Firefox is fine with, and it is faster.<p>If your useragent isn&#x27;t Chrome, they&#x27;ll serve you a less optimised payload, but which tends to have wider support.<p>They seem to have made a tradeoff - one that generally isn&#x27;t necessary under Firefox.')
