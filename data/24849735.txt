Our choice will lead either to increased social injustice and violence, or to “humanizing socio-economic systems”.[0]<p>also<p>&gt; And he condemned recurrent tax breaks for wealthy individuals as “structures of sin”. “Every year hundreds of millions of dollars – which should be collected as taxes and go to finance healthcare and education – instead end up in offshore accounts,” he said.[0]<p>In other words, the pope demands state action to address the issue of poverty, but shies away from supporting action on the &quot;moral&quot; question of homosexuality. You can certainly make <i>humanist</i> arguments for these positions, but it seems incoherent when viewed through the lens of church dogma.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaticannews.va&#x2F;en&#x2F;pope&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-02&#x2F;pope-francis-pass-inclusion-workshop-finance.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaticannews.va&#x2F;en&#x2F;pope&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-02&#x2F;pope-francis...</a>')
