Item(by='nostrademons', descendants=None, kids=[25434114], score=None, time=1608060302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433734, text='I don&#x27;t believe that the reason everything is so expensive in California is regulation and taxes.  Here&#x27;s why:<p>The North Coast (Eureka, Crescent City) and Central Valley (Chico, Fresno, Modesto, Bakersfield) are under the same regulatory and tax regime as the rest of California.  How expensive is Eureka?  Houses average $300K [1].  Restaurant meals are about $10-12. [2][3]  How expensive is Bakersfield?  Houses are about $250K [4], meals are about $11 [5].  In other words, they&#x27;re not much different from the rest of America.<p>I think that much of the contemporary political narrative gets the causality wrong.  The Bay Area and LA are expensive because they are home to global monopolies that funnel cash from all over the world into a small region.  There&#x27;s not much land available in these metros, there&#x27;s a lot of money floating around, there are a lot of people who want to move in to get a piece of this money, and so they bid up the prices of scarce goods.  Regulation comes later, to curb the power imbalances from having corporations with more resources than many nation-states, and taxes come so that the state can get a piece of the huge cash flows coming in.<p>But the primary driver of cost-of-living is being the sink for the disposable income of 7B consumers.  Eureka&#x27;s primary industry is timber, and Bakersfield&#x27;s is oil.  Both of these are commodity markets where the money goes elsewhere in the value chain.  Not so with tech and entertainment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homes&#x2F;Eureka,-CA_rb&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homes&#x2F;Eureka,-CA_rb&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brickandfirebistro.com&#x2F;menu-.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brickandfirebistro.com&#x2F;menu-.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.humboldtsmokehouse.com&#x2F;menu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.humboldtsmokehouse.com&#x2F;menu</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homes&#x2F;Bakersfield,-CA_rb&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homes&#x2F;Bakersfield,-CA_rb&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yelp.com&#x2F;menu&#x2F;locale-farm-to-table-eatery-bakersfield" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yelp.com&#x2F;menu&#x2F;locale-farm-to-table-eatery-bakers...</a>')
