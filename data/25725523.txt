I suspect this is largely because firearms are banned within the Capitol and you would be insta-arrested if you tried.  The Capitol is not an open carry or even a concealed carry area, and as we saw from the one death at the hands of law enforcement, they are not shy about using lethal force on even unarmed individuals when you cross certain lines.<p>I am also extrapolating from the arrest data that there were clearly almost no armed individuals at all.  There have been two firearm arrests.  That&#x27;s two out of hundreds of thousands of individuals and in both cases the individuals had their firearms in their vehicles, not on their person - so they were most definitely not &quot;armed groups and individuals&quot;.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;capitol-arrests.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;capitol-arres...</a>')
