Besides &quot;taken to hospital&quot;, you can be &quot;at university&quot;, &quot;on your way to school&quot;, or &quot;in prison&quot;, for example.<p>If you worked at one of those institutions, though, you&#x27;d add an article and be specific - you work &quot;at the university&quot; or &quot;at the hospital&quot;. (You&#x27;d expect the listener to infer that you mean the specific university&#x2F;hospital in the area, assuming there is only one.)<p>Edit: More colloquially, we also have &quot;going into town&quot; (no article, even though it&#x27;s probably a specific town that is clear from context!)<p>The article-less usage only seems to work for generic places (hospital&#x2F;school&#x2F;prison&#x2F;university). It doesn&#x27;t belong with a noun that refers to a person but also sort-of-refers to that person&#x27;s place of business. You&#x27;re &quot;going to the doctor&quot; or &quot;the dentist&quot; or &quot;the hairdresser&quot; - never &quot;going to doctor&quot;. This is despite the specificity often being superfluous here - the listener might not know&#x2F;care which dentist you use!')
