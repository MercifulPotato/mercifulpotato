And I can relate to this, because if I asked a dev on my team to work on building out a new report a user asked for and they respond they&#x27;re going to fix technical debt instead, I wouldn&#x27;t be happy.<p>Also we already know how this ad hoc approach to technical debt works in most organizations.  You get 0% to work on technical debt.')
