This is the curse of knowledge, and it is the root of countless misunderstandings and inefficiencies.”<p>A few months ago I came across an interesting actively developed project in embedded rust which was very technical. Full of acronyms and concepts that I was not familiar with. It took quite some time to get up to speed with how it all worked and so I took the time to add &#x2F; expand README.md files for each example, explaining what the acronyms meant and the general gist of each example. It was a worthwhile exercise for myself and I figured that it was worth sharing the perspective of a beginner too. My benign pull request remains ignored and unmerged and it makes me feel like a bit of an imposter. I thought nothing of it at the time but now I wonder if this is classic case of “the curse of knowledge”. Perhaps the author just can’t see the value of it.')
