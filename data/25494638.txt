Consider who the essay is written towards -- ISVs in 2004. What about an ISV requires super-productivity? In fact, the author states this literally:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s okay to be in awe of these great hackers.  But as a practical matter, small ISVs would be much better off hiring professionals.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s fascinating to look at this essay with 2020 lenses on. I have two observations:<p>1) The traditional ISV, while not dead, has at a lot of its traditional role usurped &amp; cannibalized by players higher up the value chain. This somewhat relates to my next point.<p>2) The rise of growth and data science roles as a fusion of marketing and technology along with the enormous growth of tech as a whole (hard tech and soft tech) means that archetypical average social media literate hacker founder archetype of today is quite interested and capable of interacting with users today.<p>And of the three &quot;sins&quot; the essay points out, that&#x27;s probably the most cardinal one -- for the vast majority of businesses, if you have high enough margins and an employee who&#x27;s good enough at growth to add double digits to your bottom-line, are you going to whinge about their predilection to fuss about interesting projects and tools? No, you&#x27;re going to raise a ton of cheap VC and let them go to town.')
