Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610151481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692377, text='&gt; Is there a proper answer for someone like me?<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think there is one. The problem with A is that it will lead to violence, anarchy, or brutal dictatorship if left completely unchecked and certain groups start to counter (verbal) arguments with death threats and violence.<p>There is a school of thought that says that a free society has to accept this and basically live with the fact that it&#x27;s constantly in danger due to this.<p>But even this school of thought has one fatal flaw - its proponents lacked the information that we have now. Social media enabled psychological mechanisms that prior to its inception and widespread use were really hard to trigger.<p>In the 20th century, mobilising the masses was hard work and required a lot of resources (printing was expensive, organising large rallies to reach many people was expensive and dangerous, ...)<p>Today, everybody can - even without owning a smartphone or a computer or having internet access - reach literally billions via social media (e.g. by using an internet caf√©). A single Facebook post or Whatsapp message can lead to riots and mobs that kill people [1].<p>These are means of communications and psychological effects that are simply unprecedented in human history. We opened Pandora&#x27;s Box without even realising it.<p>When the US constitution was written, no one had social media in mind when they wrote about free speech. The very concept that a single man could within the blink of an eye spread their message to half of mankind, unchecked, without any immediate consequences, completely anonymously was just unthinkable.<p>The amplifying effect of digital echo chambers that suppress dissenting thought and nip constructive discourse in the bud, was yet unknown. FOMO and social media addiction didn&#x27;t even enter the scientific community until just five or so years ago.<p>It&#x27;s a really complex and difficult problem and I would love to see some constructive discussion about what to do with it (especially in the mainstream media) - preferably without reducing it to an unfruitful us-vs-them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;how-misinformation-whatsapp-led-deathly-mob-lynching-india&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;how-misin...</a>')
