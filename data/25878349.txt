Item(by='yongjik', descendants=None, kids=[25879130], score=None, time=1611362900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878151, text='2021 Tesla Model S has a 100kW battery and 402-mi range.  I searched for &quot;average driving miles per year&quot; and Google says 13,500 miles - assuming this, we have about 37 miles per day, which would mean our Tesla S only needs to charge 9.2kW every day.  If they&#x27;re sitting on a charger 10 hours per day, they can take a leisurely 920W per vehicle (less than a good hair dryer), not 11.5kW.')
