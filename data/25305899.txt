WQHD is ideal for full sized laptops, but the problem is that most laptop vendors have to depend upon what display manufacturers are building.<p>Most of the display manufacturers are building 4K for marketing reasons (few people outside of gamers really know about WQHD) but those displays consume too much power  to replace FHD across the board.  An intermediate resolution between FHD and 4K might be more expensive at this point.<p>LG, which makes their own laptops and displays, did it right with their 2560 x 1600 laptop panels.')
