They have Federal level support from the diplomatic corps and may involve themselves in foreign policy. Sales of aircraft may be tied to other mechanisms of statecraft.<p>Airbus - even more so, practically a creation of European governments.<p>To give an example of what happens when nations are not powerful, look at Bombardier in Canada - which was squeezed out of a more niche are of commercial aircraft by state actions.<p>Boeing complained to Donald Trump about &#x27;unfair competition&#x27; - the US - against NAFTA treaty - imposed a 250% duty on Bombardier jets. To get around this, Bombardier had to drop their pants and do an ugly deal with Airbus. Eventually, this inability to flex material power in conjunction with other state assets ... and it&#x27;s a flop for Canada, and a &#x27;win&#x27; for a bigger entity backed by a more powerful state entity as the commercial aircraft business was sold off to Airbus.<p>If Canada had a huge domestic market, this probably would not be the case.<p>Edit: it&#x27;s possible Boom eventually develops into a much bigger entity, maybe in 40 years, using their &#x27;smaller, currently niche but growing industry&#x27; as an entry point. But  taking on Boeing is tantamount to taking on Microsoft directly.')
