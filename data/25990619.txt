IBM, Hitachi, NCR and other mainframe vendors vs Sun, HP, and later Microsoft and Oracle on the distributed computing side. As usual, it wasn&#x27;t about whose tech was better: but who was going to get the customer&#x27;s money. Back in the late 90s I saw IBM terminals doing some impressive graphics -- and that was just the built-in stuff for the UI. Build my career on distributed, first Sun and then Oracle on Red Hat, with all the FOSS in between like Apache and MySQL.

Can&#x27;t imagine ever going back.')
