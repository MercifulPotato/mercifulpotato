If they do, they should be able to visit you without issue.  If they don&#x27;t, they would need to apply for visas and that adds a layer of uncertainty - their visa applications could be denied.  Between B-2 and F-1 visas, there&#x27;s a greater likelihood that their F-1 visa applications would be denied. But, with some planning, you might be able to minimize these issues. If you&#x27;d like to discuss this, email me separately.')
