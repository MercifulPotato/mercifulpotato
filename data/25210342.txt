I am burning to see the next iteration of Apple Silicon devices with an M1X or M2 chip and more ports and RAM for higher-spec devices and new MacBook designs even lighter and smaller than the current Air (bring back the 11&quot;!).<p>I guess I&#x27;m just caught up in the hype and excited about movement in the chip design space after many years of Intel stagnation.  Zen and the M1 are a breath of fresh air.<p>Waiting to replace a 2014 11&quot; MacBook Air until the story about Parallels support is clear and maybe new MacBook designs are available.<p>I also have a 2013 Mac Pro trashcan-style on my desk at work.  Until recently it was simultaneously available in the inventory system and marked as EOL.  I&#x27;m not sure if the 2020 6-core Intel Mac Mini would actually be faster - maybe.  I&#x27;m only a part-time iOS developer so I keep trucking along with the 2013 model.')
