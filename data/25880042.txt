Any change to a scale-free system that would make it no longer obey a power law would also render it useless.<p>Democracy (uniform distribution of some resource) only makes sense in narrow contexts. In any financial system, a uniform resource distribution is highly unstable and will stabilize to a power law distribution in the absence of massive deadweight loss inducing distortions. This is completely independent of whether or not some shitcoin uses a scammy premine or some other initial allocation strategy.')
