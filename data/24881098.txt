I also feel that the number of collateral damage in the past two decades has been absurd and unjustified. I did not vote for the man who allowed drone strikes on children. Thankfully, the United States has made an effort in the past four years to leave the Middle East.<p>Nevertheless, this does not justify the actions of the CCP eradicating a whole culture and itâ€™s people. The argument is still unsubstantiated. No global leaders besides the current POTUS are condemning this behavior either, which is a shame. I can only vote with my wallet.')
