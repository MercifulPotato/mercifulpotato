They had the CIA kick off a 45 year long civil war in Guatemala, deposing a democratically elected government by way of a violet coup and replacing them with a pro-American right-wing dictatorship.<p>The CIA called it &quot;Operation PBSuccess.&quot; [1] And they didn&#x27;t call it that because it failed! The CIA produced some spectacular propaganda footage including this gem called &quot;Why the Kremlin Hates Bananas&quot; [2]<p>United Fruit also massacred a bunch of striking workers in 1928 in Colombia. Well, they paid the Colombian Army to do the leg work. This episode was named the Banana Massacre.

[4] His replacement was quoted as saying &quot;it&#x27;s important that I don&#x27;t get too knowledgable about the past.&quot; Seems like a smart dude.<p>So that&#x27;s Chiquita Bananas for ya.
