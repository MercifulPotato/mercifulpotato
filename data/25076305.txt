A mildly overweight doctor, sure. But <i>obese</i>?<p>The reality is, if you have a list of doctors and their pictures and know nothing of them except for their appearance I highly doubt anyone would pick the obese person as their first pick.<p>It’s just reality. Someone capable of going through medical school is capable of reducing their weight to being merely overweight as opposed to obese.<p>People going on “yeah if they know their stuff” are missing the point. You don’t know if they know their stuff at all.<p>As for unattractive, yes that’s bad.')
