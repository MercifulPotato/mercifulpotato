I agree we need reform if we&#x27;re to survive. Between BLM this spring, DC now, the fringe militant elements, we&#x27;re seeing more and more violence.<p>I will mention that the split-down-the-middle thing isn&#x27;t a property of electoral college. That&#x27;s how you win in a democracy. If voters are distributed between 1 and 10 on some issue:<p>1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10<p>I win by picking 5.5. Whatever you pick, you get a minority of voters. That&#x27;s complicated by primaries. In the same system, if I want to be a ballot candidate, though, I can&#x27;t do that. I want to pick 2.75 or 7.25 so the majority of my party votes for me.<p>Of course, things like charisma fit in a bit too, but for the most part, if one party runs a 2.74 candidate and the other a 7.24, the 7.24 has an advantage, and vice-versa for 2.76 and 7.76.<p>All that things like electoral college do is shift weights. Tight elections just means politicians have learned to play the game well.<p>A system where someone with 40% or 60% of the vote wins isn&#x27;t fundamentally broken -- the underlying check-and-balance works. What is fundamentally broken are when incentive structures misalign.')
