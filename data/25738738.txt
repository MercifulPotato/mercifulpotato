It&#x27;s a giant backwards step.</i><p>Free speech is a good thing. And if algorithmic ranking weren&#x27;t involved, I would probably still hold to the notion that the appropriate cure for bad speech is usually more speech.<p>But I&#x27;ve come to understand that even when some of a thing is good, more of it is not always better.<p>By all means we need vigorous debate and principled stances arguing about where the line should be drawn, and what are the appropriate consequences for stepping over it, but &quot;fire in a crowded theater&quot; is just the obvious case when we have people nattering on about how it&#x27;s stupid to prevent people from walking around with spare cans of cans of gasoline, just in case and ... &quot;hey, did you know that if the fuel-to-air mixture is rich enough, gasoline actually won&#x27;t catch fire? Here is your complimentary box of matches BTW.&quot;<p>We desperately need better models and mechanisms for regulating speech that don&#x27;t require heavy handed censorship by the government or outright bans by private parties, and it would be great if these mechanisms can be meaningfully exercised at the edge of the network (or social graph) rather than centrally deployed, but I&#x27;m not sure how to get there from here without the various failure modes bringing everything crashing down around us anyway.')
