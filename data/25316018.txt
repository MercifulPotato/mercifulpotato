Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25317659], score=None, time=1607187400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308894, text='It’s less that they’re explicitly doing the same thing while not citing existing research; and more that they’re constantly inventing new and different ways to do <i>foundational</i> things, rather than taking some of the things that have already been proven to work and “moving up the tech tree” to doing more interesting things.<p>(Imagine if you will: everyone constantly doing research into new lightbulb technologies — so we’d get the LED a century sooner! — but nobody ever researching the implications of evacuated incandescent bulbs [vacuum tubes! CRTs!], nor into the implications of miniaturizing&#x2F;printing LEDs, etc.)<p>It’s kind of like where fusion research and ML research were during their “dark decades” — everybody doing breadth-first searches of the possibilities, nobody digging much deeper into the implications of research that showed promise.<p>In all three cases, it’s because it’s hard to model those implications without a real experimental prototype; and because, in all three cases, costs to do real experiments (for reactors; for training datasets; etc.) shoot up exponentially as you “go deeper” — as you need to do those experiments <i>in the context of</i> a working example of everything you know so far.<p>The true issue is one of team size dynamics. Particle physics has figured this out: to continue foundational research, you need a few large teams with huge grants&#x2F;budgets (to build particle accelerators), rather than many small teams (that can’t individually afford to build particle accelerators.)<p>But other fields haven’t managed to have the same epiphany, and so in those fields, small teams just continue to explore the parts of knowledge-space they can “reach” with a small team — which isn’t really too productive.<p>(ML got going again because large companies figured out basic research into ML could be a loss-leader for renting out time on specialized ML-accelerator hardware. Nuclear science never slowed down, because governments were doing the basic research with huge teams+budgets from the start. Etc.)')
