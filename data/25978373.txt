And after reading the article, there was little light shed.<p>A couple of points of context.<p>- urban archaelogists in Britain find a very bright line between pre-tobacco and tobacco. Once in that latter period C1650, they are immediately inundated with disposable clay pipes. Lasting a couple of centuries. But the physical nature of those pipes provides little extra information. Nobody documented their manufacture.<p>- Its a kind of inside joke that our contemporary civilisation will deliver a similar quandry to future archaelogists: presumably, the archaelogists of the title. That is: there will be a similar bright line between pre-1980s ring-pull which were distributed absolutely everywhere, then immediately not at all in our contemporaneously <i>developed world</i>.<p>So I assume this was written for future archaelogists to get better context on contemporary detritus.')
