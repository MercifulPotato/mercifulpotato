Item(by='alex_smart', descendants=None, kids=[25196090], score=None, time=1606091635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177656, text='&gt;I can only think of free high-quality education by government as a solution to this aggressive game-the-system and FOMO mentality so deep rooted here.<p>I am also from India and I am really perplexed and pained by this. Why is it not possible to have a genuine business catering to the same market but with actually good content and trained teachers? If nothing else, WhiteHat Jr has demonstrated that there IS a market and people are willing to pay for educational content. A genuine company might take more time to succeed, but they will eventually win the war, right?<p>Why are we perennially doomed to be stuck with either scammy companies like these or the mai-baap government doing everything under the sun?  The free market seems to be able to solve these problems in other countries. What makes India so unique?')
