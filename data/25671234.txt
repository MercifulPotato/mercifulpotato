Then it was acquired by FB and is now part of big tech. We all know what this means.<p>With signal as a notable exception, I doubt that there could ever be a different outcome for any commercial product.<p>Why is it, that we do not see more competition from non-profits? The tech world has changed so much, that the ideas of the open source&#x2F;free software movement are not as applicable as they were when Stallman founded GNU. However, with Wikipedia we see a worldwide Top10 site being a non-profit.<p>So, where are all the Google&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Facebook competitors funded by contributions of its users? Given how hard and expensive it is to really compete in that space, is the goal unrealistic? Or is it that there are some (hidden) incentives in the game which contradicts that goal? (Other than monetary incentives for the founders)')
