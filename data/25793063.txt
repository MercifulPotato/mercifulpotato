It&#x27;s a service providing the favicon for a given URL&#x2F;hostname and optinal size. The main reason I&#x27;ve created this is that we didn&#x27;t want to rely on any third party service. We also saw some issues with certain domains while using the Google favicon service (ironically it couldn&#x27;t download the Google favicon for example). The thing is MIT licensed, so in case you have been looking for something like this, here you go. I will add more tests and other improvements in the future.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirsch.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirsch.io&#x2F;</a>')
