There are a lot of bankers and other white collar workers that LARP as bikers, but raise money for charity.<p>Then there are the actual biker &#x27;clubs&#x27;. What&#x27;s confusing is that these guys are full on associated with the Hell&#x27;s Angels or some other similar group. . . And still do all the charity stuff. So they raise money for childhood cancer or a local family whose house burned down during the week.<p>And on the weekend, they beat the shit out of a local bar owner who wouldn&#x27;t let them drink for free because they&#x27;re keeping him safe, then burn his bar down.<p>It&#x27;s the most confusing thing.')
