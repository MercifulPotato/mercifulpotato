Doesn&#x27;t the president conduct public business that way? PBS, for as great as it can be, isn&#x27;t really the channels most people watch. Presidents communicate on private media all the time.<p>This just seems like there is a void that needs to be filled. Terrible as they may be, we can&#x27;t have non-specialized platforms censoring politicians. There needs to a place where politician can speak their mind to the public and we can decide kick them out of office for their hate filled bullsh*t opinions when they do.<p>I&#x27;m not religious, but I would much rather trust a priest with the policing of public speech (and that gives me the worst kind of shivers). If you don&#x27;t trust zuck&#x2F;dorsey&#x2F;bazos with your data, why would you trust them with this? It just feels like we are privatizing morality and the common good. Like a digital private police force.')
