I have much more experience with Python than Go (almost none with Rust) and therefore I have much better time with python packaging tools (I don&#x27;t remember a single issue, that I didn&#x27;t find a satisfactory solution -- as much as possible in the packaging world with myriad conflicting use-cases)<p>For example, my experience with `cargo` (that I mostly use to install command-line utilities such as rg, fd, dust): it is great when it works as written in the instructions\nbut sometimes it doesn&#x27;t (running `cargo` may involve a lot of compiling -- in contrast to `pip` which can use wheels transparently and avoid compiling even for modules with C extensions -- I guess there might be a way to do something similar with `cargo` though not by default).')
