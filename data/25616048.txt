It&#x27;s not enough to have that pressure at the very beginning, it needs to persist all the way. This isn&#x27;t really the case for a vaccine.<p>In other words, by the time the virus is replicating inside of you, it doesn&#x27;t really have much pressure to evolve to evade those other facets of vaccine immunity, because doing so would probably hurt it.<p>The UK variant isn&#x27;t better at evading the immune system from what we know. It&#x27;s simply more infectious in general.')
