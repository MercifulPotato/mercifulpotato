Millions of man hours have gone into their research and design. They are rigorously monitored and controlled. Their emissions in every form is highly regulated.  If one is within 3 decades of failure, we&#x27;d know it.  \nWhen engineers and scientists say that there isn&#x27;t a single power plant that is going to fail in the next 40 years. It&#x27;s not a guess.')
