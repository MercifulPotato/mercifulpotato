I think how deeply you look into it will be a reflection of your beliefs - and more than that, of what you want to believe! (Same for each of us, generally speaking!)<p>Look into Richard Dolan&#x27;s youtube presentations.<p>Now I just clued you into two rabbit holes- how deep will you go? See, your beliefs will determine that. Your desires to believe or not believe will determine how much you look.<p>I was interested, and wanted to believe, so I read 3000+ pages of Dolan&#x27;s writings and watched 10+ hours of YouTube documentaries. Now I know practically &quot;everything&quot; (as far as I care to) about these topics. But it&#x27;s because I wanted to know, I wanted to believe.<p>And how is the written or verbal testimony of hundreds of thousands of witnesses over time not counted as &quot;evidence&quot;?<p>Changing the minds of skeptics is impossible. People believe what they want to believe, in my opinion.<p>&gt;Even a half eaten discarded alien candy bar would change the minds of almost any skeptic.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve thought this one through fully. So you have this candy bar - what does it look like? Where will you have it analyzed? When you get the analysis back, who are you going to show? People will still be easily able to discount anything short of a direct landing of alien craft or a cyber-weapon that demonstrably altered reality. I&#x27;m not even skeptic and I can discount your candy bar in my mind in half a second - it just looks like a normal candy bar. Or just looks like a shiny candy bar. Or maybe its a prank made up by an elaborate joker. etc. etc. etc.')
