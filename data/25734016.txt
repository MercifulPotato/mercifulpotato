Then Google Cloud can say &quot;Go host on Azure&quot;. Then Microsoft says &quot;Go host on Digital Ocean&quot;, and repeat until you run out of hosts.<p>Is it like a game of hot potato where the last hosting company has to host them? Because it seems there are alternatives to each individually, and it&#x27;s only when they all say no that there are issues for Parler. And to me that feels like a Parler problem, not an AWS problem.')
