Say, driver was texting? Eating a hamburger?<p>What if the driver was just driving 10mph over the speed limit? 15mph?<p>What if the driver fell asleep at the wheel?<p>What if the driver was driving on bald tires and a blowout precipitated the accident? What if they were only 95% worn out? 80%?<p>-----<p>There are different levels of culpability. Drunk driving is negligent and bad, but I hope we can all agree it is not as bad as willful murder. Five years in jail is an incredibly severe punishment already - that&#x27;s a quarter of this kid&#x27;s life to that point.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the revenge angle. We can expect more from people.')
