If there is no common set of primitives upon which various different domain abstractions are built, then you have to relearn absolutely everything for each domain, even things that are not domain specific at all.<p>You end up with a huge number of special cases. Mistakes are made because only very few people will be able to remember all the semantics of all the DSLs they need for their work.')
