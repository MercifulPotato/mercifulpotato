It happens to be a very &quot;wide and deep&quot; OS which includes a lot of userland stuff as part of the same release bundle, like OS X&#x2F;macOS. There are FOSS projects that also operate this way. The GNOME environment comes to mind as a similarly &quot;wide and deep&quot; example. I myself have had the experience of having a GNOME feature I was using removed after an update. The recourse in that case isn&#x27;t much different from the recourse in the Windows 10 Flash case. You can either live without the removed thing or find a third party solution. What you can&#x27;t do is just stop updating the thing; you&#x27;d lose (community) support and important bug fixes.<p>Of course, as long as it&#x27;s FOSS you can just fork it, right? But really that&#x27;s not the appropriate solution for cases like this. We&#x27;re talking about the removal of a basically stand-alone feature. If the official bundle stops supporting that thing, forking the bundle is not the way forward. Bringing in a third party is.<p>So the way I see it, both the problem and the solution here are the same for both Windows and large FOSS software bundles like GNOME. They&#x27;re the opposite of narrow projects, so stuff is bound to get removed eventually. You can&#x27;t stay on an old version, you shouldn&#x27;t fork, and in some cases you probably shouldn&#x27;t even protest, as the reasoning for removal may be sound.')
