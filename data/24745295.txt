In reality, during hard times corporate socialism is used to ensure companies’ survival wherein the taxpayer bails our big companies. I see no reason why similar corporate socialism couldn’t be used in a different system.<p>It’s also interesting you think capitalism allocates capital effectively. I would argue the opposite, that it aims to concentrate wealth into the hands of the few. How many life saving startups die while Apple has hundreds of billions of dollars of cash? How many brilliant people are born into poverty and can’t enact their ideas, while Bezos buys his sixth house?')
