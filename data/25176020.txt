The people who are consistently 10x more effective are, in my experience, those who manage not to deal with unavoidable-accidental-complexity in problems. It&#x27;s not their only strength, of course -- they are also very good at what they do.<p>But e.g. if your work depends on another person responding to your work in some way (e.g. interfacing to a buggy system you have no visibility into), it doesn&#x27;t matter how fast&#x2F;good you are - the progress is throttled by the other party. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone 10x their way through such a setting.')
