Pit Bull Terriers and other bully-type dogs are <i>known</i> to have high prey drives, and you can&#x27;t really be surprised if one goes after a cat or small dog. I&#x27;m pretty tired of both the people who blame the dogs for everything and the people who are trying to convince the world that bully breed dogs are great beginner- or family-friendly pets. Certain dogs have certain traits that you can&#x27;t train out of them. I love hamsters and rabbits, but I&#x27;m not ever going to get one as a pet because my rat terrier has an extremely high prey drive. It&#x27;s just stupid to put any animal in that situation.')
