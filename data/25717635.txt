A crash can  happen regardless of liquidity - at its most base it is just a change in what people view is a fair price for an asset.  &quot;I no longer like red tulips so only pay $1 for your bulb instead of $8&quot;<p>Holding some cash is always wise. One can also keep some funds in 2yr treasury FRN - checking account yields until such a time as rates back up naturally or possibly suddenly if the world questions US treasury issuance.<p>Key thing people need to understand is liquidity goes out the window in a crash.  If you own corporate paper, you know this (or should) and need to be prepared as you won&#x27;t be able to offload to raise funds to paydown margin needs elsewhere.  Certainly, if you are using margin in some way you should consider your cash drawdown needs for at least a 30% drop and make sure you have funds that will be available no matter what lest you have positions automatically closed.<p>I personaly have some out of the money, very long dated, SPY put spreads. They are long term protection as the value only maxes out at expiration and will be reduced with skyrocketing vol. So they will give me a degree of short term protection but are really designed to survive a crash followed by longer period of relative stagnation.')
