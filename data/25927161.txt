You can build impressive MVP and tech demos in a short amount of time, yes. But that requires that the author has already been thinking about the types of problems that come up in this domain for a long long time. Rest assured that Git certainly hasn&#x27;t been created in a weekend.<p>Also, you can&#x27;t create a <i>product</i> in this short amount of time. (There are some websites that do almost nothing at all, and that are very profitable, but those aren&#x27;t engineering problems). Think how long git has been maintained, polished, and extended since its inception. And still people complain.<p>Software is a learning process, otherwise people wouldn&#x27;t be so obsessed about it. And learning takes time. No matter which way you&#x27;re approaching it.')
