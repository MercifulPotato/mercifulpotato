But I think your programming analogy doesn&#x27;t apply to this situation.<p>In your analogy, there is me the programmer and the library&#x27;s programmer. If the library has a consistent behavior, I need only to know how to use it, I don&#x27;t need to know how it works internally. But the library&#x27;s programmer needs to know how it works. He may not need to know how the building blocks, he&#x27;s using in his library, work. but he does need to know how they interact to be able to deliver new features and bugfixes. (I think) He can&#x27;t add features and correct bugs by trial and error (at least not all the time :)) .<p>So In your analogy, I think the researchers that came up with the BERT model are the library&#x27;s programmer and not the programmer.')
