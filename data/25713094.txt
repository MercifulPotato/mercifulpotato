The vast majority isn&#x27;t determined to sabotage the site and therefore it&#x27;s easily overcome by determined maintainers.<p>The ability to vandalise is actually an essential part of Wikipedia&#x27;s success, in my opinion. Most users will not continue to vandalise and some will become valuable editors after seeing how easy it is to contribute and that their changes make a real and instant difference.')
