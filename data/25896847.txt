Nonetheless, standards still exist (HDA,ATA&#x2F;ATAPI&#x2F;SATA,OHCI&#x2F;UHCI&#x2F;EHCI&#x2F;XHCI,etc.) and much of the backwards compatibility is still there.<p>You bring up wi-fi cards and that is definitely one category of hardware with little standardisation&#x2F;documentation (I suspect due to FCC regulations and such.) Wired ethernet is a bit better --- Realtek and Intel NICs are both quite well-documented, with the latter being more complex. The other difficult one is GPU acceleration (but a VESA framebuffer is usually available, which gets you at least a GUI if not a fast one.)')
