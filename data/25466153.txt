If I try to sum up the insight in the case of ADHD it&#x27;s that the next thing will not be more interesting than the present, and that simply being can be more pleasing than &quot;doing&quot; something. It&#x27;s not only intellectual, there is a whole well-being feeling that comes up (at least for me). So the whole never-ending fall forward to find the next best&#x2F;more interesting becomes kind of pointless in the process. Maybe not a cure but an efficient way to keep it under control instead of suffering from it.')
