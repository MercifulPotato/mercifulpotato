It&#x27;s literally documented by the MySQL project, existed for more than 5 years, was supported by Google, and continues to be supported by MySQL.<p>Google broke it without warning. That&#x27;s a breaking change to your database, in production, 5 years after v5.7&#x27;s release when you&#x27;re fully locked in without so much as even a version bump.<p>Microsoft didn&#x27;t do this. AWS didn&#x27;t do this. Google did this.<p>Let this be a lesson to everyone that Google can and will break your critical production systems even years after they&#x27;re operating perfectly, and they&#x27;ll provide no warning, no explanation, and no fix.')
