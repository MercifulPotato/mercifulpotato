From sports and media companies that are walking on egg shells in case actors or sports stars, or even fans, say things critical of the Chinese government. De-funding or sidelining of movies potentially critical of the Chinese government. Imagine a film like The Manchurian Candidate being made now? It&#x27;s not gong to happen, not from a major film studio anyway.  The problems Apple is having here, and also with Chinese supplier companies possibly using transported Uighur labourers working under some form of coercion, can affect pretty much any foreign company operating in China.<p>In this case the App in question was pulled from the App Store in China. On the one hand I can understand it&#x27;s the Chinese market so Chinese Government rules apply. Clearly this would not be acceptable if the App was pulled internationally. On the other hand, if the US government tried to get an App pulled when it&#x27;s not clear the App violated any US law or App Store rules, Apple would fight it to the courts. That&#x27;s a tricky course to take with China, but it&#x27;s obviously the right thing to do.<p>If Chinese law says the App has to be pulled and a Chinese court says so then fine, I&#x27;ve no problem with Apple complying with that, the alternative would be to expect them to criminalise Apple employees in China. That&#x27;s clearly not a reasonable expectation on any company. But at least it would force the Chinese authorities to account for their actions and make it clear what they are doing and why.<p>The problem is it&#x27;s not really possible for individual companies to fight the Chinese government. Even for a company like Apple, the asymmetry in the power of the CCP relative to Apple is overwhelming. The CCP could crush Apple, and they know it. They hold enough economic power now that they could quite feasibly drive a major film studio to the wall, or slice off the whole profit margin of many US media or sports organisations.<p>It&#x27;s time for western governments to work together on this. Congressional hearings in the US, debates at the G7 and G20. The WTO is pretty crippled at the moment and that needs to change. Whatever side of the US political fence you are and think about US imports, surely you all want to support US exports and the rights of US companies abroad right? I&#x27;m a Brit and ok we&#x27;re out of the EU now, but on things like this we&#x27;re all in the same boat and need to work together. We need to all support Australia in their current spat with the CCP.<p>We are desperately in need of a broad and international political debate about these issues. It affects all of us.')
