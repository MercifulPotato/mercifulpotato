Is it basically like Samsung where it is essentially an arm of the government?<p>I googled some initial funding of course back in the day, but didn&#x27;t get much info on current day.<p>TSMC is viewed by some as being so critical to the modern economy and information technology that it basically ensures China won&#x27;t invade Taiwan because of the extremely strong response that would provoke from all the other countries of the world.<p>Given China&#x27;s sustained assertion of its territorial rights and burgeoning power, that becomes more and more important.<p>And with the huge cost of new-process Fabs in the 10s of billions, that also almost requires governmental coupling if you aren&#x27;t in a sufficiently large economy.')
