The OP isn’t claiming the things you describe are dumb or wasteful or that you should never carry your phone.  The suggestion is that sometimes doing without it can teach you interesting things, <i>including about your phone</i>.<p>I’m an avid backpacker (&gt;60 nights on the trail most years) and I experience the same phenomenon (I don’t mean the phone, which is just a deadweight in the country). I sometimes just do without some piece of equipment and find out I’m fine.  You often don’t need a tent, even in the snow.<p>It turns out less clutter makes much of the experience more enjoyable; you have fewer decisions to make and more “attention” to pay to other things which could be where you are or it could be something in your head you brought with you.  It can also be a real PITN if, say, it’s raining and you foolishly don’t have shelter.<p>Do I bring a tent?  Often.  But it’s ok if I don’t.<p>And what is the phone but an infinitely large backpack full of clutter?  Worse, much of that clutter is actively designed to distract you and imbue FOMO (suggesting new things precisely as you complete the old, ruining the cognitive desire for “completion”).  Phones are great and I always carry mine around in town.  But losing it would be inconvenient, not devastating.')
