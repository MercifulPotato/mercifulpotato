Anonymous sources feeding into New York Times? Because that&#x27;s all we had before and continue to have today otherwise.<p>People just don&#x27;t like when certain inconvenient information comes out and Wikileaks didnt care about the source.<p>People constantly try to pin ideological stuff on Wikileaks or data leaking in general  but that misses the bigger point and it&#x27;s a point that extends beyond Wikileaks itself and goes into information releasing in general (we don&#x27;t need to defend Assange personally or Wikileaks itself to be concerned or defend the  general idea). I also highly doubt they are selectively choosing NOT to release political information... like news outlets apparently do.<p>But I also don&#x27;t care, there&#x27;s a huge amount of risk and blowback doing such a mission regardless of source or content which we should respect.<p>They get what they can from where ever and publish it if it has some value to the general public, and we&#x27;ve gotten tons of value from Wikileaks already. So do plenty of other organizations now inspired by Wikileaks, plenty which have exposed corruption in a new way (like Panamaleaks).<p>The fact this sometimes can have an &#x27;agenda&#x27; or be exploited by the original sources will never negate the value of a neutral 3rd party who releases stuff publicly we&#x27;d never see otherwise. And will continue to do so as long as operational.<p>My only fear is that there won&#x27;t be people brave enough to do this given nation-state harassment and those who think its all a political-inspired conspiracy (which litter every social media site).')
