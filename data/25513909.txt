They could do single assault with 50-70k troops 300 km from their borders but they could not rotate or supply them or provide enough air cover.<p>Unless they can build a staging ground at a leisure pace in an ally country. Not to say that it was building up its already significant military logistics.<p>Now, why do you think such a such a force needs even bigger logistics buildup, far exceeding defensive use scenario?<p>All past of your comments on military strategy give off so much of youthful maximalism. In conflict, always expect the worst past holistic comparison. All things that &quot;could never happen&quot; according to military analysts do eventually happen.<p>A saying is you never expect the enemy to attack where you expect him the most.')
