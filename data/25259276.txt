I think it would have been more useful to compare against proper rust async concurrency: I ran 200k sleep tasks over 12 threads using `async-std` and each thread only used up ~30% cpu (~60% on `tokio`), and &lt;10% with 20k tasks.<p>What is the proper way to call `Process::sleep` in your example? I don&#x27;t see it in the lunatic crate or documentation, and I can&#x27;t compare results without running the same test in lunatic.<p>Edit: I guess async rust is mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t really explain in detail what lunatic is solving that async rust doesn&#x27;t provide, besides a vague &quot;more simple&quot; and &quot;extra features,&quot; which the example doesn&#x27;t really show.')
