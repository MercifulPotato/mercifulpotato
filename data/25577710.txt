If they do not want this liability, then they must refrain from deciding what medical information is correct and what should be suppressed.  No hiding behind medical authorities as there are multiple conflicting medical authorities and tech companies have decided which ones they bless as truthsayers and which ones they have derided as falsifiers. There is no way for them to avoid making choices once they get themselves involved in the business of censorship and suppression. Their choices, their consequences.<p>Or they can be conduits and avoid this risk entirely.')
