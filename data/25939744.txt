Because climate change is an unavoidable physical fact, that demand is likely to grow. It is already not free to externalize the cost of carbon, and a great deal of money and engineering talent will be needed for adaptation in the coming decades. It’s also not likely to remain cost-free to externalize the cost of carbon either. And even in the event of a breakthrough technology like nuclear fusion, there’s still the task of decarbonizing infrastructure and electrifying everything. All of this will need software. All of this will require a staggeringly large deployment of capital. And you would think that with so many smart people here, more of them would want a piece of that!')
