If I want someone to interpret a one-word answer as enthusiastic, I&#x27;ll put a bloody exclamation point on it.<p>And you get back to the real core of my point (though I could probably have been clearer).<p>&gt; Sounds pretty reasonable to me for SMS&#x2F;WhatsApp texting, and definitely something I agree with since ending a one-word statement with a period when you otherwise never use periods is clearly a statement no matter how small.<p>I punctuate fastidiously. In my un-blinded, anecdotal data, my interlocutors do not interpret my punctuation negatively. Sometimes they say my vocabulary makes it seem like I&#x27;m too big for my britches ... and that I use archaic idioms.')
