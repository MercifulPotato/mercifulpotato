Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[24743306], score=None, time=1602358608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740789, text='Exactly the same with analogue synthesizers.<p>A lot of the time they don&#x27;t mean analogue when they say they don&#x27;t want digital - they mean that they want knobs and switches to play with. I think some modern Moog&#x27;s even have a digital stage in the signal path (I might be making that up but I have some vague recollection of it in a schematic)<p>Making a synth sound good has very little to do whether it uses analogue or digital synthesis these days, but analogue equipment is (for the same price) less reliable, uses more power, less flexible, and more susceptible to being damaged by impacts (and keep in mind that you can&#x27;t repair a lot of modern gear with SMD soldering experience anyway)')
