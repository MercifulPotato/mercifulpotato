This has been going on for <i>fourteen years</i>, since Microsoft became the first partner in the program on (lol) 11th September, 2007, and started giving them dumps of people&#x27;s hotmail email boxes and such.<p>It&#x27;s the #1 source for NSA reporting, eclipsing even their bulk cable wiretaps.  They can hit a button and get Google Takeout, but for all major US online services, for anyone they choose, no warrant required.<p>These sorts of headlines pretend that their &quot;normal&quot; way of spying <i>does</i> require warrants.  It absolutely does not.<p>A lot of people seem to still carry the misconception that the FISA orders (again, not warrants, no probable cause, issued by a classified court (also run by US military intelligence) that never denies a request) are only for foreigners (&quot;foreign&quot; is right in the name).  That&#x27;s also not true: they use it to target US citizens too.<p>This specific circumstance was cited by Ed Snowden as one of the main reasons he came forward and told everyone that this was happening.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;702-spying" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;702-spying</a><p>The participants in this system as of 2013: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL, Apple.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2013&#x2F;nov&#x2F;01&#x2F;prism-slides-nsa-document" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2013&#x2F;nov&#x2F;01&#x2F;pr...</a>')
