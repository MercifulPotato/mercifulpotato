And even with Qualcomm, they must already build them with Android (even a particular phone) in mind, right? Yet somehow the A14 is faster than a Snapdragon 865. I think strategically if Exynos put pressure on Qualcomm in a nontrivial way (e.g. Samsung switched entirely, and started selling Exynos chips to their competitors) that would change the game. Maybe the fab needs to be spun out of Samsung, just as Intel&#x27;s fabs might be spun out as well.')
