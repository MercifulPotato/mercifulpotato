Can all OpenGL code be represented as shaders? Or is the OpenGL code needing hardware-specific compilation shaders only? When the above poster said that Mesa <i>&quot;compiles code from OpenGL to some target backend&quot;</i>, were they referring to shaders already?<p>Said differently: if I import a C GL lib and use it to make a call to draw a triangle, is this a shader, and will Mesa do any hardware-specific compilation? Or is this compilation only happening when shaders are involved?<p>I guess I&#x27;m confused about what shaders exactly are, and when they are used. I think I understand them as programs able to fiddle at each frame with how stuff (surface, pixels) is rendered, but for example, geometry (putting triangles in space) is OpenGL&#x27;s job even though it isn&#x27;t about shaders, is it?<p>By the way, do you (or other passerbys) have courses recommendations to study this? (ideally interactive &#x2F; tutorial-like &#x2F; with exercises)')
