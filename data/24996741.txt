There are some plans to tighten this, the spec was designed to allow implementing various policies. It should also be possible to write a content blocker for this as a Web Extension (maybe it already exists).<p>Does this happen on all websites? On some websites, that you could possibly share with us, so we can have a look and understand what&#x27;s up ?<p>Can anybody that is not satisfied about this open a ticket at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mzl.la&#x2F;363s8KN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mzl.la&#x2F;363s8KN</a>, and put in `:padenot` in the box `Request information from` (log in with github or a bugzilla account) with some info about the websites ? An alternative would be to send me an email, username at mozilla.com.')
