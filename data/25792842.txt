I use Syncthing for a bunch of thing and it really works well.  I&#x27;m in the process of rebuilding my offsite backup machine with it.  I make a local backup of all my digital pictures and will soon use Syncthing to move a copy of that backup to a relative&#x27;s house in another state.  Even if my house burns down I&#x27;ll have all my media.  The offsite box is a 10 year old desktop running Debian with a 12Tb drive in it.  Backup server is set to &quot;send only&quot; and offsite copy is set to &quot;receive only&quot; so it&#x27;s a one-way pipe.')
