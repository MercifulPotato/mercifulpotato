I now use a &quot;dumbphone&quot;. I have begun slowly migrating to ProtonMail. I have already been using Linux as a main OS on desktop. I do still use a Macbook Pro only because the 2015 version I have just won&#x27;t die (touch wood), but my next laptop purchase would be with the aim of installing Linux (high-end Thinkpad perhaps). I don&#x27;t use any form of social media, but instead arrange social events through phone calls, texts, and email. None of this has made my life more difficult. On the contrary, I talk to people more often, commit to more social engagements, and feel more in control of my digital life. I highly recommend everybody to at least try some of these things!')
