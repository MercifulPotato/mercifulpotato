The idea is very much inspired from Neuron - but a few differences:<p>- In zettel we have a concept of Connections and not uplinks&#x2F;backlinks. This lets us have circular links across notes.<p>- For visualisation we use Graph structure instead a of a Tree. For reasons mentioned above.<p>zettel is a simple CLI written in Go, so very easy to just grab the binary and get started.<p>The project is in a nascent stage, feature requests or any relevant ideas are more than welcome!<p>Our GitHub Repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hackstream&#x2F;zettel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hackstream&#x2F;zettel</a><p>Documentation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zettel.hackstream.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zettel.hackstream.dev&#x2F;</a><p>(Yes the docs are generated by zettel as well)')
