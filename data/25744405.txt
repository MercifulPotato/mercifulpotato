Building Signal isn&#x27;t exactly straightforward (just due to Android&#x2F;iOS crud). We need something like build attestation from reproducible builds to be extendable to slightly different source codes.<p>Other than that, love it. Now to add iOS backups and cross platform imports... And strip out gifs (or at least make them disabled for me). And force by default unknown callers to go via a relay...<p>So many wishlist items which are probably wasted effort because they will bit rot without being accepted by Signal.')
