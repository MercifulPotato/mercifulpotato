Coming from him, he not only was a mathematician, a philosopher, and a physicist, but he started the first modern form of public transport in the world[0].<p>Business is recognizing problems, and then solving them for a profit. The problems can be yours or others&#x27;. The &quot;definition&quot; of a problem is a gap between a current state and a desired state that one does not know how to overcome. You can train yourself by looking for signs of problems such as anxiety, frustration, ranting, complaining, and then digging deeper instead of shrugging it off as another day in the office.<p>I helped people with tiny businesses get in touch with huge auto-manufacturers simply by designing great looking documents with a LaTeX template and designing a commercial offer. I helped others to decide to make chemical products by digging into chemical compounds and having spectroscopies and other lab experiments done after a nightly conversation in a forest where I pulled a notebook and a pen and started listing price points and products because they complained they were being excluded by product wholesalers. I helped others by making software that generates the right document for the right bank for their clients after getting cofee. I helped others move money around, or deal with vendors abroad, or work on an HR system for a sixty thousand person organization, etc... This was when I was a student&#x2F;fresh graduate and had some time to spare and the result of conversations where I didn&#x27;t say &quot;It sucks, man.&quot;<p>One funny thing is that you end up as the &quot;go-to person&quot;, a &quot;fixer&quot; of sorts, and more and more people bring you their problems or bring you people who have a problem. It becomes a game of solving problems.<p>The gist of this is paying attention and recognizing problems, and then paying attention to your attitude towards problems. What do you do with them.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carrosses_%C3%A0_cinq_sols" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carrosses_%C3%A0_cinq_sols</a>')
