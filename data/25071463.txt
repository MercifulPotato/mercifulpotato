In a pure short term technical sense, it was the correct pick. But considering the bigger picture it was dubious.<p>&gt; While Commodore never invested much in upgrading the 6502 into 16 and 32 bits, they invested a lot in other developments. Too little and too late, the 65CE02-derived chip in the C65 was quite impressive for an 8-bit CPU.<p>Not during Tramiel&#x27;s reign they didn&#x27;t. The man was famously averse to spending a single cent he didn&#x27;t have to. He didn&#x27;t believe in the concept of budgets, so he preferred to have to personally okay every single expenditure. If that caused work to stall when he wasn&#x27;t available to do so, well, that was just the cost of doing business...<p>When he bought MOS, with it he got perhaps the world&#x27;s best silicon design team. He promptly chased them away by denying them a bonus they felt they deserved, and after that the only development on the CPU line was for cost-cutting. It was only after he stormed off in 1984 that Commodore got back into CPU development.')
