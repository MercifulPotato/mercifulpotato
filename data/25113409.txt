I lost my father and my mother few years back. My mother’s passing away hit me very hard. My mother’s passing away meant I could no longer share my deepest feelings, fears and failings to someone who actually hears and understands. I still miss her. I now have kids and wish i had 1 percent the strength she had. I hope you find peace and are able to find strength from how your dad was a pillar in your family.')
