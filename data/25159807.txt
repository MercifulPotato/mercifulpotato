Item(by='tpoacher', descendants=None, kids=[25175662], score=None, time=1605875478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157407, text='Probability only deals with a very specific type of uncertainty: stochasticity.<p>This is by far not the only type of uncertainty. Compare e.g. uncertainty as vagueness. Probability is entirely ill-equipped to deal with this kind of uncertainty.<p>E.g. consider needing to make a distinction between class A and B (real life example: heart muscle vs papillary muscle). Now consider the existence of a &#x27;hybrid&#x27; class between the two (e.g. a cellular structure that is neither heart, nor papillary muscle, but a mixture of the two).<p>Any probabilistically stated problem that attempts to define uncertainty of the hybrid tissue, will fail even before starting, because it will attempt to provide a stochastic intepretation, when in fact sampling from that pixel should always deterministically lead to the exact same result, albeit uncertain in terms of vagueness. This type of uncertainty is better addressed using fuzzy measures other than probability (which is only a subset of more general fuzzy theory).<p>See Klir &amp; Folger for nice discussion on this (I forget the title, but it is called something like Uncertainty in Fuzzy Theory Applications).')
