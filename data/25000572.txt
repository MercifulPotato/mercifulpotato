But if you replace coal with iron you&#x27;ll need more than one coal fired plant to produce the energy to recover the burned iron. You can use wind or solar to power the electrolysis instead, but then theres no need to bother with the iron at all.<p>I bet they&#x27;re hoping to just sequester the rust in a landfill or something.')
