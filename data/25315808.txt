There are so many logical fallacies that we need to remain diligent in guarding against them.<p>Lately, in response to the relatively intense polarization of beliefs, I&#x27;ve been contemplating open-mindedness, and whether discussions starting with establishing an open-minded context could get people talking again.<p>To me, open-mindedness means that you&#x27;re receptive to new ideas and experiences and generally do not reject them outright. When presented with implausible or seemingly impossible information, an open-minded person will listen to the basis of ideas, concepts and information and weigh that basis before making a determination about whether or not the idea is true and worth assimilating. Or they may try a new experience with less pre-judgment of whether they&#x27;ll appreciate it.<p>In my view, there is a critical nuance in open-mindedness: It applies whether or not the idea is consistent with what I already believe to be true. As an open-minded person, I feel that I need to regularly reevaluate my beliefs as new information comes to light, even if that new information directly contradicts a basis for a firmly held belief.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know examples that you&#x27;ve had where you&#x27;ve learned new information that contradicted what you already firmly believed, and through open-mindedness, changed your belief accordingly.')
