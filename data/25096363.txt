But it is actually simpler when used as a basic microwave.<p>It has two big buttons: start and stop. If you press start, it sets the timer for 30 seconds and runs at max power. If you press the button when the microwave is running, it adds 30 seconds.<p>If you want more precise timing, you can also preset the time using + and - buttons and set the power with the &quot;power&quot; button. Then press start.<p>It also has a nice safety feature. The microwave will refuse to turn on if you didn&#x27;t open the door recently. This is to limit the risk of running it empty, which can damage it. From my experience, it is an actually useful feature and not an annoyance.<p>So, 3 improvements over the &quot;two dials&quot; interface: easier for the most common case (30 second start), more precise timer when you need it, and an added safety feature.')
