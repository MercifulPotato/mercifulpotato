Recently one of the major colleges in the US released new admissions guidelines that are more vague than before and specifically designed to reduce the asian percentages being admissions.  It seems the jokes about Asians being better in school are true, and this university wanted more &quot;diversity&quot; so it made the requirements <i>more difficult</i> for Asians (and to a lesser extent whites) while making it easier for the targeted ethnicities (I only remember &quot;black&quot; but I believe it included more than just that).<p>For some reason the US has it in it&#x27;s head that we can balance the scales by putting our thumbs on one group and lowering the bar for others.  Weirdly they don&#x27;t see the hypocrisy or outright foolishness behind &quot;fixing&quot; racism with more racism.<p>Of course, like all things like this it has almost no effect on the ultra rich and truely privileged, and will negatively effect the underprivileged &quot;whites&quot; of all races (weirdly, just like every other race, white people are not just some big homogenous color but makeup diverse individual cultures with distinctive history).<p>But I guess those privileged trailer trash should use their privilege to buy themselves access to an ivy league education.<p>Honestly Apple&#x27;s little PR stunt is the least insulting of this stuff recently.  If you want to see really stupid, look at reddits CEO stepping down and saying his job will go to a black person (and it did).  That <i>is</i> illegal but it was just ignored.  Or the incoming US president who said he VP pick would be a &quot;woman of color&quot;.  Of course I&#x27;m sure someone will defend picking VPs based on their genetics and chromosome amounts by saying &quot;we already pick that way anyway, its why its all white men in politics!&quot;.  Because clearly you fix something by propagating it.<p>The world is so upside down now that suggesting we be colorblind is racist.')
