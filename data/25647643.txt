There is a lot of garbage being produced, you need a way to sort through it. Hierarchies of journals or conferences will naturally emerge regardless of the payment model. Just check the field of machine learning where most papers are open access and yet prestige depends on where it&#x27;s published. This is orthogonal to the matter at hand.<p>Being published by prestigious journals isn&#x27;t just about ego, it&#x27;s about future career opportunities, getting grants, getting to work on things you want to work on possibly with some of the most brilliant people in your field.<p>I think people at the top could make things change with a massive concerted effort, and I think things will change naturally as younger people who&#x27;ve had a taste of open acess get access to top positions but it&#x27;s too reductive to put things down to researchers&#x27; greed and ego.')
