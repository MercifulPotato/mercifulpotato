When I lived in LA, this seemed like far less of an issue than in Northern California, where people seemed incredibly stuck up and generally awful. Something like 40% of LA doesn’t speak English at home and I would imagine a comparable number (if not more) speak with some kind of accent. If you clung to judging people because of their accents, you’d find yourself outside most social circles there.')
