We have a humming bird feeder right above a table, them suckers buzz us a lot. 50db my dishwasher is 48db (measured). Humming birds significantly louder when hovering.<p>Drones are always hovering currently. Yes they can likely get a lot quieter. Planes are still quite loud, they&#x27;ve had 100+ years of work? Birds, they still make noise, and they&#x27;ve had millions. They seem to switch modes of flight to be quiet.')
