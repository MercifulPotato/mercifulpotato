Of course this means high cost of living because of housing competition, but it’s easier to make new friends when you’re surrounded by other people who are also looking for the same. I lived in Berlin for a few years and made a lot of close friends but almost none of them were originally from the city. It’s tough to break into pre-existing social networks.<p>I would say that it also helps a lot if you know at least 1-2 people who moved to that city just before you. You can plug into their social network and work together to expand it.<p>The other advice I have is find people who share your interests through sites like meetup.com. Lots of people who show up to those events will also have space on their dance cards. Get comfortable going out to shows, art exhibits, or whatever you’re into by yourself, and then if you hit it off with someone at a meetup event you’ll have something to talk about and something to invite a new freind to join you at.')
