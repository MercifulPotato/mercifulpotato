There are only three ways to get traffic:<p>1. Pay for it (ads)<p>2. Borrow it (distribution agreement with a third party, who has an audience)<p>3. Build it (use your own audience that you started building years ago)<p>That&#x27;s it. Every other way is either a hybrid of two of those (e.g. paying someone to email their big list) or is one of them deeper down. So it sounds like you don&#x27;t have an audience, which makes #3 impossible. At this point you can either talk to a friend or business associate who has a good-sized list, and see if you can come to some sort of an agreement with them, you can pay for ads on a relevant platform or blog, or you can start building your list now.<p>Is your landing page for a [free] lead magnet, or a purchase? Purchases in the impulse buy range ($27-47, but for developers maybe up to $97) get you qualified traffic, and for <i>really good</i> sales copy can be more-or-less self-liquidation, e.g. you are earning in net revenue basically what you&#x27;re spending on ads. But often times it&#x27;s just to take the edge off the ad spend and make sure your list is super-qualified people, since they&#x27;ve already paid you money they&#x27;re more likely to pay you more.<p>My email is in my profile and I&#x27;m happy to give you an unbiased opinion of your landing page - I have nothing to sell you, it would just be what I think of the copy, offer, design, etc.')
