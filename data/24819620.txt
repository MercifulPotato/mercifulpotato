Then you can use that income to do it again for some new projects and get a good reputation built up. I believe you need to initially build a reputation in order to have something to attract clients. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing currently on the side. I both want to see my friends become successful and I also believe if my skills can help them achieve their goals it will validate my strategy. I have about 3 years of pre-sales engineering experience and lots of software development experience so I&#x27;m not far off from where you are it sounds like. Best wishes, I hope you find a nice groove :)')
