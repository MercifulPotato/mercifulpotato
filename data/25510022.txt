You&#x27;ll find that they&#x27;re, by and large, decent people with the same basic motivations as you. They resent being told what to do by what they perceive as elitist, out-of-touch folks in major coastal cities, and your article is a conspiracy theorist&#x27;s wet dream. It&#x27;s hysterical to the point of caricature.<p>As for the &quot;anti-democratic&quot; American system of government, a cursory reading of the Federalist Papers would demonstrate that the Framers believed that majoritarian democracy was, in fact, tyranny of the majority. They were fundamentally correct - progressives love to praise Canada, but the office of the Prime Minister is, in only a slightly a hyperbolic sense, a 4-year elected autocracy with minimal checks and balances. Majoritarian rule stinks if you happen to fall into a minority, and that&#x27;s the entire point of having a constitutional republic.<p>The beauty of America is that if you don&#x27;t like your system of government, you can always move to another state. Trying to force your progressive values onto everyone via some sort of bizarre doctrine of cultural dilution is unbelievably wrong-headed.')
