Police are not allowed within 100 feet of the polling location, unless they&#x27;re actively voting or there on official business at the request of the election board. Additionally, anyone working at the polls in an official capacity is not allowed to wear any clothing with political messaging.  One of the officers who showed up earlier in the day was wearing a hoodie with the American flag on it, and the US armed forces oath of enlistment printed in place of the white stripes. As they were leaving, I pulled the officer aside and asked him to remove the hoodie before making his next stop, politely explaining the law.<p>The linked PDF of rules says that the following isn&#x27;t allowed:<p>&gt; Wearing a t-shirt or button supporting a candidate, campaign, or political party (except voters in the act of voting)<p>The American flag with the military oath of enlistment isn&#x27;t any of those. I&#x27;d probably get upset as well if some poll worker tried to tell me I&#x27;m not allowed to wear the American flag on my clothes.')
