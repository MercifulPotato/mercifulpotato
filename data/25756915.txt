They aren&#x27;t talking about popularity.  They are talking about violence.  They aren&#x27;t saying that Facebook people are ashamed and trying to hide their affiliation.  They are saying they think they&#x27;ll get hurt because of where they work.<p>What can&#x27;t we take this seriously?  There was a right wing terror attack just days ago, rhetoric all over the internet is filled with imagery of violence and revolt and retribution.  And all anyone wants to talk about is the spin directed in the other direction about who is culpable, and whether or not content moderation and censorship are the same thing, and whether or not it actually constituted a coup.<p>But, people got hurt and killed on Wednesday, and the same communities continue to threaten the same kind of thing.  Is it so hard to believe that people at Facebook or Twitter or wherever, who are geeks just like us, are genuinely afraid right now?<p>I&#x27;ll take my downvotes now, thanks.')
