He never explicitly asks for things. He implies, leaving enough gap for plausible deniability. But to this mob he was very clear - come to DC on the 6th, go to the Capitol, target Republican lawmakers who were “weak”, ie, not currently stopping the steal.<p>Fuck Trump and fuck everyone in this thread trying to pretend like the mob never got any directions from him.')
