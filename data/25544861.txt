Preaching is a very well developed art; listen to preachers and they&#x27;re always telling a story of some sort, the story goes to lows and then up to highs, they draw that story back to the lives of their audience and then finish with a call to action to make their lives better. Even details like the preacher&#x27;s cadence and the songs and rituals are well thought out and tested to keep people engaged. It also helps that the bible is essentially a collection of stories that touch on fundamental themes of the human condition and that Jesus is a universally relatable figure.')
