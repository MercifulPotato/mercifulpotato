However, when I have a week&#x27;s worth of online coursework and boring bookkeeping to do it&#x27;s impossible to get more than 5 minutes done without staring out the window, putting something on in the background, and twiddling my thumbs. I can still buckle down and get work done without it, but it&#x27;s so much more mentally draining to do a week of work without any medication than if I were just to take what the doctor recommends.<p>How do you know that other people have it harder? My suspicion is that we all suffer in quiet desperation.')
