Somewhere along the line from a WordPress plugin or hosting upgrade, the cache-control headers were changed, and the caching was broken.<p>I find the assumption that it once worked a bit optimistic. Could be true, but people do stuff that doesn&#x27;t actually work all the time. Easy for me to see someone setting up cloudflare without either verifying that it has the desired effects of reducing latency and surviving load or digging into details like request rate to the backend and cache-control headers.<p>I&#x27;m mildly curious why each request had 500ms latency at best. I know PHP isn&#x27;t the fastest out there, and talking to MySQL on every request doesn&#x27;t help, but still that&#x27;s pretty slow. Also, no parallelism? That&#x27;s a bit sad.<p>If the content isn&#x27;t truly dynamic, I&#x27;d recommend to anyone just using a static website generator like hugo. A cheap VM can easily do thousands of queries per second without requiring cloudflare.')
