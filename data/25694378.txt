There is a lot of good journalism in MSM; just about everything reported on from leaks and &quot;anonymous&quot; sources leading up to the Mueller report was later confirmed in the report or by first-hand witnesses(the matter-of-fact stuff, not necessarily the conclusions). Buutttt... CNN still has their &quot;outrage&quot; segments and echo chambers..')
