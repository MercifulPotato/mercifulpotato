One is that it doesn&#x27;t say what the title claims. We know now what the Rieman Hypothesis is, but how did the author learned to love, and more importantly to &quot;fear&quot; the RH? What&#x27;s there to fear? The name of the famous movie (with the bomb) doesn&#x27;t even have &quot;fear&quot; in it, so the author had something in mind with &quot;fear&quot;, but after watching the video, I have no clue what.<p>Second is the promise in the beginning of the video to give us a hint why the RH is important. What we learn is that somehow each zeta zero adds another harmonic to some type of series approximation of the (cousin of the) prime counting function. Which is great; if we add enough harmonics we get to approximate this function as precisely as we want. But why is it important that these zeros are on the vertical line Im z = 0.5 ? I have absolutely no clue.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I find that watching this video was a very good investment of 16 minutes of my life. But there is no need to overpromise, especially since the video delivers a lot as is.')
