Those sorts of incidents are super rare. They hit headlines &#x2F;because&#x2F; they&#x27;re rare and therefore interesting.</i><p>It&#x27;s something that <i>should</i> be non-existent, I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else in the world. But only a couple of days ago there was yet another example out of the US [0].<p>These are the kind of absurd situations that simply do not happen in any other place as other places lack the &quot;firearm saturation&quot; that enables this in the US. So something that should be improbable, still ends up being a regular thing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcdfw.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;dog-accidentally-shoots-owner-in-the-leg-plano-police&#x2F;2473904&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcdfw.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;dog-accidentally-shoots-ow...</a>')
