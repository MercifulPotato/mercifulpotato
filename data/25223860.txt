You can always mess up and pass the wrong thing, the type system can never know what is semantically correct<p>This is not true. Consider the map function of a typical functional language with parametric polymorphism:<p>map : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]<p>That signature is <i>complete</i>, it covers everything there is to know about the function. And, except for trivial implementations, <i>there is no way to implement it wrongly</i>.<p>In some cases, one can even rule out trivial implementations and infer the correct implementations from the type signature alone.<p>In any case, there is no &quot;semantically wrong&quot; input to such a function. It is just a function and totally agnostic regarding your use case.')
