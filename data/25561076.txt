The stock market is sort of a proxy for this wish: You have excess capital, and you want to invest it in something that yields a return. Maybe that&#x27;s a machine producing goods you can sell, maybe it&#x27;s a machine that produces food and gives medical aid to you, the owner. You don&#x27;t want to operate such a machine (if it is available at all), so you outsource the responsibility for a percentage of your return.<p>It seems almost absurd that the world can end up in a state where it is impossible to invest capital in a way that provides any significant return at all. All is relative, but people still want to eat and get shelter from the rain.')
