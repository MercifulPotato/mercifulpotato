That&#x27;s hilarious, considering Twitter is currently one of the shittiest site around : half the time I click on a Twitter link (I don&#x27;t have an account) it leads to &quot;you are not allowed to see this&quot;. After one or more reloads (actuary number seems to be rolled off a dice) I get to see the content, ie. 280 characters and maybe an image. I imagine they never tried to use their own website.')
