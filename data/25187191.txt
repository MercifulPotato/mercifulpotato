Kraznich or however you spell his name, never knew a time (as CEO) when Intel wasn&#x27;t top dog (and I&#x27;m not talking about 6 months of AMD being on top with Athlon 64), so he&#x27;s never been hungry. In fact, his &quot;dismissal&quot; from Intel for hashtagMeeEeEToOoO is nonsense. They had been dating for years, before the anti-frat policy was put into place, and their relationship was cleared by HR; Brian got axed because someone had to take the fall for 10nm sucking so much donkey dick.<p>The new guy isn&#x27;t even an engineer, he&#x27;s an MBA. Anything Intel does under his leadership will be solely the result of everyone <i>but</i> him. Contrast this with AMD, where Dr. Lisa Su is an amazing engineer and also a brilliant businesslady.<p>Part two is culture. Intel is full of arrogant jackasses who are in denial about how awesome they are. Turns out AMD and Apple have legitimate badasses designing their chips, but they also have managers that aren&#x27;t causing unnecessary conflict between different teams. This same shit happened to Microsoft years ago too, by the way... turns out causing a lot of conflict on your teams in the name of &#x27;dA cReAm riSing To ThE Top!&#x27; is a fucking idiotic management style, which should have been obvious to these sub-geniuses if they&#x27;d spend more time in their biology classes - humans are a collaborative species.')
