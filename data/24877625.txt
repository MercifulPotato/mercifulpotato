Item(by='jkepler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603525425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875004, text='&quot;Artistic theft&quot; isn&#x27;t really ethically theft if someone has simply copied a work.<p>Imagine a small village. If John makes an axe, and Jim sees it and copies it, did Jim steal John&#x27;s axe? Seems like there&#x27;s only theft occurring if Jim claims to have designed it himself---stealing some of John&#x27;s reputation as the designer and first maker of that kind of axe. Doesn&#x27;t the whole village benefit from more abundant chopped wood? Or perhaps from cheaper lumber prices? True, John now has competition chopping wood, but perhaps he&#x27;s got an advantage as a designer and he&#x27;ll soon specialize as a carpenter or tool designer rather than just a wood chopper. Couldn&#x27;t it be possible that copying ideas and attributing the persons who originate them enriches the entire village---including those who came up with the new ideas?<p>I find Christian philosopher Vern Poythress&#x27;s ethical reasons why we should advocate for changing copyright laws to be insightful and persuasive... and I learned the axe inventor example from his article, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frame-poythress.org&#x2F;copyrights-and-copying-why-the-laws-should-be-changed&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frame-poythress.org&#x2F;copyrights-and-copying-why-the-l...</a>.')
