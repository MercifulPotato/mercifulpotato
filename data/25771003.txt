There are about 60 other definitions in Europe.<p>I would have expected it to be most closely associated with the roman mile, which is around 1.5 km.<p>Given that this is the very first time I&#x27;ve heard about the German mile, I would assume that &lt;1% of the population knows about it, and they&#x27;d probably consider a &quot;mile&quot; either the US thing if they are familiar with it due to travel, or most likely with &quot;some archaic unit that&#x27;s somewhere around 1.5 or 2 kilometers long, no idea, why would you use that&quot;.<p>The first association that I (as a native German speaker) when I read &quot;Miles&quot; in the German context wasn&#x27;t distance units - I interpreted it as a given name of English origin.')
