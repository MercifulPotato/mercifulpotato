One MRI (which showed nada), three or four doctors, several years of physical therapy, and a personal trainer who studied the problem later, and I am concluding the following:<p>- I have loosey goosey joints more than other people.  It&#x27;s not extreme but enough.<p>- I have usage of computers that far exceeds 90% of the population (12+ hours a day).<p>- When the joints are loose, things get inflamed.  When tendons and the joint structures get inflamed, the bodies responds protectively by tightening (turning on) stabilizer muscles<p>- Stabilizer muscles can be weak and thus get overworked, causing spasms and other issues<p>- Tight muscles can cause imbalances, further causing a chain reaction of more inflammation and spasms<p>I&#x27;ve been doing weightlifting (not bodybuilding which you should <i>not</i> do if you value your body long-term! Strength Training and a bit of Olympic Weightlifting) for a number of years.  I&#x27;ve been analyzing and thinking about posture for years.  I&#x27;m typing this on a standing desk at home that has a monitor with an articulating arm (similar setup at work).  I use left and right mice alternating.  I sit and stand, alternating.  I do neck stretches every morning and some isometric neck stuff.  I suspect part of my problem is shoulder mobility so I also do daily scapular work.<p>Yet.  I suffer from neck pain every few days with flare-ups that last days and sometimes go away for a week or two.<p>Medicine:  You Suck!  We can send robots to Mars and make self-driving cars, but due to the incoherence of modern medicine, I spend hours watching Yoga and PT videos and end up memorizing the names of bones and joints and physiological movements.  And I suffer.  Fuck you, Medicine!<p>Glad I got that off my chest.')
