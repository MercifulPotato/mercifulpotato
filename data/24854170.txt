An outage might interrupt synchronization, but you won&#x27;t lose access.<p>As far as the other concerns, I&#x27;d say these concerns are all present in the &#x27;single password re-use&#x27; strategy as well, except instead of choosing one single company to trust over your stuff, you now have to trust every single website you log into to safeguard your passwords, lest a malicious actor gets access to <i>everything</i>.<p>I agree there are downsides to services, but I disagree very strongly that the situation with services are no better than just re-using a password.')
