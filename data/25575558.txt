I suspect what they’ll do is have the fleet collect data to predict that coefficient of friction.<p>Seems plausible that they could ask all the cars this winter to report instances of wheel slippage, accompanied by video rewound with the spot the wheel slipped on annotated. Could have a prediction for mu at each  point on the road ahead of the car. All the pieces are there, it’s just math and NN work.')
