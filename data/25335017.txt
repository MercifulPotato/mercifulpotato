Item(by='lazyjones', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607364707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334002, text='&gt; <i>whenever there&#x27;s a rolldown, all tickets are positive EV, regardless of the number of tickets bought</i><p>This is probably likely, but wrong in general. If the tickets cost $1 and the total prize money is composed from e.g. 50% of the ticket prices plus a fixed amount of leftover prize money, when enough tickets are bought for the rolldown round, the leftover prize money isn&#x27;t enough to cover for the 50% of the new tickets that doesn&#x27;t go in the pot.<p>Example: $2m leftover money in the pot, 5 million tickets bought for $1 each. EV = $2m + 50% of $5m = $0.9 per ticket.<p>Now, if you buy enough tickets to guarantee e.g. 4 correct numbers and know for a fact that due to a rolldown the minimum payout is going to be high enough to cover the cost of that (at least with a high probability), then you&#x27;re fine. I&#x27;d assume that&#x27;s what the couple in the story did.')
