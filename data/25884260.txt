There isn&#x27;t enough information on how this service doesn&#x27;t store user data (or metadata) and still manages to connect them (in contrast, Signal has many blog posts and documentation about how it minimizes data collection).<p>In the FAQ, there&#x27;s this:<p><i>&gt; Which operating systems are supported?<p>&gt; TeleGuard supports all Android devices with version OS 5.0.3+ and all iPhone devices with at least iOS 9.0+.</i><p>It&#x27;s good to support a few older versions of operating systems, but I don&#x27;t think a messenger can promise security or privacy if it supports operating systems that are quite old by mobile standards and aren&#x27;t getting security updates for a long time.
