I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to blame the Wi-Fi spec for this.<p>If you want anyone to blame, maybe blame the ISPs or router manufacturers that market the idea that a single router can cover multiple rooms because that&#x27;s just not possible with nowadays&#x27; interference levels and bandwidth requirements.<p>Having multiple access points should be considered normal and expected.
