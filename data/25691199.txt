Was it the only factor in his win? Of course not.<p>But your whataboutism here doesn&#x27;t hold water. Sure, there are subreddits that commonly exaggerated the truth about the Russia thing. Should they should get banned, since r&#x2F;donaldtrump got banned for supporting violence? The two issues are so very different. I do not see hypocrisy in this case.')
