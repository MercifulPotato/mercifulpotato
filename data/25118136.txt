None of my comments explain my testing method. I apologize; this was present in an earlier draft of the initial post and got lost along the way. The question asked was only &quot;Which VPNs did you test?&quot;, <i>not</i> &quot;What was your methodology&quot;, and I didn&#x27;t catch the absence of the latter until you asked that in reply.<p>In summary, for each VPN app, I connected to the VPN and then wiretapped my computer to see if it originated unencrypted network traffic to any Internet destination <i>other than</i> the VPN while operating a variety of core macOS services on the exclusion list, such as Software Update and App Store.<p>In each case, I was able to witness Apple traffic on the VPN network interface but not on the Ethernet interface below it.<p>For anyone testing Mullvad, please keep in mind that they make use of the macOS packet firewall layer <i>in addition to</i> the usual VPN network interface, which may complicate my testing procedure if followed stringently as there might not be Apple traffic on <i>any</i> interface, VPN or not, in that scenario. Mullvad context is in another post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25116863" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25116863</a><p>APPENDIX: Note that, as far as I can determine, <i>existing</i> TCP connections were not reset onto the VPN when it was connected. Since I was inspecting <i>all</i> traffic, not just Apple traffic, I ended up having to restart Slack a couple of times just to get it to switch over to the VPNs. I would imagine this should be studied more closely, since it was a surprise to me.')
