This is not some free and open platform, it was a controlled one that purposely built an echo chamber of violent rhetoric. Twitter and Facebook don&#x27;t allow the same kind of violent rhetoric, lies, etc., and while they may not do an ideal (or even good) job at it, the fact is they&#x27;re broad platforms used for a whole lot of things for a whole lot of people and are absolutely not comparable to Parler.')
