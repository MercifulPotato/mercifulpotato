Mass extinctions don&#x27;t &quot;portend a massive explosion of diversity&quot; they literally signal the <i>end</i> of diversity. Ecosystems take millions of years to recover as there are few or no species left that fill prior ecological niches to provide ecosystem services. Biodiversity is not the result of extinction, it&#x27;s what happens between extinction events as millions upon millions of mutations build up viable species.<p>It&#x27;s like cutting down all the trees in the forest and declaring &quot;but in the long run, this will be good for the forest! Think of all the trees that will eventually grow here!&quot;')
