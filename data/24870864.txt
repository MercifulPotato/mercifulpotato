I feel like my reply might not have properly explained itself.<p>Nobody is applying a moral judgement to your comment (that I&#x27;ve seen at least), we&#x27;re pointing out that yes, we know there is no such thing as free money in a grand sense. For most people on this board merchant fees aren&#x27;t some unknown thing. We know this, and obviously McDonalds takes a tiny hit for the fees every time they refund a card transaction with cash.<p>It&#x27;s free money to the person it happens to is what the commenters were saying. McDonalds refunds my card payment with cash, I get the credit card points and my money back. It&#x27;s free money. To me. McDonalds taking a hit is irrelevant to me as I did not lose anything, I only gained. Hence free money. The context is important.')
