Item(by='skrtskrt', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1606936555, title="Ask HN: Should I get a Master's in CS?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='As an undergrad I studied Industrial Engineering, which included plenty of data analysis, which was how I first fell in love with coding. But this lack of CS education leaves me with big gaps in understanding of computer architecture, operating systems, networking, compilers etc.<p>I eventually forced my way into a software engineering career, going on about 4 years now ( I am 27). I have worked on web apps, back office microservices, big data platforms, etc. All in Python, so pretty far from the metal although I have started dabbling in Go and Rust in my spare time to force myself to think more about types, memory, etc.<p>I really find myself hungry to dig deeper and work on lower-level technical problems that deal with operating systems, networking &amp; infrastructure, etc - think like working on next-gen infrastructure like HashiCorp as a dream job.<p>I do not know if I could necessarily reach my desired level of experience and skill without attending a formal CS program, both due to the formal instruction and overall structure and motivating aspect of the Master&#x27;s program.<p>However, I (financially) would not be willing to stop working, so I would be doing it nights and weekends, stretching a Master&#x27;s out over 3-5 years so it doesn&#x27;t completely kill me when combined with full time work. This seems like a really long, intimidating commitment. On the other hand, it seems pretty worth it to have the degree and knowledge base I want in hand before 35.<p>If I went through with it, my top program choice would probably be USC - highly ranked program with an option specifically tailored for those without CS Bachelors, and the option to combine online and in-person instruction.')
