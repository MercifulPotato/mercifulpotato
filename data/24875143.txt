That was once a common belief, but recent results in extrasolar planet searching would tend to contradict it, or at least cast it into serious doubt.<p>&gt; Once the earth is full weâ€™ll have to find a way to move<p>Will we? It&#x27;s quite possible we&#x27;ll see humanity&#x27;s maximum population within the next century. Malthusianism didn&#x27;t really survive contact with modernity; it turns out that most people don&#x27;t particularly _want_ to have fifteen children, and as countries develop their population tends to become self-limiting. Wholesale emigration off earth feels like a very unlikely solution to population pressure, especially given that society seems to be automatically solving it.<p>And if we have the energy to lift billions of people off earth, we also have the energy to massively increase population density. Food, in particular, is ultimately largely a question of energy; we typically grow it in fields today, but given super-cheap energy there are other options.')
