At at minimum for all companies that are paying for windows support automatically.<p>As a consumer, I have an old Windows 7 laptop that I use once a month or less (don&#x27;t need to travel much lately). I can tell you that it&#x27;s been continuing to run windows updates all year long after the EOL.
