Item(by='rlpb', descendants=None, kids=[25084998], score=None, time=1605288306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084134, text='I wonder if a civil prosecution might be easier. Have people pay for others&#x27; loss of wages, medical expenses, the support of dependents of people they caused to kill, etc, when they can be shown to have caused the spread <i>and</i> been irresponsible, to a civil burden of proof.<p>Two possible problems:<p>1) It might hurt tracing efforts if people are worried about being prosecuted (ie. people &quot;clam up&quot;). For example, this particular story might not be known at all. Hurting tracing harms public health, so this might be a good enough reason not to go after irresponsible people on the basis of tracing infections at all.<p>2) I&#x27;m not aware of the law ever holding anyone responsible for non-deliberate infection. New legal ground would have to be broken in this area.')
