It’s pretty hard for a startup to manage self hosted k8s, given large number of moving parts and management of k8s infrastructure is as big as a task of managing the startup product itself.<p>LXD is decent enough to build a good high available horizontally scalable cluster on cloud of your choice or bare metal and can be managed by startup teams. Obviously once the startup begins to reach millions of customers and users and have enough revenue than k8s might be viable.<p>In majority of the projects LXD provides much better infrastructure.')
