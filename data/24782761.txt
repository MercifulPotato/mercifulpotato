What was it? Russia spent $50K on facebook ads and won trump the election?<p>&gt; Iâ€™m sure if this story turns out to be true, we will hear about it from more reliable media,<p>Like CNN or the nytimes or the washingtonpost which peddled trump-russia conspiracy for 4 years?<p>Lets be real here, you support this censorship because of your political bias.
