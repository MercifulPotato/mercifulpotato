The two key pair method mentions that each devices can be verified to be running authentic software by azure (the phone home thing everyone is worried about). While most laptops and computers do not ship with keys anymore and instead the hardware generates some kind of signature that is then verified by windows activation, this feels like an easier method of doing that. I wonder if this also means Microsoft is aggressively going to make more and new hardware (or some Microsoft verified hardware kind of thing to setup standards) to directly compete with Apple Silicon and keep profits healthy by forcing more customers to pay for authentic software.')
