In that time I have written a lot of code and worked with many excellent teams. I’ve not had any of your problems because we always chose tooling that, for us, struck better balances and gave clear, concise error messages. There are certainly projects which are badly designed, but that is the team’s failing in every one of your complaints. Perhaps you should look inwards and not lash out against a large, diverse community.')
