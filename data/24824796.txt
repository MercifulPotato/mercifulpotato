This could raise the layout of the board significantly.<p>Yet the speed they currently offer (PCI-e x1 Gen2) isn&#x27;t fast enough for RDMA to effectively &quot;chain&quot; the compute modules.<p>So I would see that they would have some sacrifice (e.g. fallback to the smaller and more cliche mini-PCIe like most recent fresh IOT boards out there), or even remove PCI-e expansion but offer something else (e.g. embedded SATA host&#x2F;multi-NICs where only the master node could control, then the rest of the children will have to rely on RDMA, despite it will be slow and painful).<p>It&#x27;s not quite economical for Turing Pi to implement NUMA-like architecture so I would rule this out.')
