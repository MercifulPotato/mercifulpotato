There&#x27;s a familiar pattern to this debate. Someone categorically declares there can&#x27;t be any exceptions to free speech.<p>Inevitably, someone brings up a counterexample.<p>Then the original person replies that it doesn&#x27;t count, because it&#x27;s not speech and there&#x27;s a different word for what it is. Libel, incitement, terrorism, whatever word is needed to cover the example.<p>But in doing that, you&#x27;ve carved out a category for things that are excluded from protections afforded to speech.<p>Then the next thread comes around, someone declares there&#x27;s no exceptions to speech, and the cycle continues.')
