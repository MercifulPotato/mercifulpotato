It manages to hit my interests so well, that I rarely go to netflix nor spotify anymore for discovery. I &#x27;ll either directly go watch something that I &#x27;ve chosen on amazon prime, or let the youtube algorithm handle recommendations. (I know this reads like a fake review - but I swear I have no affiliation for youtube btw. Just amazed how well their recommendation engine works)')
