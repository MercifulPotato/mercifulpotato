Rather, you need to hire entire departments of nonproductive people - eg billing and administration. When you zoom in, most of these positions look like a necessary function, but systematically they don&#x27;t need to exist. Take for instance a &quot;nurse navigator&quot;, whose entire job is to deal with insurance company rigmaroles - as a patient you&#x27;re extremely thankful to have them, but their position is actually only necessary due to a corresponding insurance company department (that you&#x27;re also paying for!) trying to deny you care.<p>The ultimate problem is this planned economy mandate of &quot;full employment&quot;. It is in no individual&#x27;s interest to declare that their own job is counterproductive, otherwise they&#x27;ll starve. So they hang on performing in their own little niche, sucking resources out of the system so they personally can continue living a dignified life. We&#x27;re stuck in a paperclip maximizer, and the healthcare industry is one of the best small-scale illustrations of this.')
