It&#x27;s genuinely sad that you feel that way- that you don&#x27;t see that I want to see OSM succeed and see obstacles in its way, namely the old boy&#x27;s network that underlies the project.<p>You&#x27;re an extremely talented programmer and you can be a very charming man- I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;ve chosen to engage in this little vendetta. It serves neither of us.<p>If you want to have an actual conversation, feel free to reach out- my door is open. Otherwise, please stop with this behavior.')
