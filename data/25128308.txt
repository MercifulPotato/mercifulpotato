Setting them up to be in conflict is at least partially an organizational failure. (is codereview bad because it pits developers against other developers?) Along similar lines, test automation can be a tool that makes both jobs easier: it shortens feedback loops for developers, and allows QA to concentrate on things that are not easily covered by automation.')
