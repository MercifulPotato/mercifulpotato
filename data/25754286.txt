Item(by='ajnin', descendants=None, kids=[25754562], score=None, time=1610487946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743228, text='Very nice. A few nitpicks :<p>- You need to wait a bit for a drop target to become active, so when you try to move items quickly it&#x27;s not registered and snaps back to the start location, is it something that is intended ?<p>- The animation is smooth with Edge but a bit janky with Firefox, as if it was animated at 10fps or so. It&#x27;s probably Firefox&#x27;s fault honestly. Also the border on dragged items is not shown with Firefox.')
