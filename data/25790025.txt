That&#x27;s of course assuming they could still trade their USDT. Tether (the company) cancelled $30 million worth of coins stolen from them a few years back which suggests if the company was seized the ability to trade USDT could be disabled.\nBut it&#x27;s also true that such a scheme collapsing would instantly drive demand for BTC from Tether (the company) to zero. If that demand really is almost 70% of all the demand for BTC then BTC&#x27;s price should decline significantly.')
