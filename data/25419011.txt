I have experimented with dynamically linking C libraries upon each file save in Ubuntu.  I find this a very productive way to work.  My dream is to make this happen in embedded systems as well.  I know enough to know it&#x27;s non-trivial.  But if I never ask, it might not ever happen.  Is anyone working on this?  How can I contribute&#x2F;encourage&#x2F;motivate?<p>Clearly, there are many copmlicating issues, such as flash memory, optimization, initialization, etc.  But having seen Bret Victor&#x27;s famous livecoding experiments, I know there are others who also want this.  Any advice besides &quot;learn everything myself and make it happen alone?&quot;  Where should I look?  What&#x27;s a good strategy?  What are some good in-between steps?  Does this exist somewhere?  Does anyone want this to happen?  Is anyone else working on this?')
