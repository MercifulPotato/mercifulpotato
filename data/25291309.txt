The latency between a keypress and a character appearing on screen makes the whole thing feel like a cheap experience. I have no idea what&#x27;s causing the latency.<p>I suspect there some very big fancy rendering pipeline occurring, because when I open Windows Terminal I get the nVidia overlay popup which normally only comes up when I launch games, indicating the terminal is using a GPU-based rendering engine. Which I&#x27;m sure confers some interesting benefits, but it&#x27;s a heavy price to pay when, at the end of the day, it&#x27;s just a terminal.')
