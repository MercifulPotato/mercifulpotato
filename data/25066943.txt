The costs are incurred when people use the <i>registry</i> for <i>distribution</i>, or for all the infrastructure needed to monetize the registry and track users. All a <i>registry</i> needs to provide is an index of  URLs, signing keys, and some useful metadata to enable discovery. Trivial in its purest form, with more cost if you want advanced features like ratings or curation or your own authentication service.')
