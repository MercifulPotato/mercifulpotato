So WordPress has no protections if you post bad content. So probably WordPress goes away.<p>No problem, you say, I&#x27;ll self-host my content on AWS and use CloudFlare as a CDN. But AWS and CF also have no section 230 protections any more either and probably won&#x27;t do business with you unless you indemnify under some kind of insurance policy (which you won&#x27;t be able to afford as a small blog).<p>Even if you run your own server and install it at home, the lack of section 230 protections will probably make your ISP responsible for content you publish (remember: your ISP is not a common carrier - thanks FCC) so you&#x27;re probably going to find that all consumer ISPs are going to have terms of service that prohibit publication, and technical implementations that enforce that.<p>I mean, in the non-Internet world, if I want to make a newsletter and mail it out to a subscriber list; I can at least do that. All I need is a laser printer, and a stack of stamped envelopes. The postal service is a common carrier, at least.<p>Today&#x27;s internet is a composition of platforms, all of which are really only possible due to the existence of section 230. It blows my mind that people are so blas√© about the idea of tossing it out or reworking it in a naive way.')
