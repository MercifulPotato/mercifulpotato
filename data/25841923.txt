You can remove them easily<p>Do you think cars still use the old ISO 7736 and ISO 10487 standards for radios? Those standard-sized oblong units where people would replace them with after-market radios? That&#x27;s not the case anymore and hasn&#x27;t been more than a decade or two. Car radios these days are an integral part of the cars computers and the infotainment system. They aren&#x27;t removable or swappable.<p>If you ripped out a new BMW&#x27;s computer what on earth are you going to do with that? It won&#x27;t fit in or connect to any other model.')
