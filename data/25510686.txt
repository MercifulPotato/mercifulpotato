What about capitalism necessitates imperialism? Was Soviet Russia not imperialist when it conquered much of eastern Europe? Is China&#x27;s expansion and One-China policy not imperialist?<p>Is quality healthcare tied to the economic engine of its country? How is universal health care in North Korea? Pretty good?<p>You&#x27;re conflating separate issues and presenting them as indictments of capitalism. That is either deliberately disingenuous or horribly ignorant. Either way, I suggest you pick up a book other than A People&#x27;s History of the United States.<p>UPDATE: Small addendum since you are confused as to what capitalism is. Your 14 year old nephew does own capital: their labor. Their ability, depending on labor laws in their state, allow them to offer that labor in whichever market or not. An option that would be deprived of them in a system that follows the prescriptions of &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.&quot;')
