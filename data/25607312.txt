Fuel cell is moving at warp speed right now, and batteries are losing ground at a rapid rate. We&#x27;re seeing fuel cells move into everything from e-bikes to aircraft. If there&#x27;s any kind of disruptive event here, it will be fuel cells replacing batteries at a much faster rate than except.')
