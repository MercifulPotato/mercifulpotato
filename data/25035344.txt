So what that NHS stores the data on a Solid server if I can only access it through a Google-owned HTTP protocol? Or next thing you know, Facebook only works if you voluntarily sign all your data off to them (which in essence it does now)? So what I can store my e-mails there if e-mail dies in favour of some closed-source Slack-esque invention, that <i>definitely</i> has E2E encryption?<p>The real issue is that internet is a common utility like railways, water mains or EM spectrum, and yet it can be monopolised by the megacorps with impunity. That some small town can put up its own water well and have a local waterworks - that&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really help the 95% of the country held in the grips of a monopoly owning wells, pipes, water storage and customer data.')
