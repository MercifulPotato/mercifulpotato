Very pretty and conventional looking. At this price range it’s more comparable to a Stromer, which is at once a much more vehicle-replacement oriented bike but also a bike that <i>looks</i> like a “Das Bike.”<p>It would be nice if this bike had insurance and tracking like the Vanmoofs do. As an owner of two and knowing other owners, this is a dealbreaker. One guy has even gotten his X3 chopped by kleptos, and is now enjoying his new free replacement bike.<p>This definitely competes for looks though.')
