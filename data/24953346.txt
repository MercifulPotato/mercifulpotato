Here is my experience. I am leading a meeting with about four native Indians that were here in America, and a couple that were dialed in from India. The meeting was with a large US based financial institution. Towards the end of the call, a senior member of the team joined. The mood of the meeting changed entirely. Everyone on the call kept asking for his opinion and what he thought, and he had nothing to add and no context about anything we had been discussing. I thought that was weird, and then started googling their last names and caste systems in India on a hunch. Yep, it was the reason, I deduced. I have no proof, but if I were a betting man... I always thought the highest castes in India were religious, so it seems like this is a battle between the castes lower than that. Regardless, there is no place for this in America.')
