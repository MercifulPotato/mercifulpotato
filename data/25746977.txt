You could get close to it by publishing data in a blockchain, but nobody does...<p>So, given that, the requirement must simply be to make erasing history too hard to do accidentally.   A simple git commit history would suffice for that.  Or just a check when you save the file to see if any lines have been removed.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem necessary anyway though - If everyone keeps a record of every incoming and outgoing transaction, then if I alter a transaction retrospectively, it will no longer match the counterparties records, and my modification will be detected.')
