Item(by='dilippkumar', descendants=None, kids=[25060563, 25060683, 25063649], score=None, time=1605115290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25058363, text='&gt; The $20,000 price point of our product + the high friction of the contact process + users that are OK with ads = A high signal to noise ratio from DF visitors.<p>I’m curious about the “users that are OK with ads” part of the equation. (From the article - these are DF readers who don’t have ad blockers and are willing to click on ads). I can’t wrap my head around how this is a signal. Are seasoned tech investors (the target audience for the product) more likely to browse the internet without ad blockers and more likely to click on an advertisement? Is it the other way around - people browsing the internet without ad blockers signal some amount of naivety that somehow makes them better customers?<p>I don’t understand this. Can someone please explain?')
