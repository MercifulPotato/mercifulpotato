You can see what worked well and what didn&#x27;t, and it enables effective refactorings. That also means when writing a client, you can quickly figure out from other client code how stuff is supposed to be used.\n... If anything like this were possible for open source (indexing code that depends on a library&#x2F;API, across subrepos in any version control system, in a way that gets near complete coverage), it would enable similar possibilities of systematic improvement.<p>gets me thinking — this is totally doable for open source code. someone just needs to build some giant indexes across git repos + package repos (maven&#x2F;npm&#x2F;pip&#x2F;etc)...<p>Then write plugins for VScode&#x2F;intellij, and when developing you can right-click a symbol and “Find uses in open source code”<p>Does something like this already exist?')
