And, using something else than i3(or any other tilling window managers) seems like a step down. I like instant switching between workspaces, splits, no animations.<p>And I&#x27;ll be looking for a good laptop next year, when everything returns back to normal, and I might have to travel. And will put Linux on it.<p>And agree with regards to aggressive marketing, in my case it makes the brand a bit toxic for my taste.')
