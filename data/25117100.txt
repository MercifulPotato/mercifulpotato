Any less might make me feel aimless.<p>I&#x27;m sure that they felt the same way when the 40 hour work weeks and weekends became standard. I wonder if, in a century, people will be antsy that they&#x27;re losing more than half their life to work, and a three day work week seems perfect.<p>I keep hoping that by then the robots will have completely changed all of that... but here I am working the same number of hours per week as my great grandfather.')
