You just defined another database in database.yml (say &quot;second_database&quot;) and then ran something like<p><pre><code>  class Foo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n    establish_connection :second_database\n  end\n</code></pre>\nStill pretty straight forward and simple - just opaque.<p>A lot was available in the Rails ecosystem or using Rails code without being explicitly supported by Rails itself. Much of the last few years has been including support for stuff like this that was already being used. To me, that&#x27;s what a mature framework does.')
