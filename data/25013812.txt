Who cares about code quality or best engineering practices? As long as company grows which in turn, my compensation grows and if I retire sooner than planned, then that&#x27;s great, right?<p>---<p>Sadly, I think this is the truth in many of the tech companies in the Bay Area. I&#x27;ve seen too many times why managers can&#x27;t understanding such a simple thing takes too long.<p>Common problem the blog explains already is the &#x27;go-go-go&#x27; product cycle. A dirty hack is applied to the code base to solve the problem quick but it&#x27;ll make code less easier to evolve.<p>Another problem I&#x27;ve seen is projects led by opportunists. There are engineers who build projects just good enough to solve the problem, gets all the credit before there&#x27;s enough soak time for the new shiny FooBar application and jumps to a new company with a new title and higher comp. The FooBar starts to have issues but the core developer is no longer with the company. Company needs checks to make sure these opportunists don&#x27;t go wild.<p>---<p>My reason for trying to reduce tech debt regularly is simple: Learning dirty code at company X gives no value to me for a long run. Also trying best to write clean and manageable code is something I honor as well enjoy doing it.<p>But... interestingly enough, I started a job at a company recently and code here is one of the worst I&#x27;ve seen in years. Copy-pasted codes, implicit behaviors where a code change is pretty much a whack a mole game, zero automated testing, no local testing, list can go on. However, company&#x27;s doing fantastic business-wise. Exceeding revenue target every time which in turn, we can just increase more head counts to write code on top of it just enough to make it &quot;functional&quot;.<p>so... does the tech debt matter?')
