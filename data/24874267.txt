If I only want audio, it&#x27;s an option away. I can script things together...Windows, the popular workstation, is not that.<p>I use the same video player on Windows that you use on Linux, mpv.  And I have a ton of scripts I use to navigate my video library.  Windows doesn&#x27;t put any burden on apps to not be interoperable.  Plenty of apps interoperate just fine.')
