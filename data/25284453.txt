Do <i>not</i> break this law if it&#x27;s passed. Here&#x27;s why.<p>Once your government determines that participation in crypto networks without using a registered intermediary is illegal, they have reasonable grounds to subpoena network providers for participation in such networks.<p>Once your government can reasonably determine that your IP address has accessed a crypto network without using an intermediary, then they have probable cause for search and seizure of your digital and physical property.<p>If you are caught by any means to be using VPNs or TOR to dodge network-layer inspection, this will result in more strict sentencing decisions, as doing so can be interpreted as knowingly breaking the law.<p>Additionally, as a bonus risk to everyone who knowingly participates in crypto, consider the malware problem:<p>If you&#x27;re infected by malware that is doing so without your knowledge or consent, you may regardless be found liable, depending on how poorly the law is written and how poorly the authorities choose to treat you, if you are found to be knowingly participating in crypto in any respect whatsoever.<p>(I am not your lawyer, this is not legal advice, seek legal counsel, etc.)<p>EDIT: Or any law like it passed it any non-US country, either!')
