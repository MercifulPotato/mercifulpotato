Lots of Americans tolerated his personality because they like the policy and the results:<p>He built over 500 miles of crime-stopping wall, raised tariffs on China, didn&#x27;t attack a new country, appointed decent judges, appointed a wonderful person for the Department of Education, put an end to racist anti-American hate sessions at federal employers, improved the H1B visa situation, ditched the Paris Accord, cut our taxes, got that pipeline approved, stopped China from using NAFTA via Mexico, got several peace treaties signed, and cut lots of economy-choking regulations. Just before that virus hit, he got us to the lowest unemployment numbers in recorded history (half a century) for black people and he got income inequality to go down a bit for the first time in ages. He even signed the First Step Act, fixing the overly harsh sentences imposed on crack users by another Biden-sponsored law.<p>That&#x27;s all policy that people wanted, not personality. I don&#x27;t know if that is more reassuring or more terrifying for you.')
