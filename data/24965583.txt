Third is location.<p>If this is true then how come despite people being richer today than in the past they are still less wealthy from a relative perspective? Your statement is obviously incompatible with our current world and fails to explain why we had less inequality in the past where people had less talent and worse personal conduct.<p>&gt;None of it is society [1], unless you consider refraining from forcibly conscripting everybody into communist slavery to be a structural factor.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you get these crazy ideas but the conventional solution to high unemployment is to just increase consumer inflation which makes it lucrative for everyone to work and whatever inflation we have right now is clearly benefiting existing wealth holders at the expensive of workers.<p>Decreasing wealth inequality is quite simple. Just increase wealth at the bottom. If poor people at the bottom have $100 to their name and Bill Gates has $100 billion then he is a billion times richer but if you made sure everyone at the bottom had $200 then Bill Gate&#x27;s relative wealth would basically be cut in half and he would only be half a billion times richer.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious that there are fundamental problems in modern economies and a lot of them relate to government policy.')
