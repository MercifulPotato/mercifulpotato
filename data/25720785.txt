Item(by='loceng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610317569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717806, text='I&#x27;m writing a slowly book on this, so there&#x27;s a lot to share to answer such a question; I&#x27;m also slowly planning out a network of health-wellness differentiated online platforms to provide practical tools for people to develop their self-awareness, to gain and maintain their health.<p>We is everyone who is conscious enough and on the path of good (practice of non-violence to other and self, whether specifically acknowledged or not) or of healing, those who are more self-aware than not, who have developed their critical thinking more and less indoctrinated. There&#x27;s of course a huge spectrum of where people are in this evolution or growth stage. Part of the challenge is rallying good hearted people, rallying, organizing and directing them and resources in the most efficient way possible.<p>The book will be a story of my healing journey including the incompetence I&#x27;ve encountered throughout our health systems, along with sharing my proposed solutions, explaining my own project plans to try to solve for those problems by providing practical tools to people. I will also be explaining a protocol I&#x27;m developing to help guide people to develop their self-awareness, to gain and maintain health, including everything from food sensitivities, fasting, yoga, acupuncture, entheogens like Ayahuasca, MDMA-assisted therapy, inner child regression therapy, stem cell treatments&#x2F;regenerative medicine, etc.<p>In short, it&#x27;s all about organizing and directing resources efficiently, while eliminating the waste. There are deep flaws to the health systems: indoctrination, a lack of multidisciplinary approach, industrial complexes who&#x27;ve influenced the knowledge and current practices, and more. The how of getting to a place where education and healing is taking place is - every possible way, any entrance point to direct people onto the path that they&#x27;re willing to open the door to. For many people they only begin to care about their health after an impetus occurs. The reality is most people on average aren&#x27;t very awake, conscious yet, and so indoctrination is easy - and then those indoctrinated are &quot;sheep&quot; following the status quo - and so what has to happen is the culture needs to shift, so then by default you&#x27;re following a path that&#x27;s healthy and supporting critical thinking and self-awareness development - which will lead to gaining and maintaining health - individually, community wide and globally.')
