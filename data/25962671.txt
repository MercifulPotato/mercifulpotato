DOGEUSD was useless 3 months ago and is still useless (even more useless than GME), but shorting it then would&#x27;ve blown you up because of demand exceeding supply. The volume of the incoming retail flow is hard to predict, if enough retail people ascribe aesthetic value to it, the price will go up.<p>(2) Borrow is extremely expensive because of high demand for the relatively small float, so you need very significant edge to justify the high borrow costs.')
