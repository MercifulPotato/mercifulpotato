If you are not getting that, you&#x27;re just ingesting a toxin that is useless at best.<p>Even if you are taking D3, it is not effective without K2. So, if you&#x27;re just taking D3, again, it&#x27;s useless at best.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re taking D3+K2 as oral supplementation. How much are you taking? One of the richest natural sources of Vitamin D3 is Salmon. You&#x27;d have to eat a kilo (2.2 lbs) of Salmon just to get 8400 IU of D3. If you&#x27;re taking a lot more (for example, 80,000 IU as used in this study), your liver has to deal with it... and it has not evolved to deal with that amount. The D3 produced in your body because of sun exposure doesn&#x27;t have to go through the liver.<p>Nutrition science is hard but nutrition is easy. Just eat what people have been eating for hundreds of thousands of years. Supplements are almost always a bad idea.')
