Press voice call in a client and you may end up with an embedded jitsi, some WebRTC thing, or nothing at all. That&#x27;s exactly how xmpp clients started to diversify.<p>This really isn&#x27;t an example of protocol fragmentation - it&#x27;s behaving precisely as expected.<p>There is precisely one way to do a 1:1 VoIP&#x2F;Video call in Matrix: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spec&#x2F;client_server&#x2F;r0.6.1#voice-over-ip" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spec&#x2F;client_server&#x2F;r0.6.1#voice-over...</a>.   It hasn&#x27;t actually changed since 2015 when we first added it to the spec, until recently when there&#x27;s a proposal to improve it called MSC2746: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;dbkr&#x2F;msc2746&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;2746-reliable-voip.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;dbkr&#x2F;msc2746&#x2F;p...</a>.  Now, this is a proposal to patch the spec - it&#x27;s a Matrix Spec Change.  It retains backwards compatibility with the current behaviour, and once the MSC is approved it&#x27;ll be merged into the spec and the MSC will be discarded.<p>There is precisely one way currently to do VoIP&#x2F;Video conferences in Matrix: you instantiate a &#x27;widget&#x27;, to embed whatever web conferencing service you like into your chat room (e.g. Jitsi).  You use the widget API to control it.  Widgets aren&#x27;t actually merged into the spec yet, but are specified at MSC1236 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1236" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1236</a>), which should get reviewed and merged in real soon now.  So, as long as your client implements widgets, you can do conferences.  In future, we have plans for native Matrix conferences (MSC2359), but this is vapourware.<p>Finally, if your client doesn&#x27;t implement 1:1 and doesn&#x27;t implement widgets (or if your don&#x27;t have permission to perform them in that room) then obviously hitting the call button won&#x27;t work.  But that&#x27;s hardly fragmentation; it&#x27;s just incomplete implementations.<p>Now, if there were multiple competing ways of doing 1:1 calls, or of doing conferences flying around, I&#x27;d totally agree we were seeing XMPP-style fragmentation.  But we&#x27;re not, and if we did, we&#x27;d see that as a massive bug and jump on it to resolve the fork in the Matrix Spec Core Team, and ensure that matrix.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spec resolved the collision asap.<p>&gt; Every time Matrix comes up, someone mentions xmpp and immediately the flinging starts about how broken it is and how those developers let it slide into obscurity.<p>Perhaps, but that&#x27;s not me or the Matrix core team doing that (well, other than back in the very early days when I was still feeling a bit salty about XMPP).  We can&#x27;t control what randoms on the internet say though :|')
