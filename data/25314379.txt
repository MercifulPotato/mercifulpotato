We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.<p>This means the date of her leaving was not set in stone, ie both parties would agree to the date or a date when she would leave. She had a vacation coming up and they would discuss it when she returned from vacation.<p>&gt;According to Ms Gebru, Google replied: &quot;We respect your decision to leave Google... and we are accepting your resignation.<p>&gt;&quot;However, we believe the end of your employment should happen faster than your email reflects because certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behaviour that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.&quot;<p>She was fired, not on account of the content of her paper, but the way she expressed her feelings to her colleagues, which wasn&#x27;t an exhortation for them lay down their tools, but because laying down their tools made no different as their work was ignored.')
