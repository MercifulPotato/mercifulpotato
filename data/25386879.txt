For all other use case the design has some significant flaws. E.g. a higher end headphone such as the Hifiman Sundara has the same weight, better sound (bluetooth is anyway questionable for good sound unless you use something like LDAC), much cheaper (350) and is therefore probably better suited for stationary usage. You can also get similarly priced headphones with bluetooth for stationary use. For mobile use (walking, or even running) something with this weight is definitely too heavy.')
