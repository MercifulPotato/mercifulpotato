It&#x27;s a fairly traditional view but well described there.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think it depends on the shape of the thing. &quot;What actually&quot; is not a fixed concept like that. For instance, &quot;what makes a good vacation?&quot;. One could say &quot;not having faeces on your nose for the whole time&quot; since, after all, it is unlikely that having faeces on your nose the whole time is likely to make a good vacation even if you&#x27;re on the most lovely beach surrounded by all you live. But that&#x27;s a baseline that&#x27;s easy to meet. So what _actually_ makes a good vacation? The truth is: ∄ an activity or characteristic X such that ∀ vacations V that have X, V is a good vacation.<p>So what &quot;actually makes people happy&quot;? No one knows. We know things that can make you unhappy (faeces on the nose, not having any relationships) and we know that there exists a baseline happiness we have (the <i>Hedonic Treadmill</i>, etc.). But really, not much more.')
