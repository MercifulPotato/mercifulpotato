Loss of job and family wasn&#x27;t rock bottom for them. Incarceration was. And they&#x27;ve since rebuilt their life and their family. Incarceration was the trigger that made that possible.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to your point and to all who are subject to any drug or alcohol addiction. But I feel compelled to comment that incarceration is not always the inhumane dead-end that it&#x27;s painted as. It&#x27;s one of many tools that can be used to rehabilitate those in need.')
