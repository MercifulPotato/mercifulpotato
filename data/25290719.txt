I disagree with the characterization that, as a result of recent scrutiny, the 737 is now &#x27;far safer than other models.&#x27;  It is not and no amount of additional scrutiny, and no signoffs by any number of pilots in any nation will change that.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the most scrutinized plane in aviation history, and has been vetted by multiple regulatory bodies and received thousands of test flights since fixes were made.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with any of this.<p>&gt; Honest question: if this isn&#x27;t enough for you, what is?  All other planes have been scrutinized far less.<p>It&#x27;s plenty for me.  I would happily fly on an 737 MAX.  However, I do question whether some count of hours of scrutiny (or whatever you mean by &#x27;far less&#x27;) is a good proxy for safety.  Things that operate safely tend not require so much scrutiny.')
