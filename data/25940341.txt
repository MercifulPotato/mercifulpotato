My guess is that the web site probably needs Javascript turned on in order to work correctly. That&#x27;s not a problem, as I can see that the functionality of a game requires the abilities of Javascript. However, you should put up a message along the lines of &quot;This game needs Javascript to work - if you want to play, please turn Javascript on. I promise to not do nasty things&quot;. And you should serve from HTTPS.')
