People do have prejudice against those parenthesis, so having an entry point that is &quot;Python-like&quot; (the most popular language for beginners and non programmers) that can still teach the core features of Lisp (everything is an expression, sort of easy AST manipulation, macros, parts of CLOS like multiple dispatch) will only help people appreciate the languages it was inspired on. And possibly they&#x27;ll also feel the limitations of non sexp macros and decide to actually move to racket or common lisp to free themselves from those restrictions once they become aware of them.<p>Possibly those people will even do something like Clojure for the Julia compiler (a mature version of [1]), with an entire community around it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about doing &quot;unacceptably lispy&quot; code (and it will certainly interop much better than Clojure and Java).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swadey&#x2F;LispSyntax.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swadey&#x2F;LispSyntax.jl</a>')
