Item(by='trey-jones', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602690020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777187, text='I live in a city&#x2F;town in Georgia USA with a population of about 25k.  I have never waited more than 10 minutes to vote.  This type of thing (long lines in Atlanta) was in the news last year during our very close gubernatorial election and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s far fetched to say that it decided the election.<p>As I recall, the main reason in the news was that there were so few voting machines available in Atlanta.  My observation as I walked in to vote instantly (on Election day mind, not early voting) was that we had 3 voting machines at my polling place.<p>It seems a pretty simple thing to me that if I can vote in 10 minutes or less and people are waiting for hours and hours in Atlanta (taking time off from work, giving up their whole day?), then it seems fair to me that my polling place can do with 1 voting machine and they can take the other 2 to Atlanta.  And of course I&#x27;m assuming that this strange distribution of voting machines exists in many other polling places as well.  If it didn&#x27;t fix the problem, then it could at least make it a little bit less bad.')
