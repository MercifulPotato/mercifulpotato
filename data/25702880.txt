Aside from temporal ranking of submissions, which is both universal and transparent, it&#x27;s the same.<p>The big problem with Facebook and Twitter is a potent mix of incentive for controversy, algorithmic amplification, and groupthink bubbles.  These problems exist elsewhere as well, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s all social media (eg. television news networks in an age of unlimited media choice), but I don&#x27;t think HN is a useful example to understand any of the macro-dynamics of todays information culture and political landscape.')
