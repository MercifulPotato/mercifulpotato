On street parking and running cables across a public pavement.  Many UK houses don&#x27;t have off-street parking, particularly in cities.  Like a thousand other comments, on here, until the infrastructure is solved, it&#x27;s nowhere close to the tipping point for electric vehicles.<p>The other problem is range vs time to charge.  Members of my family frequently drive hundreds of miles a day from one end of the country to the other.  There isn&#x27;t an electric car that can match a diesel (or petrol) car&#x27;s range.  And then charging time adds an hour to a long journey.  No one wants a 5 hour journey to become a 6 hour journey.  If time isn&#x27;t an issue, and we want to be &#x27;green&#x27;, why don&#x27;t we just return to a horse and cart?')
