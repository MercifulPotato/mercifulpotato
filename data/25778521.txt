Obviously their core franchise is about harvesting, but new adjacent products like NSX and VSAN helped a lot with growth.  They just took a long time to get traction given the customer base, who don’t like change.  VMware Cloud on AWS has been surprisingly strong even to skeptics like myself.<p>On the other hand, companies  would get rid of VMware if they could, and they tried and failed with OpenStack.  The hypervisor is commodity, but the overall compute&#x2F;network&#x2F;storage private cloud system isn’t trivial.  Turns out “holding hands” whether by software or services is pretty valuable?<p>Public cloud of course is a substitute, though private clouds and data centres have survived and thrived as well (for now).<p>- Pivotal had a boutique software and services model that would be difficult to scale as a public company given the current shifts in the enterprise fashion away from productivity-at-any-cost (PaaS and serverless) and towards perceived low cost building blocks (Kubernetes and its ecosystem).<p>But it would be an gross oversimplification to suggest this was merely a vanity project for EMC and Dell.  It took in $500m+ annually on open source software (and another $300m in services), which is no small feat, though still minuscule given what surrounds it.  But anything new has to start somewhere. Not enough to impact the mothership’s balance sheets, but there was something special there that could be nurtured.  Whether it can be, or whether the differences matter enough is anyone’s guess.<p>Pat could take Intel in a direction we don’t anticipate.   VMware was written off for dead when Pat came on but he managed to buy it another 10-15 years and at peak a doubling of the stock price. He’s probably learned from that.')
