Silence is a professional courtesy when it comes to certain ideas.  For instance, I don&#x27;t talk about how I find certain parts of 4chan incredibly hilarious.  As a black man, I&#x27;d definitely have co-workers blow up if I mentioned this at work - granted they feel more than entitled to talk about all sorts of things that I wouldn&#x27;t even talk about if I was at a bar with friends (fringe lefty politics and sexually explicit things).')
