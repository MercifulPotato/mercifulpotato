There&#x27;s... really no reason right?<p>My gut feeling is that there are a lot of people that don&#x27;t like Apple, mostly due to their proprietary nature, and they just... argue against Apple. Before the M1 appeared, the argument was that Apple&#x27;s Macs are expensive for nothing, they have terrible hardware, Touch Bar is bad, software quality has declined, etc... and now it&#x27;s all about the user&#x27;s freedom.<p>Seriously people. This article is about using dev tools on the M1 Mac. Let&#x27;s not start arguing about how Apple is bad for freedom, etc.')
