Especially when manufacturing and distribution is such a small fraction of this cost.<p>While time value of memory explains some of that itâ€™s still a huge discrepancy.  Advertising etc make up the difference and while cost effective for the company, their harder to justify as a fraction of drug prices.  Especially when over prescription is so harmful due to side effects and adverse drug interactions.')
