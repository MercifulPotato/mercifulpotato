It&#x27;s pretty hard to argue that that phenomenon isn&#x27;t driven by the ubiquity of IDEs in the Java community.<p>With high-powered auto-completion and one-button refactoring, your brain stops processing the full name. No one&#x27;s incentive to pause for a minute and come up with thoughtful variable names. For most developers it&#x27;s too mentally tempting to just puke out some CamelCase word salad, because the IDE hides all the effort of having to read&#x2F;write&#x2F;remember unfortunate names.')
