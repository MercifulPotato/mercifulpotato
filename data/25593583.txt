Part of proving one&#x27;s intelligence as a junior economics faculty member is doing a lot of mathematically-heavy fireworks and then moving on to &quot;real&quot; research that matters.<p>We can laugh at this one but what is not laughable is the huge resource cost in supporting an academic economics establishment (at least in the theory area) whose product is actually not that much different from this.')
