It constantly amazes me how far we&#x27;ve come.<p>Back in the 90s, CDs were the height of getting music.  1 disk would carry around 24 songs.  That&#x27;s it.  The internet was accessible, but limited to around 56kbps on a desktop.  Mobile data wasn&#x27;t a thing.  Texting wasn&#x27;t a thing.  Cell phones were barely a thing, but coverage was practically non-existent.<p>Most people got their media only from broadcast stations.  You had radio, television, and the newspaper and that was pretty much it.<p>The fact that data is available pretty much everywhere is incredible.  Even in the last 10 years, we&#x27;ve went from data being only available in the cities to being able to stream video in all but the most remote parts of the US.<p>On top of that, something not really appreciated by the general public is just how good codecs have gotten.  It is INCREDIBLE what can be done with the same amount of bandwidth we had in the 90s.  AV1 + Opus can very nearly stream SD content at 56kbps!  1Mbps wasn&#x27;t enough for SD content with MPEG2 and MP3 audio.  Now, 1Mbps is enough for 1080p HD content.')
