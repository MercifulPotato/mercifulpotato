Aside from all of the antisocial behaviour associated with drug use, having a large group of people who are a drain on society’s resources is certainly a harm to society as a whole. Which may sound callous, but it’s a very real consequence of large scale drug dependency.<p>I still think this is likely a good law though, because the justice systems current approach to drug crimes creates such a tremendous harm to society, there has to be some rather obvious benefits to curtailing that. If you look at how relatively minor drug convictions can affect people’s lives, it’s beyond any measure of proportionality. It’s just a harm easier to ignore because it mostly affects societal out-groups.')
