At the beginning the intensity falls off as 1&#x2F;r^2, but eventually the intensity becomes so small that you&#x27;re talking about individual photons. At some point the intensity will then fall from a single photon to zero. So, after some critical distance the intensity will actually drop to zero.<p>More formally, each star emits some amount of power in each frequency band: P(f) so that \\int_0^\\infty P(f) df = P_total.<p>For each frequency then, we have a total of P(f)&#x2F;(hf) photon emitted per second. The total number of photons emitted per second by the star is then \\int_0^\\infty df P(f)&#x2F;hf which is a finite number.<p>The total number of photons received per unit area a distance r away from the star would then be<p>\\frac{1}{4\\pi r^2} \\int_0^\\infty df P(f)&#x2F;hf<p>If your detector has an area A (e.g. your retina or some other device), you&#x27;d expect to see<p>\\frac{A}{4\\pi r^2} \\int_0^\\infty df P(f)&#x2F;hf<p>photons per second from the star. As r gets really large, you&#x27;d see this drop arbitrarily low. Conversely, the amount of time you&#x27;d need to wait to see a single photon from that star then grows, making the star dark.')
