Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603652988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24888729, text='Electron running on Wayland natively isn&#x27;t relevant to its ability to screen-share. Even if it were running on Wayland it wouldn&#x27;t be able to screen-share just based on that alone, because having a Wayland window doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with screen sharing.<p>Native applications these days have the option to use pipewire and xdg-desktop-portal for screen-sharing, and it doesn&#x27;t matter whether they use that from a Wayland window or an Xwayland window. Both Firefox (under Wayland) and Chromium (under Xwayland) use this method today.<p>Unfortunately Teams does not use that method and instead calls an X function directly, which crashes, as I wrote in the sibling comment.')
