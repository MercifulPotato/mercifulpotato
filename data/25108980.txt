It was a fun time because due to the slight obstacle of figuring out how to get online, there was a certain exclusiveness to it. Plus it was the first time I had ever used something like that other than AOL chatrooms (which I think were around at the time of the aol cdrom you would install)<p>edit: forgot there was #undernet too.. dang, what a fun time. I remember there were a bunch of other servers on top of those but I can&#x27;t remember them')
