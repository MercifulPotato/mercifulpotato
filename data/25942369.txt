To do so would need the compositor to somehow detect if an application has crashed or not which means nothing less than literally solving the halting problem.<p>&gt;  in particular, allthe X facilities for supporting window managers I would just flush.<p>In retrospect this is a huge mistake. Some niche window managers today have a more active community than the whole Wayland ecosystem. In fact the most popular haskell program is a window manager. So something must be right about enabling the modularity that makes window managers possible.')
