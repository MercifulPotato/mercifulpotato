Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607999539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425239, text='&gt; The average person has no ancestors who owned slaves, and the only benefits they got were things like cheaper goods and services. Added up over a lifetime, it&#x27;s probably not a lot.<p>The average person benefitted from compound accumulation of capital. After hundreds of years of compound interest, its probably unfathomably large.<p>&gt; But some people come from ancestors who made a LOT of money off slavery, and the benefits of that have been passed down to them one way or another.<p>If those people can be identified then someone may lodge a claim against their assets. From what I learned in Black World Studies, the fruits of slavery are largely considered to have been spread through society in a way that can&#x27;t be traced and reconstructed because <i>everything</i> is tainted.')
