He was banned from politics but he suddenly decided that will of the people is the highest priority, he was a flaming democrat and he was right that it&#x27;s not right to ban him from politics. With the pressure from EU and USA his right were restored and Democracy began to flourish in Turkey up until he had enough power to not to have to deal with this.<p>Fast forward today, He actually tried to steal elections(made the elections canceled, then he lost again with higher margin then proceeded to remove power from the office he lost) and whoever seeks support from EU or USA is labeled as traitor.<p>It&#x27;s simply sad that the trick works so well everywhere.')
