I&#x27;ve also spent a month in Japan traveling and gotten to know hosts who were on AirBNB. One host we talked deeply with after she lost all of her other bookings from a massive typhoon.<p>The problems she has with guests and the problems Japanese people face as a country are very different. She has had to stop taking specific types of guests because of rude behavior like flushing food down the toilet and damaging tatami mats. When in Japan, a person described their culture as, &quot;having a very specific way of doing things and becoming very upset when people get in the way of that.&quot; With so many people having that mentality, hosting is a more friendly sort of thing.<p>We have different issues. We&#x27;ve become friendly with several of our guests, and even see some past guests once or twice a month to spend time together. When the guests come from AirBNB, we have to maintain a lot of vigilance. We&#x27;ve had multiple drug dealers, a large number of people smoking weed in our rentals, child endangerment, and a few parties. AirBNB has a hands-off policy and there are a lot of pieces of shit who have learned they can abuse AirBNB&#x27;s system to do what they want, and we don&#x27;t quite have the same culture of empathy anymore.')
