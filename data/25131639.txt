Does a CTO exist and if so are you on good terms? I don&#x27;t think this is about inspect element anymore. Your coworkers revealed their feelings about you. Consider this: if you actually hacked the site for a gag, and they liked you enough, no one would&#x27;ve mentioned anything to the IT guy. This may be a good opportunity for you to jump shop once you are vindicated -with a year&#x27;s severance for the headache. I wouldn&#x27;t try to stay at this company unless you have some overriding reason specifically to stay here. Your coworkers view you as disposable. THAT is &quot;disconcerning&quot;.')
