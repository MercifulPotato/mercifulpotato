Love gitlab but the pricing does add up quickly. Even if with all the features, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to get value out of Gold&#x2F;Ultimate.<p>When I add up all the major SaaS apps an average user has: SSO, Email, Chat, Storage, Zoom, Support. Combined, GitLab Ultimate costs 2-3x that. And I promise you that as much as we all hate a messy inbox, email is more broadly useful than GitLab.<p>The other problem with ultimate is that it strongly incentives you to NOT let anyone else on the platform.  At $1200&#x2F;year there is no way in heck I&#x27;m letting the artists use Git, they can stick to their terribly Dropbox hacks. Marketing team working on assets with developers? Use email, no way you&#x27;re getting access to GitLab.  The $100&#x2F;user&#x2F;month model makes sense if they are a core developer (still too expensive, but makes sense) using every single feature in the system, but nothing else.')
