So no, they&#x27;re not compatible retellings. Your tl;dr is basically the same post with &#x27;reform&#x27; taken out of it. Even without that, it&#x27;s patronising to assume I didn&#x27;t read what you had to say such that you had to reword it while also being sarcastic about it.<p>I don&#x27;t feel that you&#x27;re responding to me in good faith. More to that, I still feel like you&#x27;re responding to your imagined version of my response, and not the actual one. It feels to me like you&#x27;re creating an argument when I was merely disagreeing and presenting my reason why. I don&#x27;t really understand how the tone of this chat became so aggressive through you.<p>Our peers here on HN can decide that, one way or another.')
