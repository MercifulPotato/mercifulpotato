I&#x27;m supporting a clinic in Asia that is using OpenEMR for records.  The government is requiring reporting of diagnoses by category.  This is exactly the sort of paperwork that an EMR system should be able to solve well.  Since we haven&#x27;t figured out how to do this with OpenEMR, the staff is doing it by hand.  I hope to solve this problem soon, whether by figuring out how OpenEMR supports this or by adding this functionality.')
