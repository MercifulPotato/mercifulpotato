Instead of crossing your hands over the top of the wheel,\ndrivers will need to re-train themselves to guide the wheel while keeping hands\nat the 3 and 9 like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.makeagif.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;6-08-2017&#x2F;239ulB.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.makeagif.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;6-08-2017&#x2F;239ulB.gif</a><p>The problem that this wheel spotlights is that (too) many people\ndrive with their hand or hands at the 12 o&#x27;clock position. This can be\nextremely dangerous when you need to swerve quickly (to avoid an obstacle) as\nhaving one&#x27;s hand there not only increases the turn radius well over what&#x27;s\nusually required to overcome the hurdle, but it also reduces steering control.\nThis creates a negative feedback loop wherein the driver makes extreme steering\ndecisions to counteract the perceived loss of control, which exacerbates impact\nwhen the accident finally occurs.<p>Auto makers doubled down on this by adding premium materials to that part of the\nwheel specifically to provide a nicer, luxury-feeling surface for the driver&#x27;s\nhand. Instead, Tesla is tapping their inner Apple courage by removing that part\nof the wheel altogether (to both give drivers more view over their horizon and\nto force drivers to steer properly or use Auto-Steer more often if this isn&#x27;t preferred).<p>Tesla is also doubling-down on FSD with this approach as they are finally giving\ndrivers a wheel that is commensurate with their &quot;Autopilot&quot; tech.<p>I applaud Tesla for taking this approach with the steering wheel. I wish I could\nupgrade my Model 3 to have this!')
