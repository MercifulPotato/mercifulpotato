We came from EF6 and decided that the training wheels were getting in the way more often than it was worth. Performance was also abysmal but I am confident that has been improved dramatically for EF Core.<p>In cases where we want to store really complex object graphs in SQL, we typically resort to JSON serialization of those objects. This allows for us to keep the important SQL facts in dedicated columns (i.e. for PK&#x2F;constraints&#x2F;indexing) and also have a copy of the full serialized POCO sitting in the last column for convenience.<p>For reference, these databases (SQLite) are not shared with external parties&#x2F;systems so we can get away with this sort of heavy-handed denormalization approach. Our use cases of the databases are very well bounded.<p>In terms of migrations, we just write a simple for loop and use SQLite&#x27;s user_version pragma to keep track of an incrementing integer version. This means that we actually have a superior solution to EF in that we don&#x27;t need additional special metadata tables to keep track of this information.')
