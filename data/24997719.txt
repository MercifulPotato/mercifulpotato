It frequently has very large differences with other metrics, and often &quot;feels wrong&quot; compared to those other metrics.<p>It mainly seems to massively overvalue historical significance, the older the language the higher it is. E.g. the current ranking has Perl 5x more popular than Typescript, and Visual Basic 2x as popular than PHP.')
