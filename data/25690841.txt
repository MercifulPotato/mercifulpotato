I don&#x27;t have a beta for you to try out yet, but I thought I&#x27;d share my ideas on how to make notifications less stressful for open source maintainers.<p>I was really inspired how HEY solved my email inbox for me and I thought it would be great to apply similar tools to other types of notifications - GitHub ones in particular. For example:<p>- Screener\n- Reply later\n- Mute any thread without blocking users or repositories<p>Curious what your thoughts are and how does your current workflow on GitHub look like? What would you love to exist or not exist? Thanks :)')
