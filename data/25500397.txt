It feels like an elitist club. Grades are only a snapshot of your current understanding of something. Given enough time and interest, anyone can earn high marks. If I was in this class, I&#x27;d only care if I was able to learn what I came there to learn.<p>I have friends who go through hell being on their anti-psych meds and anti-depressants because of uni. I wish the culture in university was more empathetic to their needs.')
