Meanwhile we are adding (50GW * ~0.50 capacity factor) ~= 25GW of wind capacity every year. By the time these new systems are planned to deliver their first GW in 2030, we&#x27;ll have 500GW (nameplate) of wind delivering between 50 and 500GW round the clock, augmented with utility-scale storage that currently runs about $200M&#x2F;GWh and will be at least 2x cheaper by 2030. [2], [3]<p>Then there is geothermal, and solar plus li-ion storage (or better), and solar&#x2F;wind augmented with hydrogen electrolysis. I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re developing new nuclear power, I really am. But the competitive landscape it faces is daunting.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;renewable-energy-market-update&#x2F;technology-summaries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;renewable-energy-market-update&#x2F;t...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;australia-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nov&#x2F;05&#x2F;victoria-plans-300mw-tesla-battery-to-help-stabilise-grid-as-renewables-increase" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;australia-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nov&#x2F;05&#x2F;victo...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theage.com.au&#x2F;national&#x2F;victoria&#x2F;victoria-to-build-one-of-the-world-s-biggest-batteries-near-geelong-20201105-p56brg.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theage.com.au&#x2F;national&#x2F;victoria&#x2F;victoria-to-buil...</a>')
