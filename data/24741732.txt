Letting children sleep longer is simply not legal in (I assume) most jurisdictions. He mentions off-hand that co-sleeping is not recommended by most pediatricians but fails to mention that the risk associated with co-sleeping is death. Free sleeping is simply not possible for those who need to be at work in the mornings.<p>This article essentially amounts to a fire-and-brimstone sermon full of questionable statements, things that run directly contrary to established science, and poor argumentation and use of sources; it is also an order of magnitude too long for even the most patient reader.<p>Truly a shame, because I think there&#x27;s actually a lot of useful ideas and information there, but they are very hard to separate from the scaremongering and pseudoscience.')
