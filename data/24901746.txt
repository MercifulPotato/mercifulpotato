The fact that Microsoft didn&#x27;t tell the RIAA to go Disney themselves means that 100% of the blame lies at Microsoft&#x27;s feet. No exceptions.</i><p>What you said is clearly correct, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect any company to insert themselves in the middle of these disputes. At scale it&#x27;s impossible.<p>Imagine you run a forum with millions of members and tens of thousands of posts per day. You get a stack of DMCA takedown requests every day. Do you think it&#x27;s feasible for you to scrutinize each and every one, and take a moral stand on those you deem &#x27;not procedurally valid&#x27; ?  How much do you think that might cost?  What happens when you call one wrong and the law comes to YOU?<p>For anything to really change, it&#x27;s clear someone will have to go after the RIAA.. (EFF maybe?)')
