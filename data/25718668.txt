Anyone who is Anyone in the Bakeshop Community has a Presence on the EBB Network.<p>Would you then require me to keep those comments up? Because not having access to the EBBN is professional suicide for a bakeshop professional? Because I&#x27;m &quot;ruining lives&quot;? How do you write that law?<p>Or can I take them down, but I have to continue to allow MagaBakerBabe post, and I am just required to spend money paying content moderators to monitor what they are posting?<p>I am genuinely curious, from a legal perspective, what is the alternative to &quot;Corporations are allowed to ban people for whatever reason they like, except membership to a protected class&quot;?<p>Or are we not talking about laws at all, are we saying Google is free to ban whoever they like, but it&#x27;s Bad, and we&#x27;re just issuing a strongly worded rebuke here, and we would prefer that anyone with a Blog Network considers the free speech implications of deplatforming users like MagaBakerBabe?')
