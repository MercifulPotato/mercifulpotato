I settled with the Sony XM2 for their sound signature and price point a few years back. \nI bought the AirPods Max out of curiosity and I can attest that most comments on internet are from clueless people that like to bash products. \nThe sound signature is <i>nowhere</i> near any Sony or Bose headphone. \nThey just destroy them. \nThe build is exceptional, my Sony or Bose look like toys in comparison.<p>But like many other things, sound for people is <i>not that important</i>, meaning not 200$ important enough.<p>Just like, the latest TV technology is not that important for me to update to the 4K latest OLED TV. My old one LED is enough.<p>AirPods Max compare to the Beoplay H95 which are 200$ more expensive. \nSo in this case, why buying anything over the Bose or Sony price range ?<p>The AirPods Max are a pleasure to use like <i>all</i> high end overpriced headphones out there. And please donâ€™t tell me that most of the times you are not paying the brand on <i>any</i> high end product.')
