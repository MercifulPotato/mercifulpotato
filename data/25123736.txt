I love this HTTPS-Only mode and wish it would become the default (with better downgrades and messages for users who may not understand what it means). With the number of HTTP-only sites dwindling, this could result in a faster experience for sites that do not want to (or haven’t figured out how to) use HSTS or HSTS Preload (no redirects from HTTP to HTTPS) and for users who haven’t heard of the HTTPS Everywhere [1] extension.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;https-everywhere" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;https-everywhere</a>')
