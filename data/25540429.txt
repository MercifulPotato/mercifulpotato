Often ended up with inflexible, hard-coded shit, guessing sizes (&quot;8px padding? I think so??&quot;), guessing colors, whatever.<p>At another job, the designer I worked with just gave me a link to a Figma file, and I had everything I needed. I could shit out front-end stuff quickly, without any issues.<p>I used to think I was just a bad at front-end, and therefore preferred the back-end. Turns out I&#x27;m just not that good a designer, and with a tool like Figma, building the actual designer&#x27;s vision was easy and joyful.')
