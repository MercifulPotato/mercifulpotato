It&#x27;s similar for elected office, which is one reason we have these special protections.<p>That said, I agree with you. As Judge Salas says herself in this article, this is about the foundations of democracy. Peerage is certainly that too.<p>Also, since prosecutors and police are covered by this law, we need to think of this as mostly relating to law enforcement. They are the vast majority of this population.<p>Meanwhile, privacy is obviously an area that needs 21st century attention. We should at least get a reason why we don&#x27;t get these protections too. Extending their rights to privacy separately from everyone else doesn&#x27;t sit right with me.')
