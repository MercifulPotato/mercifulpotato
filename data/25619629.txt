Item(by='starky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609650343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) Hybrid, I design hardware so I typically have to go in to use equipment about once every week or two. A bit surprise is how little I need to be in the office.<p>2) I&#x27;m about a 30 minute walk&#x2F;10 minute drive from the office<p>3) Working from home hasn&#x27;t been too bad, a bit of loneliness, but mostly it is fine.<p>4) Pros - Less people bugging me throughout the day to answer questions, able to go run errands during the day if needed (e.g. grocery shopping off peak hours). Cons - Having to plan when I go into the office to do stuff, keeping track of the other people on my projects and making sure work is being done, more meetings, later hours (mostly due to being asked to oversee an project from an overseas team, at least I don&#x27;t have to get home before or after the meetings).<p>5) It sucks living in a tiny apartment and working from home. It would be greatly useful if I had a separate office so I can shut work away at the end of the day. I literally go an lie on my bed just to get away from my workspace. If it was permanent, I&#x27;d be looking to move to a larger place.  A job specific observation&#x2F;quirk, remote desktop doesn&#x27;t work well with 3D CAD programs when you run 4K monitors at home.<p>6) It depends on the type of person. My job could never be fully remote, but a hybrid model works better than I expected. I&#x27;ll definitely be wanting to work from home occasionally even once everyone is back in the office.')
