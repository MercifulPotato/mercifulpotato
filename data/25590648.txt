Item(by='jacquesm', descendants=None, kids=[25591747], score=None, time=1609401998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590426, text='Because of material inconsistencies that are hard to get rid of (sheet metal is rolled to thickness out of a non-uniform billet, and cools non-uniformly as well due to edge effects, so you get small hardness and thickness variations) the material will deform in unpredictable ways during stamping. This causes very small deformities but over the size of a whole door it adds up leading to door being off by up to a few mm even when using exactly the same tooling during manufacturing. Welding then further deforms the door, even when it happens robotically and in a jig. The chassis typically suffers from the same effects. When the chassis warps one way and the doors warp in the other you can end up with poor fit.<p>So manufacturers will do what they can to control for this but it will always be an issue as long as the input material is as inconsistent as it is.<p>Unlike software, the real world is messy, and while of course it is technically feasible to mill a whole door and a chassis out of a billet it wouldn&#x27;t be economical. So we adjust during manufacturing to cover the variations.')
