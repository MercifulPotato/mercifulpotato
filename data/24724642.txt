Item(by='biztos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602196327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724365, text='Years ago, before &quot;FAANG&quot; was a term, I was flown in for an interview with Amazon in Seattle, a city I like enough to have considered moving there.  They put me up in a grimy capital-M Motel by the airport with a cracked sink and a $50 cab ride into town (back when that was expensive).<p>OTOH they were quite efficient with their response.  It was a mutual &quot;no&quot; and they spared me the trouble by getting to me, with useful feedback, within 48 hours.<p>There is a lot of BS around the hiring process these days, but some parts of it are still in HR&#x27;s control: namely the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of the actual interview day(s).<p>If that part is bad, it indicates rot in HR, which will be a problem every single time you interact with them.<p>I have nothing against Stripe, just commenting on the general case.')
