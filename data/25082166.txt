That product doesn&#x27;t have to exist yet, it just has to be on the path.<p>Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 2 is what I use and I&#x27;m very happy with it. My requirements were a moderately high-performance laptop, hybrid&#x2F;discrete graphics, not excessively bulky and good Linux support. I can&#x27;t fault my choice. The <i>only</i> issue I had with hardware compatibility under Linux was due to me receiving it a couple days after launch and the drivers for the wifi card not yet being in the kernel used by Debian or Ubuntu (no longer an issue iirc). Happy to answer any specific questions you have.')
