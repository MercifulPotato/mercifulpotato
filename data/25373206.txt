And ethics is covering much more than just religion (source: bith my childern are in ethics class).<p>Regarding your last argument, following that logic would include argueing genocide as a solution as well. Which you obviously cannot. There is no way why China&#x27;s human righs abuses should be tolerated or supported. Tolerated to the degree geopolitical realities dictate, sure. Learning why realities are what they are and why China is doing what they do, of course. Finding arguments supporting their actions for the sake of the argument and &quot;critical thinking&quot; excersise, no way. Same goes for the death penalty.')
