It doesn&#x27;t do a full text search, but often helps me in a way I think you&#x27;re after.<p>If you type: &quot;^ worms&quot; in the searchbar it will search your history for &#x27;worms&#x27; and show the results in the dropdown. Typing &quot;* worms&quot; will search your bookmarks instead. The rest of the shortcut symbols are listed on the linked page. Hope that helps!<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kb.mozillazine.org&#x2F;Location_Bar_search" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kb.mozillazine.org&#x2F;Location_Bar_search</a>')
