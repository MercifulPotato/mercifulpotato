Academics; where do they come from?<p>Having scoped out a design for this, seen a design for it in a large corporate research lab, and noting that several large scale machine learning packages .... almost do it .... themselves: you just need to lay out the data in a memory friendly way, and you&#x27;re freaking done. It&#x27;s a completely straightforward task which could be done with any number of existing columnar data stores if it hasn&#x27;t been done already. The only reason it hasn&#x27;t been outside of (large research lab) is the type of skill needed to lay out the data in the DB properly and the type of skill needed to write efficient machine learning algorithms almost never exist in the same person. Then you get academics .... who think you need to write automatic differentiation in SQL to integrate ML with databases, having never heard of, I dunno, online BFGS or Pegasos, and, like, C.')
