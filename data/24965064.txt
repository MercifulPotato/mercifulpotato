I poked and prodded your argument, because I found it to be extremely unsound (excluding the censorship discussion).<p>And frankly I fail to find any set of eyes I&#x27;d be comfortable with where I could follow your argument for the author being a Russian-bot supporting right wing Qanon based on what he wrote. Just too unsound and lacking any assumption of good faith on the authors part, casting him as what is - in these parts of the internet - almost (right wing) or defacto slurs (russian bot; Qanon).<p>Again, as for seeing with somebody else&#x27;s eyes... well, I did for the censorship argument, didn&#x27;t dismiss what you said outright (sorry if that wasn&#x27;t clear enough) but put forth my own argument, that in part even agrees with what you said yourself.')
