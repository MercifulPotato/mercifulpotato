If that isn&#x27;t a referral, I&#x27;m not sure what is.<p>No.  You&#x27;re searching DDG or Google or Bing and a website for the restaurant comes up.<p>It says it&#x27;s the restaurant.  It has the menu and the phone number.  But it&#x27;s not the actual phone number of the restaurant.  Nor is the website set up or endorsed by the restaurant.<p>Both are owned and controlled by a third party (in this case, GrubHub) which <i>claims</i> to be the restaurant, and by virtue of SEO-spamming the site to the top of the search results, you get that site instead of that of the actual restaurant.<p>I&#x27;m trying to decide whether or not you&#x27;re ignorant or just being deliberately obtuse.  Care to settle the controversy?')
