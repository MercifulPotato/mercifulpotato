In a strict microservice scenario we would indeed need 40000+ microservices to replace our core business.<p>The thing about (our) mainframe integration is that it is essentially made up of microservices, only they&#x27;re small chunks of COBOL being called like pearls on a string, each producing output for the next in the chain.')
