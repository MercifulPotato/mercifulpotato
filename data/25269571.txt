On the last feature I completed, I wrote 2500 lines of pthread &#x2F; Unix domain socket server code, and it ran on my WSL&#x2F;Ubuntu target with only lightweight text file based shims to replace drivers on the embedded target. When I slid it over into the embedded build flow, it ran on the first try, no changes.<p>Compiled as a unit test harness in about 3 seconds on my WSL instance. Our full embedded target takes 30 minutes to build. So the WSL&#x2F;Ubuntu instance is a huge time saver.')
