I rode a bike for 8 years but after a while the risk got to me, and I stopped. A close friend&#x27;s brother was killed as he &quot;T-boned&quot; a woman pulling out of a supermarket plaza without looking for oncoming traffic (her fault, he had 2 kids, he died on impact). A second friend was recently severely injured, as a van hit him while violating the rules at an intersection. He had to have his leg amputated. I love bikes a lot (it&#x27;s a family tradition), but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s not worth it for me. Of course, this is a personal decisions, and everyone should do as they wish. Just be careful and do your best to keep the rubber side down.')
