Honestly it didn&#x27;t feel buggy at all. Especially compared to Skyrim or similar. You can get rare weird physics glitches, I had one situation where I seemingly teleported&#x2F;blacked out (not sure if that is a quest) but nothing outstanding, and sometimes bodies don&#x27;t fall to the ground in a proper way but generally it felt very smooth and bug free.<p>I am running it on a high end PC, maybe the bugs manifest more often on a lower spec PC?')
