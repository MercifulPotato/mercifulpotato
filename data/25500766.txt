I can accidentally kill a pedestrian, a pedestrian can&#x27;t accidentally kill me unless they throw a brick off an overpass.<p>I&#x27;d argue the opposite conclusion and say that as one operating dangerous machinery you should be given lower right of way for safety reasons. The burden should be on you to drive safely more than others to safely stay out of your way.<p>&gt; So that they take responsibility for their own safety<p>And what about your responsibility as the person choosing to speed around in a ton of metal?<p>&gt; In car-heavy suburban areas where everything is super spread out? I don&#x27;t think this is a necessarily a good idea.<p>There&#x27;s a chicken and the egg problem here. Such cities came about because of monopolization of streets by drivers. We can&#x27;t change that over night but given the vast benefits of people centric urban design we should be tilting the balance away from cars and towards people.')
