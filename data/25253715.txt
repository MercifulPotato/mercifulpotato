He claimed he&#x27;s made double his money since paying for his &quot;insider trading tips&quot; or whatever. My roommate claimed he was a self made millionaire.<p>I looked the guy up, he&#x27;s just a college dropout whose parents owned a very successful real estate agency to which he was placed in. He then got absurd amounts of capital from the commissions only people like his parents could get.<p>My roommate believed this guy knew the ticket to wealth but all I saw was basically the xkcd comic of &quot;but lottery tickets! It works!&quot;')
