I&#x27;m not addressing the Signal project in particular, but maintainers of free software projects need to be polite and professional (in words and deeds) as well.  Users who take the time to investigate bugs and get involved in fixing them don&#x27;t have &quot;infinite resources to pour down the drain&quot; either.  Maintainers presumably derive some value, even if not monetary, from their involvement in these projects.  Having more users than they can handle is a problem that comes with the territory of a popular project--and needs a solution just like the more technical ones.  (I translate the term &quot;toxic users&quot; as modern-speak for &quot;people who aren&#x27;t exactly aligned with me&quot;.)  I often contribute to alpha status free software, so I don&#x27;t always gain reciprocal benefit--but I do like to help others.  How many times have you seen an open issue or pull request on a project that isn&#x27;t addressed at all after years?  Often, in my experience.<p>Last year, I was working on my free software project, and I heard repeated blasts of a car horn from my driveway.  I have advanced arthritis, so it took me a while to get up and go to the door--I wasn&#x27;t expecting anybody.  The car drove off before I could get to the door.  The next day the same car was in front of my mailbox.  The door of the mail box was drooping down.  The car stopped on the side of the road, so I had enough time to hobble out and approach it.  It was pouring rain--I had my shirt up over my head to keep the water off.  I found out it was my new neighbor.  She was doing improvements on her home and needed my signature on an HOA document.  She said, &quot;I&#x27;m disabled, and I need a favor.  Also, I broke your mail box putting the document in it.&quot;  I said, &quot;I&#x27;m disabled too&quot;.  She laughed, &quot;Oh, I see.&quot;<p>The moral of the story being, Signal, be glad you don&#x27;t have to deal with people who want something from you IRL. :)')
