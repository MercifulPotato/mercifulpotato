DKIM provides neither truthfulness nor objectivity. It&#x27;s a signature mechanism used between mail servers to reduce spam. For implementation reasons, most DKIM users sign with RSA keys that are either <i>currently</i> crackable or will be crackable in a matter of years. Consequently, &quot;signed&quot; emails that are leaked years after their alleged transmission provide a <i>false</i> sense of non-repudiation.<p>2. Per 1, these emails are <i>already</i> impossible to authenticate after a period of time. This just makes the expectation more explicit. More generally, however, this just isn&#x27;t a fruitful (or intended) application of DKIM: if the government wants to obtain evidence of a crime, they&#x27;re going to subpoena the email provider and retrieve the originals. If the suspected criminal is sufficiently important, they&#x27;ll use pointier methods. The outcomes of our criminal justice system <i>intentionally</i> doesn&#x27;t hinge on the validity of a few DNS-published RSA keys.')
