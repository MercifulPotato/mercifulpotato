I used to love the technical aspects of programming, but eventually it just turned into a grind.<p>My solution was to move into management. This is not the right path for everybody, since it&#x27;s basically a completely different set of skills even if you&#x27;re still on a software engineering team. And it&#x27;s a hard job. But so far for me, it&#x27;s been a good change.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be management. Maybe it&#x27;s product, or support, something else. The point is, you&#x27;ve likely got some skills that are related to getting software products out the door, there&#x27;s probably a way to translate that into a non-technical role, if that sounds interesting to you.<p>I would also second what others said about burnout or depression. For me it was anxiety. Not a bad idea to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.')
