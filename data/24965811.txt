I posted this blog post with detailed pictures of the insides, and some more details and performance benchmarks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffgeerling.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;raspberry-pi-400-teardown-and-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffgeerling.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;raspberry-pi-400-tear...</a><p>There are also a couple videos linked in the post, if you&#x27;re more visually-inclined.<p>Fun fact: the Pi 400 (and Compute Module 4) both have newer revisions of the BCM2711 SoC (C0 instead of B0), and that&#x27;s part of the reason the clock speed is higher on the Pi 400 (1.8 GHz) than on the regular Pi 4 model B (1.5 GHz)â€”the newer revision apparently handles faster clocks and scaling with less heat than the older revision.')
