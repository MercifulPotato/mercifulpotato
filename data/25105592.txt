That seems unlikely. It&#x27;s more likely that the update includes new firmware for that chip which contains a bug. In theory, when Apple identify the cause they can update their software so this won&#x27;t happen for future upgrades. In the meantime, I&#x27;m sure they can offer compensation to those with bricked devices who can choose to either put that towards a new computer or send it in for repair.')
