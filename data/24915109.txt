Then most contributor lose interest and the pace slows. It makes the original roadmap impractical and more devs lose interest, which spirals into a dormant project (Inkscape)<p>* Maintained flawlessly, but no new groundbreaking features get added and there is a slow exodus of users toward new-shiny until it is a perfectly bug-free irrelevant piece of code (most JS stuff, GnuPG, some crypto libs, OpenBSD).<p>* Maintained into the ground by aggressive&#x2F;oppressive&#x2F;elitist&#x2F;cultist&#x2F;dogmatic core team followed by a split of the community (pre re-merge of glibc&#x2F;eglibc, GCC&#x2F;EGCS, ffmpeg&#x2F;libav, Gnome&#x2F;MATE&#x2F;Cinnamon&#x2F;Unity, Vim&#x2F;NeoVim, all of Suckless, most of GNU)<p>* Fancy&#x2F;overkill roadmap made at a time when there is plenty of contributors, but so hard to achieve most of them give up before the finish line (KDE4, GIMP 2.10)<p>* Unresponsive&#x2F;exclusive community toward new contributors and&#x2F;or SJW attempts accidentally FUDding a previously functional community (lets not point fingers and start a flame war)<p>* Unwillingness to break things or pay up the tech debt in order to stay relevant (EMACS, pre-LLVM-era GCC)<p>* Break everything consistently and often and&#x2F;or remove your contributions because of a dogma (Gnome)<p>* The Free-software people and the commercial contributors revolt against each other (OpenOffice&#x2F;LibreOffice&#x2F;StarOffice&#x2F;CollaborraOnline, OwnCloud&#x2F;NextCloud)<p>* Misguided attempts at making money by breaking things for your users (GhostScript, eLive, Mepis, Mandrake, every project who moved to AGPL)<p>* No attempt at ensuring the project can exist without its founder (CentOS, all single-person-army projects out there, all BDFL who refuse to let go when they lose interest)<p>* Sabotage (ion3, ffmpeg, Cyanogen)<p>* Suicide by committee (many Apache&#x2F;Eclipse foundation projects like Apache OpenOffice)<p>* Make a major incompatible upgrade with no clear migration paths (Python, GTK, KDE, Gnome, AwesomeWM)<p>* Promise a major upgrade, tell your users to wait for it, then backtrack (Perl)<p>* Maintain multiple branches of your software forever until you fragment your user base so much you compete with yourself and lose to new-fancy (OpenSSL, pre-rolling Firefox, MySQL, most &quot;enterprise grade stuff&quot;)<p>* crazy rebranding ideas leaving most of your users unaware of the new project (Apache OpenOffice, my own SFLPhone-&gt;Inutchuk-&gt;Ring.cx-&gt;GNU Ring-&gt;GNU Jami-&gt;Banji fiasco, KOffice).')
