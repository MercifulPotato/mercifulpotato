I feel the scientific community would benefit so much from a (sponsored?) program that paired game developers (or UI&#x2F;UX specialists, or game psychologists) with teams building scientific software. For example we help describe species- while not quite the same thing, gamers do that everywhere, skinning, equiping, stat-min-maxing, etc., they are storing facts about entitites, and getting them served back to them, often in FPS time.  Of course there are different considerations, but some of the ideas are identical, e.g. store, and retrieve lots of data, in as few clicks as possible.<p>As scientists very rarely do we have the time or opportunity to think deeply about the UI&#x2F;UX experience, we have to get things done, with minimal resources, for example over the course of funding for a 2 year grant.  This project was a bit of an exception, and a lot of fun to be in: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bioip.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bioip.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
