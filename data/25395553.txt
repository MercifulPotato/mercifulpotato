They witnessed the packet traffic to international servers.<p>With regards to &quot;debunking&quot; on sites like Politifact you need to be careful.  For instance they say the Smartmatic technology was not used in states that are being challenged when thats just not true.  The tech is the same but runs under different banners and is all owned by Dominion.  Also they focus on if Hugo Chavez family owns Smartmatic as the thing to debunk.  Obviously thats not the case or the main convincing argument that is even being made.  Its that the technology was used to game elections in Venezuela and that adopted tech is used in elections around the world now (why else would it be acquired unless they wanted the tech).  There are no code audits because Dominion claims IP protection.  Does that mean election rigging is happening?  Not necessarily.  But people have every right to ask that question and you should ask it too no matter what side you&#x27;re on.')
