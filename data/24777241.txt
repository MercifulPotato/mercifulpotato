Those at high risk have to intermingle with everyone else, and most at high risk don&#x27;t know that they are.<p>You don&#x27;t just &#x27;gain herd immunity&#x27;. You get the virus, be contagious, give it to anyone else you come in contact with, and they go out and do the same. People can&#x27;t afford to quarantine and refuse it. People will not wear a mask, they don&#x27;t care. Americans whom won&#x27;t die from the virus will not take it seriously.<p>In reality barrington is advocating that people die. Which if they&#x27;re doctors they&#x27;ve violated their do no harm promise - not that it ever meant anything.<p>As far as I can tell barrington has no leg to stand on. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re supposed &#x27;experts&#x27;, if they&#x27;re right then they can prove it.')
