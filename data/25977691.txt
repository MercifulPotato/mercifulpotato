But much more likely is our different public policies. And if you need evidence, the UK is an island (like Aus&#x2F;NZ) with policies more like the US and - surprise! They have case numbers more similar to the US than similar to Aus&#x2F;NZ.<p>If you really think the island &#x2F; continent thing is relevant, I&#x27;m excited to hear the story of why the US&#x27;s covid disaster is somehow actually canada and mexico&#x27;s fault.')
