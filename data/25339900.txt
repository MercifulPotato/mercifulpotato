Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=[25340701, 25340097], score=None, time=1607387925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339820, text='&gt; I&#x27;m always amazed at how often cops approach every day tasks with weapons drawn.<p>That is IMO a side-effect of the (from an European POV) absolutely mind-boggling, ridiculous sentencing of criminals in the US. Here in Germany, when a drug smuggler gets caught, they can expect four, five years behind bars. Not worth to shoot the cop that just stopped your car full with meth and make a life sentence out of it for murder.<p>In the US however? Decades, sometimes <i>centuries</i> behind bars. Given that perspective, it does make sense for a criminal to shoot that traffic cop - the chance to get away and escape a death in prison is non-zero.<p>Add to that the fact that there are more guns than people in the US, plus extremely lax carrying laws, and &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.<p>The result are (rightfully, I have to admit) afraid and thus extremely trigger-happy cops.<p>If the US wants to get rid of trigger-happy cops they have to get the gun problem and sentencing under control first.')
