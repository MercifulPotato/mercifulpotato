I know there have been plenty of people complaining online.  Now a roof flies off of a Model Y and that’s terrible.  But I’m not sure why all the other recalls don’t get as much coverage and this Model Y.  I mean Volvo just had a recall for the Polestar for a problem that would cause total power loss.  I understand Tesla is the hotness to hate and love.')
