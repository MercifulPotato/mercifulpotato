Franklin Computer case from the early 1980s: Franklin made a computer with an OS that it said was &quot;compatible&quot; with the Apple II; Franklin claimed to have independently developed its own OS, but it turned out that the Franklin code included not only what must have been thousands of identical lines as the Apple code, but also the name of one of the Apple programmers, James Huston, as well as the name &quot;Applesoft.&quot; [0]  (If memory serves, I read somewhere that the names were embedded as values of no-op string variables so that they wouldn&#x27;t be stripped out during compilation, as comments would be.)<p>[0] Apple Computer, Inc. v.
