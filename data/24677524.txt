There&#x27;s no reason to have to parse your code 3 times during compilation.<p>Also, a bundler operating in the AST is much more efficient, as has been proven by Rollup. But parsing a 4th time is also a waste, so let&#x27;s put it together with the same tool.<p>And while you&#x27;re also there, your test suite also needs a &quot;bundler&quot; of sorts inside itself to transform the code and run tests. Why isn&#x27;t it the same tool? Jest and Webpack have so many small differences that makes life difficult. So put it in the same tool, too.<p>However... another thing that I hope to see becoming popular is not using a bundler&#x2F;transformer at all. Except for special situations, or for some regions, you don&#x27;t really need transpiling&#x2F;bundling it at all, since 99% of your visitors are on evergreen browsers.')
