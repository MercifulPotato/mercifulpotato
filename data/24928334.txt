I mean that. I appreciate that. Forcing ourselves to see the other side is important, even if only to immediately discard it; because it&#x27;s the practice of doing so that helps us when we really need it.<p>For me, I think it&#x27;s unlikely the generous interpretation is correct, for only one reason: a group of 4 of them needed to call him, rather than a 1-1 conversation. This is a group dynamic that is well understood and they knew what they were doing, using the safety and strength of a group to ensure he couldn&#x27;t push back. In such a scenario, one of the participants in said group is unlikely to be nervous in that way, although it&#x27;s certainly possible (especially if they know, deep down, they&#x27;re being unfair and are battling heavily with that feeling -- even the group strength won&#x27;t help them).')
