Now that he is gone, having regular checks and balances is a &#x27;good thing&#x27;. Having the &#x27;other side&#x27; with a narrow, 1 vote majority in the Senate is probably a really reasonable check on power, as Senators often break ranks with the party so there&#x27;s plenty of room for a &#x27;really good bit of legislation&#x27; to get through if the Dems want to push for it.')
