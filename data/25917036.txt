NONE of the courts have even looked at the evidence this time, not even the thousands, not just dozens, of sworn affidavits that certify that fraudulent activities were witnessed. If it&#x27;s all fake and &quot;unverified&quot;, how can any rational person justify that none of the evidence has been even looked at.<p>I have looked at even just some of the evidence and just alone the statistical data indicates extremely strongly that at least something was clearly wrong that would cause any good faith and rational person to at least want to look further at the data. And there are several instances like that, not even just one that I found.<p>For example, just one example of several extremely suspicious situations, how is it that of the bellwether districts that have all, for the last 10 presidential elections essentially all gone to the winning candidate … both Democrat and Republican … all but two went to Trump this time.<p>Again, any rational and good faith person would be extremely alarmed by even just a few of the mountain of suspicious events that are being totally blacked out, just like the Hunter Biden laptop was totally blacked out.<p>Maybe you are not a good faith actor and really don&#x27;t want to or care about realty and the truth, but any decent person could not ignore these matters, no matter how much they intentionally avert their eyes and mind.')
