And mao doesn&#x27;t meet nixon without hundred or thousands of sino-american meetings behind the scenes.<p>This makes no sense. If China were completely isolated, it would still have corrected to the point where it could operate without everybody just dying in the streets. And that correction would have been a suite of economic reforms, since the economic policies were what was making everybody die in the streets. An interaction with the United States might have hastened this, or included some minor US-specific side effects, but over the long term it&#x27;s meaningless.')
