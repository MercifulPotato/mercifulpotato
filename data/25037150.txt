If you&#x27;re looking at cost-per-page, I agree - If it were, then I&#x27;d be buying a laser-jet or a tanked ink-jet (and that would be many multiples of £24 extra).<p>Not just the cost I can now put out of mind, it&#x27;s the annoying stuff (like &quot;I bet HP just made 50 cents every time I clear the heads&quot; or &quot;FFS I just printed 20 cards with a sky on them, so I&#x27;m out of Cyan&quot;)')
