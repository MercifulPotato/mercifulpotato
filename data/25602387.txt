Not every industry needs to &quot;innovate&quot; their way into surviving the VC bubble&#x27;s attempts to disrupt it. Hospitality is a fundamental service that&#x27;s been provided for centuries, and is a cornerstone of the economy.<p>Second to that, the law doesn&#x27;t prohibit it, it just makes the delivery service seek an arrangement first. I am not terribly saddened by the fact that the delivery platforms have to do some groundwork instead of just web scraping a bunch of menus and making money off splitting all the risk between restaurants and customers.')
