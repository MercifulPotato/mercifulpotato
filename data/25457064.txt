This specifically affects tests if you do things like update the UI by toggling loading spinners on await.<p>You should have a core (pure) functional component, that doesn&#x27;t perform network requests, and an outer component for side effects.<p>Your testing for the inner component becomes trivial: Do the correct props product the correct HTML? Fairly trivial to validate. Use Enzyme, react-testing-library, etc.<p>The outer component, which contains side effects, can be covered through an end-to-end testing tool like Cypress.')
