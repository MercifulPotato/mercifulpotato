How many times is the data being copied, or moved between devices?<p>2. Are you recomputing data from previous frames that you could just be saving? For example, some tracking algorithms apply the same CNN tower to the last 3-5 images, and you could just save the results from the last frame instead of recomputing. (Of course, you also want to follow hint #1 and keep these results on the GPU).<p>3. Change the algorithm or network you&#x27;re using.<p>Really you should read the original article carefully. The article is showing you the steps for profiling what part of the runtime is slow. Typically, once you profile a little you&#x27;ll be surprised to find that time is being wasted somewhere unexpected.')
