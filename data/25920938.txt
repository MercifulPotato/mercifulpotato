I (head of the Eng group) love Gitlab and had used it for  some time in personal&#x2F;open-source projects.   I managed to convince the team about Gitlab and we migrated, initially in the Free tier.<p>My first surprise was that Gitlab does not allow for Monthly payments...if I wanted to go into the Bronze tier, I would have had to pay a whole year in full.  My startup doesn&#x27;t do whole-year payments (quarterly or monthly) so that stopped me on my tracks.<p>I guess with the full weight of Microsoft, Github will out-price Gitlab. It&#x27;s kind of sad because I prefer Gitlab CI&#x2F;CD to Github actions (I just couldn&#x27;t make sense of them).')
