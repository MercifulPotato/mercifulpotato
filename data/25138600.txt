Are you so absolutely dedicated to the phrase “falling on deaf ears” that if somebody says to you “hey, that phrase might hurt somebody’s feelings, can you use an alternative” you take it as some sort of massive imposition on your life?<p>I don’t understand why small changes that can be done in kindness are seen as so inconvenient as to be worth this level of rejection.<p>I’m hearing impaired. “Falling on deaf ears” is a phrase that honestly does kind of bug me. People use it to mean being ignored for idealogical reasons but often the reason I, somebody with an actual hearing impairment, don’t react to something is because the person trying to communicate with me isn’t doing a great job of accommodating that. I tell me coworkers “I’m hearing impaired, please speak loudly and slowly if the environment is noisy” but they still mumble and get annoyed with me when I ask them to repeat.<p>Idk man, if you feel like this is language policing I recommend you walk a few years in my shoes and come back to me.')
