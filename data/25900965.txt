I may not have to rip all of them, but I will probably do some sort of rapid de-duplication check. It will probably be much more involved than the normal toc disc id though. I might compare bits from random areas of each disc to verify it is the correct pressing. I&#x27;m still not 100% sure how I&#x27;ll do it, but I don&#x27;t want to store more than I have to.<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to take the pieces of a broken disc and verify somehow that it&#x27;s a legit copy. Then I&#x27;d treat the pieces like every other copy of that disc and give the owner access.')
