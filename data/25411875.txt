There is the dat [0] project, which started 2013 and shares files between computers p2p. In may 2020 the dat protocol was renamed to the hypercore protocol [1] and dat &quot;will continue as the collective of teams and projects that have evolved from the original Dat CLI project.&quot;. hypercore-protocol [2] links to multiple applications for file sharing (none of them the dat CLI tool).<p>Hyperdrive [3] &quot;help[s] you share files quickly and safely, directly from your computer [...] -- all P2P&quot;. The github [4] mentions the hyperdrive daemon als a batteries included experience, but the hyperdrive daemon has a deprecation notice and tells you to use hyperspace.<p>Hyperspace [5] &quot;provides remote access to Hypercores and a Hyperswarm instance&quot; and &quot;exposes a simple RPC interface&quot;. The documentation is very technical and seems to be aimed at developers, not using it as a tool.<p>Digging around in the github organisation [6] or by stumbling upon the patreon [7] one can find the hyp CLI tool which is &quot;A CLI for peer-to-peer file sharing (and more) using the Hypercore Protocol&quot;. The first commit is 9 days old. On the twitter of the author one can also find hyperbeam [8], which is integrated into hyp.<p>Here on HN one can also find an announcement for &quot;uplink&quot; [9].<p>The tech looks pretty cool, but the vast amount of different projects makes it difficult to grasp. From all of these tools the dat tool seems to be the most advanced, but not actively maintained. It&#x27;s not linked on any of the hyper* sites and doesn&#x27;t seem to be the recommended way to use the hypercore protocol to share files p2p. While I would like to use the tech, I&#x27;m pretty lost on how to do that today.<p><pre><code>    [0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.datproject.org&#x2F; \n    [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.datproject.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;dat-protocol-renamed-hypercore-protocol&#x2F;\n    [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercore-protocol.org&#x2F;\n    [3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercore-protocol.org&#x2F;#hyperdrive\n    [4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hypercore-protocol&#x2F;hyperdrive\n    [5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hypercore-protocol&#x2F;hyperspace\n    [6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hypercore-protocol&#x2F;cli\n    [7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;hyp-command-line-44923749\n    [8] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mafintosh&#x2F;hyperbeam\n    [9] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;paul-reveals-is-44665610</code></pre>')
