I have implemented the alphazero training pipeline in torch, which uses a dynamic language runtime with performance comparable to V8. After spending weeks optimizing my MCTS, rules engine, and game state encoding and decoding, I still found that the CPU time consumed by these things caused substantial underutilization of the GPU. But at V8 levels of performance this is more like &quot;it takes 2x as long to train&quot; rather than &quot;it is not viable to train.&quot;<p>If I had done a better job of writing my above comment I would have made it clearer that this is not mostly about python-for-data-science. Most &quot;right tools for the job&quot; for other jobs are also points in tradeoff space that give up a lot of expressive power, ability to ensure correctness, performance, or all 3 in exchange for benefits that may only make sense over very short time horizons.')
