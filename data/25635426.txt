They do not seek exclusive bargaining power for a contract.<p>It seems more like an association of employees who seek to influence leadership on specific topics.  There influence comes not from the threat of a strike, but rather just numbers (eg we have X% of workers, all willing to put up 1% of pay, you should really listen to us).')
