Only a few more steps are required:<p>* Cover every rooftop, every parking lot, every desert with solar panels as much as we can.  Cover every windy plain with wind turbines.  Take all the excess power and instead of building expensive batteries, use it to power this CO2 -&gt; synthetic liquid fuel process.<p>* Carbon tax on any &quot;fossil&quot; fuel sources (anything from the ground).  Make it expensive so the synthetic fuel is competitive.  There&#x27;s other ways too (like requiring X% mix of carbon neutral synthetic fuel, just like they do now with ethanol).  Slowly increase the percent over time.<p>* All the old infrastructure (existing cars, gas power plants, ships, trains, buses, airplanes, etc.) becomes more and more carbon neutral as the fuel becomes more synthetic.<p>Even with the most optimistic EV car adoption projections, there will still be millions of gas cars out there.  Other old carbon fuel based infrastructure (such as power plants) are hard to replace because solar&#x2F;wind are not steady sources of power.<p>This path addressees the weaknesses of solar&#x2F;wind (how to store excess energy) and how to quickly transition existing infrastructure to carbon neutral.')
