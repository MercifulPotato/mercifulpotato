I was in the “honors” version of her class along with a few other guys that apparently weren’t warned. We were all A students normally, but we all regularly got Cs in her class and it tanked my GPA. My favorite example is that we had to make a diorama based on the Iliad, and I did Polyphemus’ cave. I was marked down because it wasn’t colorful enough.\n There were girls in the class that clearly weren’t “honors” material that got As. Another teacher’s daughter actually went and complained to the principal on behalf of the boys to no effect.\nShe finally retired this past year. I do senior photography and she’s been brought up by a lot of former students and they all talked about her sexism.')
