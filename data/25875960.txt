They take a photo of your license plate and send you a bill in the mail after looking it up in the state registry. For those who registered (have an express RFID chip or similar), that process is cheaper and you get a cheaper bill that is summed up each month&#x2F;quarter.<p>To stay strictly with the analogy, 1) what is our online license plate? 2) how would one send a bill after translating license plate to home address?<p>To me, these are fundamental web browser capability deficits. Tim Berners-Lee envisioned this and put some HTTP response codes in the registry with a <i>TODO</i> bookmark and never got around to it or something like that. It is possible but we will have to call in the committee.')
