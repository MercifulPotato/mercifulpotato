Would you mind educating me on an appropriate scenario where you may need tens of thousands of vnodes?<p>Maybe large unpaginated tables? A chat panel where you have scrolled through a large history?<p>Even if a framework like React can handle that many nodes, surely there must be better ways of handling the requirement.
