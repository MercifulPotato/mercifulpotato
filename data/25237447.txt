Used to be Latin, then French and German, now it&#x27;s English. No big deal IMO.<p>In fact I kind of like the way this is going since it represents a fantastic opportunity for NL researchers to stand out simply by publishing research and corpora focused exclusively on low-resource languages and non-English&#x2F;Mandarin in general.<p>It is also important to note that most of the ML research in the field is pretty much language agnostic and is concerned with general concept such as efficient en-&#x2F;decoding [1], training methods [2], and even stealing pre-trained weights from APIs (like GPT-2 or even 3) without paying for training [3] :)<p>It&#x27;s just easier to get your hands on and verify English corpora, results and pre-trained models for reproducibility than say Mongolian or Gaelic so that&#x27;s a factor, too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1904.09751.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1904.09751.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2003.10555.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2003.10555.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1910.12366.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1910.12366.pdf</a>')
