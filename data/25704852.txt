It&#x27;s based on Django and works with Docker&#x2F;Podman. I originally made it for my own AUR packages (&gt; 300), I needed accessible build logs if I want to collab, which the common builders didn&#x27;t provide. I made the project public and it&#x27;s crazy for me as an open source beginner to see how many people like this. The basic features are complete, but things like multiarch are getting added soon.')
