But a nicely structured datadump is not particularly valuable if it&#x27;s just one person. So you need to hunt down all other instances of XYZ and aggregate all data to get something someone would like to pay for. But this aggregation is stale and when xyz is patched and months have passed you just have gigs of data that has gone bad, and just like rotten fruit that wont sell for much. So i would say, in practicality, given enough decentralization, and a lot of competing platforms, the hypothetical bad actor in this scenario is much worse off than the non-hypothetical bad actors we have running around and fucking with our data right now.
