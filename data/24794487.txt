It&#x27;s similar to the <i>nil</i> type in Lisp (which also has no values), except that it doesn&#x27;t form the bottom of a type spindle in terms of inheritance: whereas <i>nil</i> is the subtype of every other type including itself, <i>void</i> is no such thing.<p>The claim that void is a type which holds one element is like saying it&#x27;s the <i>null</i> type&#x2F;class of Common Lisp (which has one element, the object <i>nil</i>). That&#x27;s a different beast.<p>&gt; <i>The C standard, of course, may disagree, and claim that there is no value of type &quot;void&quot;</i><p>Since there is actually such an abstract concept (a type with an empty set of values), the C definition holds water.<p>I just added Common Lisp to the Wikipedia page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unit_type" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unit_type</a>  That kind of wrecks some of its claims.')
