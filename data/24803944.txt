(as in urban dictionary)<p>with the latter a dictionary is a tool to help you better understand word&#x2F;uses that can be unclear, with the former a dictionary provides justification for your choices of wording (the dictionary defines this word so and so, therefore my usage was correct).<p>In my opinion dictionaries are trying to be 2) but people use them as 1). It is how we get definition of &quot;Literally: not literally, figuratively&quot;; &quot;literally&quot; does not mean &quot;not literally&quot; it is simply used very often like that for emphasis.')
