Like is missing a year of 4th grade going to be a problem for anyone? I barely remember school up until 11th grade at this point. Generations? Why is he saying that?<p>A year off probably won&#x27;t have much impact on children with families with the capability to care for and educate them at home. This is not the case for all demographics. For some students, a year off school literally means nutritional insecurity during a time when brains are developing and the only stable environment they have is gone.<p>My friend is a first grade teacher and has about 5 students who are homeless. It shouldn&#x27;t be a shock that they are not attending class via zoom.')
