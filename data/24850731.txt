So instead devs have to remember to close the bug which they usually do immediately after responding, which comes off as abrupt, even though it&#x27;s not meant that way.<p>- User reports bug, dev responds with request for more info (&quot;I can&#x27;t duplicate; could you provide a better test case?&quot;), user never responds.<p>In both cases it&#x27;s OK to time out these old reports (which are essentially clutter).  You could provide a way for the dev to flag this as one not to be auto-cleaned up.<p>Another improvement, while I&#x27;m at it: provide a Godbolt-like way to submit a test case that can be outrun (i.e. a CI case).  Then the bug could be auto-closed if it&#x27;s in the current release but already fixed in the dev sources.  Not all bugs or applications could take advantage of this of course.')
