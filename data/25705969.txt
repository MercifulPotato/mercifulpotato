(i believe that careful people lived long lives pre-industry.)<p>some of these conditions are regular exercise, occasional starvation, following environmental queues, supporting a healthy biome, and avoiding stress.<p>our approaches to health today are comical in their attempt to simplify and reduce a billion-year-old continuously-evolving system down to one or two simple concepts while ignoring all the harm we do to it at the same time.<p>to use a car analogy, it&#x27;s sort of like throwing away your automobile&#x27;s maintenance manual and saying, &quot;i heard the key to car longevity is changing the oil often&quot;, and filling up the engine with olive oil.')
