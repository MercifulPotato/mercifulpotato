It&#x27;s a red flag if a manager is primarily hiring people from his&#x2F;her ethic group. And yes, if you end up being the only white person in the group you definitely can end up being the odd person out (and I wouldn&#x27;t exempt Chinese from this as you have). It&#x27;s uncomfortable, but you can see this as a cultural learning experience - the opportunity to see how it feels to be a minority. It&#x27;s not often that we white people experience this in the US.')
