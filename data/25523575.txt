No duplication.<p>Yes but this is only in the happy case when the client is fully enhanced no?<p>What happens if you hook up a phx click event to increment a like counter.<p>After the page is loaded, if you click the + to increment it while having JavaScript disabled it&#x27;s not going to do anything right?<p>But with Hotwire Turbo, if you have a degraded client with no JS, clicking the + would result in a full page reload and the increment would still happen. That&#x27;s progressive enhancement. It works because it&#x27;s a regular link and if no JS intercepts it, it continues through as a normal HTTP request.')
