CGNAT doesn&#x27;t have any problem using the same source ip:port for connections to different destination ip:port, because there&#x27;s no reason not to.<p>I agree though, that most OS stacks are very conservative about using the same source ip:port for connections to anything else. It works ok until you need to make lots of connections, then you have to manage ports in userspace.')
