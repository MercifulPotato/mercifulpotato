Aquaculture works and reasonably well for a few decades. Here&#x27;s what we know now.<p>1. Aquaculture works\n2. It&#x27;s successful with only a handful of species\n3. It can&#x27;t replace marine caught wildlife\n4. Flavor-wise it is frequently inferior.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t grow salmon, tipalia, shripm or oysters, we just shouldn&#x27;t make a claim or claims that aren&#x27;t reasonable (i.e. aquaculture can feed the world or aquaculture will revolutionize modern food production).<p>Vertical farming is great for greens, microgreens, strawberries, herbs and that&#x27;s about it.')
