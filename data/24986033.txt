It&#x27;s taken such an <i>ahem</i> incredible journey from such an innovation hotbed (Fairchild Semi&#x2F;Xerox PARC&#x2F;Bell Labs) to companies that extract money from eyeballs.<p>That is not to say &quot;real&quot; innovation is not taking place, but I get the sense it&#x27;s just optimization and refinement of internal processes. Maybe VR or high(er) speed networking, but with all the recent IP lawsuits (a copyright on <i>API</i>s?!) it seems to me that the collaborative spirit of truly new discovery is gone. To use the cliche, I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that we&#x27;ve discovered everything already.<p>But what do I know; it all happened before I was even born. I&#x27;m just amazed every time I read about all the discovery and experimentation that named it Silicon Valley in the first place.')
