Item(by='username90', descendants=None, kids=[24730443], score=None, time=1602209125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725316, text='&gt; Extracurriculars are supposed to show that the student is well-rounded and driven - attributes that have been shown to be positively correlated with success in college and careers.<p>If extracurriculars are so important then why doesn&#x27;t colleges require them to graduate? Why is their admission criteria so different from their graduation criteria? They ought to look similar.<p>If grades are enough to graduate they obviously don&#x27;t value other things and therefore should just look at grades of incoming students. If however grades aren&#x27;t enough to say that a person is a good individual then why do they choose to graduate unbalanced people who only got good grades but suck at extracurriculars? Don&#x27;t they care about their output at all?')
