Each of these customers is likely to compare it against running their own Asterisk in a cloud for $100&#x2F;mo and headaches. It is a horrible pool of clients to have because members of this pool think $1.5k&#x2F;mo for what supposedly is a critical service for a company ( voice + text ) to interact with its &quot;old school&quot; clients is too much money and every two days they are looking at integrating with voip.ms so they can build dropbox using FTP.')
