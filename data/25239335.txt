There&#x27;s the other side of the \nbalance&quot; - the factors outside of one control define the ceiling limit of your delta change [0]. Of course, you can ask people to focus on the controllable and ignore the things one can not control. However, the fact that the family&#x2F;country&#x2F;skin color you are born determines pretty much most of your fate is not easily accepted by everyone.
