For individuals and SMBs this was the spreadsheet, for larger organizations this was a centralized database with remote access. But after that I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve seen a material improvement. Dumb terminals in the 80&#x27;s gave just as much value to access data as their Windows GUI successors and then web&#x2F;mobile. So aside from the spreadsheet I&#x27;d agree with the premise of this post, we&#x27;re still not seeing a true computer revolution. It&#x27;s mostly the same stuff with different interfaces.')
