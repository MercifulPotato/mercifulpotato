Item(by='est31', descendants=None, kids=[25331431], score=None, time=1607340269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329840, text='Indeed you can still bribe the captain for throwing someone else&#x27;s cargo out, but that wouldn&#x27;t bring you any benefits, except of some hassle. In the event of cargo being thrown out, you will have to pay your part of the loss, regardless of if it was your crate that was thrown out or someone else&#x27;s. If it was your crate, you will get its value replaced (minus your part of the lost value ofc). As there is no damage, why would you want to bribe them?')
