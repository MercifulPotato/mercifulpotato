Get yourself a copy of Leith&#x27;s How to Cook.

Have a look at the Amazon &#x27;look inside&#x27; to see how to cut onions, carrots and asparagus<p>* When cutting things like carrots, are you cutting one carrot or multiple? (the next point is important for this)<p>* Are your knives sharp? There should be almost no effort cutting through a carrot, for example.<p>Background to Leiths:<p>* They&#x27;re a real cooking school that teaches professional chefs assuming very little knowledge<p>* It was set up by Prue Leith and Caroline Waldegrave. Prue Leith is one of the judges on the Great British Bakeoff.<p>* Leiths is well known in London for both their professional courses and for amateur ones too (e.g. a day to de-bone a chicken)')
