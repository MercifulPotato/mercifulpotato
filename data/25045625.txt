Meaning the starting point is writing code not deployment. We bake in a Go framework to write backend services. Then micro builds in everything you need. Abstracting away k8s. Everything you need is an importable package. Everything also works out of the box on your local machine using &quot;micro server&quot;. No k8s necessary. The majority of the focus for us now is m3o.com. A hosted platform. Otherwise I think k8s is the wrong abstraction for devs. We need access to underlying primitives but also need a workflow thats driven around writing services not operating them.')
