If your company goes under, you lose 100% of your income all at once. From that perspective, it&#x27;d be a lot more rational to work say ten jobs at a single time.<p>You&#x27;re never at serious risk of losing more than 30% of your paycheck in any short period. You could even get smart and balance your portfolio of jobs between pro and counter-cyclical industries. Plus, it&#x27;s a good way to let people gracefully transition between careers.

Take a low-paying junior ML internship for one of your 1&#x2F;10 jobs to build experience.<p>It&#x27;d also be good from a societal perspective, since jobs at small, fast-growing, but high-risk companies would become comparatively more attractive. It&#x27;d be harder to sustain toxic workplace environments, since any given employee would have plenty of other options.
