I&#x27;ve had enough that I&#x27;ve lost count.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think a leet code question would necessarily have screened stuff like that out at all.<p>I&#x27;m sure I have too, but I never advocated for <i></i><i>only</i><i></i> whiteboard interviewing. There should be a spread covering all sorts of aspects of their abilities.<p>&gt; Did you actually talk with these references about what it was like to work with him?<p>Of course. I have a wide variety of coworkers with a wide variety of opinions of my skill-set. I&#x27;d select the ones that I think would resonate best with you. Barring that I have half a dozen friends that would tell you whatever I want them to. I fail to see how references are any sort of magic bullet.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s $200k a year. I find it pretty hard to believe that he was serious.<p>I was another senior engineer on the project, so I definitely could have covered the work. I had deeper experience, and given his quality I could have churned things out more quickly. I suspect he wasn&#x27;t offering me $100 &#x2F; hour at 40 hours per week. The job had a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy involved. I suspect if I was just doing the coding parts I could have covered it at about 10 hours per week, which is a lot more feasible.<p>Obviously I turned this down for ethical reasons.')
