Item(by='minimaul', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605982550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164720, text='I do a pool called backup with two raidz vdevs - 7x3T in one raidz vdev, and 9x4T in one raidz vdev. Data is striped on each of the two raidz and I lose one 3T and one 4T&#x27;s worth of capacity. This allows me to lose any one drive at a given time without data loss, and up to two drives (as long as they come out of separate vdevs).<p>As far as I could work out from the btrfs documentation, this isn&#x27;t currently possible? Plus, RAID5&#x2F;6 in btrfs is still of questionable stability?')
