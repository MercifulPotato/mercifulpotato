Many GPUs require that to initialize and as far as I know no ARM cpus support it since it&#x27;s a legacy-ish x86 thing.  It&#x27;ll be the same problem that prevents gpu use on raspberry pi 4s still.  I bet you can make a controller that&#x27;ll provide a mapping for that to allow it but that&#x27;ll mean needing a new enclosure (probably not a huge deal) and new silicon and drivers.')
