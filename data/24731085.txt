Up front I’m much more willing to trust a brand like Herman Miller to produce a chair that’s actually functional and ergonomic so that’s a plus. The interesting thing to me is really that they have a regular version and a gamer version and they appear to be really be the same with some minor tweaks (added foam in the seat and different material to help with cooling) and then a bit more flamboyant styling. I will say they actually did a good job with the styling. The original design is pretty subdued and the blue while somewhat aggressive isn’t too over the top and is only really noticeable from the back. I guess then my take is it seems like a reprint with a “For Gamers” sticker slapped on it to try and break into the gamer market. Personally I’d probably buy the plain black one if I was going to buy one but I’d be interested to see a side-by-side comparison from someone to see if those minor tweaks are actually worth it.')
