It has the unique feature that all the code sorta looks the same style, across users. So the readability remains high during maintenance. I donâ€™t think it is the best at building rest or graphql APIs, or for highly complex data centric systems. For that I would reach for a language with better generic programming support and many libraries available - like TypeScript.')
