And yes, I did read that part, and it is true, but I think it was getting at something slightly different.<p><i>&quot;What are you not saying because you&#x27;re scared I&#x27;ll blame you if it fails&quot;</i> implies that the advice-giver has a certain mental model that didn&#x27;t quite resonate with me.<p>Mostly I try to avoid hurting people who ask me for advice. A) because I care about them, and B) because very often the &quot;right&quot; answer could reduce their will-to-action in a completely counter-productive way.<p>(As a hypothetical relevant to HN -- 9 times out of 10, the &quot;correct&quot; advice to give your friend on their startup&#x2F;product is to deliver a completely filter-free structured rant about all the ways their startup&#x2F;product is complete and utter dogshit. &quot;Correct&quot; in the sense that their startup&#x2F;product will be bad and need iteration, but also in the sense that founders&#x2F;creators almost always have a Parent-Child-esque emotional connection to their creation, and without some external emotive-&quot;knock&quot; they will often rationalize away the need to make changes.<p>But of course that is incredibly poor form as a friend, which is your foremost relationship with this person, and not as a product-reviewer! And so you&#x27;ll tend to give some nice comments and then some highly-couched &quot;constructive&quot; critique that signals you know they want some negative feedback, but don&#x27;t trust them to handle it -- and as a result they won&#x27;t really know where their product stands, and nothing improves.<p>As a prospective advice-seeker, you really can&#x27;t over-signal your commitment to getting the other person&#x27;s raw &amp; emotional thoughts. &quot;Swear&quot; words tend to be one good way to signal this sort of thing in the English-speaking professional environment, but ultimately humans evolved to be master-tier readers of their friends&#x27; inner emotional state and if you feel a tightening in your gut when you get harsh advice, the advice-giver <i>knows</i> you feel it)')
