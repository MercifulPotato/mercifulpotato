Definitely interested in hearing others&#x27; thoughts on the name as well.<p>Here was my thinking: As a solo, bootstrapped founder, I think people are interested in the person behind the product, at least at first.<p>I&#x27;ve been using my personal story and the process of building in public to grow an email list and waitlist.
