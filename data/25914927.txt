(sometimes that expert might be you yourself - it still remains true).<p>In the same time, factory drones can produce hundreds of the same gadget.<p>Naturally, the time of the expert is much more expensive than simply buying a new gadget.<p>This &quot;right to repair&quot; is romanticized nonsense, like the idea of everybody growing their own food.<p>Not that I don&#x27;t like the idea of being able to repair my own things. I even think one should try occasionally, just so that one doesn&#x27;t become totally stupid.<p>But to claim it is somehow a common good and betterment of society is nonsense. The opposite is true. Devices will now become more expensive for everybody, because companies have to jump through hoops to make them repairable, even though hardly anybody will actually repair them.<p>If you want to tinker, or grow your own food, get a Raspberry Pi or a little tomato plant for your balcony<p>Also, if you are worried about the environment, perhaps recycling laws make more sense, or more specifically, producers being responsible for the proper disposal of their devices. Would have to consider the upsides and downsides, though.')
