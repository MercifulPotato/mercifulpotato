Which is fairly common, they are each the odd one out on some searches.  Though I think google’s personalized search results make it seem very different to some people.<p>Pick something really odd like “Purple car teacup” and google seems to give really bad results.  3 links to amazon, 2 to Pinterest, and 2 to EBay.  They all link to thepurpleteacup.com, but only google has a Yoycart link, it also wants to replace car with cat.  I think Bing started off with the best image search and ddg the worst, though bing wanted to ignore teacup for the bottom half of it’s results.')
