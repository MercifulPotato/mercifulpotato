There should be a possibility to verify at every single level, even if it might require special tools. Independent verification is the key to trust. But users can also choose to stop at any point if they so wish.<p>&gt; - Software that makes the Clock app tick and the Weather app give weather information has no business in the Right to Verification.<p>Actually, such software should be verifiable and open, too, because otherwise it will have too much power over user, just like any software. It’s basically what Stallman says, and every time users start to use proprietary software in any form, it starts to do things against their will. Power corrupts.<p>&gt; with everything opensource, the world would be worse off. Innovation would cease. Free low-quality stuff everywhere<p>I do not see how you came to this conclusion. A lot of free software is of higher quality than the proprietary alternatives. Care to elaborate? You are also using word ‘free’ as if it’s about price. Free software is not gratis.<p>&gt; but when it comes to technology and abstract concepts - it would be a total chaos if every user had to keep their own key safe.<p>I fully agree here. The solution however is not to choose an almighty emperor that has infinite power over you, but to allow users to choose whom they trust and change their mind. I trust Purism with my hardware and software, but I also have the power to change my mind and pay someone else to develop my software, since it’s FLOSS.')
