It makes very little sense.<p>Actually it makes a lot of sense. Your boss sends you a Zoom link and asks you to install Zoom. Or you&#x27;re having a meeting with the CEO of some company and they send you a Zoom link, saying it&#x27;s the only thing their company uses. Or you are a high school student learning online and your teacher only delivers lectures on Zoom. Most people listen to their bosses and superiors instead of protesting their viewpoints about security.<p>Only privileged people can protest. Others just lose their jobs, or don&#x27;t get their high school diploma.<p>No, it&#x27;s not right, but it is the reality.')
