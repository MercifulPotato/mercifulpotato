Power\n    spent in off-chip buses can be a significant portion of the overall power\n    budget. As an example, the core power consumption of Intel Celeron at\n    266MHz is 16W, while its off-chip bus (for a standard configuration)\n    operating at 133 MHz consumes 3.3W [12, 13]. The contribution of off-chip\n    bus power consumption to the overall power budget increases even more for\n    embedded systems with low-power processor cores and memories, making\n    off-chip  buses  a  potential  candidate  for  power  optimization. Figure\n    1 shows the power consumption due to off-chip data bus for several embedded\n    benchmark codes as a percentage of the overall power consumption (which\n    includes processor data path, caches, buses, TLB, register file,\n    instruction issue logic, clock, and off-chip memory) for an\n    embedded processor.  From this figure, we see that the off-chip data bus\n    consumes between 9.8% and 23.2% of the total power consumed by the system\n    depending on the benchmark being run. So, reducing the power consumption\n    of the off-chip data bus would reduce the overall power consumption of\n    the system to a considerable extent</code></pre>')
