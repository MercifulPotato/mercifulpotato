I have yet to see a single detailed explanation that actually touches on all the intricacies involved: from blog posts to documentaries, they all are incomplete at best or wrong at worst.<p>So of course, the proposed solutions are necessarily incomplete, as they&#x27;re not working from a comprehensive understanding of the problem. I don&#x27;t know how to solve this. The problem isn&#x27;t recent, it&#x27;s at least decades old, if not centuries. As far as I can tell, it boils down to a lack of effort to reconcile the experiences of disparate groups, and the need to contextualize their ideologies within those experiences. This fundamentally means that one person&#x27;s facts can be another person&#x27;s fiction, and the line between the two should be tread carefully. For a long time, this problem was sidestepped entirely, as groups simply avoided one another or had minimal contact.The problem was exacerbated in the modern world, and has been brought to its most extreme conclusion through the internet.<p>Institutional authority today speaks with too much unearned certainty. Those who share that certainty will be appeased, and those who do not will be incensed.<p>I do not know how to solve this problem. Neither does anyone else, though. That includes the author of this article, who doesn&#x27;t even understand the problem in the first place.<p>If there is one takeaway, however, that I would like people to have, it is this: just because someone disagrees with you, or refuses to acknowledge facts of which you are certain, does not mean they are stupid. It is entirely possible it is you who are missing something.<p>Be uncertain.')
