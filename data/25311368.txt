I see this position of calling what she did &quot;exhorting them to stop working&quot; often, but this isn&#x27;t really what she did.<p>I too care about DEI, but after putting lots of time and effort into it I saw how futile the effort was in my organization because there was real buy-in from higher ups. I was putting a lot of unrewarded volunteer work helping with &quot;inclusivity&quot; and talking about the problems&#x2F;solutions, but that was all it was in the end for the people we needed action from; &quot;talk&quot;. I did decide eventually to dial it back and stick to my actual paid job of programming, and although I didn&#x27;t send an email to other people telling them their effort was being wasted, if someone came and asked me, I&#x27;d tell them to not bother. There&#x27;s other places, usually further removed from the the company and easily PR-able channels, where the effort is better spent.<p>In any case, I hope you realize your comment is full of hyperbole and the people who think she isn&#x27;t in the wrong, myself included, aren&#x27;t being unreasonable. We&#x27;re smart people too.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no way that Google (or any company) would continue to employ her after that<p>I agree. None of this comes as a surprise and I&#x27;m sure she expected it too; that doesn&#x27;t mean Google is in the moral high ground.')
