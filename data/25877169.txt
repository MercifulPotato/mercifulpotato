Teachers typically have a bunch of resources that they want to use for the class they&#x27;re teaching, and sometimes their link is going to be in printed material that the student will have to type in. This seems like a nice solution to that problem.<p>Currently I use bit.ly for this, but it means generating lots of links.  What is helpful on bit.ly is the bookmarklet.  Being able to add a link to a bundle from a bookmarklet would be quite nice if you haven&#x27;t done it already.')
