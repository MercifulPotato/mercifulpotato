(Google Cloud SQL&#x27;s HA setup is extremely similar.)  But you still get 1-2 minutes of full unavailability when hardware fails.<p>I haven&#x27;t operated etcd in production myself, but I assume it does better because it&#x27;s designed specifically for HA.  You can&#x27;t even run less than three nodes.  (The etcd docs talk about election timeouts on the order of 1s, which is encouraging.)<p>For many use cases, 1-2 minutes of downtime is tolerable.  But I can imagine situations where availability is paramount and you&#x27;re willing to give up scale&#x2F;performance&#x2F;features to gain another 9.')
