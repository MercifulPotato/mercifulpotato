I bought a refurb Galaxy S5 back in 2015, and have been using it since.<p>Today, when shopping for devices at a comparable price, their specs are usually worse than S5, a phone that&#x27;s 6 years old at this point.<p>Many of the new budget phones today come with 2GB RAM (Laughable), and a less than 1080p screen (Usually some weird resolution like 1520x720?). For me to get the same performance&#x2F;screen quality as the S5, I would now have to spend around $400-500, not $225 like I did 5 years ago. Mid range now seems to mean $500-700 phones, an amount that wouldn&#x27;t be out of place for a desktop PC, and way more than I&#x27;m willing to spend on a phone.<p>What was it about tech getting cheaper again? Doesn&#x27;t hold in my experience.')
