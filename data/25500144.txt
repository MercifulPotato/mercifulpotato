If so, hard to tell if you are responding to me specifically, or some &quot;HN crowd&quot; generally; in either case, yes, feminists have to prove themselves, or specifically their ideology. And no, I haven&#x27;t said anything about &quot;useful by default&quot;, that&#x27;s <i>your</i> strawman.<p>I think you&#x27;re being sarcastic, in which case your whole post is just a bad-faith, low-effort dismissal. It&#x27;d be useful if you&#x27;d respond less cryptically.')
