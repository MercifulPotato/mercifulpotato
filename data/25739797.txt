Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=[25740495, 25740168, 25740182, 25740251], score=None, time=1610408298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739061, text='Neutrons are countable with integers.<p>Waves -- even in classical mechanics -- are not &quot;countable&quot;, and are best represented in physical models with a continuum, such as field of real numbers.<p>They&#x27;re fundamentally different. Quantum Mechanics glosses over this difference because when it was developed, this was too hard to deal with.<p>A lot of people who briefly studied QM at an undergraduate level assume that it &quot;keeps going&quot; and is applicable to all small-scale processes. In reality, it is not applicable to a wide range of phenomena, including explaining why particles come in countable units.<p>Similarly, the &quot;infinite size&quot; of electron clouds or the probability distributions of particles such as neutrons are a <i>mathematical shortcut</i> that was explicitly called out as such in the first QM papers. After a century, people just forgot and assumed that QM has a direct correspondence to reality, when it is a simplified abstraction designed to be analytically tractable.<p>Lastly, many people think that QM predicts that EM waves come in &quot;countable&quot; units called photons. This isn&#x27;t true <i>in general</i>, and again, was called out as a simplification for the treatment of the emission and absorption of EM waves by <i>atomic matter specifically</i>. Atoms have electron orbitals that can take on only specific values, hence they can only absorb or emit EM waves with specific values. This is not a property shared with free particles or other fields that interact electromagnetically.<p>QM pedagogy needs to be rethought from the ground up, because nobody seems to be learning QM, but instead they&#x27;re internalising a limited model they don&#x27;t actually understand.')
