Donald Trump refused to deploy National Guard and Pence had to do it even though Pence did not have the authority. You can&#x27;t blame the tail of snake of the venom in its head.<p>There is plenty of evidence that the GREAT LEADER tried to overturn elections. If the Congress fails to impeach him it would imply the Congress is not a strong and relevant institution anymore and what the GREAT LEADER failed at someone else would succeed in future. Also, no point blaming FBI here as they were merely pen pushers, their bosses and Congress from which derive legitimacy are far more incompetent and responsible for this mess.<p>Cato Institute (Libertarian&#x2F;Conservative think tank) analyst David Bier has a timeline here. The Great Leader Supreme had called for this rally in early December and had since used violent language asking folks to move to DC on December 6th.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;David_J_Bier&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351552702032056328?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;David_J_Bier&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351552702032056328?...</a><p>Here are some quotable quotes.<p>&gt; 12&#x2F;19: Trump announces the Jan. 6th event by tweeting, “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” Immediately, insurrectionists begin to discuss the “Wild Protest.”  Just 2 days later, this UK political analyst predicts the violence<p>&gt; On Dec. 29, the FBI sends out a nationwide bulletin warning legislatures about attacks<p>&gt; 1&#x2F;1: Trump tweets the time of his protest. Then he retweets “The calvary is coming” on Jan. 6!” Sounds like a war?  About this time, the FBI  begins visiting right wing extremists to tell them not to go--does the FBI tell the president?<p>&gt;1&#x2F;5: Trump tweets at various law enforcement, intelligence, and military agencies that he supposedly oversees about the threat from “Antifa.” At the same time, a VA FBI Office warns of a “war” at the Capitol from the far right starting the next day.<p>&gt; 1&#x2F;6, 12:00-12:17pm: Trump begins his speech. At 12:17, he says that he will march with the rioters to the Capitol to demand the election be overturned.<p>&gt; &quot;After this, we’re going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We’re going to walk down. We’re going to walk down any one you want, but I think right here. We’re going walk down to the Capitol&quot; - Donald J. Trump - Jan 6 2021<p>&gt; &quot;We are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and we&#x27;re going to the Capitol and we&#x27;re going to try and give weak Republicans the pride and boldness that they need to take back our country... So let&#x27;s walk down Pennsylvania Ave&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ipTSkxiToDE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ipTSkxiToDE</a>')
