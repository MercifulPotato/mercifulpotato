It&#x27;s an edge case, and many of those laws are there to protect workers anyway.<p>Frequently the issue isn&#x27;t so much that compliance is extraordinary difficult, it is that there is no section in the HR manual for handling it, and they don&#x27;t want to deal with it. Most of the time it would take two days of labor at most, and a small percentage of the employee salary to make it kosher. In Canada it is so common that there is an entire industry that will arrange legal employment of Canadians by foreign corporations with no local presence. Most US companies don&#x27;t even want to hear about how easy it is to comply.')
