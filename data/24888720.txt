DDG does have a DuckDuckBot crawler &amp; obviously lots of staff &amp; expertise in the area (Apple more acqui-hires than anything else). I don&#x27;t know of a more appropriate Search company they could acquire to give them a headstart given Bing isn&#x27;t for sale &amp; MSFT is non acquirable.<p>If Google did decide to drop the payment they&#x27;d most definitely turn &amp; collect placement checks from Bing as their first recourse, but if they wanted to build their own search technology they wouldn&#x27;t be sourcing their results from Bing, they&#x27;d want to make sure they&#x27;re masters of their own fate and own (or license) the technology &amp; expertise themselves like they&#x27;re doing with Apple Maps.<p>But I don&#x27;t see any of this happening, the placement payments benefits both Companies.')
