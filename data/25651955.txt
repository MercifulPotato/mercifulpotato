For example, it is illegal for a small grocery store to exist within a mile of my house. It is also illegal to build housing close to where jobs have been located. The design of cities has been centrally planned to manufacture car dependence, and exclude the possibility of biking or walking. It also eliminates the possibility of shared transit from private companies from being profitable.  A century ago, light rail companies built entire little suburbs that allowed people to get to jobs without cars. That&#x27;s not possible anymore because of legal structures that ban planning that is compatible with that lifestyle.<p>There is huge unmet demand for this, which is why cities are so much more expensive than far-based lifestyles these days.')
