If you&#x27;re 18 and older you can decline any medical treatment if you&#x27;re competent to do so. If you&#x27;re 16 or 17 you cannot decline life-saving medical treatment, the courts will decide.<p>If you&#x27;re under 16 your healthcare team will test to see if you&#x27;re Gillick Competent. If you are Gillick Competent you can consent to any medical treatment. Doctors will always try to get the parents involved, and will always try to get agreement of the parents, but sometimes that&#x27;s not possible and in those cases they can use the child&#x27;s consent.<p>However, for treatment with puberty blockers there was a different protocol: the child, and the parents, and two different healthcare teams had to all agree that PBs were the right thing and that the child had capacity to make this choice.<p>This court case is saying that this is not sufficient, and that even if the parents and children and treatment teams all agree the courts still need to rule.')
