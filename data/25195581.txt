The logical response is to use multiple layers of network security provided by different vendors and hardware&#x2F;software stacks so that there is no single point of trust and you mitigate the impact of a breach. That way you don&#x27;t need to struggle with the heavy burden of maintaining  illogical beliefs such as mystical associations of &#x27;western&#x27; supply chains being &#x27;clean&#x27;, whereas &#x27;backdoors&#x27; are being actively created by &#x27;bad actors&#x27; affiliated with &#x27;the other&#x27; motivated by &#x27;reasons&#x27; against your specific person because &#x27;nothing better to do&#x27; despite &#x27;vast scope&#x27; and &#x27;international supply chain conspiracy&#x27;.
