Caching at the browser across sites is not that important, it caching at a point of presence (POP). This POP being so much closer to your end users brings performance gains because TCP is terrible over distances. QUIC may fix this by it&#x27;s shift to UDP. I haven&#x27;t seen a benchmark yet.<p>Security is a concern, use SRI.<p>Reliability can be mitigated with fail over logic to a backup.<p>The part missed is bandwidth. Using a CDN means your web server doesn&#x27;t have to serve out static files that you are paying per a GB to serve. Small sites it&#x27;s not much but it does add up. It&#x27;s a Content Delivery Network not a Cache Delivery Network.')
