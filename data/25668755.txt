I&#x27;m not sure if the deplatforming push is good or not but I see moves like this only accelerating it, which is going to lead to a deepening &quot;red internet &#x2F; blue internet&quot; schism that&#x27;s probably not good for either side. It&#x27;s obvious that the left feels that they can keep shutting down right-wing media by various sorts of economic pressure and legislation, but I think we&#x27;re seeing this strategy start to hit sharply diminishing returns but at this point the echo chambers have been so strongly reinforced that it&#x27;s hard to imagine any other strategy getting support.')
