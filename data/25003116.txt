Why don&#x27;t we know?<p>And I also don&#x27;t really understand how mail can arrive later. In my state of Oregon which has mail-in only voting, ballots must arrive by 8PM on election day. That&#x27;s it. Why do other states allow it to go past that? This is crazy. It&#x27;s election day, not week.')
