Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25072149], score=None, time=1605201313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059780, text='I hear their sense of abandonment, and I want to reach out to them: stop voting for ignorant incompetents.<p>It&#x27;s not just the top spot, but all up and down the ticket, those voters repeatedly choose morons. The last four years they&#x27;ve had overwhelming control, and their chosen leaders have done absolutely nothing for them -- except deliver a steady stream of insults, which seems to be all they really want. Their message is clear: given the opportunity, rather than help themselves, what they desire more is to stick it to those urban populations they hate so much.<p>Every election we go through this hand-wringing cycle of trying to listen harder to them. It&#x27;s time to turn it around: how about you flyover chuckfucks listen to me for a change? Not the psychotic delusions of me being handed to them by the single solitary news stream they watch (the only one, they&#x27;re told, that isn&#x27;t lying to them), but the things I actually say and think.<p>Maybe then I&#x27;ll stop referring to them as flyover chucklefucks. But thus far, they&#x27;ve spent so much time convincing themselves that I despise them that they&#x27;ve made themselves right.')
