If you reason at least somewhat in a Bayesian way, and you&#x27;re exposed to a repeated stream of the same lie, then if you update your priors <i>at all</i> with each exposure, you will eventually regard the lie as being probably true.  And the main point of propaganda is to repeat the lie as often and in as many places as possible.<p>But it isn&#x27;t inevitable that people update their priors.  Many people don&#x27;t when exposed to advertising, for example.  If we recognize propaganda, then maybe we can do the same.<p>The problem with that is what throwaway894345 is talking about, that people decide that you&#x27;re propaganda and won&#x27;t listen, even if <i>they</i> are the ones who have believed the propaganda lie.')
