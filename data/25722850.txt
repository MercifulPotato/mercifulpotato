All the GUI stuff worked without me having to fiddle around in the terminal like a &quot;hacker&quot;, the UX was generally high-quality, and the default theming was pretty and consistent.<p>My overall impression was that it was definitely and surprisingly usable for non-technical people like my mom, grandma, etc. who don&#x27;t use their computer for anything sophisticated but also don&#x27;t have the time&#x2F;energy&#x2F;wherewithal to debug and configure things.<p>I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about the Mint Cinnamon experience, and I recommend that everyone involved in the &quot;Desktop Linux&quot; world try it (at least in a VM) so they can get a sense of what &quot;good defaults&quot; actually look and feel like.')
