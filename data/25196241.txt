Not just articles like these and videos, but also interactive explorables. Even my 7yo was able to understand basic aspects of game theory and complex systems with the help of explorables made by NickyCase, MeltingAsphalt etc. Most recently, I taught myself to not just solve 4x4 Rubik&#x27;s cube but understand its connections to ideas in abstract algebra such as commutators. I feel extreme gratitude for all the people who create such enlightening material and offer it freely, without asking for a paid subscription to their Udemy course.<p>It inspired me enough that I started creating a DMOZ-style catalog of learning resources as a FOSS project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;learn-awesome&#x2F;learn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;learn-awesome&#x2F;learn</a>')
