Which is fine for stuff like finding a COVID-19 vaccine. But is a total disaster for promoting innovation.<p>I have a computer engineering degree and have watched nothing of interest happen in semiconductor manufacturing for over 20 years. Yes we have blue LEDs now. Yes we have fast video cards. But if you look at single-threaded performance per clock cycle, it&#x27;s been stuck within the same order of magnitude since the Pentium got 20 stage instruction pipelines and huge caches (which in hindsight were big blows for SIMD and MIMD).<p>It would take a paltry amount of money, in the low millions of dollars, to design real (general purpose) multicore processors that deliver orders of magnitude better performance than what we have today. But unfortunately lawmakers are for the most part technologically illiterate, and technologists are unduly skeptical of any type of programming outside the mainstream.<p>So my dream of a sub-$1000, 1000+ core CPU with a modest amount of RAM per core (between 1 MB and 1 GB) that can be programmed with existing tools like Erlang&#x2F;Go&#x2F;MATLAB&#x2F;Julia and even Docker is just never gonna happen. And without that, there is no viable road to really experiment with stuff like AI, physics simulations etc without renting time in the cloud. We have the impression that progress is being made on these endeavors today, but things look a little different to me, watching them play out at a glacial pace, at mind boggling expense, over 3-4 decades. I mourn what might have been.')
