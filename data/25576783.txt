By not having a defined policy, they can declare anything racist. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re declaring hacking videos to be racist, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re using the perceived threat of racists using the letter of the law to continue to post racist content as a way of not needing to justify their deletion of anything on any topic without explanation. If racism didn&#x27;t exist, YouTube would want to invent it to justify their policy of not having a defined content policy.')
