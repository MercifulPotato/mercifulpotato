In 1970, political consultant Roger Ailes and other Nixon aides came up with a plan to create a new TV network that would circumvent existing media and provide &quot;pro-administration&quot; coverage to millions. &quot;People are lazy,&quot; the aides explained in a memo. &quot;With television you just sit — watch — listen. The thinking is done for you.&quot; Nixon embraced the idea, saying he and his supporters needed &quot;our own news&quot; from a network that would lead &quot;a brutal, vicious attack on the opposition.&quot; Alas, his fantasy network did not come into being at that time, and the 37th president was soon engulfed in the Watergate scandal. At first, Republicans dismissed the scandal as a Washington Post &quot;witch hunt.&quot; But then the White House tapes proved beyond doubt that Nixon had used the levers of government to pursue vendettas against his opponents and cover up his extensive skulduggery. Disgusted GOP leaders, including Sen. Howard Baker of the Senate Watergate committee, chose principles over party. Nixon was forced to resign.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome&#x2F;570832&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;newt-gi...</a><p>&gt; “One of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don’t encourage you to be nasty,” he told the group. “We encourage you to be neat, obedient, and loyal, and faithful, and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around the campfire but are lousy in politics.”')
