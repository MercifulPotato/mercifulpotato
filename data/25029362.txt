I just wish I would have known I&#x27;d get into this 4k video stuff when I bought my computer. I have the newest 13&quot; MacBook Pro, and it can just <i>barely</i> render out a video like this. Lots of stuttering, crashing, etc.<p>I wonder if I should get an external GPU or if I&#x27;d be better off just buying a different computer altogether.')
