Do you include yourself in this group of people that need training wheels? Or do you think you yourself are perfectly capable of doing it right but those other deplorables are not?<p>I don&#x27;t need training wheels, and I don&#x27;t expect any adult citizen of a free country to need them either. I think the majority of people have far more common sense and desire not to hurt others than they are being given credit for. Unfortunately, the media focuses on the outliers that don&#x27;t have those qualities and makes everyone think everyone else is like that. That is doing our society a serious disservice.')
