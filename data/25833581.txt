The most worrying is that you don’t notice it.<p>It is increasingly worrying because when people are exposed to the other side, they immediately « catch fire », wonder why they have been lied to, and never trust public broadcasting anymore. With luck, they may smoothen their beliefs a bit later in life, for the most centrist ones.<p>To me, public TV, especially BBC, shouldn’t be one-sided as it is now.')
