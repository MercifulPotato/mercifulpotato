Have fun passing certification requirements for all those consoles, buying a Mac to build your iOS binaries, paying the associated developer program fees, and good luck getting your app on Tesla and the long tail of smart fridges etc<p>And this one isn&#x27;t very accurate considering you can&#x27;t run a WebGL app on any (non-jailbroken) game console. Idk about Tesla or smart fridges though.')
