Using multiple fields of bits works fine here.  60 possibilities for seconds and minutes fit very well into 6 bits each.  A raw 24-bit integer gives you plus or minus 2330 hours, and if you don&#x27;t reserve a bit the format they actually went with gives you plus or minus 2047 hours.  Since it just needs to represent 999 hours and change, that&#x27;s fine.<p>The problem is the weird <i>non-bit</i> packing they did before.<p>DOS is different, partly because there are fields that fit worse, and partly because 32 bits is just <i>barely</i> enough to store seconds in the first place.  If you did a DOS-style packing with 34 or 38 bits it would work fine.  And it would be able to represent leap seconds, making it arguably better than unix timestamps!')
