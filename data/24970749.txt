It is unknown why they are lost. Without these personal writings it is difficult to assess whether her depth of knowledge and love for physics was on a similar level.<p>* Their relatives and children claim they always sat at the table together in the evening, discussing physics and working.<p>* She gave up her authorship contribution for an engineering project before for Albert, claiming &quot;we are one, Einstein&quot;.<p>* Several references to &#x27;our work&#x27; in various letters.<p>* Three of the 1905 papers originally had the author Einstein-Marity, a typical double name women adopt after marriage. It is unknown why. (Maybe Einstein wanted her to get recognition though?)<p>* There are some differences in how mathematical notation is used in the 1905 papers, and how much detail is given for the steps.<p>* Her divorce agreement stated that she would get the Nobel prize money. The amount was pretty much making her rich back then, which is an excellent situation to be in for a struggling single mother who might want to stay in Switzerland and not go back to Serbia. Some more details here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.einstein-website.de&#x2F;z_information&#x2F;nobelprizemoney.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.einstein-website.de&#x2F;z_information&#x2F;nobelprizemone...</a><p>* Minerva did not work in physics after she got pregnant. (The article states how she couldn&#x27;t get through the academic system.) Though, Einstein, while still a productive physicist, never had an as successful year as 1905 again.<p>* She had better grades, Einstein copied her maths lecture notes, and you’ve got to say that you have to have quite a bit of endurance, intelligence and a thick skin to go from Serbia to ETH to study physics as a girl at that time. Not trying to devalue Einstein here, but it definitely took quite a bit more from her than for a boy at that time.<p>On the other hand, Einstein seemed to respect female scientists as evident in the letter to Curie, and might not have agreed to let her trade recognition for money if her contribution was real. In their honeymoon phase he also clearly saw Minerva as an equal (not so much later on, there is an awful letter by him setting rules for her as a housewife, but their marriage clearly was in pieces at that time.)<p>I’ve been following this case for a while and wish we could collect all neutral evidence (letters etc.) in original (german) form, similar to what the article already did.<p>There is a chance that the true story is that a couple that loved physics collaborated in 1905 and revolutionized the subject. I would love this conclusion.')
