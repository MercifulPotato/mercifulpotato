Isn&#x27;t that the claim - the ketamine caused those issues...<p>&quot;Instead you suggest the only plausible alternatives to forced Ketamine injection is him getting his bones broken or 9mm bullet in his body. That mindset is exactly the problem.&quot;<p>What mindset is that? What are you suggesting as an alternative once someone has started fighting, (reportedly) grabbing for a weapon, and continuing to struggle once restrained?<p>It would be great if we had video to confirm that the injection was justified in this specific case. I would have also liked to see what the actions were leading up to the encounter.')
