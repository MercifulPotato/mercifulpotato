Mostly Nerdtree and the tabs plugin for that, formatting plugins for various languages, and CtrlP. I&#x27;ve tried autocomplete a few times, but never found it worth the trouble. Might be because I mostly work in dynamic languages where autocomplete is mostly awful, and it&#x27;s easier to just remember, yank from elsewhere, or lookup function names and signatures than to get anything useful from autocomplete.<p>I don&#x27;t really like realtime linting, autoformatting, or error highlighting either. I find it highly distracting, and usually it&#x27;s complaining about something I was already going to fix anyways. I&#x27;d rather have such things done only when I intentionally trigger them. I&#x27;d say please stop whining about syntax errors and test failures in code that I haven&#x27;t finished writing yet.<p>I&#x27;ve tried some Git plugins, but never got into those either. I still prefer the gitsh cli application for most of my Git work.')
