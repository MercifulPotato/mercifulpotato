They could make a profit any time they wanted by simply not re-investing any further.<p>Tesla, SpaceX, and many other companies necessarily have to invest heavily in the early days to build out their infrastructure and capabilities. I understand completely why they might not be profitable for years and yet still be good long-term investments.<p>With Airbnb, I struggle to understand what they&#x27;re investing in. There&#x27;s no inventory. They own no real estate. That&#x27;s supposed to be the genius of the business model. And yet they keep losing hundreds of millions each year.<p>When you say they&#x27;re investing in growth, what exactly are they investing in? What am I missing? What are they doing that costs $3B a year, and how does their cost-to-revenue ratio improve as the business scales?<p>From where I&#x27;m sitting, it looks like the more business they do, the more money they lose.')
