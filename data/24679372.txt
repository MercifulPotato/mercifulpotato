My bipolar visual hallucinations typically lasted seconds to minutes, typically only happened during deep anxiety, and could be shooken off. LSD hallucinations last multiple hours, are very strong, happen in any mental state, and can&#x27;t be shooken off.<p>Bipolar psychosis is a lot weaker, feels more like religion, can last many weeks. The scariest types of psychosis are the ones that are hard to distinguish from the real world. Talking to trees while in psychosis is easy to talk yourself through. Believing someone wants to marry you is a much harder psychosis to reason through, and can result in badly damaged friendships if you don&#x27;t figure it out in time.<p>LSD psychosis is strong and warped and pretty much always dispelled easily as soon as you are in a calm frame of mind.<p>I&#x27;ve found that in the weeks following a trip, bipolar cycles are much more tame and manageable.<p>I know other bipolar individuals who also found similar relief in LSD.')
