They’re a decision by leadership and sap the company’s prospects. Certainly negotiate. Maybe it’s your only job? Maybe it’s a 50% pay boost? Ideally you can show the company a better way: keep records of incidents, make statistical measurements to set expectations and then change from the reactive to proactive stance. The idea is to make things sufficiently reliable _before_ the customer experiences the incident (not after!). However, on the margin, if you’re not being sufficiently compensated, you might need to find wiser leadership.')
