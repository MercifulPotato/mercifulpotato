XML forced even the worst programmers to at least think half a second about the existence of the whole encoding concept.<p>Some horrors from the past: receiving so-called text files generated by concatenating multiple exports. Every chunk had a different encoding, and there is no hint  when the encoding changes mid-file or what was what.  As most of it is ASCII, it seems to work and people don&#x27;t even understand what the problem is.<p>Another one:  XML-support by pasting a CSV file between the beginning and end tag.  &lt;data&gt;...CSV goes here...&lt;&#x2F;data&gt;  .  Of course, the CSV between the tags is not XML,violates escaping rules, and has no defined encoding.<p>One of the worst I ever received went like &lt;textfile&gt;&lt;byte value=&#x27;65&#x27;&gt;&lt;byte value=&#x27;66&#x27;&gt;....  &lt;&#x2F;textfile&gt;.  Now have fun converting every element to an individual byte, then finding out the encoding of the resulting text file.')
