It&#x27;s not like an Intel 4004 that just does the processing and relies on external chips for peripherals, they bake in all the typical stuff that the system it&#x27;s designed for (a cell phone) is expected to use. It contains 8 ARM cores (one of which is &quot;the CPU&quot;), a GPU, an AI DSP, a memory controller, 3 image signal processors for connection to cameras, video encoder&#x2F;decoders, Bluetooth, Wifi, NFC, GPS&#x2F;GNSS, dual SIM support, probably some general-purpose inputs and outputs, plus, yes, a 5G modem.<p>To sum up the explanations given for why it&#x27;s part of the SOC and not an external device on a bus:<p>&gt; <i>Last year’s ... external 5G modem such as the X55 helped the 5G transition as it was available to vendors earlier than the Snapdragon 865 SoC itself, allowing them to design their RF systems before having access to the newest SoC.</i><p>&gt; <i>The platform’s reabsorption of the modem into the SoC die should signify better power efficiency, lower platform cost as well as lower PCB complexity for smartphone vendors.</i>')
