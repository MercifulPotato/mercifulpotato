It has become very clear in the last many years that a non-insignificant percentage of the populace doesn&#x27;t possess the knowledge or level of rational thought to properly evaluate what they are being fed en-mass.  It&#x27;s increasingly easy to exploit some people&#x27;s herd mentality and lack of education to rise movements that can have significant impact.  I often talk to people who suddenly spout off some random conspiracy theory because they read about it 10 times on Facebook and they lack the ability to evaluate it properly. I wholly agree that I&#x27;m not a fan of censorship but likewise I don&#x27;t think private platforms have a responsibility to equally showcase what is known to be false.<p>It&#x27;s all going to be a mess no matter how you handle it... but permitting an endemic lack of education over the last  generation has brought the concept of democracy to this point.
