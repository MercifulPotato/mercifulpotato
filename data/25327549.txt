Otherwise you can&#x27;t remove in O(1) time.<p>It is straightforward to maintain a list of freed nodes which you can add back later.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind not being able to remove in O(1) time, you still have the advantage of passing the handi-capped (contiguous) linked list to interfaces that expect a linked list, but still get the cache locality of a plain vector.')
