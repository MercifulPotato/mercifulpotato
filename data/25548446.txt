I trust Apple, Roku, and even google more than smart TVs producers. They also provide support, have a demonstrated interest in providing security updates, and at least in the case of Apple don’t profit off spying on you.<p>Smart TVs have been repeatedly caught spying on people, both indirectly by reporting what you watch, and directly with microphones. They’ve been caught injecting their own ads into content that you’ve already paid for. They seldom, if ever, get any updates, and even those that do get less long term update support than generic android phones.<p>This is why people hate smart tvs')
