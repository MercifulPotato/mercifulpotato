The soft-ness of software means you always have a lot of choices about how to do things, and those things are a very deep tree. Knowing one specific solution is generally not that useful, because softness is about malleability.<p>The real skill is understanding what you&#x27;re making. What are the constraints, and of those which are hard to satisfy? Which choices are binding once committed? Everything else is fill-in-gaps, or choose a sane default: &quot;Page needs my corporate background color, can&#x27;t remember the CSS for it. I need a DB, let&#x27;s go with pg. I need to make sure passwords are done sanely, let&#x27;s double check the django docs. For some reason I keep getting an error with the page, let&#x27;s google it.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s also a skill to recognize when you have to backtrack on your choices. Maybe you missed the bit where it says &quot;don&#x27;t use this lib multithreaded&quot; and you have to find another. With some experience your backtracking won&#x27;t take you all the way back to square zero.')
