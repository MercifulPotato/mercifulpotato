But, as more people move towards free software, the governments in lust of power would like to restrict the freedom of the people in dealings with software. Also, oppressive goverments may use &#x27;&#x27;free&#x27;&#x27; software in oppression. How can we take away their &#x27;&#x27;freedom&#x27;&#x27; in such circumstances? (Can we? I don&#x27;t think that is possible.)')
