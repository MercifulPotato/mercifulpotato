Facebook Ad company should be independent from Facebook and should have access to the platform on the same terms any other ad company could have access with all respect to privacy. Currently Facebook has a conflict of interest between the social media platform and ad business. We never have seen this before and this needs to be urgently regulated. The same with Google - their ad business has to be decoupled from search and ad company shouldn&#x27;t have any access to personal data. Google search and Facebook should be forbidden by law to store personal data in a manner that does meet interest of advertising or other types of surveillance.')
