Payload is (as meant when the word &quot;payload&quot; was created) rather the goal; in case of Saturn V it was Apollo stack which needed to be launched to the Moon. Similarly, in Space Shuttle case payload is something which is in the shuttle trunk; that&#x27;s why typically a shuttle flies. Illustration for why 140 tons isn&#x27;t the payload of Saturn V is that Saturn V wasn&#x27;t able, or designed, to launch arbitrary 140 tons to LEO, and Skylab is a implicit confirmation of that.<p>The definition of payload to LEO in case of higher-than-LEO missions can include booster stage and fuel, but then we have another strange case of Shuttle with IUS - the payload could fly higher, and was rather small, yet we don&#x27;t consider Orbiter&#x27;s mass as part of LEO payload in this case. Since, as another consideration, we usually consider Saturn V as a 3-staged rocket, not a 2-staged (as flew with Skylab) with a space booster stage which is used for LEO insertion as well as for subsequent translunar injection, it would be logical not to include 3rd Saturn&#x27;s stage into LEO payload. Then Saturn V LEO payload becomes too small to be meaningful (TLI requires a lot of fuel).<p>It would be better - here - to consider Space Shuttle LEO payload to include Orbiter&#x27;s mass - that justifies large liftoff weight. As for what&#x27;s Saturn V LEO payload, this question is better be met with clarifications.')
