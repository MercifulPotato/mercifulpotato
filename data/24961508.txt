In fact, in many fields the master&#x27;s used to be considered the basic &quot;undergrad&quot; degree here. A bachelor&#x27;s degree existed, but in many fields you&#x27;d have been considered to have dropped out of completing a master&#x27;s if you only had bachelor&#x27;s. That might be slowly changing, with a higher emphasis given to bachelor&#x27;s level degrees, but the sentiment probably still remains.')
