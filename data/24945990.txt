For exmpale, they found that,<p>(1) Hue was not a good dimension for encoding magnitude information, i.e. rainbow color maps are bad.<p>(2) The mechanisms in human vision responsible for high spatial frequency information processing are luminance channels. If the data to be represented have high spatial frequency, use a colormap which has a strong luminance variation across the data range.<p>(3) For interval and ratio data, both luminance- and saturation-varying colormaps should produce the effect of having equal steps in data value correspond to equal perceptual steps, but the first will be most effective for high spatial frequency data variations and the second will be most effective for low spatial frequency variations.<p>===<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.research.ibm.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;l&#x2F;lloydt&#x2F;color&#x2F;color.HTM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.research.ibm.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;l&#x2F;lloydt&#x2F;color&#x2F;color.HTM</a><p>or as pdf:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;frankMilde&#x2F;interesting-reads&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ibm-research__why-should-engineers-and-scientists-be-worried-about-color.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;frankMilde&#x2F;interesting-reads&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;...</a>')
