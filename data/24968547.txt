It&#x27;s actually lovely for everyone. They know to turn Fox News off and keep their opinions on politics to themselves, and we&#x27;ve continued to have an active and healthy relationship even though they live much further away.<p>Standing your ground isn&#x27;t a bad option, because if your family doesn&#x27;t respect you at all, why would you want to be around them anyway?')
