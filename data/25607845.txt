You can&#x27;t excuse poor treatment of the biological needs of students simply because you have a very difficult job.<p>My comment was also not a reductive statement when I&#x27;ve been told &quot;no&quot; when I ask to go to the bathroom, or told &quot;3 people have already gone to the bathroom, you&#x27;ll have to wait until next period.&quot;<p>Both of these specific situations, and variations, happened to me. I watched a classmate pee their pants once when they were denied access to the bathroom.<p>Want to talk about job stress? Think about the stress an 8 year old goes through when every time they feel their bladder getting full they start worrying about whether they&#x27;ll be allowed to pee, or have to wait until the next class or recess&#x2F;lunch, learning nothing in the meantime and hoping they&#x27;re not the next kid that has to have their parents bring a change of clothes.<p>I don&#x27;t know what country you&#x27;re in. I&#x27;m in the US, and quality of pay varies greatly from state to state. Workload (class size) often varies with the socioeconomic status of the people in that school district. What doesn&#x27;t vary in any conversation I&#x27;ve had with people on this topic is that my experiences are very much not unique.')
