You don&#x27;t get free license to incite violence anywhere, and no one thinks that&#x27;s a good idea.  You can&#x27;t do it here on HN.  You can&#x27;t do it on Reddit.  Why should you be able to do it on Facebook?<p>Now, sure, there&#x27;s a question as to whether Trump&#x27;s posts yesterday went quite as far as you think they&#x27;d need to be considered &quot;inciting violence&quot;.  But that&#x27;s a judgement call.  You don&#x27;t want Facebook carrying a call to attack congress, you just think that&#x27;s not what Trump did.<p>But <i>if</i> there is a call for a mob to sack the seat of government and attack a joint session of congress, I think we all agree that Facebook should be allowed to censor the fuck out of that.')
