I&#x27;ve done pretty extensive work using Selenium; it&#x27;s finicky and sometimes too limited for what I need it to do, but I haven&#x27;t found serious reason to hate it. Documentation&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s exceptions are pretty easy to understand, and it does what it says on the tin without much in the way of surprises or drama. It&#x27;s usefulness has far outweighed any irritation it might have caused me.<p>Only thing I&#x27;d wish for right now is more robust handling for the frequent StaleElementExceptions that can crop up, but it&#x27;s not too much pain to work around those yourself IMO.<p>...come to think of it, why are you apologizing?<p>Edit: ...seriously, you started Selenium?')
