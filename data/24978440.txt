Do you really want to deal with the problem of distributed consensus though? If software especially <i>built</i> to deal with it often gets it wrong (as I think Jepsen tests have frequently demonstrated), what are the chances your team is going to succeed and not build a distributed monolith instead?<p>I suppose in the end it depends on if you want to trade the hard problem of managing a monolith for possibly a much harder problem.<p>I find that for these discussions, the definition of a microservice is too nebulous. Personally I think that if you have &quot;state&quot; that crosses service boundaries (ie. a fault in either service causes the loss of that aggregate state) you have instead built a distributed monolith.')
