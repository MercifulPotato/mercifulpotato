There shouldn&#x27;t be anything stopping you from using this library inside of GNURadio, however you can also get away with not using GNURadio at all given how indepth this library is. So the answer is, it can be both. It could be super useful in conjunction with GNURadio when first decoding a protocol in order to really understand the signal you&#x27;ve captured, and then you can script it in Python sans GNURadio to automate the signal interpretation.')
