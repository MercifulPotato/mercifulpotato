Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607666986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381981, text='No sidewalks, or sidewalks only on one side.  Or a paved road with a gravel shoulder. \n Or make the property owner responsible for maintaining a walkable path.<p>Different property configurations with narrower, deeper lots.  Or houses with no street frontage &#x2F; shared driveways.  (Note: there&#x27;s a safety tradeoff here with respect to fire truck access.)<p>I&#x27;d be in favor of eliminating light poles entirely in residential areas, even if they were free to install and operate.<p>I currently live in kind of a weird house; it&#x27;s in unincorporated land within an urban area.  There is no street frontage; we share our driveway with a neighbor.  No sidewalks on our side of the street, but most streets have them.  We&#x27;re one of the few houses in the area still on a septic system because connecting to the city sewer would be expensive and difficult.  Few street lights.  A sidewalk on our side would be nice, but I can live without it.  (We have a 94-year-old neighbor with an electric scooter that he built a wood&#x2F;and&#x2F;plastic enclosure for that he drives to the grocery store, so apparently lack of sidewalk isn&#x27;t a mobility issue for him at least.)')
