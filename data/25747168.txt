The were a confidentiality risk even before becoming mobile. You also have piping running through your house, which could be tapped, you don&#x27;t even need microphones, and the EM field emitted by your monitor can be read across the street. So why even care? Why should I encrypt anything, if I can&#x27;t even prove not living in an all powerful simulation?<p>Back on topic, it&#x27;s not a phones intended purpose to snitch on you, they usually do not listen into the room, without extremely malicious manipulation, and more so you simply can not realistically avoid having a phone in your reach, today. If I were talking business I would probably leave the phone outside too, for that matter, and I don&#x27;t trust cheap communication hardware, either.<p>In real life drawing analogies by principle doesn&#x27;t make for a good argument, most of the time, as life is adaptation and compromise, not a path through a logical circuit.<p>Do you honestly not see an obvious difference between a phone and an Amazon wired device intended to record and remotely analyze what&#x27;s happening in the room?')
