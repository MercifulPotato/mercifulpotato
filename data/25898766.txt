It&#x27;s not clear if the vaccine confers sterilizing immunity, i.e., you are protected against the bug and also can&#x27;t spread the disease, so most people who have children or are around children will ideally not take undue risks.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if under-16 cohorts&#x27; trials are underway already. If they are, and if children are going to be vaccinated before their next school term starts, then society as a whole may consider dropping the current precautions.')
