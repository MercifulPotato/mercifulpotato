For argument&#x27;s sake let&#x27;s assume they are. A manager affects the productivity of all of his&#x2F;her reports. Let&#x27;s say a manager has 10 reports. If the manager stops working twice as hard, maybe all of the manager&#x27;s reports would become 1&#x2F;2 as productive. That means the manager&#x27;s 2x work provides the same business utility as 5 ICs.')
