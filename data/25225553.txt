It&#x27;s quite possible for a military-industrial complex to exist and it only generates a bunch of little rich people(20-100M), since the government spreads its patronage out over a large section of the population instead of tech which concentrates wealth into single individuals. If one person is reaping most of the rewards, it&#x27;s easy to knock down the system. If a lot of people are benefiting a little bit, you&#x27;ll have far more supporters for your policies.')
