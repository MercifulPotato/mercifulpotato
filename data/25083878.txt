But software is effectively immortal, and that&#x27;s the root of this problem. We need to introduce decay into software systems, or we end up with zombies that are too useful to let die.<p>We should allow software to die. It&#x27;s okay. Whenever a generation feels like they can&#x27;t lose the artifacts of the previous generation, civilization is in decline. Which is okay too, except when technology protects those artifacts too well, which I believe usually hastens the end.')
