Countries or places with poor infrastructure<p>2. Rural areas<p>3. People using the software after many years when the server with the patch might be gone.<p>Also there is the fact many companies abuse patches to add features they shouldn&#x27;t or remove features (rootkits, DRM, or Paradox habit of removing features in a way to &quot;encourage&quot; people to buy DLC, or PS3 suddenly not supporting Linux anymore, and then there is Epic &quot;hotfix&quot;)<p>The possibility of having patches is good. The habit of patching is bad. Or course adding features and content over time is fine, but releasing software you know it is buggy intending to patch is later is not.')
