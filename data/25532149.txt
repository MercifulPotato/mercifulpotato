I didn&#x27;t realise RAID firmware wasn&#x27;t included in that (for some reason iLO firmware isn&#x27;t either, but I think that&#x27;s probably because it includes OSS). For this reason alone I&#x27;d avoid HP on principal.<p>I&#x27;m hoping one day I can find a reasonably cheap RAID card that still supports using hte BBWC in JBOD mode...')
