If you are willing to invest in some other parts of the world, 4%-5% could be the norm, for example China 10Y- bond is at 3.157% and you could probably find some relatively safe bonds with 1% above 10Y bond. But then you are going to be exposed to exchange risk and political risk. So far I don&#x27;t really see any &quot;safe&quot; option here.<p>In Canada we do see 2% - 2.5% GIC offerd by some of the banks from time to time with a bit of bonus (say $1,500 maximum), but it&#x27;s still far from 4% to 5%.')
