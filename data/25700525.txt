That said, I still consider myself a newbie at the language and have only used it for customer work one time.<p>Many years ago, I set aside learning Scala for a while, dug into Haskell (again), and for reasons that I don’t even understand myself, I then had an easier time using Scala. Same comment for Clojure (not my favorite language by far, but I have used it often professionally).<p>One thing resonated in the article “Very senior Haskellers calls for “type oriented programming” which goes like this: Write types and interfaces for the types and fill in the blanks.” I prefer just using simple types, and one thing I like about Clojure is just using the built in simple data structures.<p>In any case, I think it is very worthwhile using a wide variety of languages but I understand it when other people prefer to not spend the resources experimenting.')
