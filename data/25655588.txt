Usually noone notices stuff like that, if the chemicals are not &quot;too bad&quot; (=fish die), the worker will lose his&#x2F;her job if (s)he doesn&#x27;t do it, and the manager will get someone else to do it. If the worker reports it, it&#x27;s his word against the managers, the manager will just say it was leaked rainwater, and that they asked the worker to spill it in the gutter, so the worker has no real choice, if they want to feed the kids that night. People above the manager have no idea about that local wallmart, and that one time issue.<p>Then, the worker dumps the chemicals into the stream, the chemicals just happen to be very dangerous, and a million fish die in the river downstream. Is the CEO really the guilty on here? Did he really know?<p>On the other hand, you have the VW dieselgate, where a whole team had to work on the software, and atleast a few level of mangers had to have known about the issue. But on the corporate ladder, where every level is squeezing the level below it to &quot;do more&quot;, &quot;bring in more profits&quot;, it&#x27;s possible that some manager in charge of something actually didn&#x27;t tell the people above him, just how exactly he solved the exhaust issue, just that he solved it, and saved millions of euros (and got a huge bonus). On the other hand, coordinating a big team of coders, and such info not getting to higher ups or to members of different teams in the same company (with different managers) is probably unlikely.<p>What i&#x27;m trying to say is, that blaming the CEO by default is bad, because in the first case, it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect the CEO to even know that that local walmart exists.... and in the second case, that there should be a very thourough investigation just how high the knowledge went, and have the whole chain of comand held responsible.')
