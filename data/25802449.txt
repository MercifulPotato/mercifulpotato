They also have bought into a whole bunch of different conspiracy theories - they consider the Democrats as tyrants when it&#x27;s Trump who&#x27;s clearly attempting a coup to become a tyrant, suggesting maybe he&#x27;ll even be President for 3 terms, etc; there&#x27;s countless proof points relating to his behaviour that he&#x27;s a tyrant wannabe.')
