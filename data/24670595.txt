I have had my Series 4 for 514 days. I currently have a 514 day Move streak and 72 perfect weeks (All Activity).<p>I used to second that, until I got to 689 days and then the heart rate sensor stopped working on my watch.<p>I now have a longest move streak that is pretty hard to reach again, no way to reset it, and my motivation largely got destroyed after 2 weeks of no rings closed at all, due to Apple refusing to provide me with a proactive replacement for what was clearly a hardware defect. After nearly 2 perfect years.<p>A couple of months later, Covid happened, and I now have a pretty poor end result, as the rings no longer matter having lost the ability to continue streak tracking (the only way to see your streak is if you&#x27;re setting a new record).<p>I think the lesson here is beware on relying too much on this crack for motivation. If you&#x27;re not developing the appropriate discipline alongside it, and just relying on the crack, you may find you fail like I did when the crack disappears.')
