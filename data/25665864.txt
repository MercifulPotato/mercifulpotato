Been there done that! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten a single job from sending in applications randomly using something like Indeed or Monster. Usually they were all through word of mouth. That being said, you should probably just keep trying. Besides encouraging you to keep going, here&#x27;s some other advice which you can take or don&#x27;t. Just trying to be helpful if I can!<p>1. Build up a portfolio of work, through hobby at first. Build some apps, release something, post it here and at the bottom of the post or on the README, or website, mention you&#x27;re looking for work. It gives you exposure and experience and could lead to some interesting opportunities, but at the very least you&#x27;re gaining some relevant knowledge. Try to work on things you love, but work with tools you&#x27;re not familiar with (yet). Figure out some modern tech stacks, methodologies, practices, etc, and run it. You could even get started learning Web Development with C#. Come up with an idea such as what we discussed before, pick a solid framework, learn how to do proper testing (and implement full enough test coverage), pick a apidoc generator and write some really nice docs, pick up a framework like React and build a UI, etc.<p>2. Try to expand your networking. I&#x27;ve gotten three jobs by asking around to all my IRC friends, and one job through responding to a Hacker News thread. Join some relevant IRC channels, Discord communities, etc, and get to know people. Like I said, I&#x27;ve never had success just submitting resumes. Might need to be a bit more strategic and reach out to people personally, perhaps through LinkedIn.')
