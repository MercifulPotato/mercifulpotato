This includes implementing my own LISP interpreters&#x2F;compilers just for fun. I also know enough Haskell (and Idris) to compare LISP style languages with the “opposite” end of the functional language spectrum. And I an the maintainer of a high performance functional programming language at work. In the end I still end up never reaching for LISP or Clojure when solving real world programming challenges. The key reason is that I am more productive with strong types. The same reason why I initially loved Ruby and then stopped using it the moment I tried to build anything bigger with it. I realise that not having types makes some people happy. That’s great. It just doesn’t make me happy.')
