Intel using ECC to segment consumer&#x2F;server offerings. 2. Even when AMD supported ECC (officially or unofficially) on consumer products, consumers voted with their wallets with a mix of ignorance.<p>ECC ram should be more expensive as you&#x27;re paying for more bits, and marginally slower as you&#x27;re comparing stored with computed. If consumers don&#x27;t value their data (they say they do but don&#x27;t act accordingly), bit errors is what we get.<p>I do my job on a company laptop, if it were my own company I&#x27;d use an AMD desktop with ECC.')
