I don&#x27;t have all the answers but a few things to note on this topic..<p>1. The lockdown was probably not actually harsh enough.<p>I got a waiver from it, as did almost everyone I worked with, to continue coming into work. The paper said we were &quot;critical to national infrastructure&quot; but we work in long-term research which could easily be pushed back by weeks without anyone knowing or caring.<p>I don&#x27;t know how typical this was or how many people were excluded.<p>2. You could always travel to and from other states pretty freely via car.<p>The only serious attempt I ever saw against this was at the New York Connecticut border they were checking for certain license plates (Florida maybe? they didn&#x27;t care about my MA plates) one time. Even then, you could apparently get off the highway and avoid this because a friend of mine did.<p>3. Mask rules were&#x2F;are looser in NH where everyone goes on weekends if traffic is any indication.<p>4. In recent months I saw a lot of people mushed together dining outside in the Italian district. We can debate how much this matters since it&#x27;s outdoors but I don&#x27;t think they were doing that in Australia. Separation looks more serious based on articles I&#x27;ve seen:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theage.com.au&#x2F;national&#x2F;victoria&#x2F;melbourne-unveils-16-covid-safe-outdoor-dining-precincts-20201001-p560z2.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theage.com.au&#x2F;national&#x2F;victoria&#x2F;melbourne-unveil...</a><p>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hard stats to put in here, but it wasn&#x27;t Australia in MA and degree of enforcement certainly makes a difference if you&#x27;re going to have rules.')
