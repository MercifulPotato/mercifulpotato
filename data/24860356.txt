I don&#x27;t have the car anymore, but I still have all the crazy parts in a box somewhere.<p>I implemented a small frontend in linux; I tried to implement a GUI directly from scratch in SDL+GL so it never really got far. I read yesterday about GM licensing unreal engine to build their in-car UI and thought back to this early work even though it didn&#x27;t go anywhere at the time. I did have a relatively popular touchscreen-friendly windows app for tuning XM satellite radio using the XM-PCR and later the XM-Direct receivers. It supported AM&#x2F;FM as well using the &quot;RadioShark,&quot; a USB connected AM&#x2F;FM radio. My software supported buffered playback so you could pause and rewind. On the non-public version, it could automatically encode, tag, and save the songs based on the metadata.')
