Windows has something similar built in, but it&#x27;s not as good as Flux in my experience. Flux has the ability to slower change the hue of your screen over time and gives you great control over it at every level. It also lets you set a notif for when you want to get up so when it alerts me that I&#x27;m 8.5 hours away from needing to wake up I know I need to start winding down')
