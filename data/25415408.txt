You remind me of almost every other intervention in medicine.<p>I remember e.g. when heart failure was treated with beta-agonists (every doctor at lectures: &quot;It makes sense! The heart is struggling, so we give it a boost!&quot;).<p>Then they did some studies and found that while the heart output increased, people were dying faster. So they decided to do the exact opposite and switch to beta-blockers (every doctor at lectures: &quot;It makes sense! A dimmer candle burns for longer!&quot;).<p>Then they found out beta-blockers made things worse too. I have no idea what they do nowadays, but I&#x27;m sure doctors still have a rationalisation-by-analogy explanation for it, whatever that is.')
