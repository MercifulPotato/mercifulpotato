I comfortably maintain CMake builds that work on linux (with centos, ubuntu and arch), macos and windows without much trouble.<p>If you mean cmake versions, I&#x27;m not sure what you expect, should cmake just freeze in time and stop adding features so someone gets to use cmake from 5 years ago?<p>Also, the bit about autotools on windows is silly. If it can&#x27;t build native windows stuff, it&#x27;s not at all viable for windows.<p>I also dislike cmake (particularly dependency management) and wish for something better, but I think our criticisms should be well-founded.')
