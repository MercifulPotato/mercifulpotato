If there was a nuclear war between the US and Russia&#x2F;China, there are enough nuclear weapons that you’re not only hitting the US and UK (which you’re for sure fighting against), but also Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Because if you take the US out while also getting taken out but don’t take out the allies, you didn’t really “win” the war.')
