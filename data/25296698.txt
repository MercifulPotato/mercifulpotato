You have to click on &quot;show images&quot; every time you read an emai, even from a trusted contact.<p>- There is no &quot;open mailto: links on FastMail&quot; option on desktop.<p>- Spam filter is too aggressive. I&#x27;ve missed too many legit mails while trying it.<p>- Contact list manager is too barebones. There isn&#x27;t even a &quot;find and merge duplicates&quot; option.')
