The organizational infrastructure, investment in those engineers, associated risks if the investment doesn&#x27;t bear fruit, engagement with the capital markets necessary to provide the financial infrastructure to keep the blood flow of money pumping... There&#x27;s a heck of a lot more going to make any moderate R&amp;D project happen. Why is the engineer more important than the many people required to make the organization function in a way that makes the engineer&#x27;s work possible in the first place?<p>Maybe people at the top get too much of the compensation, but what about the network technicians and IT departments that provided a functional work environment? What about building maintenance? What is harder, the research involved, or learning &amp; navigating knowledge of the legal and financial mechanisms necessary for large complex organizations with a thousand interlinking pieces to other organizations? Who should get more compensation when the absence of any one component, not just the researchers, might have caused failure?<p>I want to be clear though: I&#x27;m not defending astronomical compensation of the very few at the top. I&#x27;m saying that if there&#x27;s inequity here, it doesn&#x27;t begin or end with the engineers and researchers. Its victims are the sum total of all the people, all of the functions, without which the system fails.')
