Lucky the doc was reasonable and instead of giving me a bunch of pills, she just tested me for typical food allergies. Turns out I was allergic to 2&#x2F;3 of my daily diet.<p>Once I&#x27;ve cut those foods out of my system, everything&#x27;s back to normal. It really seems we can do quite a bit of good by just not harming our body to begin with.')
