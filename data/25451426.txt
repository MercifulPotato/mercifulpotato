SF and Asana are great for their function, but it&#x27;s impossible to rely only on them to run a business.<p>With SF, you can track your actions with a client, but you can&#x27;t actually manage a contract start to finish, sign, and then execute a transaction.  And Asana, it&#x27;s unfortunately a silo within a company that relies on countless integrations to reach it&#x27;s max potential. By being hyper-specialized, they both force you to spend more before you can operate a business which is a lose-lose proposition.<p>Operwell gives its Users the ability to send contracts to their clients, manage drafts then e-sign; pay and receive transactions, and then it integrates chat and messaging features -with automation embedded- so that daily communications with clients are automatically record-kept without manual data-entry.<p>When combined with Operwell’s full project management and HR&#x2F;Performance management suite; there’s an actual chance to give small businesses a true All-In-One platform to run their entire business.<p>SF and Asana are popular, but I believe Operwell gives the person who&#x27;s actually running a business more than they expect and everything they actually need.')
