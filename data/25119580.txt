Item(by='b20000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605578878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117362, text='since the pandemic started, i&#x27;ve seen airbnb guests constantly showing up for a stay in our apartment building where subletting via airbnb is specifically prohibited. leasing office doesn&#x27;t care and looks the other way. this has contributed to the spread of covid-19 without doubt. it&#x27;s infuriating to have total strangers hang around the property while trying to concentrate on work and writing software. these people show up, refuse to wear masks and then get drunk and hang around &#x2F; go to the beach nearby. airbnb doesn&#x27;t contribute anything to society and how this company can be profitable at all is a total mystery to me.')
