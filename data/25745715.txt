Elections are managed <i>almost entirely</i> at the state and local level in the US.<p>For example, Georgia&#x27;s win was certified and defended by a Republican Governor and Secretary of State. Their results come from the county level, of which there are over three <i>thousand</i> in the US, many of which are heavily Republican, and each of which is responsible for its own election setup, count, and verification.<p>You&#x27;d have to convince tens if not hundreds of thousands of election officials and volunteers to participate and cover it up.')
