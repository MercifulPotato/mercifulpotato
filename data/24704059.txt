While I do understand the bad practices of many tech companies, I think the picture is very different when you look at careers in other STEM fields, such as biology, chemistry, and physics. H1B visas are very important for foreign students in these fields particularly those hoping to pursue careers in academia. H1B visas are in fact a beacon of hope that brings many talented students to America, with the promise of finding a job here. As a matter of fact, many of these students go on to work on projects that are important for human health, e.g. COVID-19 research. It is convenient for the country to attract and retain their talent, of which there is currently a shortage.\nNot every H1B holder is an underpaid scrum master. Some are legitimately scientists doing on a postdoc in academia, and working to improve lives. For those of you rejoicing, I just want to ask you to do more research in how this rash policy change may impact the lives of real people.')
