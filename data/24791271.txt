The lie may have already had its desired effect by the time the truth comes out, if it ever does. Lies about, for example, the stab-in-the-back, tobacco and WMDs in Iraq got the liars what they wanted at the cost of millions of lives.<p>The truth may never become as widely known as the lie due to the frictions it encounters in spreading. People like to see news that confirms their own biases (me too), they like spreading news that&#x27;s counter-intuitive or unusual, and they hate reading boring stuff (like fact-checks with a long list of citations). An interesting lie will spread quicker and wider, and be remembered for far longer, than the correction that just a few days later.<p>Overall this whole &quot;free speech kills lies&quot; idea sounds like religious dogma to me. It may be true in some cases, but it&#x27;s taken as an immutable, universal article of faith and its proponents never feel the need to cite any actual evidence or address the horrific consequences of the edge cases. It&#x27;s an idealistic image of how the world works, similar to a socialist utopia.<p>Free speech is crucial to liberty and progress, and the government must not regulate speech. But that should not apply to private platforms.')
