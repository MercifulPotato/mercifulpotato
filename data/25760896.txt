That&#x27;s why my primary suggested fix wasn&#x27;t &quot;just removing pip&quot; but hiving the Debian managed python environment off somewhere different and calling it something else and with different binary names (e.g. debsyspython) that debian package authors could rely upon.<p>Then the default &quot;python&quot; and &quot;pip&quot; could be without debian dependencies and users could go wild doing whatever the hell they want without messing up anything else in the debian dependency tree (like they would with pyenv or conda).')
