For instance, why isn&#x27;t navigation a command? It&#x27;s not necessarily <i>bad</i> that it&#x27;s unintuitive -- lots of things require you to know something before you interact with it -- but to suggest that anyone who doesn&#x27;t immediately guess the syntax has somehow failed only introduces needless elitism.')
