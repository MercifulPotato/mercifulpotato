People like new things, and often switch jobs looking for something new, and in tech that&#x27;s often new technology they&#x27;ve played with but not got a chance to use in production.<p>Honestly, something that&#x27;s advertised as ruby&#x2F;python and HTML will probably put a lot of devs off that used to happily do that all day, and so a company might have to pay higher for good talent, or put up with worse talent applying for the same salary.<p>You might actually be worth more not knowing react. Communicating that to prospective employers might be hard though.<p>In other words, you can probably make really good money slinging COBOL if you know it and can communicate your talent sufficiently for the same reason, but more extreme.')
