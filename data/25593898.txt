So they&#x27;re all kind of emulating this robotic version of themselves that never has any opinion people can object to.<p>Discrediting this expectation was one of the biggest silver linings of Trump&#x27;s win in 2016 I think. The pressure for politicians to be flawless turned our politics into a least-common-denominator farce where the smallest gaffe matters more than the biggest policy ideas.
