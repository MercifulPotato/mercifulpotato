But so are most professionals, parents, etc (I.e. folks over 25). And you only have to be sitting slightly to the right of the median before the vote ratio steam rolls you’re world view.<p>&gt; and what you see as an enforced echo chamber is just the vast majority of users sitting in the middle of that bell curve doing their thing<p>That’s literally a fucking echo chamber. A community that has a voting mechanism that reinforces the views of the majority and suppresses anything unpopular with that majority group.')
