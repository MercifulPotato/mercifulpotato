To those of you suggesting that &quot;maybe it&#x27;s the schedule&quot;, you are wrong.<p>I got my daughter to sit with me and watch &quot;The Social Dilemma&quot; on Netflix, and she still wouldn&#x27;t leave her iphone alone.  I could not believe it.  Her exact behaviour is being acted out in front of us, and she&#x27;s busy maintaining her streaks.  I pause the show and &quot;Really?  Are you seriously using your phone right now?&quot;<p>She&#x27;s totally addicted to snap.  so much so that she will even make little snap poses during a normal face-to-face conversation, which prompted me - the first time I saw it - to say &quot;Did you just pose for a snap photo?&quot;  to which she embarrassingly agreed that she had.<p>Just as the author of the article related, my daughter cannot be without her phone and exhibits many of the same behaviours described in the article.  Sounds like we&#x27;ve had the same arguments.')
