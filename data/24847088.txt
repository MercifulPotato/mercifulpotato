That made it quite easy to write code which ran circles around R performance-wise without leaving the Python syntax domain and with a very simple FFI to call C to boot.  I even had a tiny &quot;pycc&quot; script to create &quot;executables&quot; instead of &quot;importable modules&quot;.  Yes, those executables did depend on the installed base of Python stuff.<p>These days, Nim is a better Cython but with less dynamic temptations and more powerful metaprogramming (and, yes, a much smaller ecosystem..maybe not that much smaller than Python in the late 90s, though).  { Not that this is <i>all</i> Nim is...It&#x27;s actually a really good everything-language that&#x27;s tricky to summarize in just a few words. }')
