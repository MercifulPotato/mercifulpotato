Money is not wealth.<p>For example, suppose you have a car that you paid $20K in cash for this year. That works out to about $10K 30 years ago (I think the Fed charts you showed are in inflation-adjusted dollars, though they don&#x27;t say so). So as far as monetary vaue is concerned, you have the same net worth in your $20K car today as a person 30 years ago would have in a car that cost $10K then. (Or even a car that cost $20K then, if we aren&#x27;t adjusting cost for inflation.)<p>Having owned cars over this entire time period, however, I can tell you that the <i>wealth</i> contained in that $20K car today is quite a bit greater than the wealth contained in a car that cost $10K 30 years ago. A $20K car today will be more reliable, get better gas mileage <i>and</i> give better average performance, have numerous safety features that didn&#x27;t even exist 30 years ago, <i>and</i> have more bells and whistles in general. So in terms of wealth, I&#x27;m quite a bit more wealthy with $20K worth of car today than a person 30 years ago would be with the same inflation-adjusted monetary value of car.<p>And cars are actually a pretty poor example as compared with, say, computers or phones.')
