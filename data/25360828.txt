Consortiums can help to pool resources when everyone knows what needs doing<p>TSMC or its ecosystem is already like a consortium.<p>this semiwiki article point that out.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semiwiki.com&#x2F;semiconductor-manufacturers&#x2F;intel&#x2F;293645-how-intel-stumbled-a-perspective-from-the-trenches&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semiwiki.com&#x2F;semiconductor-manufacturers&#x2F;intel&#x2F;29364...</a><p>&quot;TSMC, for example, has a massive ecosystem of partners and customers who together spend trillions of dollars on research and development for the greater good of the fabless semiconductor ecosystem. There is also an inner circle of partners and customers that TSMC intimately collaborates with on new process development and deployment. This includes Apple of course, AMD, Arm, Applied Materials, ASML, Cadence, and Synopsys just to name a few.&quot;<p>TSMC hand out their kit to their partners on their node process.<p>bottom line: fabless no longer just simply toss design over to the foundry.')
