Bitcoin has some sort of &quot;first mover&quot; advantage which gives it a critical number of investors&#x2F;PR that allows it to keep trading high, and no other coin will ever be able to catch up to it.<p>2.  Bitcoin is actually technically superior to other coins, and it won&#x27;t be supplanted until whatever the special sauce is, is replicated.<p>3.
