ROS is to robotics development what Django&#x2F;Rails is to web development.&quot;<p>ROS2 is version 2 of the original ROS framework.<p>As a results of the ROS framework, a number of modules (packages in ROS-talk) for complex robotics algorithms, functionality has been implemented by companies &#x2F; the community and shared among each other.<p>For instance, Hadabot reuses the Navigation package (along with many others) that has been pre-impremented which allows me to employ many robotics functionalities without having to re-invent the wheel.')
