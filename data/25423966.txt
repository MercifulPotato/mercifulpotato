If PornHub had iron tight controls and one of the actors was caught using a fake ID, then it might be reasonable. But they didn&#x27;t have iron tight controls... or apparently any controls. There was zero verification that participants had signed releases or were of age.<p>PornHub&#x27;s controls were complete shit.<p>Maybe some people want drugs from Pfizer&#x27;s &quot;Community Sourced&quot; drug program... I sure don&#x27;t.')
