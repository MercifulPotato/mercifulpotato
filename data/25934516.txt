Attributing it to him &quot;wanting to be evil&quot; is easy, especially because he is abrasive.<p>Due to the incentives above, it might be said we are annoyed by their lack of willingness to be fired in a futile effort to obstruct a system which will carry on regardless--we are annoyed they won&#x27;t do something pointless.<p>I have a feeling most people would have trouble taking food out of their family&#x27;s mouth and literally becoming unemployed in order to tilt at a windmill where your effort cannot win. That&#x27;s a pretty impossible standard to expect. If Shkreli found morals and got fired, Shkreli2 would take over.<p>So instead, I say, the problem is the system. Pretending it is about moral failing <i>enables the system</i> to go on by wasting time blaming moral failings instead of fixing it. The system produces bad behavior. We can tut tut each individual person it produces, or we can change the incentives and fix the system.')
