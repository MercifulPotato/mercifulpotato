I find it fascinating that the two similar titles create very different expectations in my mind. Maybe it&#x27;s just my own cognitive associations, but &#x27;world&#x27; makes me think of wider implications (eg social, political, environmental) while &#x27;earth&#x27; seems more scientific (eg natural processes). Someone might say &quot;look at the world around you&quot; but not &quot;look at the earth around you.&quot; In French, &#x27;tout le monde&#x27; translates literally to &quot;all the world&quot; but is used to mean &#x27;everybody&#x27; -- and specifically, humans.')
