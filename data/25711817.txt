Whatever it was that led his writing to mature beyond his earlier work, it certainly did that.<p>I don&#x27;t plan to start looking for more agony in his later works than his earlier ones. The &#x27;Unfinished&#x27;, written in the fall of 1822 (he moved into his parent&#x27;s home, unable to leave until the following spring) has none. Similarly for the <i>Rosamunde</i> music, written before the Dec. 1823 premiere.<p>Then there&#x27;s the Great Symphony, written 1825-26. Everywhere countless ideas and themes; In 1840 Schumann said of it &quot;this work reveals life in every fiber, color down to the finest shading, significance everywhere, the most acute expression of individual detail ...&quot; To what should we attribute the frightful &#x27;battle&#x27; in the Andante? This isn&#x27;t <i>program music</i>.<p>In the late chamber works, yes, I feel some deep regret - and anger. A great tragedy - but - his disease certainly <i>was not</i> his master.')
