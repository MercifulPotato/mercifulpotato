Nobody ever stated that. If anything, it was all of the Intel and AMD users who created that straw man. &quot;See, it&#x27;s slower than a 64-core Threadripper at 280 watts&quot;. No kidding.<p>2. The M1 is clearly not a desktop-class SoC nor was it intended to be. However, it&#x27;s more than competitive with many desktop x86 processors that run faster and hotter while consuming much more power.<p>3. As a first attempt, the M1â€™s performance per watt is very impressive. Obviously the 5nm process helps but it&#x27;s never one thing with Apple: it&#x27;s the unified memory, the 8 instruction decoders (AMD and Intel max out at 4), and the integration of the 16-core Neural Engine, among other features.')
