There should be much simpler and harder caps on business size (and&#x2F;or other large-size discouragements such as tax rates on revenue or some other hard-to-fake metric for size). The extremely wimpy trust-busting rules currently assume no harm until proven otherwise, which is much too high a bar, and much too slow, and much to reliant on the inefficient judicial system to be able to steer a market economy.')
