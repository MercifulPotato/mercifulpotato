When I look at people like Bezos or Gates I am not sure they created as much as they were able to gain a larger share of a market. I think without them we would have been fine and other players would have been in the market. So I think to some degree they took wealth from others.<p>I also don&#x27;t believe that the top 1% (or pick another number) are creating more wealth than they did 50 years ago which then would justify them taking ever larger shares of the economy for themselves. I think to a large degree modern mature economies are pretty fixed with very even overall growth so it comes down to distributing the gains in a fair way.')
