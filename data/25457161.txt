It&#x27;s not some natural law; it&#x27;s a political result reached through activism. Anyone is free to try and get a different result, and each side will judge how much power they have in this case, and try to use it to best achieve the outcome they want.<p>&gt; The board is legally (and ethically) obligated to work for the benefit of the company.<p>But the board also decides what working for the benefit of the company means. Some person or persons must have decided that letting that manager go is better for the company than keeping her. If others were involved in the decision, they might have decided differently.')
