We don&#x27;t have anything now that could drive such a ship. My guess is that this is either something we&#x27;ll have within the next couple hundred years or we&#x27;ll never have it.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that by the time you want to build this kind of ship, you&#x27;ve gotten raising people from frozen embryos or frozen eggs and sperm perfected, and that is where most replacement crew would come from. That should greatly reduce the crew size needed.<p>I think we&#x27;ll be able to handle the biological side of this within a hundred years, with a good chance of it being quite a bit sooner than that.')
