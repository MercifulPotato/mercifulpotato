Think of all the encounters with racist old people that we tend to laugh off with &quot;she&#x27;s from a different era&quot;. The brush off we do doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they have grossly outdated and evil views by todays norms. Also think about old people that did change. We don&#x27;t judge them too harshly for past behavior given it was the norm at the time.<p>As a personal anecdote; every time i&#x27;ve been slow to adapt to the new societal norms, when i look back it&#x27;s been me who was wrong, not society. It&#x27;s just taken me time to realize it. I&#x27;ve learnt to force myself to accept, based on repeated past experience, that it&#x27;s probably not society that&#x27;s wrong when the overton window moves, it&#x27;s probably me. I&#x27;m yet to regret adapting my viewpoint even if at the time it irks me somewhat. If you&#x27;re over 30 think back to the school yard gay insults and compare your own viewpoints now. It&#x27;s not wrong you&#x27;ve changed is it? Take that lesson into account with todays changes and you won&#x27;t regret it.<p>What i&#x27;m trying to say here is that fighting against changes to the overton window will cause you to end up as a sterotypical old person with grossly outdated views. There&#x27;s no need to be this way.')
