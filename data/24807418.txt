The income tax is prorated by the number of months that you were a resident in CA, relative to the vesting point.<p>I left CA about a year after a stock award and had to pay CA state tax for 3 years after leaving (but each year the rate would decline).<p>There&#x27;s a serious WTF moment when you find this out, particularly when you pick up from CA and go to WA (a state without income tax).')
