Just quit. Enough people do it, and their boss will fix it. You don’t like your company’s policies around privacy, diversity, inclusion, human rights? Quit.”<p>This is psycho advice. It ranks up there with the crazy myths about just being able to instantly get new software jobs (when the actual time of job searches is usually longer than 6 months, despite the tone deaf wave of gainsaying comments this is sure to incite).<p>Voting with your feet rarely leads to organizational changes, especially if you don’t give clear feedback or spend sincere effort trying to fix the issues you’re having prior to quitting. More likely, you quitting is just tacitly reinforcing power and control by the shitty people who made your experience shitty.<p>When you need to quit, by all means, absolutely do it. But don’t kid yourself that there’s any “voting” going on. Do yourself and others a favor: give feedback and take responsibility for your own job satisfaction. Nobody can help you if you won’t try to get help.<p>And don’t count on a fast job search. This topic is so tone dead on HN. Some cacophony of commenters will swear you can get a million jobs from all your spam LinkedIn headhunters and be re-employed in weeks, but it is emphatically not true and the selection bias of those examples has to imply just ignoring them as inapplicable to the vast majority of software engineers. Interview prep, finding a good fit and getting what you want in a position and in compensation is really hard and takes a long time in software.')
