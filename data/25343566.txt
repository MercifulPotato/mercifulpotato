If you spend enough time with a consistently formatted codebase, your eye will be drawn to the important parts when you review code. In a tiny way, you develop &quot;expertise&quot; with the formatting, and when you look at other code there is an ever-so-subtle friction to understanding it. Manually reindenting code after editing or refactoring it is also pretty annoying, though of course that&#x27;s the instinct that &quot;code is meant to be read&quot; is intended to argue against.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the creator of Rubocop isn&#x27;t that bullish on Prettier, because my company literally uses Rubocop to replicate a Prettier-like experience [1]. Rubocop makes a totally decent Prettier replacement, with the right rules. Another advantage of using a separate opinionated formatting tool is that you avoid issues with a diversity of editors which never quite have the same auto-indentation to mess up code diffs.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexport.engineering&#x2F;approximating-prettier-for-ruby-with-rubocop-8b863bd64dc6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexport.engineering&#x2F;approximating-prettier-for-ruby...</a>')
