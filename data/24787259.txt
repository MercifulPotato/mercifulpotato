I see so much talk that&#x27;s based off of people&#x27;s view from an entirely Western media-centred POV. There&#x27;s so much more to what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s a lot of pot calling the kettle black too. There&#x27;s a lot of good stuff in the TLS from a few weeks back.<p>Han is the cultural race&#x2F;ethnicity in mainland China. [0] It&#x27;s about 92% of the population. So that&#x27;s a lot of people. Is China trying to sure up its borders? Yes. Is China out for world domination, I really don&#x27;t think so. Every single one of my Chinese friends is about as sweet as they come. China is the new mystery to the West, and I don&#x27;t think people in the West really understand them. The amount of growth in China is outrageous. We&#x27;ve outsourced so much there, and then have a go at them for stuff we don&#x27;t really understand.<p>I think GP is right in ways. I think there are some nefarious actors in China running the same plays from the playbook written by the Anglosphere war powers, but to lump it all in a say &#x27;China bad&#x27; is, in my very under-read &#x2F; under-experienced, opinion, a terrible thing.<p>他们很好 - Hope I&#x27;ve got my characters right!
