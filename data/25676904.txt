That said, please rest assured that your account and experience will not be immediately impacted. We are still working out the timeline details with BBVA USA, but we expect this to be months, not weeks, and we will work with you as we learn how our closure will unfold.<p>We greatly appreciate your patience and please know that we&#x27;re very sad about this; helping small businesses and entrepreneurs survive and thrive has brought us nothing but joy and fulfillment and we wish we could continue.&quot;<p>Guess I will be going elsewhere.')
