States were the dominant law givers, and it meant that power centers were more decentralized and local to the people being governed. Instead of most laws that directly impact your life coming from far away in Washington DC from politicians you will never meet and can&#x27;t influence, you had laws from more local government that you had more of a chance of participating in and influencing (e.g. for the things that mattered you had much more _meaningful_ representation). When states could elect senators, it had more of a chance of keeping that power decentralized. Now government power, like the internet, is increasingly centralized which makes it a battle of the federal government to make the entire country do what &quot;our side&quot; wants. It would be better if most laws were decided locally in your state or city-- and other states or cities could do things differently. That would be good for everybody.')
