Many packages put their copyright&#x2F;license info in special inline comments (using &#x2F;<i>! ... </i>&#x2F; tags), and every minifier I&#x27;ve used keeps such tags by default. But including these tags in your bundles can be undesirable - if a dependency has: &#x2F;<i>! Copyright foo@bar </i>&#x2F; without specifying the package name, then your bundle will appear to be entirely (c) that author.<p>OTOH the huge majority of projects do include a valid license identifier in a package.json tag (since npm complains if you don&#x27;t). But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any widely-used default way of generating a good licenses declaration from them.')
