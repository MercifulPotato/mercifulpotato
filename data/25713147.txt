People have been &quot;afraid to speak openly&quot; for all of America&#x27;s history. The notion that there&#x27;s something drastically different about &quot;cancel culture&quot; in terms of severity is historically ignorant. Look at the comedian Lenny Bruce&#x27;s arrests for obscenity, for example. Or the  anticommunist panic of the 1950s. To say nothing of how women were controlled up to and after suffrage: deprivation of rights, marginalization, beatings, and rape. Ditto the free speech of black people, who faced lynching for as little as whistling.<p>Social actions will always have social consequences; that&#x27;s a necessary corollary to freedom of speech. What&#x27;s different today is that social conservatives and especially the radical right are starting to experience those same social consequences. If people are going to use their freedom of speech and association to, say, support Nazis, then other people  are free to use their freedoms of speech and association in response.')
