We don’t regularly have hospital ITUs stuffed full of people with influenza, threatening to overwhelm capacity. We don’t generally have city-, region- and country-wide lockdowns where transmission is massively curtailed. Even a very casual look at what happened in different countries makes it clear that this disease has an obviously different character.<p>It really feels lately like there’s some kind of weird “iamverysmart” syndrome banging around on HN in particular - every single post mentioning COVID is full of these shallow armchair analyses that seem to think rejecting all prevailing wisdom is an inherent good. It’s totally possible to be critical of the global response and analyses of it without this honestly <i>fucking weird</i> assumption that everyone else except you is a mindless sheep.')
