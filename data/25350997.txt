I got pinged for a SRE job recently (my background so far is very much Linux based so I must have matched some filter) but I&#x27;m not strong in development, k8s (or even containers), or all of the other cool stuff I see on HN. I know I can lab stuff out, but that&#x27;s not anywhere close to doing it live.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be a SRE for Google, but I&#x27;d like to learn some more on the reliability side of my world and bring things like Git, Puppet, System design, etc and not be left behind in this wave that&#x27;s approaching. My organization isn&#x27;t too involved in the cloud, so a lot of upcoming tech seems out of reach.')
