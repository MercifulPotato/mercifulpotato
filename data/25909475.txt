In turn many of the people which are still obese are people where just eating less and doing more sport doesn&#x27;t really work and in turn telling them to just do so is problematic.<p>But on the other side going just to a different part of Germany some degree of obesity caused by drinking to much beer, unhealthy food and maybe to little sport is quite common in the idk. 50+ generation.')
