I would guess that many of the poster&#x27;s problems have to do with Linux&#x27;s mediocre GUI support in general.  I&#x27;ve recently switched to doing development on Ubuntu (vs. RH&#x2F;CentOS) and all the GUI stuff works <i>much</i> better in that environment, incl. ddd.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried Eclipse&#x27;s C&#x2F;C++ debugger, but its Perl debugger (part of EPIC) is quite nice and works well on both Mac and Linux.')
