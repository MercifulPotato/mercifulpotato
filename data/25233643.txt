Does the knowledge acquired by re-invention and its effect on subsequent effectiveness and or productivity outweigh the cost of time expended. In many cases, especially in a mature or stable environment, the answer is yes. It&#x27;s also an attractive method of learning to people who like to think from first principles, as it involves developing a bottom-up understanding of whatever &quot;the wheel&quot; in this case is via practice.<p>I find that strong opinions either way on this question to be indicative of time preference. My own view is there&#x27;s a time to do it and there&#x27;s a time to avoid it. It becomes very valuable when ones navigating an unfamiliar area or is in the midst of a fundamental shift in the landscape. It&#x27;s best to avoid it if the team or project is an a do-or-die scenario where certain milestones must be met to ensure it remains a viable team or project.')
