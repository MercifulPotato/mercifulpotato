Math notation is also a language and it barely uses any English words.<p>I don&#x27;t see meaningful differences between languages whether they are computer languages, human languages, math notation, except how the human brain processes them.<p>&gt;linguistics research at the time which defined language as a set of strings.<p>Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with that. You can have trivial languages that follow simple rules. In practice humans tend to use more complicated languages but that is just their personal and cultural preference.<p>People here are too hung up the message that is being communicated rather than the general idea of language as a communication method. Programming languages usually express algorithms and trigger logical sections of the brain but nothing prevents you from using a human language to express the same algorithm and trigger the same sections of the brain. The reason why people associate programming languages with logical thinking is that they were exclusively designed to communicate logic and nothing else.')
