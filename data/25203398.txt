I get that electrify everything is a great slogan but the reality is that maybe 60-80% makes sense and then after that it because a total cluster.  I disagree - and i will continue to say that CCS is a red herring and waste of resources.  It has been under development for a considerable amount of time and still has not proven itself.  Go look at Alberta&#x27;s multibillion dollar investments into CCS and how much has not materialized.<p>Deploy technology we already have and invest in viable R&amp;D technology. Renewables, better agriculture, hydrogen based fuels, reforestation, changing cement processes, landfill management, capture biogas from waste water treatment plants and ag facilities, reduce high GWP refrigerant uses in countries that still allow them....<p>We will blow by 1.5 C if you&#x27;ve been watching this space since the early 2000s we&#x27;ve blown by every single warning that we&#x27;ve put up.  Theres a moment in time that is happening right now - we waste our political clout and money on CCS or anything on GeoEngineering and it will be a disappointing future.<p>And no, investing in soil remediation would not incentivize further use of the ICE&#x2F;fossil fuel burning tech because the oil majors aren&#x27;t the companies standing to gain from soil remediation (i.e. they haven&#x27;t spent considerable money funding R&amp;D institutes to evangelize and deploy this tech).')
