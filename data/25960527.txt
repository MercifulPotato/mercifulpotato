Nothing. Absolutely nothing.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make sense. <i>Any</i> restrictions on speech (e.g. prohibiting lying in commercials, prohibiting yelling fire in a crowded room, etc.) <i>always</i> need to go through the lens of whether there is a &quot;legitimate government interest&quot;, because the courts have been very clear that any restrictions on speech much have a clear rationale. If the SEC wants to argue that posts on a public website forum are somehow collusion, they need to argue why those posts are <i>not</i> protected by the first amendment.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s easy to come up with a clear rationale for why one would limit speech in this case, and &quot;commercial&quot; speech is much more open to restrictions. However, I don&#x27;t see how one could argue &quot;I&#x27;m buying a shit ton of GME, and I think you should too, because I want to screw over the hedge fund guys&quot; is any different, just because it&#x27;s on a forum, from all the other types of investment advice and theories that goes out all the time.')
