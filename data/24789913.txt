I mean, you love working from home? Congrats, more power to you. But the number of comments stating that &quot;only people who are good at office politics like going to the office&quot;, &quot;only incompetent managers need to see you in person&quot;, &quot;your co-workers aren&#x27;t your friends&quot;, etc. are, as I would generously put it, tone deaf.<p>For many (most?) people this has been the worst working situation of their lives, and attempts to minimize that are insulting. I believe it will be <i>especially</i> bad for those early in their careers, trying to find their footing, get mentorship, and build their network.')
