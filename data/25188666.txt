I would like to keep it that way; extremely effective systems of state censorship of publishing and communications, such as implemented presently on iOS (remember when the US was about to ban TikTok?) is a good way to force large groups to revert to those bad, old ways if all other options are removed.<p>I don&#x27;t want the majority of the population to only have immediate access to devices that are similarly censored, centrally controlled, and able to be remotely surveilled (such as the unencrypted OCSP data leak extant in macOS the last two+ years, and all of the telemetry built into Windows by design).<p>Privacy and freedom and peace are all deeply interlinked. It&#x27;s an ecosystem, and damaging one part can have deep consequences for the others.')
