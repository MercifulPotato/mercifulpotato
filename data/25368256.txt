Item(by='loughnane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607563119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367892, text='&gt;I still canâ€™t bring myself to write in books for some reason<p>A lot of us have been taught that it&#x27;s defacing (which it is if it&#x27;s a library book or a friends&#x27; book), but really it&#x27;s an act of love. There&#x27;s no surer sign that someone has spent a lot of time with a book than to see it well worn and marked up.<p>I used to take notes before marking it books. I still do a bit, but the proble is that the notes are lifted out of the context of the book. Not so if you write in it :)')
