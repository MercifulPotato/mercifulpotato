Item(by='DiogenesKynikos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608460525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482937, text='&gt; the northern recovery was easier because they didn&#x27;t fall into a local maximum and have their economy entirely depend on slave labor to function.<p>Directly, the Northern economy didn&#x27;t depend <i>at all</i> on slave labor. It depended on wage labor, supplied in large part by large numbers of immigrants. Almost all immigrants settled in northern states, because there was very little opportunity for them in southern slave-owning society. The jobs and economic growth were almost all in the industrializing North.<p>The South exported most of its cotton (Britain was the largest importer, I think), so if we&#x27;re talking about who relied indirectly on slavery, there&#x27;s a much better argument for Britain being the primary beneficiary than the northern states.<p>Economies are interconnected, but that&#x27;s not the core of your claim - the one I object to. The claim that I object to is that slavery is responsible for the US&#x27; economic development. From what I&#x27;ve read, it appears much more to have severely stunted economic growth in half the country for decades, while the half that relied on free labor rapidly industrialized.<p>It appears to me much more that the Southern plantation economy depended heavily on industrial growth in Britain and the northern US, but that British and American textile mills were capable of sourcing their cotton elsewhere if need be (including from economies that used wage labor). The South was much more similar to modern countries that depend entirely on one or a few low-tech exports, such as oil or lumber. Such economies are at the mercy of the international price of their one product. They face tough international competition, because their product isn&#x27;t particularly complicated, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to increase production elsewhere in the world. An economy that only exports oil may make a few magnates wealthy, while leaving the economy as a whole stunted and most of the population poor.')
