I think if you are under a fairly small number of days, you are exempt (e.g. you WFH permanently in NH and occasionally go to the office in MA for a meeting).  More than that and you become a part year resident so your MA tax liability is pro-rated by days_in_ma&#x2F;365.  Anything over I think 180 days and you&#x27;re just considered a resident and pay 100% (which will be most NH people with MA jobs).<p>With so many MA employee-but-NH-residents WFH since March, they will now qualify either as a part-year resident and pay the much smaller pro-rated amount under the part year residency rule, or if under the min-days nothing at all.<p>Predictably MA wants its tax $ and is now going after NH residents who it thinks would normally be working in MA even though they have been out of state.<p>Of course these NH residents don&#x27;t get access to any of the services in MA, except for the roads they drive on to get to work (they likely buy their gas and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts in NH).')
