But the ultimate test is how well the theory matches the experiment.<p>In fact, programmers know this very well. We avoid spaghetti  or giant-ball-of-mud code, we try to express our ideas clearly so we can be more certain that the program works as expected, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. We use elegance and beauty as a guide when writing and improving out code. However, the ultimate test is whether the program works as expected or not.<p>No matter how elegant a wrong program is, it is still wrong. Wrong but elegant code can be an intermediate step to the final correct code, but it&#x27;s not the final goal.<p>The same with the scientific method. You can guide your research with elegance in mind. (At the end of the day, simpler more elegant models are nicer to work with when developing your theory and when applying it in practice!) But the ultimate test is the experiment. And also, if your theory is elegant but untestable (unfalsifiable), the theory is not scientific. It might be completely wrong.<p>As useful as it is, even as a search heuristic elegance might be misleading.
