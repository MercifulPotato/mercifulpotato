Things to fake: name of the person (some names are more attractive than others), profile picture (attractive persons have more followers), previous work experience (big companies attract more followers). \nThe goal is to spread content from others (highly skilled and respected people) via your channel&#x2F;profile so you get followers&#x2F;likes&#x2F;comments. Don&#x27;t spread BS; never. You are creating the &quot;perfect&quot; profile that shares the &quot;perfect&quot; work of others. You can automate this a lot.<p>Step 2: from 10 to 90<p>Let your fake profile grow. In a couple of weeks you&#x27;ll get quite some followers (quality &gt; quantity).<p>Last step: from 90 to 100<p>Make your fake profile start sharing your own (true and personal) work. Suddenly your work is being published among other (highly skilled and respectful) individuals. It is now when you start receiving followers&#x2F;comments&#x2F;likes&#x2F;connections. Enjoy.<p>Edit: of course, if you already have a friend that is highly skilled and respected in the same industry as yours and they can share your work in their own social media in a regular basis, then even better!')
