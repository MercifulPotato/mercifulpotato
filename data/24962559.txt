I haven&#x27;t seen too many different mechanisms.<p>What have you seen on modern cars that&#x27;s different than make sure it&#x27;s in park or neutral (or clutch pedal depressed) and turn the key, or for keyless make sure it&#x27;s in park or neutral (or clutch in), press the brake and push the button? And if the key battery is low, press the button with the key.<p>I&#x27;ve driven some older vehicles where you turned the key to enable ignition, but had a separate starter button, and some vehicles with ignition locks that didn&#x27;t work, so you could turn the ignition without a key. And some cars with keys go off -&gt; accessories -&gt; ignition -&gt; starter vs accessories &lt;- off -&gt; ignition -&gt; starter. If the key retention in the switch&#x2F;lock is broken, sometimes it&#x27;s tricky to make sure you pull the key out in off instead of accessories.')
