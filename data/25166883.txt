Every time it was a slog but I just got through it.<p>The one thing I can say for certain is given enough time it will happen. But whether you can overcome it or it causes you to quit is down to how intrinsically motivated you are (Anki or no Anki) to achieve the goal you are using Anki to help you accomplish. If you would continue to pursue the goal even without Anki then you will most likely persevere.
