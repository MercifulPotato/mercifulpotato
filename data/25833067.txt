(a ~40 hour analysis)&quot;). The study instead is 95% about the onboarding process and maybe 5% about the app itself. Nothing about the sharing workflow of images, videos, audio or group messages. Stuff most users are interested in the most probably.<p>Nothing fishy at all about this.<p>Furthermore: no app can access the iOS keyboard or modify it for obvious security reasons. Having a numpad up is as good as it gets. So the critique about the recommendation of pasting the numeric code from messages is hardly valid.')
