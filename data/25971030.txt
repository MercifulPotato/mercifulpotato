Electrification is going to take <i>at least</i> 20 years, so we&#x27;ll have time to figure things out. Even if <i>all</i> new cars are EVs in 15 years, a lot of people can&#x27;t&#x2F; won&#x27;t buy a new car which will drag out the transition.<p>Also, I know a lot of people who are buying EVs are also installing solar. While it&#x27;s not a perfect match for a person with a 9-5 job, it is a fantastic solution for the growing number of remote workers. This is what I am doing personally.<p>I understand that a lot of people don&#x27;t have places (or the money) where they can install solar so it&#x27;s not a solution for everyone.')
