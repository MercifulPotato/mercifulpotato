My main issue is with the Java zealots that come into the discussion and make it seem like anyone can just take their existing Java application and use it with an AOT compiler. The reality is that you will most likely have to make changes to your code, do a significant amount of configuration, and heavily modify or remove dependencies. Furthermore, you are isolating yourself from the huge Java community because very few people are using any of the existing AOT Java compilers.<p>They try to paint an extremely rosy picture of the current situation when the reality is that it&#x27;s a very long way from the experience you get in Rust, Go, D, C, C++, Haskell, Ocaml or any of the languages where AOT is considered the default.')
