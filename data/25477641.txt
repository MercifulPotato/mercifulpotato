It&#x27;s nearly completely straight and so pretty boring. Plus, because it&#x27;s not a loop you have to ride back every time, which feels like drudgery. Practically it&#x27;s a good idea because there are not a lot of uses for an old rail track, but you won&#x27;t get kids to do it repeatedly and us adults get sick of it pretty quickly too.')
