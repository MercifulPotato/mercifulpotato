This feels lazy to say but I know for a fact I would send tips way more frequently if they made tipping a one click experience.<p>I know there are third party tools that let projects cook tip functionality into their projects.<p>With how difficult it is to find time to write open source software alone, time put towards setting that up winds up feeling like me prioritizing thirsting for tips and donations over finishing whatever the original goal of the project was. I know for a fact I&#x27;m not the only one who feels that way.')
