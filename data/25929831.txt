I don&#x27;t have AAA game quality textures to compare, but I think for usual textured model it is still worthwhile. eg. this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;milek7.pl&#x2F;.stuff&#x2F;somelocotex.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;milek7.pl&#x2F;.stuff&#x2F;somelocotex.png</a> weights 16MiB uncompressed, 5.1MiB as PNG, 5.3MiB as DXT5, and 2.1MiB as DXT5-in-LZ4. (mipmaps included in DXT5)<p>&gt;PS I think that BC could be massaged at compression to be better compressible, and i think i read something about that. Don&#x27;t remember.<p>There&#x27;s Oodle BC7Prep from RAD Game Tools: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radgametools.com&#x2F;oodletexture.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radgametools.com&#x2F;oodletexture.htm</a><p>EDIT: RAD page states that &quot;BC7 blocks that are often very difficult to compress&quot;, so that might be also a factor why my DXT5 test compressed much better than your BC7.<p>EDIT2: Yeah, with BC7 LZ4 only compresses it down to 4.6MiB.')
