Spanish, French and German all looked like they&#x27;d come out on top at some point, but they all lost a lot of relevance after Europe was shattered in ww2.<p>And now we have once again two competing languages dominating the world stage, american English in the west and Chinese (or Mandarin I guess) in the east.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a future when these merge naturally, because they don&#x27;t have any common ground to speak of.<p>However, realistically speaking... If we actually do manage to become a singular community, one language would win at some point. I doubt it&#x27;ll happen while we&#x27;re alive, but it&#x27;ll surely be an interesting topic for historians of the future... As long as we survive long enough I guess')
