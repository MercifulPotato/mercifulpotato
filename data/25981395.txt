I have been working so hard for the past 3 months on this app, and last year tried to submitting the alpha version to hacker news a few times but that version was a lot less polished and didn&#x27;t get much attention.  The response today has been really wonderful, and has been so encouraging!<p>Feel free to ask me any questions or request new features.<p>Everything is still very much in active development and it would be amazing if anyone is interested in contributing the source code[1].   I just took a few days of rest and am gearing up to begin posting a bunch of math education video&#x27;s on my youtube channel using all the new features which I built just for that purpose.  I will be adding new features as I need them during the video creation process.  Most importantly, coming soon there is going to be a feature to export animations to mp4.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MathInspector&#x2F;MathInspector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MathInspector&#x2F;MathInspector</a>')
