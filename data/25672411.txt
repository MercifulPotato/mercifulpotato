I chose Golang for the project because it made it easy to cross-compile for Linux, Mac, Windows, and ARM (Raspberry Pi).<p>Golang has a great terminal package called tcell that made compatibility with a wide variety of terminals easier, and uchess will even run on a Linux TTY if you use a unicode compatible VT implementation like KMSCON.<p>The project has been a lot of fun, and I&#x27;m hoping to garner some community interest to see where we can take it.')
