(I know, I know. Touchy subject, but hear me out - and please accept that I&#x27;m not trying to attack gun owners here.)<p>In Australia, there are few enough guns that reasonably strict licensing for owning&#x2F;keeping&#x2F;selling guns _mostly_ works. We managed to restrict &quot;assault style&quot; weapons early enough to have been able to do it before the prevalence of semi automatic weapons made it impossible. Gun violence here is several orders of magnitude lower that in the US by any reasonable measure. Not zero, but rare enough that &quot;gunshots heard&quot; is still newsworthy here.<p>If the US decided to try and get to that - it&#x27;d be a multi generation process to change attitudes and perceptions, and then to remove all the weapons currently in circulation. I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s the political or social will to even consider starting that. Your solutions to gun violence are fundamentally going to be different to Australia&#x27;s.<p>(From my perspective, the news that my nieces regularly do &quot;active shooter lockdown training exercises&quot; in schools was inexplicable and horrifying. I kinda understand your historical &quot;right to bear arms&quot; - but I can&#x27;t bend my mind into understanding how that&#x27;s ended up at &quot;there&#x27;s nothing we can do about disgruntled teenagers getting hold of AK47s so we&#x27;ll just teach our children how to hide under school desks and not make any noise, hoping that &#x27;playing dead&#x27; will help them avoid getting shot&quot;. Not that I&#x27;m claiming too much moral high ground here, the most recent mass shooting in New Zealand was by an Australian. We have our fair share of fuckwits here too. Our main advantage is that most of those fuckwits do not have access to firearms when they fly into a murderous rage.)')
