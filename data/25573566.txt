GMail offered the most free space, by an order of magnitude over its competitors, and that&#x27;s the primary reason it succeeded in drawing users initially.<p>Email search wasn&#x27;t the draw initially, and wasn&#x27;t even all that much better; there was serious controversy over search, years later, as it was tied to ads that reflected the content of private communications.<p>Hotmail, Yahoo et al had reasonably good search for the time, but stiflingly little free space.
