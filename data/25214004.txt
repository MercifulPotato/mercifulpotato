As far as I can tell it is pure human interest fluff, it does not explain how the auction worked nor how this hack worked (understandable, since it&#x27;s probably impossible to describe to people who don&#x27;t understand the auction).<p>Here&#x27;s the entirety of their explanation:<p>&gt; SMITH: We&#x27;ve been using this metaphor of a superhighway in the sky. And you know how whenever someone wants to build a superhighway in the real world, there&#x27;s always some run-down farmhouse in the way that the government has to pay way too much money for? The private equity firms had essentially bought all these key farmhouses blocking the new spectrum highway.<p>&gt; ROMER: But the plan was not to stop the highway, to block the auction altogether. It was just to make it more expensive. Private equity and their consultants figured out which frequencies the FCC&#x27;s computers valued the most, the frequencies you really needed to make the whole reorganization work. Once you had those, you could drive up the prices for all the TV stations, which private equity happened to own a lot of.<p>What reorganization? That&#x27;s the first time it was mentioned. Why are some frequencies more valuable? (Or alternatively, why is it surprising and non-obvious that some are more valuable). Why would owning stations at these specific frequencies allow you to drive up the <i>other</i> prices?')
