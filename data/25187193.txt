I&#x27;ve been on the 747-400 for years (decades it feels like) and know a little about the cabin crew rest area for that model. Unlike the 787, the 747 crew rest has bunk beds and the flight crew rest is in the cockpit where the old engineer&#x27;s station used to be (who&#x27;s been replace by more advanced engine computers).<p>There is usually 2 business class seats reserved for flight crew. I had a memorable flight one Christmas where I was bumped but the captain gave up his rest seat for me (the spouse of one of the working cabin crew).<p>When it comes to airline union contracts any and everything is negotiable, so rest areas and crew seats may simply not exist if things continue the way they are going.')
