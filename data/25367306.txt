Websites are already liable for any illegal content they host if they don&#x27;t make a good-faith effort to have it removed quickly. Fake news isn&#x27;t illegal, this isn&#x27;t something that would be improved by rescinding section 230.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that all harmful content is illegal. I&#x27;m saying they can choose to spread baseless conspiracy theories when it benefits them with no legal consequence, but they can remove anything they like <i>because they don&#x27;t want to promote it</i> while calling it a baseless conspiracy theory, also with no consequence. This is an extremely influential position that is created by law and gives them extraordinary latitude at shaping perceptions.<p>&gt; This has no practical meaning because literally anything can be framed as political issue. For example, the efficacy of masks and vaccines.<p>Well those are political issues. I agree that &quot;literally anything&quot; can be framed as political, I don&#x27;t agree that my criticism lacks practical meaning as a result. We don&#x27;t like people discriminating on the basis of certain categories. I think political opinions are one of the categories. You may not, we can discuss this.<p>&gt; Protected classes are the few exceptions to the rule, the burden is on you to explain why politics should be added to the list.<p>Gladly. Its unfair for people to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, religion. Because we think that all of those are aspects of being human that people shouldn&#x27;t be punished for by refusal to hire or sell to. Political leanings are often matters of conscience, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or sex. Political freedom involves the freedom to hold unpopular opinions. Permitting someone to discriminate their provision of services on the basis of someone&#x27;s gay marriage is just as offensive as permitting them to discriminate on the basis of someone&#x27;s support for the legality of gay marriage.')
