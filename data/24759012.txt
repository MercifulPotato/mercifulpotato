Sometimes doing a full rebuilt takes more a while, so my process goes something like this:<p>1) build with &quot;-O0 -ggdb&quot;<p>2) In a debug session, notice that a variable I want to inspect has supposedly been optimized away. Get extremely frustrated.<p>3) Rebuild with every debug-friendly flag I can conceive of &quot;-O0 -ggdb -fno-inline -gdwarf-4 -fno-omit-frame-pointer ...&quot;<p>4) IIRC, step 3 usually (but not always?) addresses the issue.<p>But long story short, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever pinned down the minimal requirements for avoiding the issue. Usually when I encounter this, I have bigger issues to deal with.')
