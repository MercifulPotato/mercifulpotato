The worst numbers I&#x27;ve seen are a 50% increase in OD deaths, so we can probably expect the 2020 numbers to come in at 105,000 or less. There are 220,000 COVID-19 deaths nationwide in the US so far.<p>Horrible numbers eithier way, but there has NOT 4x the number of deaths from drug overdose in the US compared to COVID-19.')
