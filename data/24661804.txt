If you think about it, this doesn&#x27;t actually make much physical sense -- you can break a two-dimensional object into four pieces half its size, not two.</i><p>I&#x27;m looking at 2-dimensional objects on the table here, such as papers, and I just don&#x27;t see how that is true. For instance split an A4 paper in half: you get two A5 papers, not four. By definition the size of an A5 is exactly half of an A4&#x27;s size.<p>What am I missing?')
