Memory queries pull in 64 bytes of contiguous memory at a time (actually more with speculative prefetching). That extra data is used in a linear scan, but is mostly wasted when doing random access. You also have other bottlenecks with binary search, e.g. branch misprediction.<p>Yes, for large enough N, a BST easily beats linear search.')
