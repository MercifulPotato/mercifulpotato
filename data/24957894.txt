Item(by='bnralt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604217364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955422, text='&gt; Lots of people have never even heard of fellow dwarf planet Ceres, but it spent almost as long as a full fledged planet as Pluto.<p>Well, if the original IAU proposal for the definition of planet had gone through in 2006, not only would Pluto still be a planet but people would be made aware of new planets Ceres, Eris, and others. It also would have highlighted how there&#x27;s still much to discover in our solar system, since we wouldn&#x27;t be able to firmly say how many planets there were. The IAU ended up taking the conservative approach in choosing a definition, one that preserved an overly simplistic view of our solar system in people&#x27;s minds.<p>The value of the word &quot;planet&quot; is in signaling the importance of an object (IE, no one would care if these were called &quot;Celestial body class A&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Celestial body class B&quot;&#x2F;etc.). Saying &quot;rogue planets are not planets&quot; was a way of saying &quot;these things aren&#x27;t that important, you don&#x27;t have to worry about remembering them.&quot; The ignorance most people have about celestial bodies like Ceres suggests that it was effective.<p>Worth noting that a &quot;rogue planet&quot; isn&#x27;t defined in the adopted 2006 IAU definition of planet (which only deals with planets in our solar system, and relies on an orbit for its criteria).')
