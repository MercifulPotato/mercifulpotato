Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24746847], score=None, time=1602430964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746411, text='&gt; Literally no one can arrest him in this situation<p>Assuming the law is criminal, and applicable, city police probably can arrest him.<p>It seems quite probable, though, that the city does not have the authority to regulate county or state law enforcement tactics, so the law is simply invalid as applicable to him, which isn&#x27;t a “we have a sheriff as opposed to some other structure of county law enforcement” problem, but “we are trying to regulate the actions of higher levels of government” problem.<p>EDIT: Actually, looking at your story, it doesn&#x27;t look like there is any law at all—the Mayor of Portland made a <i>policy change</i> directed at his subordinates, which include the city police but not the  Multnomah County Sheriff&#x27;s Dpeartment. So no one can arrest anyone because there is no criminal law, except insofar a side of force inconsistent with city executive policy is covered by some criminal law applicable to Portland Police.')
