It seems like information theorists have many mental models of what is going on, and they just fluidly switch between their mental models without sweating. It makes for a frustrating read, to say the least.<p>------<p>Application wise: Vertibi ECC is used for earlier Wifi 802.11... while LDPC is newer like 802.11n or so. Really low level stuff, I&#x27;m curious about it but don&#x27;t really have an application in mind. Just found it curious that it&#x27;s technically a graph algorithm')
