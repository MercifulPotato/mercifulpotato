But this was not actually a post mortem. They still don&#x27;t know how it could happen. Essentially, how can they write &quot;We’re too tired to figure it out right now.&quot; and right after attempt to answer &quot;What have we learned? Why won’t this happen again?&quot; Well obviously you have not learned the key lesson yet since you don&#x27;t know what it is! And how can you even dream of claiming to guarantee that it won&#x27;t happen again before you know the root cause?<p>Get some sleep, do a thorough investigation, and the results of <i>that</i> are the post mortem that we would like published and where you learn from.<p>Publishing some premature thoughts without actual insight is not helping anybody. It will just invite the hate that you are seeing in this thread.')
