It&#x27;s part of the United States government, and nobody has ever tried to keep that secret.  Not RFA, not the U.S. Government.  Nobody.  &quot;Deep ties&quot; makes it seem like it&#x27;s trying to be covert.  It&#x27;s not.<p><i>It isnâ€™t really a credible source.</i><p>It&#x27;s one of the more credible sources of news in Asia.  Especially for more authoritarian countries.  I used to know a number of its journalists, and they strive for neutrality and factual reporting in places where that is not allowed.<p>It&#x27;s the Asian version of Radio Marti, or Radio Free Europe.  Funded by the U.S. taxpayers, run by the U.S. government, to bring information to the world.  There&#x27;s nothing new here. This has been going on longer than most of us have been alive.<p>It&#x27;s like BBC News, but without all of the sensationalism that has crept into the Beeb over the last couple of decades.<p>Trying to paint it as some kind of covert propaganda machine illustrates a lack of knowledge, or a personal political agenda.')
