Can you point me to a sustainable website with useful knowledge?<p>Almost all knowledge has been artificially fenced off in order to allow the elite to extract rents from it. Patents and copyrights monopolize vital production processes, and put it in the hands of knowledge Capitalists.<p><i>&quot;Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world&#x27;s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the  sciences? You&#x27;ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.&quot;</i> [1]<p>Wendy Liu adds:<p><i>&quot;Place Silicon Valley in its proper historical context and you see that, despite its mythology, it’s far from unique. Rather, it fits into a pattern of rapid technological change which has shaped recent centuries. In this case, advances in information technology have unleashed a wave of new capabilities. Just as the internal combustion engine and the growth of the railroads created Rockefeller, and the telecommunications boom created AT&amp;T, this breakthrough enabled a few well-placed corporations to reap the rewards. By capitalising on network effects, early mover advantage, and near-zero marginal costs of production, they have positioned themselves as gateways to information, giving them the power to extract rent from every transaction.<p>Undergirding this state of affairs is a set of intellectual property rights explicitly designed to favour corporations. This system — the flip side of globalisation — is propagated by various trade agreements and global institutions at the behest of the nation states who benefit from it the most. It’s no accident that Silicon Valley is a uniquely American phenomenon; not only does it owe its success to the United States’ exceptionally high defence spending — the source of its research funding and foundational technological breakthroughs — that very military might is itself what implicitly secures the intellectual property regime.<p>Seen in that light, tech’s recent development begins to look rather different. Far from launching a new era of global prosperity, it has facilitated the further concentration of wealth and power. By virtue of their position as digital middlemen, Silicon Valley companies are able to extract vast amounts of capital from all over the world. The most salient example is Apple: recently crowned the world’s most valuable company, Apple rakes in enormous quarterly profits even as the Chinese workers who actually assemble its products are driven to suicide.<p>Whereas we were once led to believe that the network society would produce an egalitarian world, we increasingly see tech as a machine for the commodification of information itself. Something that has the potential to be abundant is made artificially scarce, because capital finds it profitable to enclose the digital commons and dictate its terms of access. Facebook wants a monopoly over your social network so it can show you ads; Google is the internet’s directory; Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, and Apple Music are your tollbooths for cultural production; Amazon is the gateway for your retail needs. These corporations serve social functions integral to modern life, [...] yet, not only are they not publicly owned, they are immune to any sort of democratic control.&quot;</i> [2]<p>[1] Aaron Swartz, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;stream&#x2F;GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto&#x2F;Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;stream&#x2F;GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto&#x2F;Goamj...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tribunemag.co.uk&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;abolish-silicon-valley" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tribunemag.co.uk&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;abolish-silicon-valley</a>')
