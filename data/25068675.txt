AIUI there&#x27;s simply been flat-out more voters in the 2020 election on every side, so saying &quot;more X voters voted for trump&quot; might be technically provable today but not very useful.<p>Proportions are harder to pin down, as an accurate &quot;X%&quot; necessarily requires knowing the full set (or at least a random sample, and votes are being counted as they come in rather than in a random order).')
