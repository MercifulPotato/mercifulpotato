Pretty much any software infrastructure - from (SQL&#x2F;No-SQL&#x2F;In-Memory&#x2F;etc.-) databases to entire web-frameworks can be found as ready-to-go VM images and containers these days.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit more work to find and setup, but in the end you gain an understanding what system is actually doing, how it might behave and the ability to deploy into any environment - from local workstations to bare metal to (a fleet of) VMs to high-level hyper-scaler services.')
