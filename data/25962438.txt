Probably not.\nI know what I need to do, but I&#x27;m not going to remember which packages I need to install,\nor how they are configured, or if package x works with webpack4 or if I have to have Vue2 because a certain thing I want to use doesn&#x27;t support 3 yet etc.<p>There are so many moving parts now for an &#x27;app&#x27; that it is not feasible to keep it all in your head. Thats why there are so many starter-packages for things, because people forget what they did the first time around, so just create a new git repo with the skeleton to get going again ... only to be replaced in 6 months.<p>It was perl and flat file site counters when I started, and now I have to google how to make webpack work nicely :D')
