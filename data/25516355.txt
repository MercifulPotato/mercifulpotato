Including one that caused a new release just hours after the supposedly final one. Distros wait a bit longer before shipping an updated kernel and none of these hit actual users.<p>As far as I know there is no reason to abstain from using Btrfs. When Fedora talked about not using it, they had as reason that they had no in-house expertise.')
