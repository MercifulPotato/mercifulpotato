Item(by='lokedhs', descendants=None, kids=[24763010], score=None, time=1602555125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760602, text='I&#x27;ve had my bank call me, wanting to talk about something important (I think it was loan payment that didn&#x27;t go through or something of that sort) and the first thing they said was: &quot;This is Bank XYZ and I&#x27;m calling to inform you of something. But before we do that you have to prove your identity. Can you tell me what your account number is?&quot;<p>I said: &quot;I&#x27;d be happy to, but first can you prove your identity to me? After all, you&#x27;re the one that called me&quot;<p>What followed was a hilarious discussion where they were unable to prove anything to me (for example, telling me something about my account that only I would know) because they&#x27;re not allowed to tell anything to me until I proved who I am.<p>Finally I told them that I&#x27;d be happy to call them back and I asked them where I can find the number to call. I was obviously not going call a number the person would give me. They didn&#x27;t know how to find the number to the customer service, so I found it myself and called back.<p>When they answered, I explained the situation but obviously there was no way to actually get in touch with the person with whom I had spoken earlier, and the person that I did speak to didn&#x27;t know what the topic was. I asked them to call me back.<p>Well, they did eventually called me back, but what was the fist thing they asked after they did? &quot;We need you prove your identity, can you tell me XXXX?&quot;<p>They&#x27;ve stopped doing this now, and the mest recent thing they called me to inform me about something they just went to the point right away. I wonder if I&#x27;ve been flagged as someone who doesn&#x27;t need verification or if they changed their policy.')
