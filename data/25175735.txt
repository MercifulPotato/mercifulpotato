Seems like corporate newspeak to me. It&#x27;s the same idea as MVP - build just what you need to work, with a little better branding.<p>I think the author&#x27;s first illustration shows this pretty well. They show an MVP as constructing the whole semi part by part and the MLP as using a wheel barrow, then a truck, then a van, then the semi. Only, that second illustration is obviously what MVP means. Use the fastest thing you can build that does the job. That&#x27;s the wheel barrow until your load is too big. MVP and MLP actually mean the same thing - just people feel like &quot;lovable&quot; sounds better, when in reality it just obscures the meaning.<p>The author is right about one thing though. It matters what you&#x27;re doing. If you&#x27;re building a podcast app you&#x27;ve got to do a lot better than existing podcast apps to make anybody switch. You&#x27;ll need to be much more polished. If you&#x27;re making new you can be a lot rougher because people have no alternative. This isn&#x27;t really an argument against the MVP idea though, it&#x27;s more like the observation that UX has different importance for different products.<p>I would still suggest someone making a podcast app start with the MVP though and build that up until it was good enough to win users.')
