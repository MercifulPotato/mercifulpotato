You can accept donations. You can charge for support&#x2F;enhancement work, or for a managed service. You can also find a salaried job where your work is released under a Free and Open Source licence, such as Linux kernel development.<p>You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s famously difficult to monetise Free and Open Source software, but there are a few examples of it happening.<p>&gt; the original idea of open source: that it was the cool things you could build with code, not the code itself, that had value.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing your point here, but as far as I know, there&#x27;s nothing in the Open Source or Free Software movements that ever viewed FOSS primarily as the basis for interesting proprietary software.<p>&gt; They&#x27;ve built things on FOSS code that never existed before, and most of them have contributed a lot of FOSS code back. But they haven&#x27;t sold databases, reverse proxies, and key&#x2F;value stores, right?<p>Red Hat might be the clearest counterexample here. If I understand correctly, their charge for their official builds, which I suppose is a way of charging for support.<p>You&#x27;re right though that many of them go with a service model and don&#x27;t publish the code. Amazon Aurora, for instance, or Google App Engine.')
