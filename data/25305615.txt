Item(by='cactus2093', descendants=None, kids=[25305675], score=None, time=1607105163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304889, text='The biggest thing you&#x27;re ignoring is that Prop 22 brings real, tangible benefits to workers compared to what they have today. It has companies pay I believe 41% of their healthcare costs, whereas previously this was 0%. And it includes the 120% of minimum wage provision, on top of vehicle maintenance costs. This is real money that real drivers and couriers will be &quot;topped up&quot; in certain cases, that they simply weren&#x27;t being paid before.<p>The choices were 1. the previous system where drivers were purely contractors, 2. the AB5 world where the vast majority of them can&#x27;t work at all anymore but the ones that remain are full-time employees, without the flexibility that attracted many of them to this work in the first place as opposed to, say, getting a job at a traditional taxi company, or 3. a compromise where the work stays fundamentally the same but pays more in many cases.<p>Most of the people I saw opposing prop 22, which I&#x27;m guessing includes the above commenter, and certainly included the legislator behind AB5, were just bystanders who viewed it as yet another a philosophical showdown of unionized full-time work vs anything goes exploitation. Even though that framework is a poor fit for the details of this particular situation.<p>The people with skin in the game saw it differently, the details actually mattered to them and they voted accordingly.<p>&gt; overturning its provisions needs a 7&#x2F;8 majority in the state legislature.<p>Given that prop 22 overturns a law that had recently been passed by the current sitting legislature, there wouldn&#x27;t have been any point to doing it if it could just be immediately repealed by the same people. Prop 22 can be still be overturned with just a &gt;50% vote by a future ballot proposition.')
