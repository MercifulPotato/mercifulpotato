And I think this hits a really nice middle ground that works for different types of people.<p>Personally I am very fast at reading&#x2F;writing, and I focus better and understand better when reading, so I skip most of the videos and calls and just read them instead. But for some people they really enjoy the video side of things, and that&#x27;s cool too. Most of our meetings&#x2F;calls are optional and it works well to cater to both types of people. Our source of truth is ultimately what&#x27;s written down (i.e. in an issue) and how we get to that point is flexible.<p>I really like it.')
