Item(by='kurthr', descendants=None, kids=[25702832], score=None, time=1610215754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702465, text='I see your position, and I agree that the problem is more complex than just pesticides are bad, but it&#x27;s also more complex than saving sugar beets. If this were an invasive species (like murder hornets or malarial mosquitos) problem that could be stopped before it started or a temporary measure to prevent life and death (rather than wealth accumulation) for a significant number of people, I&#x27;d have more sympathy.<p>Application to sugar beets is expected to increase crop yields 13% on a non-critical crop, for a commodity (sugar) that can be easily imported. The virus problem won&#x27;t ever go away. So this just sounds like subsidizing a particular local agricultural industry, because it&#x27;s having a hard time competing right now. Will that ever change, why not choose bees or wildflowers over sugar beet farmers? Is it just because they can pay for lobbyists or positive news coverage?<p>Furthermore, it sounds an awful lot like the massive use of (the most advanced) anti-biotics in cattle feed lots to increase meat yield. That builds up immunity so that those last line of defense drugs are no longer useful to treat humans with deadly diseases. The key here is that there will be a state of permanent emergency where some new poison is always needed to keep profits at their previous artificially high level.<p>If the local industry can&#x27;t compete, and it&#x27;s not necessary other than for a small group&#x27;s continued profit, maybe it&#x27;s time to move on. The alternative is a possibly long term loss of pollinators (because the insecticide goes down streams) and the development of stronger&#x2F;larger reservoirs of mites, moths, molds that could permanently affect all pollinators in England.')
