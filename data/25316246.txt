The 100 Million miles that a human driver will have to drive on average to die in a crash will be pushed to a billion miles+ before L5 is achieved, effectively moving the goal post further.<p>Ultimately self driving technology has to be better not than a human, but than human intervention. It has to be so good that it recognizes when a human incorrectly intervenes to override L4 decisions and then be able to override that human&#x27;s overriding. Only then will autonomous vehicles overtake humans.')
