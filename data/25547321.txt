That&#x27;s hardly a fair argument to bring to the discussion.<p>&gt; <i>How about QNX then?</i><p>QNX wouldn&#x27;t run on something with &lt;1MB RAM. Nothing POSIX compliant would* . The published minimum requirements for Neutrino 6.5 (which is already 10 years old) was 512MB. Double that if you want the recommended hardware specification.<p>Sure, if you want to strip out graphics libraries and all the other stuff and just run it as a hypervisor for your own code you could get those hardware requirements right down. But then you&#x27;re not left with something POSIX compliant, not even useful for the N64. And frankly you could still get a smaller footprint by rolling your own.<p>The selling point of QNX is a RT kernel, security by design and a common base for a variety of industry hardware. But if you&#x27;re writing something for the N64 then none of those concerns are relevant (and my earlier point about a resident OS for the N64 being redundant is still equally valid for QNX).<p>Also smart phones are neither embedded nor &quot;constrained&quot; devices. I have no idea what the computing hardware is like in your average car but I&#x27;d wager it varies massively by manufacturer and model. I&#x27;d also wager QNX isn&#x27;t installed on every make and model of car either.<p>* I should caveat that by saying, yes it&#x27;s possible to write something partially POSIX compliant which could target really small devices. There might even be a &quot;UNIX&quot; for the C64. But it&#x27;s a technical exercise, like this N64 port of Linux. It&#x27;s not a practical usable OS. Which is the real crux of what we&#x27;re getting at.')
