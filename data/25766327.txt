I think that&#x27;s the best of both worlds and utilizes the low-latency environment of a classroom best, while still capturing the in-person benefits you mentioned.<p>Unfortunately, class time is generally largely spent observing lecture, and the real meat of the learning is generally spent alone in a high latency environment (with feedback available via email or forums). I don&#x27;t like going to class just to watch a video, and going home just to do problems out of a book (by myself), and that has been my experience so far.')
