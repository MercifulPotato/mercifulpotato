The sociopath won&#x27;t acknowledge their own state, so will blame others, also knowingly and silently for personal gain.<p>The remedy is radical honesty and working with oneself. Nobody else can do the work for someone, but breaking the patterns can be inspiring.<p>Don&#x27;t let authority gain undue power over your lives. Some day you will regret it.')
