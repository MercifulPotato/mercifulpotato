They don&#x27;t burn the fuel to make the clothing, rather the opposite: this can now no longer be burned and turned into CO2 because it&#x27;s on your body.<p>Is it somehow pollutive to make oil products even if you don&#x27;t burn them? And I mean more so than the alternative of course, because I get that so much as pumping up the oil costs energy.<p>If it&#x27;s just about the irony of wearing the biggest problem we&#x27;re facing as a garment and not a real question then I see the point.')
