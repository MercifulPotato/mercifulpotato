I&#x27;ve been to many parks in the U.S and Canada.  I don&#x27;t have a favorite.  My favorite usually winds up the park that I last visited.  So, currently that would be the rainforest, beaches and mountains of the Olympic peninsula in Washington.  Camping inside the parks makes a big difference.  Backpacking, even more so.<p>One park that I visited on a whim was Capitol Reef, in Utah.  My plans for several days backcountry camping in Zion fell through because of snow fall late in season.  I had to improvise.  Hikers are some of the most friendly people and love sharing knowledge on the trail.  One suggested I check out Capitol Reef.  What a gem!  It was far less crowded than Zion and absolutely gorgeous.<p>See the parks!  Camp there!  You&#x27;ll need to plan 6 months in advance for permits to the most popular destinations.')
