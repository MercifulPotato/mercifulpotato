The programing analogy might be cyclomatic complexity and separation of concerns. Examples abound of functions with overloaded conditionals, long parameter lists and other smells that might it difficult to reason about the operation of such a function. On the other-hand, you do see the overzealous craft trivial functions that should just be inlined in the few places they are used.<p>Clarity, for both prose and code, involves finding the right tradeoffs and abstraction boundaries.')
