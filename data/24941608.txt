Depending on what the code does it&#x27;s not impossible, and sometimes WASM even comes out smaller, but this takes a lot of optimization and tweaking, and often developers are blind to this sort of problem (it mostly affects the users after all).<p>One cannot simply hand-wave those points away just because Javascript sucks (even ignoring the fact that JS hate is often completely irrational, I don&#x27;t like the language either, but sheesh, C++ or Rust are not <i>that</i> much better).')
