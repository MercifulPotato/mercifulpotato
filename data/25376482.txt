It was a frustrating experience and my initial impulse was to vent about that. But I&#x27;m choosing not to do that mainly because it seemed at the time that every person that I dealt with at NWS was trying to do the best they could.<p>The situation that NWS is facing is basically that massive tax cuts coupled with growth in defense and social programs has left most other areas of the federal government hollowed out. The amount of money needed to fix the problem being discussed here is minimal but after decades of budget cuts across non-defense and non social-welfare programs there is simply little left to invest in improving services.')
