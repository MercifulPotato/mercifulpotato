Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610895163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807915, text='&gt; There&#x27;s both the clear vision of conservative values and ideals... and Donald Trump.<p>I&#x27;ve lived long enough to see the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; morph <i>multiple</i> times. (You will too eventually, just watch carefully.) They&#x27;ve long since lost any connection to their origin in classical European political philosophy and have now become merely placeholders to give the pretense that the two major US political parties have some kind of consistent ideological (as opposed to financial) backing, which they don&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s a certain irony in Barry Goldwater being credited with launching the modern &quot;conservative&quot; movement in the US when Goldwater himself could be considered much more &quot;libertarian&quot; and was opposed to the policies and increasing influence of &quot;conservative Christians&quot; such as Pat Robertson.<p>Scratch either of the two parties and underneath you&#x27;ll see a very loose coalition of differing, sometimes opposing interests, not a clear set of consistent, unwavering beliefs. It&#x27;s an ongoing power struggle, and the political labels just reflect the currently dominant group in the power struggle.')
