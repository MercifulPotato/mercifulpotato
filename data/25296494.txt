In fact there are quite possibly a ridiculous number of steps in hiring an employee on visa.<p>What is alleged in the lawsuit seems purely self preservation, if FB doesn&#x27;t jump through the hoops of getting PERM certified for the employee, they are going to leave and go to another company which does that.
