I know that checking a proof almost always is a lot simpler than creating it (and certainly never harder), but when a programmer annotates a function, they don’t provide a proof that the property holds, they just make an assertion that the it holds, and the compiler has to check it.<p>If the compiler can do such a check, and the number of possible annotations is finite, it can check each of them, thus computing the set of annotations that the function adheres to.')
