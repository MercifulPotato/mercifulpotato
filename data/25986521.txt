It&#x27;s a tool to increase deflation by giving companies money and thus invest into expanding their production capacity to the maximum. But companies aren&#x27;t stupid. They know when they produced exactly as much as they can sell so they don&#x27;t borrow more money than they really need. The end result is that prices don&#x27;t change or they drop very slowly because the supply of goods is always high enough. The end result is slow and creeping deflation that is difficult to see. Once companies are well capitalized the excess money is then spent on random crap like stocks or housing without providing any additional value and it massively increases inequality because most people don&#x27;t own any assets. A lot of basically dead zombie companies can easily coast on the value of their stock without doing anything productive.<p>Inflation is good for workers because it makes business owners sweat. When demand for consumer goods grows beyond supply the price of consumer goods increases and that increases the profit margin for productive businesses who then start doing economically valuable work by employing people. Unemployment keeps dropping until companies have to compete for workers by offering higher salaries. Interest rates catch up with inflation and make it harder and harder to capitalize your business, meaning only the most productive companies with the most productive investments actually get to borrow money instead of throwing it into random nonsense like stocks because they ran out of ideas.')
