Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=[24680151, 24672501], score=None, time=1601731556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670642, text='<i>Composted</i> manure has value and no objectionable smell.<p><i>Fresh from the horse</i> hot solids have the opposite of both of those qualities.<p>It takes time and biological action to turn the second into the first. The manure pile bears little resemblance to what comes out of the bag you buy at the home center or farm store.<p>Of course, I have zero sympathy for folks who move in next to a horse farm or near an airport and are somehow shocked (more likely feigning shock) to learn that horses and airplanes do horse and airplane things there.')
