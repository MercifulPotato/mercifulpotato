You&#x27;d still get email (receipt?) and other bits from PayPal after the transaction was done.<p>Now though, the CC processing on Ebay seems to be a non-PayPal version.  At least, that&#x27;s what it looked like today when getting stuff.  No mention of PayPal anywhere, which I was pleased with having had a very bad experience with them (PayPal) a week ago.')
