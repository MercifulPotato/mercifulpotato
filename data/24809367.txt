It is a simple measure of WEIRD[1] psychological tendencies. Not &quot;authoritarianism.&quot;<p>[0] better reference: referring to Nazi nudist societies <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freik%C3%B6rperkultur#Naturism_between_World_War_I_and_World_War_II" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freik%C3%B6rperkultur#Naturism...</a><p>[1] again: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;joseph-henrich-weird-people&#x2F;615496&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;joseph-...</a>')
