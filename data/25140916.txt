With a corporate mapper you either hit a wall of misunderstanding due to limited English and, excepting English, no map-local language skills, and any time you invest in that mapper is limited in effect, because retention at such jobs seems low.<p>Some companies do listen when you provide feedback, and others just have some community managerÂ¹ who doesn&#x27;t really know anything at a deeper technical level handling all the communication with OSM&#x27;s volunteer corps of mappers.<p>There is a company in Minsk that is doing edits worldwide based on the output of a set of slightly outdated linters, and it&#x27;s disappointing to see that they could get much better feedback and linter input by listening to the remarks made by us volunteers, but that would require the attention of one of the few employees with in-depth knowledge, which they haven&#x27;t planned for.<p>1: Another gem of inappropriateness was trying to communicate with the Dutch OSM community via Google Translate mangled Dutch. (The vast majority of us can manage English quite well, thank you.)')
