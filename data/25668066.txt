We&#x27;re a YC-backed startup university based in San Francisco.<p>I&#x27;m currently leading an R&amp;D initiative to bring more of our content to an online friendly format as we gear up to launch an online Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Applied Computer Science. We&#x27;re aiming to hit a content quality on par with Vox &#x2F; Masterclass.<p>Our eventual goal is to properly unbundle a university degree into a more modular and modern education format that aligns with how students and professionals learn today. Instead of traditional classrooms, students will go through self-paced high quality videos paired with active learning exercises and projects and significant 1:1 and small group instructor support.<p>I&#x27;ve just built out a video studio at our SF campus to enable rapid development of high quality educational content using BMPCC 4k cameras and an ATEM Mini switcher w&#x2F; iPad and laptop inputs. You can check out some of our early videos here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vmcA6BlSqw0&amp;list=PLZ_SI6zSFXvCKmO5TDqm3aAl16irCJVJ_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vmcA6BlSqw0&amp;list=PLZ_SI6zSFX...</a><p>I&#x27;m looking to work with a strong video editor to take the content to the next level with cutscenes, animations, and more. We&#x27;ll be working in DaVinci Resolve to stay in the blackmagic ecosystem. Our R&amp;D team will be full remote, so you can be anywhere in the world.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, shoot me an email (ashu@makeschool.com) with:\n- Your portfolio\n- Your usual contracting rate<p>Cheers,\nAshu')
