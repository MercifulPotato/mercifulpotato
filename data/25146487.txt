Someone recommended I try psilocybin mushrooms. I learned how to grow them, grew them and then had my wife help facilitate a safe well-intentioned trip using 7g of dried mushrooms. Happy to answer any questions about it. It was a profound experience. It isn&#x27;t a cure but it&#x27;s certainly a tool in my toolbox that has helped reshaped my life in a real and lasting way.')
