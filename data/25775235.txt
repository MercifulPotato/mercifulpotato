That it&#x27;s a choice?<p>That said, I was once a single page app skeptic but I now think React and Vue are great alternatives to HTML&#x2F;templates that compile to HTML if you have a reasonably complex front end. Pre-React and Vue, in the Angular.js&#x2F;Ember.js&#x2F;Backbone era, SPAs were not in a stage of maturity that made it simple or optimal to use them as a primary front end. Today I&#x27;d say for a complex FE go ahead with React or Vue, if you have a very simple FE, definitely consider HTML&#x2F;template-to-HTML as a serious option.')
