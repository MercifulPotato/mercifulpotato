Uniswap is an example system that should be implemented in Bitcoin as well over time, as it brings transparency to trading and asset ownership. It doesn&#x27;t need turing completeness (so gas is not required), though as it needs state management, I think it&#x27;s important to be able to account for the cost of UTXO created.')
