Wednesday used to be the day I had college while working four days a week but when I quit college it just became my day off. I find that it works quite well for me while most of my colleagues seem to prefer having a three day weekend with either Friday or Monday being their day off.<p>I suppose there&#x27;s pros and cons to either approach (which I haven&#x27;t really researched at all yet) but to me right now breaking up a continuous stream of work days makes total sense (while still fitting for the 9-5 custom, which I, like many people, don&#x27;t prefer but I haven&#x27;t had any better opportunities yet).')
