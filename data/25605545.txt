I think the US has gone about as far as it can go with crowbarring healthcare into an insurance model. Moving from Canada to the states as an adult I can sincerely tell you that healthcare here is an utterly terrible experience on every level, from check-ups to clinic visits to overnight emergency room stays. At a certain point it becomes more ideological <i>not</i> to have socialized healthcare. And that point was passed long, long ago. Twisting a few dials &amp; pulling some levers on a machine that is fundamentally profiting off of people being sick will just never cut it. Nothing can overcome that underlying incentive.')
