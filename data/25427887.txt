Software isn&#x27;t trustable. Any companies that still claim to have security&#x2F;privacy is lying if they don&#x27;t offer a publicly auditable mechanism. This includes Apple and Google. They&#x27;re both lying to our faces.<p>Something similar happened to me but with the iPhone lock screen a few days ago. The camera and microphone indicator was on when I was unlocking it. There&#x27;s no face ID enabled on my phone. It was in my pocket. There&#x27;s something fishy going on. Then there&#x27;s siri turning on at random times despite me not saying the wake word.')
