They vaguely describe what I would call intersectionalism, but they take such a reductionist approach that it really misses the point. They call it a bunch of &quot;categories&quot;, which is pretty misleading, in my opinion. They also are pretty harsh with how they describe those categories meshing into local communities, missing the forest for the trees in how intersectionalism is a micro view and communities are the macro.<p>On economics, I agree with the author that it&#x27;s very difficult to start a family in America right now. They&#x27;re mostly on the money about the unions and wage problems, but they again betray their underlying opinions by lumping Democrats in with Republicans on this issue where they honestly might be the most different.<p>I would agree with the author about the &quot;knowledge economy&quot; not working out like we thought, though I&#x27;d attribute that to skyrocketing education costs and other educational system issues, not wage issues. One could argue better wages would help, though. I would accept that.<p>I think the author betrays their own opinions several times in this article. They&#x27;re scathingly critical of the left, but paint the right as essentially just victims of the above mentioned &quot;categories&quot; that have sprung up.<p>Democrats are not blameless, and I&#x27;m first in line to be critical of the politicians I have voted for, but Republicans are also not innocent victims.')
