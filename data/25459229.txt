The usual compromise is to rename phenomena that were named after them, not name any new things after them, and let their name drift into history. The history of the field is there for anyone who wants it, but it is just that - history. They are not venerated going forward.<p>If you want to make the case that this field should be forced to bear von Braun&#x27;s name as a stain, I guess that&#x27;s a somewhat interesting idea but I think it would have the effect of improving von Braun&#x27;s legacy rather than forcing spaceflight to reckon with its past.')
