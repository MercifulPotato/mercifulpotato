Item(by='Nursie', descendants=None, kids=[25841805], score=None, time=1611102659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840068, text='I fundamentally disagree that placing some limits on speech is necessarily destructive to democracy or implies the removal of power from the people, particularly as the people have the power to elect those that could change such a policy.<p>Yelling &#x27;fire&#x27; in a crowded theatre is not protected speech, yet we don&#x27;t challenge the democratic credentials of a nation that prevents that, nor is such a rule considered beyond the reach of democratic governments to change or alter, it is not an untouchable decree handed down by a group of bien pensants. Nor do we say such things about criminalisation of incitement to violence. Perhaps something in this mode of thinking is more appropriate.<p>And I&#x27;m also going to have to say again - <i>this is not something I&#x27;m proposing as a solution. I am not even proposing a solution</i><p>I am identifying a failure mode in the sort of absolute free speech idealism that is common and particularly in the &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; concept. I don&#x27;t know how to fix it but it is clear that it is a threat to democratic principles in and of itself in the face of mass communications. And I disagree that taking steps to address it would <i>necessarily</i> be undemocratic, depending on what those steps are.<p>By your A and B premises, Germany is undemocratic, even though their rules on holocaust denial could be democratically removed were there the will to do so.')
