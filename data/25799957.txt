This part isn&#x27;t new, but updates require a reboot almost monthly. Compared to Linux and macOS that&#x27;s obnoxious--especially combined with coercing those reboots to happen.<p>I&#x27;ve found the &quot;news&quot; and ads added to Windows very user hostile. As with telemetry. Any attempts to disable them soon get backed out via an update. Similarly with Edge harassing you to &quot;try it again&quot; &quot;are you sure you don&#x27;t want to change your default browser?&quot;')
