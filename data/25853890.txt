The vast majority of DNM transactions are in bitcoin (yes, I know WHM is trying to change this).. Same goes for huge card shops like jstash, which tend to only accept bitcoin. On various crime forums like exploit.in and verified.sc bitcoin is definitely the currency of choice. Most ransomware payments are in bitcoin too, even if a few have tried asking for monero recently.<p>It&#x27;s very strange to see someone choose to come up with lies like this.
