Give me a proper server box and a well-written application, and I&#x27;ll deliver the 25k rps that you want.<p>Besides, most webapps spend most of their execution time waiting for the database, memcached, redis, elasticsearch, or whatever. The speed of the language runtime makes very little difference.')
