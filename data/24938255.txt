There&#x27;s little investigative journalism, no interviews with backing sources, no new facts laid out, just complaining about supposed wrong-doings and coverups. Some of which can be easily refuted.<p>Look I don&#x27;t read The Intercept, but this is not newsroom material. I&#x27;m not journalist or have any kind of editing experience, but I wouldn&#x27;t even run this in a school newspaper if I was put in charge. This is editorial material, pure and simple. The fact that he&#x27;s complaining about censorship is eye-rolling.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that most people here don&#x27;t understand that the op-ed page and newsroom are different organizations, run by different people, and have different standards, even though they appear on the same newspaper. it&#x27;s scary that these lines are being blurred more and more by the day.<p>But honestly, what&#x27;s really probably going on is that Glenn Greenwald is tired of The Intercept and wants move full-time to his substack page. To do that he&#x27;s bootstrapping his audience on his new site by manufacturing outrage. I would think most people should see through this...')
