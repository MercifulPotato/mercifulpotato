See the appendix on the posted documents for his actual statement (about 20% into the 170 page PDF <i>that has random page numbering</i>).<p>BA Colorado College, PHD Rutgers, post-grad work at Wisconsin in applied economics and econometrics.  His career is in economics and environmental studies. Well-educated, but not in statistics.<p>He spent 3 years in the 1980s at the Kennedy School doing energy and environmental policy.  This is all in his statement filed by Texas.<p>He states that there is no reason more people would vote for Biden in 2020 vs voting for Clinton in 2016, so it must be rigged.<p>He states that the votes tabulated late at night can&#x27;t have been from the same sample of voters as the votes tabulated earlier in the evening, so it must be rigged.<p>His argument is that an election is identical to a giant bag with millions of balls, some of which are red and some are blue.  Each vote is nothing more than pulling one of the balls out of the bag and looking at the color.  The proportion of red balls to blue balls was determined in the 2016 election, and the 2020 election should have the same proportion but more balls.<p>It&#x27;s completely wrong.')
