Rather I think Airbnb enabled previously unwilling (or unmotivated) people to start hosting others for a cost.<p>The type of people I would meet were from a different cut of cloth than Airbnb folks. One picked up my friend and I from a Megabus stop and later we ended up going to our host&#x27;s second home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. One let us try out his expensive cycling bike out for a bike ride. I&#x27;ve attended a yoga session with my Couchsurfing host before on a trip. When I hosted, I took my guest (a cadet at West Point who hadn&#x27;t had drinks in forever) on a spontaneous bar hop with my group if friends.<p>There was always a mentality of paying a good experience forward and a sense of community - which is tough to preserve when it becomes a transactional experience.<p>That being said, I agree Airbnb likely led to the downfall of the CS community. There were some sketchy ppl in that world. After running into one of those, I slowly found myself preferring to pay for the security and safety although deep down I knew I was going to miss out on all the fun that I couldn&#x27;t simply pay for. As for hosting, I just wasn&#x27;t interested anymore knowing that if someone were paying to crash at my place, it would be less about hanging out or getting recs but more about just needing a reliable roof to cover... where&#x27;s the fun in that for a host?')
