God forbid anyone have an opinion that isn&#x27;t progressive through and through.<p>Just to be clear… I don&#x27;t like Trump, and didn&#x27;t vote for him. Being a conservative does <i>NOT</i> mean you&#x27;re a Trump fan.<p>But here&#x27;s the real issue… if you&#x27;re not someone progressive (or on the hard left) the <i>VAST</i> majority of people will not even converse with you. Game over. Discourse is dead, if you don&#x27;t fall between the lines.<p>You don&#x27;t have an acceptable thought, your viewpoints are not welcome here.<p>Every conservative I&#x27;ve talked to has been willing to discuss and differ and disagree, and peacefully coexist with those with whom they have differences with.<p>The left? My experience has been that they will scream in your face. Your opinion does not matter unless you agree with them completely.<p>You get shouted down.<p>You get fired from your job.<p>You get branded as a racist.<p>JUST BECAUSE YOU&#x27;RE CONSERVATIVE.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder people are afraid to express themselves.<p>&lt;edited to remove the profanity&gt;')
