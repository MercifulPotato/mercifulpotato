Aliens, new age beliefs, flat Earth, reptile conspiracies, etc. are fringe beliefs in our current society, and are recognized to be fringe beliefs.<p>Religion and belief in witches, in the societies you are referring to that had those beliefs, were <i>not</i> fringe beliefs; they were mainstream. The people who were believed to be on the fringe in those societies--the people who were viewed in those societies the way we today view, say, flat Earthers--were people who did <i>not</i> believe in the mainstream religion and all of its claims. For example, in Salem, Massachusetts in 1695, people who said witches did <i>not</i> exist were the ones who were believed to be on the fringe.<p>So the problem is not that individual people can have fringe beliefs. The problem is that <i>an entire society of people</i>, minus a few outliers, can have, and act on, beliefs that are later shown, beyond any reasonable doubt, to be not just wrong, but delusional. So the question we should all be asking ourselves is not, what is wrong with today&#x27;s flat Earthers, but which of the <i>mainstream</i> beliefs we have today will end up being like the belief in witches in 1695?')
