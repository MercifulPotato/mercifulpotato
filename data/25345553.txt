The vaccine was approved hastily and without addressing this concern - it is not “a known side effect of dengue immunity” but a side effect of prior infection, avoiding which was the whole point of the vaccine.<p>There is no reason to believe that SarsCOV2 infection has a similar problem (ADE) or causes a similar long term issue - but it is too new to be sure. And if it does have an ADE issue (or similar) it is possible the vaccine will trigger it like the virus (as happened with this particular dengue vaccine, but which can potentially not be an issue with a different vaccine)<p>And it’s also possible that the antibodies matching the protein chosen will attack another similar protein in the body with some people - and will cause an autoimmune condition. It is unlikely, but possible.<p>That’s why vaccine safety profiles are usually tested for years before approval for general population. These vaccines have had exactly 2 months wide scale safety evaluation.<p>I am very hopeful they will turn out safe; but our knowledge of their safety profile is very far from our usual level at the time vaccines are approved, especially with respect to long term safety.')
