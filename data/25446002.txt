Then they&#x27;ll claim that this is all to prevent global warming.<p>All this is actually starting to make me doubt global warming. The banks certainly never gave a damn about global warming before. Do I think that people in power suddenly became more altruistic over the past few years? No, from my experience, they became much more selfish! The whole timing with Greta Thunberg media hype followed by COVID19 then multi-trillion dollar bailouts followed by talks of &#x27;green new deals&#x27; and the great reset (which is actually just a continuation of existing policies; not a reset by any definition of the word) is starting to all look a bit too convenient.<p>I&#x27;ve seen first hand how money can corrupt everything. So I&#x27;m wondering if it is the science which is attracting the money or the money which is attracting the &#x27;science&#x27;. All the climate models are oversimplified and phony; it&#x27;s pseudoscience... They have tens of thousands of different models and each year they cherry-pick the ones which guessed correctly... Then they keep switching to newer models which keeps proving them right claiming that they did so to keep up with technology (of course not because they were running out of correct old models to cherry pick from)... It&#x27;s a joke.')
