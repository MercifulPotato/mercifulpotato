I&#x27;m not trying to argue about which system is better, I&#x27;m just saying that the comment I&#x27;m replying to is saying incorrect things about GPU performance. I&#x27;ll answer your question anyway though:<p>You could build a complete desktop system including a GPU that&#x27;s more powerful than the one in the M1 for ~$1000, but certainly not a 3080. They&#x27;re very expensive, and nobody has any in stock anyway.<p>An RX 580 or 1660 would probably be the right GPU with that budget. (Although you could go with something more powerful and skimp out on CPU and ram if you <i>only</i> cared about gaming performance).')
