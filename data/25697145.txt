We&#x27;re at a point wherein either side winning the presidency is just riling up the other side. Biden literally represents only his 55% of voters and Trump his 45% and when one side ones the other strictly loses, there&#x27;s no feeling of compromise anymore. This is going to end in one side subjugating the other, and the right is arguing right now that&#x27;s exactly what the left is doing to them through the means that you mentioned in your post. I think, eventually they&#x27;ll respond to their perceived subjugation and the recent riot was just the peak of an iceberg.<p>They don&#x27;t want to live a certain way but politics in general has been increasingly moving towards a national level, away from local politics. I can understand the right&#x27;s belief that big city liberals are forcing left-wing values onto them because the left has expressed the same opinion about the right forcing values onto the left. The sentiment is mutual. And to some degree both sides are correct, there are definitely value systems that are forced from the top down (government), some may be good and some may be bad but that also depends on who you ask. And in the end neither side is happy.<p>Now obviously, tech companies are in their right to ban whoever they want for whatever they want. That&#x27;s how the US operates even though I don&#x27;t like it, and the right was happy to give businesses that power. But at a societal level it&#x27;s clear we have an America with more than one identity and it&#x27;s acting like a dysfunctional mental illness because we&#x27;re forcing people together that don&#x27;t want to be together. If the middle east is any indication that&#x27;s a recipe for inevitable conflict.')
