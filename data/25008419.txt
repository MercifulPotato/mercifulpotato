But enthusiasts are known to pay premium for their hobbies. Recently I watched a video about someone driving one of the original Benz &quot;cars&quot; in Germany, really, a 100 years old carriage with a single-piston engine - which is all fine, except that the engine runs on Ether Petroleum, which is only still produced for medical reasons.....so any time they want to pull it out of storage, they literally just buy several bottles out of a pharmacy.<p>Hell, as I mentioned in another comment - if you live in UK and are willing pay premium(like Â£5&#x2F;litre) for it, you can still purchase leaded petrol for your classic vehicle which you stubbornly refuse to convert to regular unleaded because &quot;collector value&quot; is a thing.')
