To the point that there literally is a private company that built a high speed link between Orlando and Miami.<p>As for the experience of driving to a train station, that&#x27;s compounded x times by going to an airport.<p>But in the end the lack of use stems more from discomfort, than anything else. Having high speed connection from Poughkeepsie&#x2F;Albany to NYC would open up Hudson Valley to commuters decades ago, not a boom of Zoomtowns today (Kingston, NY, Beacon, NY)<p>The overall infrastructure is crap in US and that is the primary reason for poor use of it. (I mean, FFS, old Tappan Zee Bridge didn&#x27;t even have pedestrian walkway! While being the only available crossing for miles)')
