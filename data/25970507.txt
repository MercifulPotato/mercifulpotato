It would be a disaster for Germany, to have Poland as enemy right now and have them doing military exercises together with Russia some km from the Germany&#x2F;Poland border. Yes, Poland has a strong aversion to Russia, but being kicked out from EU, would force them to search for new partners, and Poland, together with Belarus, would open a tunnel from Moscow to Berlin. Germany dont want it. Russia would do everything to have it.<p>Another point is that a  lot of sectors in Germany depends heavily on Polish workforce, specially in the border region like Brandenburg, Saxony and Mecklenburg Vorpommern.<p>&gt; The EU states are too diverse right now in terms of \n&gt; values and economy. Hard to effectively lead such a bunch.<p>ThatÂ´s exactly one of the main complains from Hungary and Poland, regarding migration. A diverse country in terms of values is hard to lead. So in that matters you are pretty well aligned with them.')
