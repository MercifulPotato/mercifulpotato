Homeless often do walk into recycling centers in cities where there is no redemption value, but they are lucky to get $.01&#x2F;can when selling by weight.<p>Recycling centers are common if you know where to look - the ugly side of town is an ideal place for them (both because they are by nature messy, and because competition means they can&#x27;t afford are more expensive area). Many small towns have a place to recycle (most small town industry has enough metal waste to make it worth recycling, so there is demand)<p>Though in Iowa the way the redemption works is any store that sells it must take it back. I don&#x27;t know how redemption centers work, because we don&#x27;t have them, instead every supermarket takes their cans back. This ends up being a war on generic soda: coke&#x2F;pepsi you can take anywhere, but stores will reject the other-store brand cans making them a hassle to sort.')
