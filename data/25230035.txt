I&#x27;m really wondering if stress played a bigger factor in their blood glucose levels, which has been observed to cause a release of glucose from organs into the blood. In this study participants played video games for 90 minutes after drinking the test beverage. I think playing video games can be very stressful for a lot of people, they also switched games every 15minutes. Participants also knew that the beverage might contain sugar, which if your a type 2 diabetic might be enough to cause stress(?). In figure 4 they show the effect on the blood glucose levels for the low vs high sugar beverage groups.<p>I think an easy way to learn about the effects on ones own body for this is to buy a blood glucose meter and test themselves before and after drinking beverages with artificial sweeteners.')
