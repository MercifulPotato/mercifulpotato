In the physical world, however, it&#x27;s definitely an important artifact, considering how much it&#x27;s upended things for brick-and-mortar (at all scales) and the whole supply chain &#x2F; fulfillment &#x2F; logistics realm.<p>(And note that &quot;important&quot; should not be taken to mean &quot;beneficial&quot; here; it&#x27;s already important to the history of these sectors in the same sense that giant asteroids are important to the history of Earth-based life - that is, outright destructive of the current landscape, but might very well result in new opportunities in its wake)')
