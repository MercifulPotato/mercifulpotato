Or something like the old web in general. Or it has to be non profit (no ads, no subscription options, no paid content, only donation&#x2F;flattr if anything). I haven&#x27;t decided on a good rule yet, it&#x27;s quite tricky.<p>At any rate, the idea is to somehow filter out all the garbage when I just want to know how to do something. Too often I have to find personal blog links on stackoverflow (&quot;PS. I wrote more about it here&quot;) as opposed to that helpful article simply showing up in the search results by itself.')
