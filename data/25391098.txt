Except for the government!<p>In reality, sales taxes tend to be half as large or less <i>and</i> are usually not actually paid on raw good for resale by resellers,  so the difference isn&#x27;t quite as stark, but it is odd that no mention is made of the difference in government revenue, since the government is the entity actaully imposing the taxes!')
