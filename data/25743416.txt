What is the solution though?<p>&quot;Paying salaries competitively&quot; can also be rephrased as: &quot;Raise as much money as you can and keep salaries on an upward trajectory&quot;. Optimising for profit is normally a good, healthy thing, but given the cheapness of capital (printing etc) sloshing about, how does one go about and build a profitable and steady company with good talent <i>without</i> getting yanked into this cycle?<p>All companies want talent, and capital has been freely available for the past 15 years in amounts previously unimaginable. It doesn&#x27;t seem like there is any way to avoid this treadmill.<p>*Note, I am perfectly on board with paying competitive salaries, my point is that given the heavy market distortion because of all the VC money, that &quot;competitive salary&quot; isn&#x27;t actually an accurate descriptor.')
