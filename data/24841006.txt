Item(by='mmm_grayons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603219870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840869, text='I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to agree at first glance.  If I see unlimited, I expect to get the value.  I only order the &quot;unlimited free refills&quot; coke if I&#x27;m going to sit and work somewhere for four or five hours, since it&#x27;s otherwise pretty expensive.  On the other hand, Backblaze doesn&#x27;t price it&#x27;s personal backup service like restaurants price &quot;unlimited&quot; coke.  I&#x27;ve helped family and friends switch over from other services; some were so scammy they were charging thousands of dollars per year.  As far as the average consumer is concerned, it&#x27;s functionally unlimited in that the marginal gigabyte of data he backs up has no additional cost associated with it.  I have a hard time calling that &quot;Orwellian&quot;.<p>Edit: I just saw that another employee mentioned the largest customer is storing 430Tb.  That&#x27;s pretty darn unlimited for the price point.')
