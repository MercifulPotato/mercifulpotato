If the crossing car doesn&#x27;t give enough space (i.e. cuts people off), then they&#x27;re at fault. Otherwise the uncontrolled direction is at fault.<p>To simplify it: Everyone should give everyone enough space&#x2F;time to stop before hitting something. Everyone should use that space&#x2F;time when something unexpected happens. Anyone who breaks either of those should be at fault.<p>Again, just my opinion about how it should be. I have no idea what the law says.')
