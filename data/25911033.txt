Few projects treat `configure.ac` and its macros as serious as programming should be. They produce spaghetti code, duplicate code, patched code, slow code, unmaintainable code and they leave it there for decades only add code to make it worse, without ever feel the embarrassment to fix it. Of course blame the coder before blame the language.')
