This is what Microsoft warned us about!” I can only imagine that spawned a backlash internally against open source until they realized how popular the router became. It was nice of them to make the homage WRT several years ago. Maybe I should go read the article. Like many here I had (and probably still have!) a 54 series and ran ddwrt on it. Very liberating to realize half the functionality I wanted wasn’t in any way a hardware limitation, just software. After that, my next routers were purchased with careful attention to the amount of RAM and nv memory onboard as well as the device compatibility table. Now I run UBNT in the house on the ER platform with unifi stack on a VM that rarely gets turned on except to manage fw upgrades of the radios.')
