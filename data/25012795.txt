Item(by='spodek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604715257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011218, text='&gt; <i>Micromanagement, when used in the context of a business, is a situation in which managers (or anyone responsible for leading other people) are overly controlling of work or processes.</i><p>The key word in that definition is &quot;overly&quot; and the measure of over, under, or just right amount of control is the person being managed -- what works or doesn&#x27;t work for that person.<p>None of the behaviors the article listed are good, bad, right, or wrong in the abstract. If the person responds positively to very firm management and asks for it, it&#x27;s not micromanaging. For another person, very light management may be too much.<p>How do you find the optimal amount? Partly by asking, partly by observing, partly by experiment.<p>Bottom line: management (and leadership) is a human-human interaction. What works is based on the person you intend to manage (or lead).')
