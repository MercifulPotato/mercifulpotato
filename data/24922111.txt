My core point was that &quot;correlation does not imply causation&quot; doesn&#x27;t &quot;refute&quot; anything but logical postulates---the problem with something that can be so dismissed isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s logically flawed but that it <i>isn&#x27;t science</i>. Which I think is closer to what Feynman was describing than what you&#x27;re implying. When you say &quot;science isn&#x27;t supposed to be easy&quot; (I think most people already know that, but thanks), you&#x27;re supporting <i>my</i> position: saying &quot;correlation is not causation&quot; isn&#x27;t helpful. In itself, it&#x27;s either misleading or trivial.  And it deserves a standard response: &quot;Thanks, Professor. What&#x27;s your experimental design to investigate that? Competing hypotheses? Evidence supporting your position?&quot; Yes, science isn&#x27;t supposed to be easy, and that applies to disputing theories and evidence, too. I have my own problems with the release in the OP, but are you seriously claiming that it&#x27;s based on Cargo Cult Science? You know, or should know, that there&#x27;s more than mere correlation in the evidence and theory around AD research community focus on plaques.  You also know or should know that there is good research being done on competing theories---ones treating the plaques, perhaps not as epiphenomena, but as secondary to a more subtle primary mechanism.  If you think that more research dollars should go to the second group (and I would likely agree), cool.  But if you seriously think that the hypothesized connection between AÎ² plaques and AD is based on an easily dismissed &quot;logical error&quot;, you&#x27;re not competent to participate in that discussion.')
