But he got counted as a &quot;refusal&quot;. How many other people who <i>didn&#x27;t</i> refuse had some intuitive sense that the whole thing was a setup, thereby dampening whatever moral impulses they had? There&#x27;s no way of knowing. The fact that it <i>was</i> a setup changes the whole experiment, as compared to one where all of the information being given to the subjects is truthful.')
