I also interviewed at many more established Mittlestand tech(hardware) companies and I saw the same shitty patterns(butts in seats culture, micromanagement, no work from home allowed, outdated tech, poor pay, <i>&quot;flat culture and family atmosphere&quot;</i>) so I feel safe to generalize at this point.<p><i>&gt;I worked for quite a few young(!) small- to medium-sized tech companies in Germany</i><p>Well the ones I worked at were part of established hardware tech Mittlestand that keeps getting positively exemplified as why Germany is so successful vs other countries, not the hip new software startup.<p><i>&gt;Of course, the opposite also exists, especially with old-school managers in well-established companies. Family-owned businesses are often the worst. The butt-in-seat mentality is very prevalent. During the Corona pandemic, they had to be dragged into the 20th century, kicking and screaming.</i><p>Well, yes, that&#x27;s exactly my experience. The experience made me give up for good on ever working for the Mittlestand business, especially the family owned ones.<p>Out of curiosity, in which city are you located and wich field of tech are you in? I&#x27;m open for moving once covid blows over and scouting for spots already.')
