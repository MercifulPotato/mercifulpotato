If you can&#x27;t tell quality, money doesn&#x27;t buy it (eg used cars for the average buyer). Also, if the person paying isn&#x27;t the one using the product (or they don&#x27;t care for some other reason), you stop getting quality (eg government\ncheese).<p>Google arnt the ones reading articles so they don&#x27;t suffer if quality falls. You also can&#x27;t really quantify quality of journalism can you (of the million articles Google sponsors, which were good?).<p>There are exceptions to this, the BBC for instance. But on the whole the US is very bad at this and even if it weren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s hard to do.<p>This is also the reason journalism has collapsed in general: when customers paid for stories by buying papers the stories had to be good. But now advertisers are paying for clicks and any journalism that happens is purely co-incidental...<p>There&#x27;s also a big issue with censorship and control when Google literally own the news. I&#x27;m actually pretty pro Google, but given the amount of grilling they get, it would be really easy to just cancel some stories about them and push some about senators who dislike them etc.')
