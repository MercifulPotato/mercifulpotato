Item(by='gknoy', descendants=None, kids=[24782533], score=None, time=1602701691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24776712, text='&gt; Would people like it if it didn&#x27;t have the star wars backdrop? Does the star wars backdrop even make that much sense?<p>The bulk of the plot would work fine if it were space-bounty-hunter-with-angry-people-after-him, plus friends and a macguffin.  Star Wars flavoring seems like the main way that this differentiates it from Cowboy Bebop (space bounty hunter in the solar system, hops between planets...).<p>A big part of why the show is good is the mysterious &quot;what&#x27;s under the mask&quot; aspect. We&#x27;ve had Boba&#x2F;Jango Fett for decades, but it&#x27;s really neat to see the expansion of this lore about the mandalorian culture -- why they always stay masked, etc.  SW nerds like me often find lore tidbits delicious.<p>The Mandalorian also happens to have ridiculously good production values compared to most shows -- I&#x27;m watching a movie in serial form. (See also Altered Carbon.) It also has interesting characters that I am curious about (both heroes and villains), with backstories I&#x27;d like to hear more about. THAT part doesn&#x27;t need to be Star Wars. It could be samurai, or space privateers, or drama on a space station (DS9), and as long as it&#x27;s done well, I&#x27;ll want to watch it.')
