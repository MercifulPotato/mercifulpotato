It is a horrible collection of hacks that make simple things hard and hard things impossible. I have thought many times “if only was I drawing this control&#x2F;layout directly, I would’ve finished hours ago.”<p>I think this betrays a lack of understanding on the part of the author of how to write good web components. Yes, the DOM is tricky at first, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s trying to support things like resizing windows to arbitrary sizes.<p>I don&#x27;t even understand what he tries to say with &quot;draw the control directly&quot;. In component-based library, this is exactly how you would work. Put your component where it needs to be, and boom, you&#x27;re finished (just like in all frameworks this is a lie, you probably still need to tweak).<p>I don&#x27;t in general buy the argument that the DOM is low-performant and low-quality. Lots of great and performant UIs have been built on the web platform.')
