Bail is essentially taking money. If someone can post a million dollars bail, but thinks they can evade the Justice system by fleeing, a million dollars probably isn&#x27;t going to be worth a sizable risk of being imprisoned for whatever the potential sentence is for their crime.<p>OTOH, non-cash-bail systems tend to put more focus on monitoring and related conditions which have a real and meaningful impact on flight.')
