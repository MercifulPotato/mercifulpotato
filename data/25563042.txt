We @ juspay.in use it to power a bulk of UPI payment transactions. We also use PureScript to power our payment page SDKs.<p>API (CRUD&#x2F;Auth) code written in HS becomes a beauty once you start building experience with HS. I think the most advantage of FP comes from how it changes the way you model your solution for a problem. With a strict type system, it&#x27;s easier to anticipate edge cases and with currying building abstractions becomes natural.<p>Having said that, HS is not all sunshine. It took me an inordinate amount of time to setup an IDE like environment. If I recall correctly, HLS would take &gt; 20GB of RAM in few hours with our code base. Eventually I had to remove that and extensively use only the editor features to jump around code.')
