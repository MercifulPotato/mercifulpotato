Suppose, I dunno, the Koch brothers somehow managed to buy Google (or maybe the Saudis, it doesn&#x27;t matter really) and simply took over the existing power structure to use it for evil.<p>Yes, maybe everyone would work to migrate, but it&#x27;s hard not to think they could do some bad things in the mean time.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t some Ma Bell situation where it&#x27;s illegal to build another phone company.<p>Well, if the alternatives get treated like the examples given up thread, that&#x27;s quite an uphill battle, because you may not be able to get an ISP, payment processor, IP addresses, domain names, etc.<p>Having to remake the entire infrastructure again makes some of these things natural monopolies even if it&#x27;s not exactly illegal to build another one, network effects are still a pain.')
