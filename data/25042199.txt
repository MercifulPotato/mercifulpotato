Here is the direct link:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doreenmichele.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;sticky-this-see-typo-submit-pull-request.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doreenmichele.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;sticky-this-see-t...</a><p>And maybe what needs to happen is not so much &quot;sticky this&quot; as just learn that what non-coders really need to hear somehow is &quot;You just submit a pull request for that. Takes like five minutes.&quot; and <i>not</i> &quot;We are friendly! Come join our email list!&quot;<p>Because I&#x27;m not averse to reading all that stuff. But if you have to do three hours of reading before you can submit &quot;you have a typo,&quot; that is going to drive people away. If I can tell you &quot;You have a typo&quot; and get that approved and it&#x27;s a positive experience, then I have more motive to start learning about conventions and so forth.')
