The best mitigation here is, first, don&#x27;t cater to fascists who want to tear apart the fabric of American society.<p>Second, if you&#x27;re going to piss people off, either set up a contract that doesn&#x27;t give your infrastructure provider the freedom to end its relationship with you, or do without the benefits of cloud. AWS isn&#x27;t a utility, and its services are largely replaceable -- buy some computers and set up your own servers.')
