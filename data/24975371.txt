Brave is one of the best things to happen to the web and actually has a chance at saving the web.<p>Brave allows me to easily donate money to creators. I currently fund the internet to the tune of $10&#x2F;month using Brave. Someday that will be $100&#x2F;month.<p>Brave removes ads &quot;pre-render&quot; so it is the fastest experience one can get. Other ad-blockers remove them after they have already loaded via JavaScript. Brave does this natively.<p>Brave has features to let users watch ads and earn currency, I don&#x27;t use that at all. But some do, and it is consensual and fine for them.<p>Brave has an option called &quot;Private w&#x2F;Tor&quot; and that is what yabones is claiming that &quot;its users fall for the VPN fallacy&quot;. Which may be true for a small percentage but yabones is making a sweeping generalization here by implying &quot;all users&quot;, which is not even close to true. I don&#x27;t even use Private w&#x2F;Tor mode. I don&#x27;t consider anything truly private on the web and nobody else should either.<p>Brave is one of the best things to happen to the web as the web has become swamped with tracking and ads. Brave does remove all those by default.')
