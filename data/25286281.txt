Are your friends and family all locked in to Apple just because nobody wants to try a different chat app? I know plenty of people who don&#x27;t have any facetime client whatsoever because they don&#x27;t have any Apple products whatsoever. I suggest that &quot;nobody else you know&quot; wants to migrate to new chat software because nobody&#x27;s asking them to.<p>Nextcloud, Matrix, Discord, Signal, Telegram, Skype, Zoom, hell even Pidgin. These are all competitors to Apple&#x27;s Facetime -- they all have voice and&#x2F;or video chat on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS.<p>Here, let me help you start the conversation that way:<p>&gt; <i>You:</i> Hey mom&#x2F;dad&#x2F;friend&#x2F;acquaintance&#x2F;boss, I&#x27;m going to use a different program to talk to people who don&#x27;t have an iPhone. Can you install it and talk to me on it for a bit and test it?<p>&gt; <i>Mom&#x2F;dad&#x2F;friend&#x2F;acquaintance&#x2F;boss</i>: Yeah sure what&#x27;s the app?<p>&gt; <i>Another mom&#x2F;dad&#x2F;friend&#x2F;acquaintance&#x2F;boss</i>: What? No.<p>I wonder which way the conversation will go?')
