What I am not sure is whether it gets copied somewhere else for long term storage or some data mining, thing that you may not be aware of. I doubt you know everything that happens at google but I might be wrong there as I don&#x27;t know who exactly is that I am talking to. Regardless, google has lost my trust completely and am not sure if it is possible to recover it and go back to the &quot;do no evil stage&quot; anymore.')
