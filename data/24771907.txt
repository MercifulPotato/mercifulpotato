Usually, they&#x27;d retain something like 3 months of archives. Providers actually competed on how much archival history they retained. Retention also usually varies based on binary&#x2F;text newsgroups: there is far less cost to retaining text Usenet posts because they&#x27;re usually very small.<p>My 1M message Usenet archive is 5.6GiB of space, and I believe this covers ~30 days of non-alt.binaries messages.
