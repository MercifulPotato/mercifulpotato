RapidStash is a service for rapidly publishing sandbox APIs with just JSON. If you have an idea of what kind of data you want to send and receive but aren’t yet ready to build a backend, just throw some example data in a “stash” and interact with it there. Use the forking feature to iterate on ideas and share with others. You can also save stashes and set read&#x2F;write permissions to restrict their usage.<p>Check out the web app or try it in your favorite HTTP testing tool (e.g. Postman, Insomnia). We welcome feedback and suggestions on how to improve the service, we’re eager to make this as useful as possible. Thanks and enjoy!')
