Item(by='H8crilA', descendants=None, kids=[25069556, 25069538], score=None, time=1605187013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069385, text='To be completely fair, there exists a justification for (at least some of) the action we&#x27;re seeing: if developed economies&#x27; bond yields are correctly pricing in future nominal gdp, i.e. we will not be back to good times for the next 30-50 years, then owning anything that can grow is tremendously valuable. But it&#x27;s such a stretch to assume 30-50 years of stagnation, even if the entire bond market agrees with you. I mean do you seriously expect property relationships to not be rewritten in some revolutionary way somewhere along the way if we get 30-50 years of misery?')
