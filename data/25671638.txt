Badly positioned to prevent the initial compromise of the perimeter, but still there to handle a protest like this.<p>[1] Video of the incident in Germany. I think the intent of the protestors to enter the building is visible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OdX5952CFTU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OdX5952CFTU</a>')
