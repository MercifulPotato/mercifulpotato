Item(by='arghwhat', descendants=None, kids=[25188244], score=None, time=1606146454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187588, text='&quot;XYZ isn&#x27;t slow if run on a fast enough processor&quot; is an utterly useless statement.<p>My personal gripe with the eShop is the horrible startup time (compare to the time it takes the settings application to open - part of this can be assigned to it being a web application indeed), lack of partial&#x2F;incremental presentation, and possibly lack of prefetching. Asset loading causing bad UX is always a frontend problem.')
