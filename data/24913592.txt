I thought I remember reading that scurvy patients recover pretty quickly, and according the the NHS[0], it&#x27;s about 48 hours to start feeling better and 2 weeks to recovery.</i><p>Scurvy is vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is water soluble.<p>Vitamin D is fat soluble. Fat soluble vitamins generally work on a longer, slower time scale. It takes longer to incorporate them into the body and longer to become deficient.<p>People who are deficient in vitamin C may simply not be getting enough of it in their diet. Because vitamin D can actually be manufactured in the body, it tends to correlate to other underlying issues.<p>People with other underlying issues tend to require more time to recover from anything, medically speaking. They may even have inherent challenges in absorbing vitamin D properly or using it properly.<p>I have a genetic disorder that predisposes me to deficiency in all fat soluble vitamins, including vitamin D. I&#x27;m sure my firsthand experience with being slow to heal and my body being slow to adequately resolve nutritional deficiencies (on the order of months of supplementation to fix things) is on the fairly extreme side, but most Covid-19 patients in danger of dying from it are elderly and have underlying health issues. So I would expect my experiences to be somewhat similar to their situation.<p>Does that make sense? Did I answer the question?')
