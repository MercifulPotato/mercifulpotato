Urbit OS is a program that runs on almost any cloud server, most laptops and many phones: anything with Unix and an internet connection.<p>The main thing to understand about our ‘overlay OS’, as we call it, is that the foundation is a single, simple function. This function is the Urbit OS virtual machine. We call it ‘Nock’. The entire Urbit OS system compiles down to Nock, and Nock is just 33 lines of code.<p>Nock is similar in spirit to WASM or the JVM: it’s a uniform machine code for every Urbit ship. A frozen foundation makes for some nice features:<p>The state of your Urbit OS is a pure function of its event history. It’s auditable, inspectable, repeatable. You can actually trust it. Writing decentralized apps becomes vastly simpler than in the old world, since every node computes exactly the same way. The entire Urbit OS stack, from programming language to applications, is upgradeable over the network. For ordinary users, this makes for almost no system administration.<p>Since Nock is a protocol for computing itself, any two nodes on the Urbit network can easily share data, communicate and connect their software.&quot;')
