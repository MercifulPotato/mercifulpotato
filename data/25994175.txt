Practically <i>any</i> media. Even with codec packs installed it won&#x27;t play any of my hundreds of h264 DVD rips, it won&#x27;t play the few WMVs I still have kicking around, it won&#x27;t even play bloody <i>MP3s</i>. I think I found one weird-codec MP4 and a couple of ancient AVIs it deigned to accept, but that was it.<p>Or I can spend 30 seconds installing VLC and be 100% confident that it&#x27;ll handle anything I throw at it. If I could fit a Lascaux cave wall into a USB port it&#x27;d play it.<p>Congrats to everyone involved in making this software. The world would be a sadder and more frustrating place without it.')
