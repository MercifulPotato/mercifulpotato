Smart people tend to over estimate their understanding of complicated subjects, and it irritates them when it appears you are making something more complicated than it &quot;should be.&quot; Even though the error is their over estimation, not the complexity of the solution.<p>If you combine that with their ego being unable to accept that something is more complicated than they assume, then you get the situation where they propose a solution that is simple, easy to implement, and wrong.<p>Add to that a measure of &quot;hurt&quot; from feeling like the messenger is getting the credit that you are due. And you get someone who directs their anger at the messenger not the message. Yes, it&#x27;s broken, yes it&#x27;s dysfunctional, but it&#x27;s just business. If you are in that spot you can assuage your hurt feelings by forcing the simple&#x2F;wrong solution through to &quot;prove&quot; to yourself that you have more power.<p>In all fairness I don&#x27;t blame the engineer. They fully believed that their simple solution was completely adequate. I do however blame the management that put up with this. They are the ones who should have been looking out for the company&#x2F;technology and not whose feelings would be hurt by doing the right thing. Several years later James apologized to me for not doing the right thing, and I appreciated that, but I also recognize that while my system was much more secure and would have not had the vulnerabilities that were later found, it was more complicated and thus harder to validate, and it could have just as easily been broken in a different way.')
