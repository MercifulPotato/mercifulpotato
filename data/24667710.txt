If the final result has remotely similar properties to balsa, it is not going to be able to come anywhere near cutting you - balsa&#x27;s a very soft wood.<p>Of course if the final result has remotely similar properties to balsa it would also mean that you could just about break it with a hard enough sneeze. Balsa&#x27;s a very soft wood.<p>(Though now that I look at the actual abstract it&#x27;s probably stronger than the chunks of balsa wood I learnt to carve as a kid: &quot;high toughness (3.03 MJ m-3) that is 3 orders of magnitude higher than standard glass (0.003 MJ m-3)&quot; - so maybe you could indeed do some serious damage with shards of clear balsa.)')
