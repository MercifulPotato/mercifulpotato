Our system uses git to store collection metadata and git-annex to manage binaries.  It was originally designed to be used to allow partner sites with very low connectivity to contribute archival-quality video to a distributed archive.  Data can be synced over the network or via physical storage sent in the mail.<p>Using Git&#x2F;git-annex for this system has advantages for archival preservation.  Copies can be located in geographically diverse locations and synced as necessary.  The Git log&#x27;s use of cryptographic hashes also makes data tamper-evident.')
