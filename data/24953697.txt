Order in mathematics crosses a similar threshold, as it becomes sufficiently structured to support algebraic reasoning.<p>It&#x27;s funny, because I think this metaphor cuts exactly the opposite direction -- code reaching sufficient complexity, the pure math approach doesn&#x27;t survive an encounter with the real world.<p>I love static analysis and think that there are core business domains that are best expressed with a rich type system, but there is a whole world of absolutely critical programming that cannot simply eliminate messiness, due to interfacing with humans and our flawed practices.<p>With sufficient time and an expressive enough type system, even the messiest business process can be represented, but I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s an example of beauty but rather stubbornness.')
