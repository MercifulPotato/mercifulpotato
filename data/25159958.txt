African elephants exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Female Loxodonta africana mass between 1 and 1.5 tonnes and males between 2 and 3 tonnes. 640 &quot;African elephants&quot; is somewhere between 2.6x10^6 kg and 3.8x10^6 kg depending on the sex mixture of the herd, a range of 6000 tonnes. That&#x27;s the equivalent mass of over 30 American football fields filled with pickup trucks. Hardly negligible.')
