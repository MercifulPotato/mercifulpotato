The people tripling down on long-term trades like Tesla for retirement are idiots banking on the good times going on for decades. Remember 2000s when there was a media push for &quot;Generation Equity&quot; - WIRED frontpage? Yeah, that was the same thinking. There isn&#x27;t enough money in the world or GDP for a generation to cover a 100Trillion debt market once it matures (which would be 100T+rate the purchased bonds bear).<p>If you want to do short selling or short-term trading, that&#x27;s great, but these are these infantile investors that are going to see their investments wiped out in a correction.')
