It&#x27;s probably very hard to change given entrenched interests, and nobody has even tried.<p>Trump has done nothing to change policy - he kept occupying troops abroad, expanded strikes globally, undertook strikes on Iran and assassinated a top member of that regime illegally in Iraq - we haven&#x27;t seen the fallout yet.<p>Also if you&#x27;re willing to overlook Trump&#x27;s racism and fascism in favour of a slight change in foreign policy (even if it was real), I&#x27;d suggest some introspection at this point.')
