I don’t consider their expert to be particularly credible and their conclusions (with leaps of faith as to assumed motive) are not even borne out by the facts as they reported. An overly sensitive page size detection could produce the same discrepancies they claimed to find.<p>The ‘expert’ in the Antrim document also claimed over 100% of registered voters voted in various Michigan counties but was actually using Minnesota data. It was buffoonery of the absolute highest order and plainly visible. Why anyone would rely upon someone so incompetent for any other analysis is beyond me.<p>Oh, right, equally ludicrous is the misadministration by a Republican county clerk is cause for disenfranchising a vote by the opposing party.<p>For her part though, the county clerk called shenanigans:<p>‘Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy all pushed back on the report.<p>Guy, a Republican, said she was saddened by the efforts to discredit the equipment.<p>I did read the report and find that there are many misleading statements that are simply not accurate.”’')
