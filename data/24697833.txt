I used Celery as a part of Django. It kept running into weird issues. Celery-Flower used to monitor the Celery threads is not maintained and that became a huge issue for me as I had no way of tracking any issue.<p>I have also used Celery parallelize crawling of multiple websites in parallel. Beyond a small number of workers, Celery would go into a frozen state (My data flow was one way. No chance that I know of deadlocking.) The code felt too convoluted to dive in and understand.<p>I have since shifted to Dramatiq ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dramatiq.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dramatiq.io&#x2F;</a> ). It has all the features I like of Celery (Chaining of async methods with error handling when any one link on the chain fails), with super reliability. It also has Django support.<p>Having said that, it must be recognized that Dramatiq was built from the success and learnings gained from Celery. Celery is a wonderful piece of work still in active use in almost all Python shops.  I am just thankful that we now have so many alternatives.<p>PS: The Django-Q mentioned in another comment looks very well structured, comprehensive and actively developed. I shall give it a try. For now, so happy with Dramatiq.')
