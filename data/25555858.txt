The RISC-V designers in contrast seem to deliberately design instructions to make it easier to perform macro-op fusion. You can see specific revisions to the spec being made to make macro-op fusion easier.<p>Actual real world performance tests already suggests that RISC-V tend to require less memory for their programs as well as fewer instructions than x86 and ARM. Hence even without pervasive macro-op fusion they are in a good spot.<p>E.g. for CoreMark used to benchmark embedded processors RISC-V BOOM implementation came ahead ARM-32 Cortex-A9 with about 10% fewer instructions, 10% smaller memory usage and about 10% higher clock frequency (thanks to smaller core).')
