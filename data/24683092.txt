Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=[24683353], score=None, time=1601854319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680342, text='&gt;That requires (1) the failure to be visible and self-evidently the result of political processes and decisions (2) people to act on (1) and actually vote (3) alternate candidates that have a genuinely different plan.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s not that easy to ensure that all 3 happen.<p>That raises a couple of questions:<p>1.  Why aren&#x27;t problems visible?<p>Is it a failure of local government to disclose how they&#x27;re spending <i>your</i> money?  If so, why do you and your neighbors allow that?  It is <i>your</i> money and <i>your</i> town after all.  Especially since, even in a medium-sized city, a few hundred people who care about their quality of life can completely upend politics as usual.<p>2.  Why don&#x27;t people &quot;act on [lack of transparency] and actually vote&quot;?<p>Again, this seems rather odd to me.  I can certainly understand (although I don&#x27;t agree) that folks may think that Federal, and even some state elections don&#x27;t give them any say.  But local elections are a very different story.<p>3. Is it really true (as you seem to contend) Is it your contention that overwhelming majorities of people <i>everywhere</i> just don&#x27;t care about the places they live, or for what purposes their tax dollars are used?')
