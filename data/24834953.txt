Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[24835016, 24835104, 24835034, 24835006], score=None, time=1603181378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834919, text='Sure, I love chat support interfaces and use them all the time. If I want support, that is. But not when I hit your site for the first time and just getting acquainted with your product. I just want to see your product materials at my own pace in peace. If you want me to see something different, change those materials to whatever you want your first impression to be. But don&#x27;t accost me with a &quot;can i help you&quot; before I have even had 2 minutes to read your product description. That&#x27;s almost like if a grocery store employee greets you at the door and follows you around as you browse the fruit section asking &quot;can I help you&quot; -- I&#x27;d probably leave that grocery store pretty quickly.<p>Popups of all kinds, I despise. There should NEVER be any unsolicited modals. That includes chat boxes, &quot;please subscribe to our newsletter&quot;, GDPR warnings, and all of them. They all interrupt my attention flow severely. If you&#x27;re lucky, I will inspect your DOM and will block your modal with injected CSS&#x2F;JS rules, reload, and keep browsing your site. If you&#x27;re unlucky, I&#x27;ll leave and look for other competing sites that are a more pleasant experience. I have clicked out of <i>several</i> sites before that had a stupid &quot;can i help you&quot; Intercom popup. On a few of those occasions I actually replied &quot;no go away&quot; before leaving the site, hoping that they would take the feedback for the future.')
