But it&#x27;s something that deserves the hard work it takes to get out of it, I think. I&#x27;ve been realizing a lot of these kinds of challenges in life demand a lot from us, and it can be so daunting, but the reward of taking on that challenge is really immense. Imagine learning to get out of the spiral early - that one day you can just say no and focus on better things. You absolutely could, I bet.<p>&gt; What you wrote helped me out. Thanks.<p>Thanks for saying so, that really makes my day.<p>I&#x27;ve had a similar experience and something that caught me by surprise was this technique called fear setting. I thought it was the cheesiest nonsense ever, but through some turn of events I ended up trying it. I applied it to a problem like what you&#x27;re describing one day and ended up just writing, in the plainest, simplest, most honest terms why I fell into so much resentment. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for both of us, but the experience was a revelation. Not all negative emotions are driven by fear, but the resentment certainly was in my case. So I wrote out why, what it does to me, what I can do to address that.<p>The key discovery was a sort of nested fear. It was like the immediate issue wasn&#x27;t the real fear, or the thing driving my resentment. This should have been obvious I guess, because the superficial problems never justified the amount of resentment. No, ultimately I was afraid of addressing the superficial problem; the broad implications, the confrontation, the unknowns. I kept those tucked away so well and used that resentment to distract and convince myself that the REAL problem was the superficial once. It was really bizarre to realize that once I stopped to dig, the real fear and discomfort was right under the surface all along. Out of sight and out of mind, I guess.<p>Writing it out felt really stupid the first time. Like, I must know all of this already - why do I need to write it down? It&#x27;s sort of like rubber ducking a problem though. You put it out there in plain sight and just go &quot;OH... Oh.&quot;, and there it is. Now what do you do with it?<p>Tim Ferris talks a lot about fear setting. I don&#x27;t know much about him, but he makes some sense on this topic. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;fear-setting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;fear-setting&#x2F;</a>')
