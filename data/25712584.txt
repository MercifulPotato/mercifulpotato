Also, the realist concern is classic &#x27;balance the strongest power&#x27; dynamic.<p>I don&#x27;t think China has to worry about an outright official blockade, but you&#x27;ll end up with a Cold War rerun and Chinese companies being unofficially driven off the West, SK and Japan working together, possible SK&#x2F;Japan nukes at the very least. China played a lot of cards trying to keep other countries not ganged up against it, best not ruin it to get a devastated province. Simply put, any starvation scenario where Taiwan decides to fight will be a disaster for CCP too.<p>So I believe any CCP strategist understands it&#x27;s better to sacrifice men and take Taiwan outright without turning it to Yemen (a preference which you stated as well). A quick enough operation will be ignored by the world for reasons you provided, and they may well be in a position to do that soon. The &#x27;wait out months&#x2F;years and publicly starve out Taiwan&#x27; is incredibly poor in comparison.')
