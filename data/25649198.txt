Item(by='ckemere', descendants=None, kids=[25653577, 25649298], score=None, time=1609872248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646180, text='I think that the suggestion of a challenge-based Phase 3 trial is poorly elucidated, not for the reasons mentioned in other threads (the risk of severe reactions) but because they probably would have revealed in more detail what the Phase 2&#x2F;3 trials actually <i>did</i> reveal, that the vaccine is not 100% effective in preventing infection. (Full disclosure - I participated in the Moderna Phase 3 trial and will get vaccinated ASAP if it turns out I was in the placebo group.)<p>The incentives for Moderna&#x2F;Pfizer&#x2F;AZ are a bit complex here. If they did a challenge study and discovered that 25% of vaccinated individuals were infected but had lower viral loads, that might have made it more difficult to get approved. Instead, doing what they are doing - rolling out vaccination with zero public health monitoring of folks after the fact allows them to avoid having to deal with that. Moreover, for the anti-vaxxers, who currently seem to have focused in on the fact that a tiny fraction of folks appear to have an anaphylactic response to the lipid nanoshell on the mRNA, it would have been easy to say &quot;Oh, the vaccine doesn&#x27;t actually work at all.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate, but certainly not the first time where incentives are aligned to favor ignorance rather than maximum knowledge. I think the really interesting question I have is whether Moderna will continue to follow their Phase 3 participants after they are all unblinded and vaccinated. If they do, and do a good job of assessing changes in antibodies, then I&#x27;ll be really impressed with their ethics.')
