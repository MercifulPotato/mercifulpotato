I was under the impression that it is the bare minimum if we are talking about production. Why is a separate tool necessary? To normalize the pipeline tests? If that&#x27;s the case maybe there&#x27;s another issue with engineering principles and basics that is not adressed but I don&#x27;t know.<p>I don&#x27;t want to just be sceptical and dismiss anyone&#x27;s effort for a free and open source tool but since I can express what I think I believe it will yield more overhead than anything, at least for my use cases so far since testing the data require way more steps than analyzing a single dump for coherence. \nWhile I can see the advantage of such a tool with exchanging interface definitions with data providers or other people, I consider it yet another thing to add to the whole infrastructure which obviously comes at a cost that is not 0 that can ultimately be solved with documentation enforced through sane devops methods.')
