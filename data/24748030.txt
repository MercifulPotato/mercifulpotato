Lots of old bikes dug out of storage and brand new bikes with slightly wobbly riders. Also, more diverse riders. I think it&#x27;s great.<p>There&#x27;s also a big increase in poorly maintained bikes- a squeaking chain is not just wearing itself out faster than usual, but also wearing out expensive drivetrain parts. Lubricate and clean your chains (and WD-40 is not lube)!')
