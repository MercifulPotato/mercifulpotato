Item(by='Kednicma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602366500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738554, text='&gt; In quantum mechanics some events are truly random and cannot be predicted. Does this mean that quantum mechanics is where you can find free will? Sorry, but no, this makes no sense. These random events in quantum mechanics are not influenced by you, regardless of exactly what you mean by “you”, because they are not influenced by anything. That’s the whole point of saying they are fundamentally random. Nothing determines their outcome.<p>This is wrong, sorry. Rather, QM is contextual; the response to a measurement is both influenced locally by the measurement&#x27;s orientation and non-locally by its causal history.<p>QM gives us indeterminism. Further, if we have free will, then so do subatomic particles. It is neither good or bad, but it is how it is.')
