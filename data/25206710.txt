In maths, the main competition is Greek letters. Kids today arent going to know their eta from their gamma. I find many undergrads can&#x27;t remember the Greek alphabet.<p>Sure, girl wearing hat might be a bad choice, but I think &quot;simple emoji like tree, fire, snowflake (for example). Do a good job of replacing Greek letters.<p>Another place I use emoji, is for a set of Labella which should have no order. Mathematica a often say they are naming some things 1,2,3, but please forget the integers have arthmetic and ordering. If you use fire, tree, snowflake as the names, no-one assumes an ordering, or arithmetic.')
