Should be &quot;How to get a CS degree in the time you need to be ready&quot;.<p>Cool that something like this exists, and I support it. For me it was similar. I studied math and physics for 6 terms and was programming since age of 6. Then my thesis adviser told me that all my thesis suggestions are for CS, not math. So I thought, well what the heck, let&#x27;s just write a CS thesis. I did all the missing coursework in half a year and wrote my thesis in the second. This would be of course utterly impossible without the background I had at that time. (I studied in Germany, where you generally have full control over your studies. I.e. you can do all courses from all terms at the same time, for instance)')
