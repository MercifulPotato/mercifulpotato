Out of million people only small percentage would become infected with covid and of that, only small percentage would die.&quot; The virus is very contagions eventually most people will get infected, not a small percentage. The death rate is nominally low, but a 1% chance of dying is still a lot to me. Also the chances of getting long term side effects or just having a very bad illness are much higher.')
