Engineering-driven work doesn&#x27;t take into account the trade-offs between speed and quality.<p>Often engineering teams are pushed to work faster at the expense of the quality or by cutting reasonable corners on flexibility of the system.<p>How do you describe this to outside stakeholders?<p>I feel like the correlation between speed and quality should be taken into account, which is why tech debt makes sense. It&#x27;s the debt you accumulate as you build software.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the name either')
