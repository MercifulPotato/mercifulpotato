Let&#x27;s just be clear that BDSM is for consenting parties who are turned on by various experiences including pain. That&#x27;s not what sexual violence &#x2F; rape is. BDSM or a nod towards it features in many mainstream games. Then again Dishonored did feature a kink scene which turns into a violence&#x2F;torture scene... it&#x27;s just not overly sexual.')
