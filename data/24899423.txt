Most people seem to prefer to sit in traffic in a car they control than public buses.<p>Buses are an incredibly bad public transportation option because they sit so well in a local maxima trap because they look like a viable public transportation and &quot;share&quot; the road infrastructure costs of cars leaving them &quot;cheap investments&quot;, so much that cities don&#x27;t think they need to invest in anything more expensive. But they also share all the detriments of investment in car infrastructure, and thus through self-fulfilling-prophecy expectedly never grow the ridership to encourage cities to push for more investment in public transportation over car transportation.<p>From that perspective bus services aren&#x27;t even a band aid on the systemic problem, but a symptom&#x2F;perpetuator of the systemic problem.')
