But note that the Rust you get to work with is extremely limited: you don&#x27;t get loops or native function calls (redbpf inlines them in the LLVM IR), and so essentially no library support. There are some BPF programs you can express in C (anything that relies on a bounded loop, for instance to walk a packet a byte at a time) that I don&#x27;t think you can in redbpf right now.<p>(Bounded loops are really fussy anyways and you probably won&#x27;t use them in most programs, so writing in a single language rather than Rust and C might easily be enough of a win).')
