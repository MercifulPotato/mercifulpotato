We&#x27;re tested up to 4 times&#x2F;week (I have friends who are tested daily), asked not to use mass transit, and many of us work so many hours that we have no time to do much socializing outside of the group of people working for the production who are all in the same boat. It&#x27;s really the only place I go where I feel perfectly safe. Even when unmasked to eat, we don&#x27;t sit together, we&#x27;re always socially distant.<p>Contrast this with my friends outside the business...they&#x27;re going out semi-regularly, have only been tested when they want to see their family or get out of quarantining for 2 weeks after travel, think nothing of eating in the outdoor huts that are slowly getting more and more enclosed as the NYC weather gets colder. I&#x27;m very sympathetic to this woman and all restaurant owners in general, but the situations are not the same.')
