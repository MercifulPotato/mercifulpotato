Imagine you have a website with your local town adverts and spammers manually keep registering to your side, confirm email and then keep account appearing to be used by a true user and suddenly start spamming. You block one account, find a couple similar then block them too. Then you get a complain from a user claiming to own one of those accounts. Let&#x27;s say you ignore that. Few days later a new spam account &quot;wakes up&quot;. You block couple similar accounts. Tell spam detector to block certain sentences and domains. Another complaint. Then another account &quot;wake up&quot;, this time spam filter catches it, then spammer tries manually changing their spam until it goes through. You block those too and delete accounts. More complaints. Now other legitimate user complain that they cannot share a link or write certain sentences. Turns out spam filter is too trigger happy. You spend time to tune it. More accounts &quot;wake up&quot;. This goes on and on. You find yourself no longer working on the site, but firefighting spam. You report the IP addresses used for spam. Nothing changes. Then you find out the IPs are from a couple of countries, that are not your town. You block the IPs. You get complain legitimate user on holiday can&#x27;t access it. More accounts &quot;wake up&quot; - from new IP addresses. It is TOR. You block TOR. More complaints that some users cannot access, but other than that no more complaints about spam. Finally you can go back to developing your product.\nIt is simply not worth. I advice to block everything from various lists as the minimum. Countries don&#x27;t allow people from dodgy places, websites should be able to do too.\nPeople should be going to jail for spam. They damage economy. Big companies have resources to deal with it so they don&#x27;t lobby to make law changes as it takes potential competition at bay.')
