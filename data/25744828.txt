But as they grew, and our dependence on their product grew, the rules changed. They are now regulated differently, and have to sell to all who pay their bills. And nobody thinks it a stain on ConEd&#x27;s reputation when they are found to have been selling power to porn-studios or gun-makers (i.e. legal activities some find distasteful), nor to weed-growers or mafia-run warehouses (illegal activities, but we don&#x27;t expect ConEd to hire deeply investigate every connection).<p>Is AWS selling something like water &amp; electricity, a basic neutral service needed for many businesses? Or something more like a cable TV service, where they bear <i>some</i> responsibility for what&#x27;s communicated in the channels being provided?')
