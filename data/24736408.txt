That was caused by a thundering herd, and I don’t plan to repeat it, but unless your benchmark was also on a single-core machine, I’d say that’s “significant”; PGBouncer really has no overhead on connection startup, while simply copying the shared buffers table into a new process represents a real overhead for postgres proper.<p>A TCP connection is really lightweight, when stripped down enough. Thousands of connection establishments per second per core is not actually gonna break a sweat.')
