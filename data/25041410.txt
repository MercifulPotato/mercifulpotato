That&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re doing when you&#x27;re giving a review on &quot;the purchasing experience&quot; on Amazon.<p>Everyone on earth knows that it might rain during your dinner, just like everyone on earth knows that packages get lost sometimes or the UPS driver might drop your TV. It&#x27;s not useful or fair to the product&#x27;s company or restaurant to leave these kind of reviews.')
