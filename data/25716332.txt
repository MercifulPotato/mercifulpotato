But with platforms being privately owned and centralized, the scale at which they start being problematic is fairly small.<p>The likes of Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;YouTube have blown past this limit a <i>long</i> time ago.<p>At this point it&#x27;s too late for regulation.

So the only solution left seems to be to shut them down completely, and let the competition do their job (it won&#x27;t take long, considering Internet timescales). But maybe before consider what kind of regulations these competitors will have to live under. (Maybe a built-in time limit before they are shut down in turn, and the cycle starts all over again ?)')
