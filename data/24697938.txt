I think these are the drivers and please tell me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>(1) Sports clearly do a good job of finding exceptionally talented people, so maybe we should follow their playbook.<p>(2) People like and accept competitive sports, so emotionally they should have the same reaction to competitive academics.<p>On (1), there are so many ways that STEM success is not like sports.<p>- On an individual level, sports are literally engines for scoring performances, so progress towards success is completely observable.  The highest levels of STEM success are defined by doing never-previously-observed things in highly collaborative environments with no opportunity for an exact head-to-head comparison.  There is zero reason to believe that your 1,000 AOPS math problems are the best way to advance your STEM education towards real success, even though it may help you outcompete your neighbor on a single test.<p>- On an industry level, sports are entertainment businesses that only needs to find enough exceptional individuals to create events people will pay to see.  Participation as both a spectator or contestant are voluntary.  Public education is a social investment in economic opportunity for its citizens.  It needs to succeed for far more people, and the definition of its success doesn&#x27;t stop at finding a few stars who fill stadium seats.<p>On (2), there&#x27;s a difference between rooting for the participants and rooting for the system.  We like seeing people overcome obstacles whether they are fair or not.  I bet a lot of people would enjoy a movie about the Chinese family you describe building a better life for their kids.  I like movies about people overcoming gangsters, nazis, and tornados.  It doesn&#x27;t mean I want to fund gangsters, nazis and tornados to make more great stories.<p>Finally, I unequivocally agree on flipping the bird to anyone who judges the Chinatown mom for doing the best for her kid.  The issue is that a similarly brilliant kid shouldn&#x27;t be held back because they don&#x27;t have the same awesome mom.  And hey, maybe there are other great ways that three-job mom could be investing in her family and herself.')
