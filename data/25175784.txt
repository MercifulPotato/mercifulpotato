If you buy the low-end workstation Xeons the processor costs about the same. For example, Xeon W-1290 (10C, 5.2GHz turbo) has a $494 MSRP. The i9-10850K (also 10C, 5.2GHz turbo) has a $453 MSRP. You also have to buy a motherboard with a workstation chipset to use the Xeon, but W480 chipset motherboards are also priced about the same (~$200) as their consumer Z490 counterparts.<p>The real reason ECC is not common is because it is perceived as unnecessary for desktop workloads. Software crashes and corrupts data all the time because of bugs, not bitflips. Most consumers care so little about their data that a single hard drive crash will wipe it all out anyways. Why spend 12% extra on memory if consumers hardly see any value from it?')
