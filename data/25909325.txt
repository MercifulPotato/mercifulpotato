There is the duration of the 2% canary deploy where we start to see pick up of traffic, a 5 minute wait, then a 20% &quot;deploy&quot;, and a 5 minute wait. All in all this comes out to around 10-15ish minutes in canary. This is a stage where we can almost instantly shut off traffic to the canary deploy.<p>Could we reduce risk by lengthening the process? Maybe, but you also make deploys longer which means less stuff can get through in a day. This makes devs respond with larger PRs, for example, which increases the risk profile.<p>So we need to balance time and duration. Typically large problems will manifest quickly, or take a lot longer to detect (and thus are generally more minor problems) when you have our scale of a user base in my experience.')
