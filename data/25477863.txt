Now open source it and let the rest of the world save their citizens.<p>And who’s going to pay for it? The whole PPE shortage was exactly because of this entitled attitude. If you artificially limit prices, you’ll only limit the supply (to possibly nothing, as vaccines have high upfront costs), and enable scalpers.<p>One obvious solution is to have a UN initiative that buys the IP and opensources it. I don’t know how hard this is. Generally, one big problem is the lack of gratitude on the part of freeriders. Otherwise, the goodwill it generated for the sponsors would probably be enough to make it happen.<p>PS: I live in Iran. I am not defending my privilege here.')
