Actually I should know more about this since I took a lecture series with Krishnaswami on this topic. He combines the two type systems in a way that makes sense and can produce a programming language.<p>But yes, for the linearity control you&#x27;d need to model variables within the type system and indirect to a function handling h&#x27;s resource relationship instead of using it directly.<p>Formally I would like to compare linear types and dependent types and their ability to encode or not each other. I don&#x27;t know what the tools for that are.')
