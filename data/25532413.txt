That is, you would have thousands of adsets, and each adset would target a small slice of your target audience.<p>The theory behind micro-targeting was that your audience&#x27;s conversion rate varies considerably by certain key targeting attributes.  And, if your audience has varying conversion rates, your CPC bids ought to reflect this.<p>For example, let&#x27;s assume your LTV is $100.  And, let&#x27;s assume your average conversion rate is 1%, but actually, males convert at 0.5% and females convert at 1.5%.  If you do NOT split your audience by gender, you will be forced to bid $1 per click for every user.  However, if you split your audience by gender, you can bid $0.5 for men and $1.5 for females.  By splicing your audience, you gain considerable efficiency.  The theory behind micro-targeting was to find the permutations of targeting attributes that split your audience into segments with the most variance in conversion rates.<p>However, what&#x27;s happened over the past few years is that Facebook&#x27;s AI has become vastly better at doing micro-targeting than even the best individual marketers.  This is partly because they have more data than platform participants, but also because they have much smarter engineers.  As a result, it&#x27;s now become better to hand over targeting responsibilities to Facebook&#x27;s AI.  For the most part, you just tell them what you want the average CPA to be, and they do the targeting for you behind the scenes.')
