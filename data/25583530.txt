It is a plateau. Many will still want more and may be unhappy. At that point happiness must be sought by other means (love, community, esteem, self-actualization), which might indeed involve the application of money, but it requires doing something worthwhile (from the perspective of that individual). Something money enables, such as a bigger house isn&#x27;t enough (by itself).<p>It isn&#x27;t that money above 70k doesn&#x27;t improve wellbeing, but that isn&#x27;t sufficient by itself to do so.')
