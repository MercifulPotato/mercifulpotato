I&#x27;ve been offered either midazolam or gas &amp; air for colonoscopies and pretty sure my last couple of endoscopies were done without anything.<p>The movicol prep stuff they give you isn&#x27;t ideal either; you&#x27;ve got to drink a lot of odd tasting fluids that then give you basically explosive diorama which can be awful in itself. It also causes some people to explosively vomit as well (it&#x27;s designed to make your body want to eject it asap) which really isn&#x27;t fun when it&#x27;s trying to escape both ends at once.<p>The actual procedure isn&#x27;t amazing either. A camera down either end is uncomfortable at best ranging to extremely painful (short term) as they try and get round the corners in your bowel. There&#x27;s also the potential it to go wrong in some nasty ways or for odd side effects, and at absolute best, you&#x27;re still stuck on a table trying to make polite conversation with 2m of camera tube stuck up your bum.<p>Can confirm your refusal to confirm; none of it&#x27;s a thrilling or trivial experience.')
