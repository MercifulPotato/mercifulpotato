You don&#x27;t need credentials, just a willingness to study hard and Leetcode and you will get high paying jobs. Amazing, no gatekeeping at all like other professsion.<p>Software Engineering changed my life, and the life of my family. Me and my mom only had savings about $12k back then in 2015 and I lived in NYC, didn&#x27;t know that it would change my life when I started studying programming using that money.<p>Hate all you want about SWE and Leetcode and JavaScript (lol), but they paid my bills, and my family&#x27;s bills, and my old single mom&#x27;s bills.')
