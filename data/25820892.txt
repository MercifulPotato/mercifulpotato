I would expect that in a collision in space, some of the kinetic energy would be used in internal structural changes, and not all converted to the resulting motion.<p>Am I wrong here? If not, does it still preserve enough kinetic energy after collision to promote this chain reaction? And how long until lower space ring is actually unusable?')
