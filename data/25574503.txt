With the beta stuff (everything else), the driver is expected to always be alert and intervene where appropriate, so Tesla doesn&#x27;t have to be as aggressive on the safety side.<p>As it relates to the features, I agree that they aren&#x27;t ready for what most drivers expect, either because they aren&#x27;t reliable enough (beta) it because they aren&#x27;t confident enough (TACC). With that said, FSD is a feature set, not a level of reliability. As a whole it eventually needs to reach a level of reliability, but there&#x27;s no specific time horizon.<p>For Tesla, a feature moving from beta to alpha is what indicates reliability. In addition, that reliability may not come with the degree of confidence most people expect from a driver. Safe FSD could just end up as the AI equivalent to a student driver. It&#x27;ll get you someplace safely, but there may be phantom braking, excessive waiting, and so on. If that&#x27;s the case it would be nice if we could enable a beta version with more &quot;normal&quot; driving that we would have to keep an eye on.')
