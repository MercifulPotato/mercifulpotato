So I built a small server out of secondhand parts to offload those tasks away from my old laptop.<p>Using vscode&#x27;s remote development support (which lets you mount a remote machine in the editor as well as doing port forwarding), there is almost no change to my usual development routine but massive improvement to build time and battery life, for ~$300 in parts. I guess I will postpone upgrading my laptop again.<p>This setup also works outside of my home network because I use zerotier on both the laptop and the local server, though I also configured my router to expose the server&#x27;s ssh port in case I can&#x27;t use zerotier for some reason. I also configured autossh to connect to my small vps server and port-forward the local server&#x27;s ssh port there as an additional fallback because my isp sometime doesn&#x27;t assign a public ip when the modem is restarted.')
