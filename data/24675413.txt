It is stated that the range of such droplets is generally no more than 3 ft. We are unable to locate the basic science behind that assertion.<p>&gt; Whether contagious as a respiratory droplet, aerosol, or both, there have been no controlled studies to investigate the efficacy of respirators in preventing the transmission of influenza A<p>&gt; there is a theoretical problem in the logic underlying N–95 respirators. Assume an N–95 mask functions better than its rating and at a sedentary inhalation rate blocks 98% of the bioaerosols that it is confronted with. We are still left with the 2% that penetrate through the filter, to be inhaled by the wearer. Whether discussing tuberculosis, influenza, measles, or smallpox, we do not know the concentration of pathogenic bioaerosols in the environment, nor do we know the minimum infectious dose for these pathogens.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t think anyone disagrees with their conclusion that having everyone wear N100 masks is a good idea, but I&#x27;m not sure if any of their proposed methods are feasible. And the most important conclusion of their research is perhaps that we know way too little about possible countermeasures.')
