Item(by='Impossible', descendants=None, kids=[24934428, 24927608], score=None, time=1603906927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920043, text='<i>The number one question we’ve received about ALC is: “Why can’t I move the blocks around?” While we could absolutely design a tool that allows you to poke and prod down to the mil, there are already piles of tools that do that</i><p>I tried to spec out a quick small handheld console with two analog joysticks and four buttons and it was basically impossible to make something useful because of this constraint.  I understand auto-layout for non-input components but it makes input useless except for complete debug components.<p>For reference I was trying to build something similar to Adafruit PyGamer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;4242" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;4242</a>) with a second analog stick.')
