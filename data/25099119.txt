The oldest tags on its GitHub repo are for 2018. I think this defies &quot;people want to continue the legacy of actually-not-that-great thing because I had do suffer, so other people should too&quot;. I think you&#x27;d only put into making&#x2F;promoting Kakoune if you genuinely thought modal editing is a good thing.<p>Whereas, if the bigger value in &quot;I learned modal editing&quot; is the signal of &quot;modal editing is hard, so anyone who knows it must be good&quot; (rather than value from a better developer experience), I think aiming to make modal editing more intuitive&#x2F;accessible is counter-productive.')
