Even fewer actually verify them. That has nothing to do with how easy Git makes it to impersonate commits. In fact, whether you sign or not, you can still easily impersonate commits <i>with any Git tool</i> unless the person on the <i>other</i> end actively verifies the signature. (Which GitHub makes much <i>easier</i> than git, since they also maintain &amp; automatically check a verified mapping of email -&gt; GPG key, instead of you having to somehow get the key and then make sure it&#x27;s the right one and then explicitly tell git to verify the signature)<p>I am well aware that you can sign commits with Git. I do, personally and professionally, and my coworkers and I are required to, by policy that I wrote. That has absolutely no bearing on the topic at hand even tangentially.')
