That&#x27;s likely why philosophy is often so semantics heavy. Your example is apt.<p>OTOH, I do think that there are different levels of &quot;bogged down in semantics.&quot;<p>Semantics <i>can</i> sometimes interesting in their own right. That&#x27;s rarely a help though. The semantics are generally not interesting as used to try and win a debate.<p>Getting back to the original point, I think the semantic arguments are usually the shallower ones. That&#x27;s not bad in itself, but being a bog, moving past semantics is a rarity once in. That tends to get annoying and boring faster than rehashing a repetitive but substantive discussion.<p>Say we&#x27;re discussing the existence of god. &quot;<i>What if I consider god to be the universe itself?</i>&quot; might be interesting on first pass, but it&#x27;s kind of boring by the third time. Environmental sustainability. It might be interesting to reflect on the etymology or politics of the term &quot;sustainable&quot; in the context it&#x27;s used today. It rarely gets us to a more nuanced view though. Usually, it just keeps the debate in shallow water. what does the word &quot;really&quot; mean. What words should we use.<p>As I said, I think it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that there is no escape. Professional philosophers get stuck in semantics regularly. OTOH, a forum is probably somewhat susceptible to shallowness (semantics are just one type) regardless. After all, it&#x27;s a casual medium.')
