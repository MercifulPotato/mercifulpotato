The correct statement is that the concept of &quot;elapsed time&quot; does not apply to a photon; it only applies to timelike worldlines, not null worldlines.<p>To put it another way, if your statement were true, it would mean that the origin and destination events were the same point in spacetime. But they&#x27;re not; they&#x27;re distinct points in spacetime. Which means that, since the spacetime interval along the worldline is zero, you can&#x27;t use the interval to distinguish points on the photon&#x27;s worldline. And the concept of &quot;elapsed time&quot; <i>requires</i> that you be able to do that. So the concept of &quot;elapsed time&quot; can&#x27;t be used for a photon.')
