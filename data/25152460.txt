Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605809781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151683, text='&gt;<i>freedom of association&quot; as a negative concept</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it is negative <i>as a concept</i>. I agree that, in theory, it is best to always err on the side of more freedom, not less. In practice, however, it can become negative if you think people don&#x27;t always act rationally. Which is why I don&#x27;t know if the right to work is good policy; part of me feels like it takes advantage of humans short-term bias, and leads them to limit their own long-term rational best interests.<p>It&#x27;s very much like the social media debate going on right now. Part of me just wants to say it&#x27;s better to have a completely open marketplace and let the chips fall where they may. But another part of me feels like there is a very real danger this will hijack human psychological shortcomings in a way that is not good long term. Maybe the clich√© that &quot;people get the government they deserve&quot; is the closest I can get to reconciling the two.')
