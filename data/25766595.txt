Thanks for finding it.<p>I&#x27;d rather believe this was a combination of natural phenomenon and instrumentation failure than an alien visiting us from far far away.<p>After reading the text that doubt is definitely still strong.<p>It starts with conflicting reports from people on the ground.<p>They are never able to identify what it was.<p>And also the text reads as if it was written by a &quot;believer&quot; if you know what I mean.<p>Take this for example; WHEN THE &#x27;F?4&#x27; TURNED FROM THE OBJECT AND APPARENTLY WAS NO LONGER A THREAT TO IT THE AIRCRAFT REGAINED ALL INSTRUMENTATION<p>That to me reads like someone who has watched too many scifi movies.<p>And the report goes on to say that a 2nd object came out of the original object and was estimated to be &quot;half to one third the apparent size of the moon&quot;. wtf?<p>This whole report makes me question the sanity of everyone involved. And since it&#x27;s now declassified why won&#x27;t any of the at least 5 airmen involved step forwards?<p>And besides all that, what motive would these aliens have to come here and fly around with their light shows once a decade?')
