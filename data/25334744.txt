Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607363544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334347, text='I mean this in the best possible way, try punching &quot;529 Plan&quot; into Google.<p>The point of the comment, which I&#x27;m not sure why it was being downvoted, is why something might sound newsworthy (<i>14</i> college funds?) when it really has a simple, logical explanation if you&#x27;re sophisticated with money. And in the same breath, in applause of a guy performing a tax optimization, the original poster shits on the state - did it create this tax loophole? Do you think the people running government want college to be expensive?<p>Rich people, really everyone with heritable wealth, love the 529 plan. If you understood that it is used to create multi-purpose, heritable investment accounts tax-free in vast excess of the actual cost of tuition - that anyone who would have a hard time paying Harvard&#x27;s tuition goes for free anyway - you would detect some insincerity in &quot;14 college funds&quot; too!<p>And maybe consider that this 529 plan remains the status quo, this <i>total</i> tax dodge, because of people who have this romanticized picture of it being used to pay expensive college tuitions. We&#x27;re talking about a family so sophisticated that it&#x27;s probably going to change legal guardians on those very same children in order to benefit from free tuition anyway.<p>It&#x27;s a great story. We certainly want our brainiacs spending resources &quot;hacking&quot; some shitty institution like the lottery. On the other hand, you think he doesn&#x27;t take beyond his measure from the government too?')
