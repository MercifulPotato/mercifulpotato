The real brilliantness of Emacs is that almost everything is an Emacs buffer. The interface is extremely uniform: text file, configuration menu, completion buffer, compilation log, IRC chat window, it&#x27;s all the same &quot;widget&quot; with just some customization (keybinds, coloring) on top. You can always copy&#x2F;paste text the way you&#x27;re used to, navigate the buffer the way you&#x27;re used to, everything is uniform and consistent.<p>Ever felt the frustration of having an application pop-up a modal with an error message and you want to search for it online, only to realize that you can&#x27;t select the text so you have to copy it by hand? That can&#x27;t happen in Emacs. Ever been annoyed that your custom bindings and shortcuts didn&#x27;t work in all the parts of your editor? That the way you interact in the main text editor is different from the input box in the search dialog? In Emacs it&#x27;s all the same thing.<p>I switched to Vim a couple of years ago but this uniform interface is still something I miss. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll bite the bullet and use Spacemacs.')
