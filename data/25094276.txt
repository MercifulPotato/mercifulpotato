The big 4 will grind you to the bone, but boutiques often pay better and have much more reasonable expectations of time commitment. I donâ€™t see consulting ever going back to the weekly travel model, and during the pandemic I work maybe 30 hours a week while pulling in the salary I do. Most of my work involves going to meetings, understanding complex business architecture and providing advice around niche topics while working within the politics of a various org. Pulling in a salary+bonus in this range with very little risk on my part.')
