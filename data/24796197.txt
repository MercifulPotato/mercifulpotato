The possibilities in terms of medical and industrial applications seems hard to overstate.<p>Related, but one of the best talks I&#x27;ve ever seen was this 2018 talk on the subject. It gets into how organisms seem to have bioelectrical patterns that store information separately from genomic, anatomical states. These bioelectrical patterns play a huge role in developmental processes, as they appear to control how the organism is structured at a high level. As a layman and a programmer, to me it sounds like the genome is the actual implementation of a function and the bioelectrical pattern is the sequence of functions you want to execute.  They&#x27;re able to manipulate these bioelectrical patterns to do things like replace a worms tail with another head.  It&#x27;s absolutely crazy to think about what could be possible here.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RjD1aLm4Thg&amp;t=0s&amp;index=6&amp;list=LLezTLfb6xy-ZOXNY3QWMfFQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RjD1aLm4Thg&amp;t=0s&amp;index=6&amp;lis...</a>')
