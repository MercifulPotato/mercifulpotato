You would still be able to schedule workloads on multiple cores as usual, but if they&#x27;re all in the same &quot;trusted&quot; set, you can skip side-channel mitigations and recover performance. The system would still fall back to using the mitigations when you have too much work to be able to keep workload sets isolated via scheduling.')
