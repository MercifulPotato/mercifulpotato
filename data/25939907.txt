Early aircraft mechanical fuel injection systems contained an altitude-compensating aneroid, but I doubt early automotive models did.<p>Many small recreational aircraft still use altitude-compensating carburetors that contain aneroids that act on needle valves to compensate for altitude.<p>Even today, the oxygen sensor is a relatively expensive part, and it&#x27;s possible that early electronic automotive fuel injectors didn&#x27;t measure and compensate for oxygen concentration in the exhaust.<p>So, an old automobile retrofitted with an aircraft altitude-compensating carburetor may very well compensate for altitude better than an early fuel injected automobile.  Though, I assume only a handful of cars have ever been retrofitted with altitude-compensating carburetors.')
