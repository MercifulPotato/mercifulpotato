By functions as a service do you mean functionality hosted by me or shipping serverless functions with the codebase? At the moment you get any necessary server logic as serverless functions (formatted correctly for your chosen host) or if you choose &quot;Other&quot; for your host you get an Express.js server. Definitely interested in supporting AWS cognito&#x2F;dynamo&#x2F;s3 or bundling all that up into an AWS Amplify option.')
