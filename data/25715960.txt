On one hand, you claim these platforms &quot;amplify&quot; hate speech, and on the other hand, you want to push them to other platforms.<p>...but it is exactly that isolation that create the bubble induced amplification of hate-speech.<p>If everyone was forced to exist on the same platform (as a though experiment) then hate-speech would have to co-exist with rational thinkers and their hateful ideas might not propagate much.<p>...but the moment you ban&#x2F;deplatform&#x2F;censor&#x2F;etc... then they begin to form isolated groups with no counter-balance of rationality.')
