The FSB will embed an exploit in it in attempts to hack you? Because you will divulge private information(beyond playing the game) to the FSB? It&#x27;s unclear what the threat you are trying to combat is.<p>This is besides the point(I am ready to believe for the sake of argument that Yandex is indeed owned by the FSB), but the wikipedia page you linked doesn&#x27;t seem to support your argument. It seems like Yandex is trying to thread the needle between legal law enforcement requests and the safety and privacy of their users. Here&#x27;s the full quote you ellipsed:<p>&gt; In June 2019, RBC News reported that Yandex had refused a request by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) under the Yarovaya law to surrender encryption keys that could decrypt the private data of its e-mail service and cloud storage users. The company argued that it was possible to comply with the relevant law without compromising its users&#x27; privacy.[82] Maxim Akimov, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, said that the government will take action to relieve FSB pressure on the company.[83] Alexander Zharov, head of the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, subsequently said that Yandex and the FSB had reached an agreement where the company would provide the required data without handing over the encryption keys.[84]')
