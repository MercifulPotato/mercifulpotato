The whole network design, thermal&#x2F;mechanical design, and floor plan is built with certain assumptions and they can&#x27;t just go in and rack up some new machines. It evolves pretty slowly and when a facility gets a new machine it is because they refresh the whole thing, or a large subset of it.<p>That said, the EPYC machine type is available in 12 zones of four different regions in the US, which isn&#x27;t bad.')
