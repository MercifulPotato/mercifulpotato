It might be that something about the individual person&#x27;s biochemistry or health history (like prior exposure to a different corona strain) is the cause of the false result. If that&#x27;s the case, then people who receive a false result on this type of test will tend to always receive false results, and testing more often won&#x27;t help much.')
