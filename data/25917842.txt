That&#x27;s also the best way to determine whether or not he&#x27;s lying.<p>If he&#x27;s consistently lucky, then he&#x27;s good.<p>Probabilistic tails are narrow but they do exist. By that, I mean you shouldn&#x27;t assume that something isn&#x27;t worth discussing just because it is improbable. That approach stifles the free exchange of thoughts and ideas, and neglects the reality that some people <i>are</i> in fact talented at things that most people can&#x27;t do.<p>PS I didn&#x27;t say <i>you</i> specifically downvoted the guy, but we as a collective have downvoted several of his comments on this article, and you as an individual are trivializing his (claimed) experience as luck.')
