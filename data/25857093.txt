But gosh, how many products like currency converter or something exist which have a lot of users and revenue.<p>My points:<p>1. If your project is useful for people some of them will use it<p>2. It doesn&#x27;t matter if free versions exists. People by coffee in stores (cheap) and in Starbucks (expensive). People order taxi (paid), when they can use autobus (might be free or very cheap).<p>3. But your product should be a bit better or at least the same as others<p>4. Now, one crucial moment is pricing. Once I posted my product on reddit and was surprised that people started comparing my pricing to competitors, and they were complaining about it. But still. I know a guy whose prices are literally x3-x5 higher than others, while his app is not that good, and he still has ~$4000 revenue per month<p>BUT<p>Keep in mind, that if you&#x27;re not going into &quot;business way&quot; meaning instantly paying ads&#x2F;watching conversions&#x2F;investing&#x2F;taking risks etc, it may take a LONG time (1-3 years) to get exposure<p>In a nutshell: just make a good app, put pricing (average among competitors) and start talking about it everywhere for a year. If the app is good, it&#x27;ll bring you money (at least there is probability)')
