The former could potentially he outdated within months, the latter likely won&#x27;t be used until it&#x27;s been tested for <i>decades</i>.<p>So obviously a 30-year patent is potentially paralyzing in webdev, yet might even be <i>too short</i> in space tech!<p>The problem is there simply isn&#x27;t any duration that can satisfy both fields.<p>Meanwhile, often patents don&#x27;t benefit <i>anyone</i> because they&#x27;re 1) more trouble than they&#x27;re worth to actually enforce, and only serve to reinforce the incumbents who don&#x27;t need them, and 2) are in some cases deliberately written to be meaningless and uncommunicative, which defeats the purpose of open publishing in the first place.<p>Every law might have upsides, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that patents are fundamentally flawed.')
