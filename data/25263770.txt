That is insane and stupid and incredibly fucked up. I&#x27;ve had to rent Macs in the cloud on a rare basis to test certain latest-version Safari issues, and it&#x27;s always a crap connection and a miserable experience. But is it enforceable for them to stipulate the minimum length of time of a VM lease?! That&#x27;s your machine. You paid for it. If you want to rent it out to someone for 3 hours that&#x27;s your prerogative. I don&#x27;t see how they can possibly enforce that or how it could be legal as a seller to tell someone how to use their hardware.')
