This is a pretty good proxy for accessibility too i.e. things that can be clicked look like they can be to the machine. A quick document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;a&#x27;) and document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;button&#x27;) in the console verifies that there are no such elements.<p>Another one, basic browser features like backswipe on the trackpad to go back just doens&#x27;t work.<p>Custom user agent stylesheets is another accessibility&#x2F;power user feature that will not work<p>You cannot select any text as far as I can tell<p>Reader mode doesn’t work, not even on the news demo which is a prime example of where it should work<p>You cannot copy or preview link URLs<p>You cannot copy image URLs<p>Navigating by landmarks(such as headings) probably also doesn’t work(I haven’t tried this yet)')
