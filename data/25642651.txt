This and other geographical features led to the early idea of melting water flows on mars millions of years ago creating grooves and valleys, not just from volcanic activity.<p>So this is far from &quot;new&quot; news. It&#x27;s just getting way more modern research with way better hardware (thanks to 12yrs of HIRISE data).<p>I&#x27;m mostly paraphrasing this from watching an old video of the NASA funded project on YouTube where they did what HIRISE is doing with way more primitive tech and old computer terminals.<p>Edit: I found it, &quot;The Planet Mars (1979)&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dZzY8-nxabA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dZzY8-nxabA</a><p>(Highly recommended watch, it shows original feeds of old badass NASA nerds working together on the lander. In one scene it shows a computer slowly getting a photo print out from the actual satellites on a terminal screen, with the team getting giddy at seeing these shots beaming directly from space).')
