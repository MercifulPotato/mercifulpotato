According to Wikipedia, the rotor ship Buckau could sail within 20-30 degrees of the wind, though I suspect that is a misreading of the supposed source of that data, and that 50-60 degrees is a more plausible figure. Similarly, I suspect the claim that they can sail closer to the wind than conventional sailing vessels is in comparison to square-rigged ships.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotor_ship#Pioneers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotor_ship#Pioneers</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=9lqwg3iZyH0C&amp;pg=PA656#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=9lqwg3iZyH0C&amp;pg=PA656#v=on...</a>')
