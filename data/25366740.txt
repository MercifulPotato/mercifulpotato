Government is restricted from preventing the free exchange of ideas, but private industry is not. However, government is free to mandate us to stay in our homes and not see anybody, thus leaving us with privately owned telecommunications companies as the only way to communicate with others, and they are free to prevent speech.<p>Wow... funny how this all works out so convienently.<p>But really this is dystopia level rhetoric. &quot;Your freedom to speech is not really being restricted. It&#x27;s just that because you&#x27;re locked in your house (since being outside talking to your friend is apparently not a fundamental freedom), you can&#x27;t actually talk to anyone because your private sector companies say so.&quot;')
