Item(by='young_unixer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603157122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831699, text='Free software and proprietary software have big incentive problems, but the problems are different:<p>In proprietary software, acting in a scummy way many times doesn&#x27;t result in loss of profits, it may even increase profits.<p>Free software has the problem that usually there are no hierarchies and, consequently, no responsibilities. That makes it harder to imprint a coherent vision on a project. It also makes it harder for non-software people (graphic designers et al)  to join, since complex cross-discipline ventures require a lot of organization and structure. QA, writing docs and other &quot;boring&quot; jobs become an afterthought.<p>I think the way to fix this is making free software organizations akin to commercial entities in their internal organization: have bosses and pay salaries, but still be non-profits so that the incentive to be scummy is small. The source of income being, obviously, donations.')
