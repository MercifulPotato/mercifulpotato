This reviewer is perfectly proud of the fact that a newbie doesn&#x27;t stand a chance against a veteran player.<p>But that also makes it a terrible party game. There should always be benefits to experience and skill, but the near complete lack of randomness in Dominion, compared to something simpler like Ascension, makes it really unpleasant to play if there&#x27;s a skill gap.')
