That being said, others have asked us about this recently as well. I&#x27;ll paste a reply I made the other day on Reddit:<p>Your concerns are well founded! I&#x27;ve certainly been burned by services disappearing...<p>It&#x27;s a compromise to have a business model that allows us to develop Charm full-time vs. being completely open source. Our plan is to have a business model similar to GitHub: free and low cost services for individuals with enterprise hosting options (colo or hosted by us).<p>One thing that I think we should do is allow for a very easy export of all of your data. We can build that into glow and charm (vs. having to email us and ask for it or some other draconian option).<p>This is very much a 1.0 release of the Charm Cloud and one of the reasons we wanted to ship it early was to get feedback from the community and build out the features our users want. Your point is a great one that we should solve for ASAP. A glow export feature that spits out a .tar.gz of all your stashed markdowns seems like a great idea.<p>We&#x27;re also open sourcing the libraries we use to build glow and charm, most of which don&#x27;t require the Charm Cloud. We just made our TUI framework Bubble Tea open source for instance:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;charmbracelet&#x2F;bubbletea" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;charmbracelet&#x2F;bubbletea</a><p>We also have a library for applying JSON stylesheets to Markdown called Glamour that is independent of the Charm Cloud (and currently in use in GitHub&#x27;s cli):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;charmbracelet&#x2F;glamour" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;charmbracelet&#x2F;glamour</a><p>Thanks for your question, it&#x27;s a problem worth addressing.')
