To put these numbers into context though, Speedtest&#x2F;Ookla reported an average USA broadband speed of 135 Mbps and an average worldwide broadband speed of 64 Mbps for 2019 [1], rising every year.<p>It&#x27;s a lot harder to measure latency, though, which is the biggest variable IMO for whether Stadia works for you. It doesn&#x27;t work well on my parents&#x27; HughesNet satellite internet, but I regularly got &lt;4ms ping when I lived in Kansas City and rarely go above 10ms round trip here in Oregon (on Comcast, even!). They seem to have done really well with their edge node placements, because even in small cities like Joplin&#x2F;Bentonville (both around 50k pop.) and in Netarts (800 pop.!) the latency feels on par with native games. Luna latency here in Portland spikes to multiples seconds at a time on occasion, and GeForce Now was pretty much unplayable in many cities&#x2F;towns outside of Kansas City back in the Midwest (but seems to work fine most of the time here). In my experience, Stadia&#x27;s been by far the most consistent experience wherever I went.<p>I&#x27;d wager that the the subset of [people Stadia would work well for but they think their connection isn&#x27;t good enough so they don&#x27;t try it] is larger than the subset of [people that would try Stadia but don&#x27;t have a good enough connection for it].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.speedtest.net&#x2F;insights&#x2F;blog&#x2F;global-index-2019-internet-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.speedtest.net&#x2F;insights&#x2F;blog&#x2F;global-index-2019-in...</a>')
