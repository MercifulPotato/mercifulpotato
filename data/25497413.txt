In particular, conflicts happen between two patches, and are solved by a patch.<p>This means for example that when you solve a conflict on a branch, and pull from the same remote, the conflict won&#x27;t reappear (no `git rerere` needed).<p>Or that you can push a conflict resolution to a remote, even if that remote is in another state: as long as the remote has the conflicting patches, the resolution will work.')
