Andrew Yang has spoken about this better than I could off the top of my head, but to add a few things about our system (which does work very well from a global perspective):<p>* The stigma (in non-covid times) toward &quot;dole bludgers&quot; is pretty significant. We&#x27;re a pretty egalitarian society, but there&#x27;s a fairly common distain towards welfare recipients. This would likely be reduced if everyone was receiving the payment.<p>* You mentioned that recipients receive payments even if they quit or can&#x27;t be bothered getting a job. That&#x27;s kind of the situation with the current payment (JobSeeker), which was created last year when covid hit. The usual adult benefit (formally called Newstart allowance) had very strict &quot;mutual obligations&quot; and required you to apply for N number of jobs per fortnight otherwise your benefits were cut (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servicesaustralia.gov.au&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;topics&#x2F;mutual-obligation-requirements&#x2F;29751" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servicesaustralia.gov.au&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;topics&#x2F;mutu...</a>). Also, if you quit a job you would have a cooldown period (usually 8 weeks) before you would receive benefits (with exceptions for injuries, redundancy, etc).<p>* Rent assistance is basically guaranteed. If you pay rent, you will get a portion of this covered.<p>* Our welfare program also includes a pharmaceutical discount (almost all prescription meds are $6.60 for recipients).<p>It&#x27;s a really decent program overall, but it&#x27;s not UBI.')
