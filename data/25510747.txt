I mean, from a IP standpoint I get why they do it but... it also burns your <i>most</i> loyal fans. Despite the abuse, Nintendo&#x27;s fans are still as avid as ever, but now fan projects have to be made entirely in secret and then explosively released so that Nintendo can&#x27;t shut it down before it gets traction (see: AM2R [1], Full Screen Mario, etc.). I just can&#x27;t believe how hostile Nintendo is to its fans - from C&amp;Ds to fanmade games to heavy handed streaming rules on YouTube...<p>I mean, I still love their games but if they just muzzled their lawyers a bit they would be one of the most loved companies on the planet.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DNkqKC7nwls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DNkqKC7nwls</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AM2R" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AM2R</a>')
