And Firefox has this weird issue that now\nand then a newly opened tab doesn&#x27;t focus the address bar,\nforcing me to use the mouse to select it.<p>And I still don&#x27;t get this trend in some newer software to make\ntab switching via Ctrl-[Shift]-Tab feel like the lottery instead\nof just going to the one on the left or right. There&#x27;s a reason\nwe can reorder tabs by dragging them around, and a reason our\nkeyboards have more than just those three keys, and &quot;fidget cube\nreplacement&quot; is not it.<p>Sometimes I wonder if the UI designers never use their own\nproducts or just aren&#x27;t aware that building habits for chains of\nworkarounds should not be the normal way to interact with\ncomputers. &#x2F;rant')
