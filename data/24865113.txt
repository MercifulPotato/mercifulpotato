The same way - they get paid money for it and have benefits, duh.<p>Escalate appropriately to targetting family - you know the same way they would if crazed vegans attacked a meat packing worker. Anyone so cowardly they cannot accept working for a living for an entity &#x2F;with a legal monopoly on use of force&#x2F; has no business being a police officer.
