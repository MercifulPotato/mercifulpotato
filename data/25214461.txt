Participating in this kind of litigation also costs millions and attracts public attention, leading to innumerable second-order effects (eg. public relations damage, law reform) that are hard to predict and may be more significant than whatever specific legal decision a judge makes. So being able to put a numerical probability on the legal opinion “we think the company has a good chance of winning this case” may not be that helpful.')
