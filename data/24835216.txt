Where would Britain have been without it&#x27;s sea power, the RAF, huge numbers of recruits from Imperial colonies, the USA. However that doesn&#x27;t really reduce it&#x27;s significance, it just puts it in context. When thinking about the invasion of Normandy we naturally think of thousands of troops rushing up the beaches from landing craft, but without air power those landings would have been impossible. Similarly many of our efforts were enabled or materially supported by high quality intelligence.<p>I think it&#x27;s best thinking about it in the same terms as air and sea power. It&#x27;s another domain of conflict that supports the action on the ground, and in fact in all the other domains of conflict. It can make a huge, even essential contribution, but none of them is decisive on it&#x27;s own.<p>The point about GCHQ is interesting and I&#x27;d not thought about their importance to the UK in quite those terms but it does make sense. Our armed forces punch well above their weight, but our primary asset is actually our relationship with the USA, and our value to the USA may well be primarily in the Intelligence arena.')
