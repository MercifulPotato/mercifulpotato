Most electric cars are re-charged once a day, which is about the same as a phone.<p>&gt; Must operate in a much wider variety of conditions than a phone<p>Also, not really true if you look at the range of temperature and conditions an iPhone is rated for. (Including water resistance. Mine went through a <i>washing machine cycle</i> and came out fine.)<p>&gt; iPhones don&#x27;t need to pass crash tests<p>iPhones protected highly delicate components against hard impact on concrete. That requires similar engineering delicacy as protecting human meat in car crashes.<p>&gt; Brakes... suspension<p>The complexity of the accelerometers and camera systems deal with similar engineering challenges of the same quality.<p>&gt; iPhones weight orders of magnitude less than a car<p>Does weighing less make something <i>harder</i> to engineer? If anything making complex machines that are feather-weight seems more challenging. Certainly you&#x27;d acknowledge that smartphones are harder to build than mainframes, even though the latter is an order of magnitude heavier.<p>&gt; Regulatory requirements are way less stringent for phones<p>This is true. But given Apple&#x27;s unrelenting engineering excellence, there&#x27;s very little chance they&#x27;ll design a substandard or unsafe product. Therefore regulatory compliance is merely an issue of hiring enough lawyers. Apple has plenty of cash to hire lawyers. Certainly much more than GM.<p>&gt; Lights<p>iPhones definitely have lights.')
