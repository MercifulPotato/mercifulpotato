I just redeemed 77K for a one-way business class flight from SFO to IST non-stop on Turkish, which was priced at $2000 on a half-round-trip basis ($0.025).<p>It&#x27;s actually quite easy to get $0.015 on United when redeeming for economy class. Maybe Pandemic pricing is messing with the numbers, but this shouldn&#x27;t be too challenging most of the time. They don&#x27;t impose fuel surcharges which helps a lot.')
