In a natural monopoly, the high barrier to entry means it&#x27;s essentially wasteful to encourage competition.<p>For example, imagine operating the first power plant in a desert region. If it&#x27;s expensive to set up power plants, then there won&#x27;t be much point in encouraging competition; no one else will want to set up one. The operators of the power plant have a natural monopoly.<p>It would be better to spend the resources required for a second power plant on servicing customers elsewhere instead of fighting over the same territory â€” so the monopoly is &quot;good&quot; in the sense that it disincentivizes a bad allocation of capital.<p>Generally, natural monopolies get regulated (e.g. a power authority blessed by the local government operates the power plant instead of a private firm).')
