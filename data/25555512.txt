I spent most of my working life in food service (read: broke) and then 6 years as a massage therapist at a high end practice. I taught myself Ruby and JavaScript in between clients and on breaks.<p>It was already a good decision pre-pandemic, but if I was still a waiter or an MT, we would have been just so horribly fucked. I would have basically had months of no work or income, which would force me to go back to work during the pandemic. I&#x27;m so grateful that I don&#x27;t do that kind of work anymore. I literally don&#x27;t know how we would have gotten by.')
