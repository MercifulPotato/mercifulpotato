Item(by='andai', descendants=None, kids=[25228124], score=None, time=1606475111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219047, text='I&#x27;d say a small dose of mushrooms (or LSD, but less experience there) is actually more likely to be a positive experience than weed edibles. Most people I know who have had bad experiences with drugs had it with edibles (or even just weed). Of course, due to the culture, weed is considered more &quot;normal&quot; in most countries than psychedelics, which is somewhat ironic in my experience.<p>To be clear, not implying that weed can&#x27;t be wonderful or that you can&#x27;t have a bad trip on psychedelics, just speaking from what I&#x27;ve experienced, seen and heard from others.')
