Back during the big UPS strike in the 90s, the Montgomery, Alabama warehouse had the highest picket crossing rate in the entire country. This location is probably a best case scenario for Amazon because even if the union succeeds in forming, it has a high probability of failure, especially in any labor action it attempts as finding replacement workers will be easy and there is little public support for unions in the community. They won&#x27;t be able to get away with any intimidation or below board retaliatory actions on those who don&#x27;t go along with the union action.<p>The situation is almost so ideal for Amazon that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if someone high up in the company planned for this to be the location to try to unionize in order to poison the whole concept. They won&#x27;t even need to play games with shutting down the warehouse as union failure at this location is highly probable.')
