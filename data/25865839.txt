Otherwise, we don&#x27;t have the resources to support at this time.<p>So Electron is not the reason this request was denied.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong that Google is blocking login from embedded webviews, but the thing is that Google is <i>separately</i> blocking logins from embedded webviews. It&#x27;s a different situation that&#x27;s unrelated to their Widevine licensing. If what you were saying was correct, then the Castlabs Electron framework[0] wouldn&#x27;t have Widevine support, and it does.<p>It&#x27;s not about embedded engines, it&#x27;s about Open Source.<p>----<p>&gt; which is why the inclusion of DRM in webstandards was widely debated in the first place.<p>My take on this is that you would be right -- it would be weird to complain about Google refusing to set up a licensing scheme for Widevine -- if not for the fact that:<p>A) they were a part of the campaign for DRM inclusion in the first place, even while people argued that it would hamper browser innovation, so the problem we&#x27;re in is in no small part their fault,<p>B) the fact that they control both Widevine licensing and the dominant desktop browser (and the fact that they have used that control to harass even mainstream browsers like Brave[1]) constitutes something at least adjacent to anticompetitive behavior,<p>and C) the fact that they&#x27;re willing to license Widevine to Open Source browsers like Brave and Firefox suggests that there isn&#x27;t a fundamental problem with Open Source that means it couldn&#x27;t interact with this DRM in a way that&#x27;s acceptable to Google.<p>Add those 3 points together, and I feel like it&#x27;s reasonable to ask Google what they&#x27;re doing and why they&#x27;re doing it, and to expect them to have some kind of answer as to how they&#x27;re going to maintain control of Widevine without cutting off the legs of browser innovation and using web standards to shut out competitors.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;castlabs&#x2F;electron-releases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;castlabs&#x2F;electron-releases</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;browser-laptop&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10449#issuecomment-323800130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;browser-laptop&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10449#issueco...</a>')
