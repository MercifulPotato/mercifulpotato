Unfortunately, the crutch only takes you to the bottom of the hill, no more.<p>And then suddenly, you&#x27;re in a crowd of people who have made mistakes, recognize mistakes made and correct mistakes instead without an instructor. Sort of like swimming out to the ocean with water wings on and suddenly they start to deflate.<p>That&#x27;s when this starts to look like a fatal error rather than an easily recoverable one &amp; even if you survive it, you&#x27;re stuck with a permanent impostor syndrome.')
