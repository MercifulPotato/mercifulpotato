Fucking Glenn Greenwald. Jesus.<p>This is neither &quot;monopolistic&quot;, nor is it &quot;force&quot;. Words still have meaning.<p>First, obviously it&#x27;s not monopolistic; quite obviously, Parler is still <i>entirely free</i> to roll its own hosting, even if every host out there shuns them.<p>Second, for reasons I hope I don&#x27;t have to explain, this isn&#x27;t &quot;force&quot;. This is the opposite of force. This is peaceably retreating from doing business with Parler.<p>I don&#x27;t know what happened to Glenn Greenwald about 10 years ago, but something definitely happened.')
