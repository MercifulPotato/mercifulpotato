There is very little diversity of thought or ability to see multiple dimensions in the general public, so why should I expect it in journalism (well, it&#x27;s supposed to be their job, but that&#x27;s obviously old fashioned).<p>&gt; Why would it be weird? Is there an alternate perspective where the nation&#x27;s capitol wasn&#x27;t ransacked by a hostile mob?  What other interpretations are you imagining would be reported?<p>This is an example of the above.  You see this event as: &quot;The nation&#x27;s capitol was ransacked by a hostile mob.&quot;<p>There is so much more to this story, so many obvious (to me) questions, and even other details in the coordinated narrative running in the media.  Yet here you are, <i>rhetorically representing</i> that a &quot;mob&quot; &quot;ransacking the capital&quot; is all there is to it.  And it&#x27;s not just you, this sort of <i>obvious</i>(?) distortion of reality is becoming extremely common in culture war threads.  I point it out regularly, and I&#x27;ve never had a single person touch the topic.  Either they will reply but completely dodge the question as if they didn&#x27;t see it, or they will say asking such questions are absurd or inappropriate, or simply not reply.  To me, this mass change in the ~&quot;collective consciousness&quot; of the population is completely fascinating.')
