The increased attention and varied perspective represents the beliefs and desires of more people than just a majority as measured one way (e.g., by political party.)<p>By contrast, a single-house legislature fulfills the desires of a national majority population the most quickly, which is what you are advocating for. This is at the expense of more careful consideration.<p>In other words, we do not agree on the definition of representation as you see it as maximizing activity and I see it as maximizing consideration.')
