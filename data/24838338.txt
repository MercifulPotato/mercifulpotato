I know it is very popular,and probably in the top 5 use cases, and I use some of them everyday.  but in my experience they&#x27;ve always been off in their own world in relation to the rest of the python community. Most of the people I&#x27;ve met that use this stuff are either scientists or finance people that are just using it as another tool along with matlab, R, and excel.  Which is what they should be doing, but in their minds they&#x27;re not writing python code they&#x27;re using Pandas, Jupyter, and Matplotlib.<p>But yes, never ever jump on a new release of anything, at least in production. Always stand back and wait for someone more optimistic to find the bugs')
