So it doesn&#x27;t make sense for people to worry their kids will suffer a bad world due to climate change. They&#x27;ll most likely enjoy a better world than us despite climate change.<p>I am sorry, but this is just delusional. Perhaps the biggest catastrophes will be averted, but only with great effort that our children and grandchildren will have to endure.')
