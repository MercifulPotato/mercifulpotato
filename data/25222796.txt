I&#x27;ve asked the editor to correct it.<p>You are correct, IH was started in 2016, I could have sworn it was started earlier.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to put an exact date on this, but I entered university in 2010 and I remembered reading about startups almost from my first or second year.<p>Paul Grahams essays, Zero to One, The Family (french thing), Rocket Internet, VC etc.<p>This whole thing kind of fascinated me, but reading about it felt like watching a soccer game. I was just a spectator of a world I though I could never be a part of. Probably a mix of lack of confidence and unwillingness to takes risks.<p>But then I discovered this whole bootstrapping thing, IH, Rob&#x27;s books, Kalzumeus essays and for the first time, I was reading about thing I could see myself doing.<p>Even though you didn&#x27;t ask, I hope it clears things up :)<p>PS: My english being a bit clunky, this article was editorialized quite a bit<p>PSS: Thanks for the kind words')
