Also scripts are generally developed by a room of writers, not any single one.<p>But the reality is that it <i>is</i> monitored, but certainly not self-monitored -- it&#x27;s monitored by <i>advertisers</i>. If an pilot or episode isn&#x27;t acceptable, advertisers will yank their money in a heartbeat.<p>This is why mostly all sitcoms preach a &quot;conventional&quot; middle-class morality, because that&#x27;s specifically what advertisers find palatable. It&#x27;s also why the first dark&#x2F;shocking drama on TV -- <i>The Sopranos</i> -- was only possible on a network that was subscriber-supported instead of advertiser-supported, namely HBO.')
