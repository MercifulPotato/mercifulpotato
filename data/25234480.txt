When I&#x27;ve taken the time to ask black friends and black professionals in my industry about their experience, it&#x27;s very clear that they deal with an extra level of complications and hardships compared to me.<p>And it&#x27;s not &quot;my one black friend was a victim of racism this one time.&quot;  It&#x27;s just generally harder to get a job. It&#x27;s just generally harder to get promoted. It&#x27;s just generally harder to be taken seriously relative to your white peers.<p>And that&#x27;s why these responses from Coinbase are unsatisfying. Every company and every hiring process has elements of racism in it. We haven&#x27;t escaped the biases that permeate our culture. There are companies that are aware of these biases and work hard to minimize their impact, and there are companies that stick their heads in the sand and say &#x27;nope, no racism here! Find me actual proof!&#x27;.')
