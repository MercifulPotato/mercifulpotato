That way the truly valuable uses could still happen and the more optional uses of co2 would be discouraged.<p>Yep. A price on carbon is actually the most powerful lever we have to bring down emissions. Very nice visualization when you move the carbon price slider here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-roads.climateinteractive.org&#x2F;scenario.html?v=2.7.35" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-roads.climateinteractive.org&#x2F;scenario.html?v=2.7....</a><p>And you can make it both equitable and politically viable if you use the money from the carbon fee to provide direct payments to households, then combine with a border adjustment to maintain trade competitiveness. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;econstatement.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;econstatement.org&#x2F;</a><p>Ultimately we just need something in place that corrects this obvious market failure with as few side effects as possible, and carbon fee and dividend does that. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carbon_fee_and_dividend" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carbon_fee_and_dividend</a>')
