I reported a bug in May 2015, put up a little example page in order to show them the problem:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bjarneh.github.io&#x2F;ie&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bjarneh.github.io&#x2F;ie&#x2F;index.html</a><p>Strange bug where input fields added to the DOM containing non-ASCII characters (whether you escape them or not) trigger &#x27;input&#x27; events. So the example page loaded in IE will already have triggered 2 &#x27;input&#x27; events, since the last 2 input-elements contain the letter &#x27;Ã¥&#x27; (escaping it as &amp;aring; makes no difference).<p>After getting through the trouble of submitting the bug, nothing happened. About 6 months later I got an email saying the ticket was closed; as they were not able to reproduce the bug. The bug is still here today 5 years later.')
