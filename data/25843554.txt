In other words: they care whether the government <i>actually</i> does a good job, rather than whether the procedure through which the government was selected is correct, or whether they could criticize Xi.<p>How would the government get feedback then if people aren&#x27;t allowed to criticize? As I said before: one can submit feedback about policy. Just don&#x27;t go around and insult people. The government monitors social media as well for grievances. At the same time they censor social media to prevent mass unrest, but they take grievances seriously and works to solve them.<p>Whereas the west has freedom of speech as a core value, mainland Chinese value unity, face, action over talk and freedom from poverty. To them, it&#x27;s much more important to be able to have a good economic life, than freedom of speech. After all, 2 generations ago the Chinese were dirt-poor. When I was born, food rationing still existed!<p>As Kishore Mahbubani, ex-UN Security Council head and ex-Singapore diplomat, said: the CCP is in actuality more like a Chinese Civilization Party. Their goal is to advance the interests of Chinese civilization, not to spread communism world-wide.<p>China is not facist. Facism means that society is deliberately split up in classes (e.g. races), with one class being seen as inherently superior to other &quot;untermenschen&quot;. This is not China. There&#x27;s no notion that Han is better than Yao, or whatever. Official government policy is to give ethnic minorities preferential treatment, such as easier access to university.<p>Or maybe you&#x27;re using &quot;facism&quot; as a generic word for something you don&#x27;t like? This is an actual question, not a diss.<p>As for hypersonic weapons: yes escalating weaponry is not good. But on the other hand, the US is not blameless in this:\n&quot;The US Has No Place in the South China Sea Dispute&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;original.antiwar.com&#x2F;dave_decamp&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;the-us-has-no-place-in-the-south-china-sea-dispute&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;original.antiwar.com&#x2F;dave_decamp&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;the-us-h...</a>\nThe US isn&#x27;t supposed to be sailing warships around in the South China Sea in the first place. How about we all calm down and de-escalate at the same time, rather than trying to demonize a single party?<p>&gt; When we have no other advantage, what then? Do we implode?<p>What made America and the west great? It&#x27;s because of the great many talented individuals, focus on science and technology, investment in education, research and development. <i>Keep doing that</i>. We&#x27;ve been dropping that ball lately, becoming complacent. The west can easily compete with China toe-to-toe if only we get our shit together.<p>China is not interested in exporting its governance model. It has never done that. There&#x27;s no evidence it ever will do that. Why should they? It&#x27;s not in their interest to change others&#x27; governance model. China&#x27;s rise as a superpower is easily the most peaceful one in human history.<p>China is not an enemy, not a threat. When China and the west come together, the whole world wins.')
