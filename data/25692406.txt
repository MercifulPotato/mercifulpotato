Either it&#x27;s &quot;too little too late&quot; or &quot;i don&#x27;t like unelected tech leaders having the power to deplatform POTUS&quot;. The reality is somewhere in the messy middle.<p>If you distance yourself from the blow-by-blow and look at the chronology like a historian might, though, it is really hard to escape the fact that the social media platforms are dumping Trump days before Biden takes over. They profited from him sowing discord, and didn&#x27;t even bother to finesse the exit.<p>I also am concerned about the long term damage of Trump leaving office continuing to claim the election was stolen. For the next couple decades there will be millions of Americans absolutely convinced that their government is taken over by a massive conspiracy against Trump. These people will put up more protests and violence in future. this is something that cannot be stamped out - Trump has to be convinced or cornered into reversing his stance publicly. That is the only way.')
