We cannot use customer funds to front that cost due to regulation.

They could just disable that until they could afford it again.)<p>It&#x27;s not as simple because due to settlement rules, a lot of normal transactions actually require margin. eg. selling stock A and buying stock B with the proceeds the same day. Due to T+2 settlement the money isn&#x27;t actually yours until two days later.')
