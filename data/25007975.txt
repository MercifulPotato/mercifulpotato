I tried to kick the tires on it a couple years ago, and what I found is that the error messages were just so vexing, and it took a minute to understand what they meant, even in toy examples.  Maybe it gets better with time, or there is tooling to help with this, but it seemed a bit behind the times with the standard which has been set by more modern programming languages.')
