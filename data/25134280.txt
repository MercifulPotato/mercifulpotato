At my company we ended up just installing a local build agent on a powerful pc, and using that for the &#x27;frequent, but not super important&#x27; builds, such as building&#x2F;test for a PR.<p>The builds for acceptance&#x2F;prod we still do on remote CI&#x2F;CD, but those happen much more rarely. Also the advantage of a local CI&#x2F;CD is that it is much easier to setup caching for things like Node Modules, NuGet etc.<p>We use Azure Devops which has a pretty good local CI&#x2F;CD story, installing an agent was quiet easy for us.')
