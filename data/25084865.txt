But this Zig example, I think, will cover the most common case of functors for creating generics.<p>(I&#x27;m also not sure if Zig does compile-time check if the type T is compatible with LinkedList. OCaml does this type of check, making sure the signature of T fits the requirement of the functor LinkedList. The module T may have certain functions, for example a compare function associated with T to ensure sorting of the elements in your data structure.)')
