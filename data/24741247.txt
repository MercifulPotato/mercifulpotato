Further, I feel bad for ICs and bosses alike because the bosses likely had poor management training (MBA doesn&#x27;t count - I mean modern methods and mentoring&#x2F;coaching) and are managed by other managers who also never had good training.<p>I find that most people actually really want clearly defined work &#x2F; goals from their manager and for the manager to be pretty hands off unless they need help, more resources, etc.<p>There&#x27;s also another class of problem which is that, as a corollary to the above: &quot;You weren&#x27;t meant to have a job&quot; - ie it&#x27;s not always easy to execute &#x2F; enjoy work even when the work is interesting and your boss is great. Anything worth doing is probably going to be challenging and that&#x27;s going involve some measure of stress.')
