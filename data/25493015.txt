The lawsuit and sanctions are decided by the courts based on existing laws and precedent, and for them Facebook&#x27;s size or position in the Israeli market does not (and should not) hold any weight whatsoever.<p>The most the legislative can do is amend the relevant laws to make what Facebook tried to do legal going forward, and that still wouldn&#x27;t apply retroactively.
