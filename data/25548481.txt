I have a lot of the same feelings. My current resolve is to quit my job around the time the pandemic ends, and start taking more risks with how I choose to spend my life. I am lucky to have enough savings at this point to do so. Maybe I&#x27;ll figure things out a bit better before I hit the big 30. I hope you can find a path that works for you too.')
