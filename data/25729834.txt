Item(by='Frost1x', descendants=None, kids=[25730238], score=None, time=1610377705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729551, text='I tend to agree with this sentiment.<p>Unfortunately, I think even outside the oligopolies of tech, we have another underlying issue where even in a competitive market, market consensus can arrive that runs counter to democratic ideals.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if all the tech providers actively coordinated on this. I&#x27;d be more willing to believe they all saw Trump as a threat to business and an overhanging risk for their business they tackled at an opportune time. One or two set the stage for the market (Twitter and Facebook) and then the rest followed through based on observed market feedback from Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x27;s actions, arriving at a concensus to censor Trump.<p>To be very clear, I donâ€™t like Trump whatsoever and think he has clearly manipulated masses of people for years. At the same time, I don&#x27;t think Trump directly violated policies. He&#x27;s largely acted in the questionable grey areas of culture and society to push his will and has been quite effective at it.<p>This really brings into question underlying foundational principles surrounding free speech limitations and free speech protections, privatized communications&#x27; role in modern political discussions (essential to democracy), how we protect against oligopies or natural market consensus that may be harmful to underlying foundations to democracy, and so forth.<p>In this case I think we saw the oligopies and market concensus actually help democracy by protecting against a ridiculous yet growing insurrection attempt. What happens if that control or market consensus shifts to help businesses over consumers or general citizens of the US? There&#x27;s clearly a lot of unchecked power here that needs to be corralled.')
