It&#x27;s incredibly difficult and expensive to build new housing there.  Likewise for Seattle.  The local activists tend to ignore this supply constraint, and attack the easy target of the big, evil tech companies and their rather easy to pick-on &quot;yuppie, hipster&quot; employees, acting as if demand for new housing is inherently bad for the region.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly myopic, and frankly, greedy, view of the world.  &quot;My city was perfect as soon as the dwelling I live in was created, and nothing else should be added after that.&quot;<p>DFW doesn&#x27;t have the same constraints on new development that SV, SF, Seattle have.  You wouldn&#x27;t see a huge spike in housing costs like you had in those locations.')
