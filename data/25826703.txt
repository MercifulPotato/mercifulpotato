They are the ones with the power to address this. That part of the constitution is still intact. This is why Biden can suggest wearing masks, but is powerless to mandate them, amongst other things.<p>I think that it is wishful thinking to believe the military could be re-purposed to make a significant difference. Their job is to blow things up and kill people. It seems the field hospitals deployed were a drop in the bucket, and I assume that all doctors and nurses are already busy. What else would you expect from them, or the rest of the federal government? I&#x27;d be afraid of a single bad solution being forced on everyone. The feds have a pretty bad record of moving fast.<p>Perhaps this is just a difficult situation and is not going to go as smooth as you&#x27;d wish? There&#x27;s no magic bullet here.  It&#x27;s a pandemic. Covid has killed as many people per-capita as the low end of the estimated 1-4 million deaths from the 1968 Hong Kong flu. These things happen.<p>Also there is no widespread disagreement on what the response should be. i.e. Would our national response follow the NY model or the Florida model?<p>Yes, I would blame states for local problems. If your state setup a system leaving twelve local $20&#x2F;hr employees in a bad situation I would say that is your state&#x27;s fault. What makes you think the feds could do a more effective job?<p>Not all states are doing a bad job.')
