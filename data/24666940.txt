I know for a fact that the complex isn&#x27;t even posting all of their vacancies as my friend&#x27;s now-empty unit has never been listed. I don&#x27;t know how this will play out in the long term but lots of my teammates at work (3&#x2F;18) have moved out of the Bay Area, at least for the short term.<p>Many of my friends moved back to their hometown to be near their parents as well. It&#x27;s much cheaper and probably a once in a lifetime chance to really interact with your parents daily after college.')
