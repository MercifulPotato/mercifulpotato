I&#x27;m very sad to hear this news, and I&#x27;m sure you were too. Just want you to know that you all made a really meaningful difference in the lives of at least my wife and I. Before I switched to Simple, I had a really hard time budgeting for things&#x2F;planning for expenses, and was frequently toeing the line of overdrawing my account. I was essentially financially illiterate.<p>Simple made it incredibly easy for me to get my shit together and start being proactive with my money, so there was really no excuse to not do so. Now, my wife and I are well on our way to an early payoff on our mortgage (~18 years early), paying off our vehicle loans early (~2 years early), having a pretty good safety net in the bank, and being otherwise debt free.<p>So if you haven&#x27;t heard it above the sadness of losing Simple: thank you. Seriously, thank you. You really did something great and you should all be proud of what you&#x27;ve accomplished.')
