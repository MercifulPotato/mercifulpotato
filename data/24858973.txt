Look at 5G, supposedly it uses less energy per byte than 4g, but we&#x27;ll have 2 problems:<p>- rebound: faster bandwidth = people will consume more bytes = need more energy<p>- stack: 5G will be deployed on top of 4g which is deployed on top of 3g which is deployed on top of 2g which is still operational in many places.<p>It goes the same for transportation. If an electric car replaces a ICE car it&#x27;s a net positive (or maybe not, you&#x27;d have to study the whole cycle from lithium mining to end of life disposal). If an electric car replaces a pedestrian or a bicycle it&#x27;s a net negative no matter how you look at it.')
