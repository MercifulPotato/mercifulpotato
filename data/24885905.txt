Look, I try not to be negative, but at some point you have to admit the RIAA dealt a serious blow.<p>The value of youtube-dl wasn&#x27;t the software. It was the community. It was the ability to respond, within <i>hours</i>, to a change made on any given site. I.e. youtube-dl stopped working? No problem, file an issue, wait a day, solved.<p>That is now gone. And the world is simply going to have to accept that it is gone, or figure out a way to get it back. Because that was the sole reason youtube-dl mattered. Not the software.<p>Yes, this youtube-dl2 thing is certainly ... clever. I guess that&#x27;s the point, right? &quot;Look! youtube-dl can still be downloaded!&quot; That&#x27;s why it has 34 upvotes right now, right?<p>... But so what? In a day, no one will remember it, and it won&#x27;t have any impact. There&#x27;s no community here. The community was the key.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why people will do ten thousand mental backflips to avoid admitting defeat here. Yes, go ahead and clone this software far and wide. Make three youtube-dl templates! Etc.<p>In three months, after youtube-dl is broken on most websites, no one will know where to turn, or how to update it, or how to file issues, or any of the things that made youtube-dl special. Because youtube-dl wasn&#x27;t software. It was people; the combined effort of hundreds (thousands?) of people. That collaborative space is now gone.<p>I am mortified to hear myself speak so negatively, with not one positive thing to say. I used to despise people like that. And here I am, doing the same thing.<p>But you know what? You, personally, can solve this problem. You have the power to build The Next Thing. The thing that doesn&#x27;t suffer this same fate.<p>The tech can exist. I urge you to (a) think about a long-term solution, and then (b) devote years of your life to making it a reality.<p>Until then, though, just accept that youtube-dl is gone, and be done with it.')
