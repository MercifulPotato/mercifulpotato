But they try to do it on their own for the cutting edge stuff. Toyota developed their own hybrid technology, and it paid off for them big time. Having a better hybrid system than anyone else gave the Prius a serious leg up in the competition. Honda&#x27;s done similar work with variable valve timing, GM did it with automatic transmissions, etc.<p>I think, though, that that&#x27;s a tangential point, because Uber is not a car company. As others have theorized, Uber has an interest in developing it themselves because self-driving represents an existential threat. They have absolutely no defense against someone else using self-driving to do to them what they used gig economy labor pricing to do to taxi companies.')
