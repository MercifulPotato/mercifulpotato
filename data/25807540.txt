Front panel switches to get it up, paper tape punched from an ASR-33 to load a program and get it rolling.  Maybe a 5MB drive on the thing.  It is amazing to see what a influence the whole PDP family had on the technical&#x2F;engineering computing world back in the days of mainframes being the only &quot;real&quot; information technology systems.
