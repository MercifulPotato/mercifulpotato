The fact of the matter is that building new public transport is monumentally expensive, but roads themselves already exist. Installing new sensors and beacons would certainly not be a cheap task, but the bulk of the work is already done and there&#x27;s no reason why these new systems couldn&#x27;t integrate with existing roads that humans drive on. You can imagine for example a speed limit sign with a QR code containing information for the car to read, or a stop light using a radio transmitter to indicate its state. This infrastructure has to be upgraded anyways; why not make it friendlier for computers to use it? The costs pay themselves when crashes and traffic jams go away.')
