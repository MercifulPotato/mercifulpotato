Perhaps worse than this being a problem is that Microsoft don&#x27;t seem to be providing any solutions - there are various GitHub issues about it, with non-Microsoft ransoms being the ones providing workarounds (but these depend on your environment - I haven&#x27;t found <i>any</i> way to get this working myself!).<p>WSL1 was very ambitious. AFAIK, the main reason for shelving it&#x27;s approach was filesystem performance. While it was indeed slower than native&#x2F;VM, I personally never found it troublesome outside of artificial benchmarking. For the vast majority of use cases, WSL1 worked well, with Docker being the only <i>real</i> thing missing, IMO.')
