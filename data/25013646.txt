When I started looking into it, I found out he had an 8086 so was forced to optimize, but I had a 386 and took it for granted.  So whenever I ran his programs they were very fast.   Sometimes constraints are a good thing.  I believe part of the issue we see today in say web or mobile app dev is that most developers have much nicer gear than their average consumer.   They end up building things that run very nice locally but like shit across network or with slower hardware.')
