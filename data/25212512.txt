While some of this configuring is strictly unnecessary (changing the keyboard layout in xorg.conf is only relevant if you aren&#x27;t using a DE with that functionality), FreeBSD seems more ... finicky with GPU drivers and their DRM&#x2F;KMS compat layer from Linux than Net&#x2F;Open.<p>On NetBSD you can usually just &quot;starts&quot; and get an accelerated X session with no config, from just a &quot;full sets&quot; install. You usually have to install at least some extra kernel modules in FreeBSD.')
