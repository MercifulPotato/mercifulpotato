To scale up the multithreaded performance they just have to increase the core count and scale the cooling system accordingly, ie: exactly like you would have to for x86. A decent desktop cooler can dissipate enough heat to run CPU&#x27;s with 100+ Watt TDP&#x27;s, while the M1 in the current Mac Mini sits around ~20W estimated if you discount the RAM.<p>So again, what would make anyone think that an M1 with decent cooling would not be able to maintain the current ST performance indefintely, or a hypothetical 8+8 or even 16+16 core M1X or M2 with a TDP of 100W and top-notch cooling solution would be impossible?')
