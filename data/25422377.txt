The concern about when the shared_ptr&#x27;d value runs its destructor only matters if the value&#x27;s destructor is something you care about.<p>If you have a situation where a value needs to be shared between multiple other values, but also the value is trivial enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter when it&#x27;s destroyed or what it does when it&#x27;s destroyed, but also the value is not so trivial that you can copy it instead of using a refcounting pointer, then std::shared_ptr is fine.')
