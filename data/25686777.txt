Item(by='hiq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610125377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669531, text='&gt; - Metadata handled by Amazon<p>That&#x27;s rather broad, which metadata are you thinking about? Especially given the sealed sender feature. Assuming you have access to everything at Amazon, what can you deduce about Signal users?<p>I can think of:<p>- IP address (you can tell that this IP address sent some Signal message)<p>- size of messages<p>- timestamps of messages (when they were received by an Amazon server)<p>IP address leaks a lot of information but there are still workarounds, and it seems reasonable if you&#x27;re in a no-trust model (meaning Signal&#x27;s servers wouldn&#x27;t be any better than Amazon&#x27;s). In any case, that&#x27;s way less information than other mainstream messengers.<p>On the other hand, one distinguishing feature regarding metadata is groups: group membership is not known by anyone outside of the group if I understand correctly, contrary to WhatsApp (and others).')
