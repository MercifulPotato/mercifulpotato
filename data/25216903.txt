Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606366142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212539, text='Your intuition gets you to the right place but I think it is a bit flawed.<p>Entropy must be described relative to a system and an arbitrary definition of macrostates and microstates. It actually has nothing to do with disorder or order, I used the term previously because it helps with intuition but it is actually categorically wrong.<p>For example for a system of 5 loaded dice that roll six 99% of the time. With a microstate defined as the value of each dice after a roll and a macrostate defined as the number of 6s.<p>With this system entropy goes up as you roll more sixes. Order also goes up with entropy. Entropy is an arbitrary concept that is defined relative to your choice of a &quot;system&quot;, &quot;macrostates&quot; and &quot;microstates.&quot; You can choose systems that have higher probabilities of being ordered like say magnetic cubes in a box versus regular cubes. The magnetic cubes are more likely to be stacked perfectly and that is defined as a higher entropic state even when there is &quot;less&quot; information needed to &quot;describe&quot; it.<p>I never read about information theory but I&#x27;m assuming that the choice of &quot;system&quot; in information theory is usually pretty simple as in you can have numbers like the dice, but you usually don&#x27;t work with &quot;loaded&quot; dice. So under the case where the microstate of each entity has equal probability of occuring. In this case there is a direct relationship between whether data describing something can be compressed and the entropy of of that something. The higher the entropy the less it can be compressed.<p>Information places idealistic restrictions on microstates... However this is not the case in nature. If the microstate of our universe of atoms is defined as the cartesian coordinates of each atom. Then atoms have a tendency to coalesce into spheres (planets, starts, black holes) due to gravity and as a result each microstate does not have equal probability of occuring.<p>Planets are in fact a higher entropic state then the cloud of dust that the planet initially started out as. I can now describe all those atoms with in compressed form (a macrostate): &quot;Planet.&quot; Thereby leading to an opposite relationship between compressibility and entropy. In this case the higher the entropy of a system the less information is needed to describe it.')
