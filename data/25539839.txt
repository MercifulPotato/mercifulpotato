Item(by='jsnell', descendants=None, kids=[25540662, 25540132], score=None, time=1608937816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25539625, text='That seems like just a fancier way of expressing TWIV&#x27;s &quot;we can&#x27;t possibly know anything without lab experiments that establish the exact mechanisms, so we should do nothing&quot; philosophy.<p>The undeniable fact is that this variant has successfully replaced other already highly prevalent variants. That needs to be explained somehow.<p>Could it be a founder effect? No.<p>Could it be random chance? No. Of course a stochastic process could converge like this even with no selective advantage eventually. But the change has been too fast and too consistent in this case.<p>Could it be a super-spreading event? No. The change has been continuous, and a single event would cause just a step-change in relative prevalance.<p>Could it be the new variant being more transmissive, or having another similar selective advantage? Yes.<p>Could it be an unspecified emergent behavior? I guess it could. But how are we supposed to reason about something that vague? We have a simple explanation that&#x27;s consistent with the known facts, I feel that anyone proposing that it&#x27;s just emergent behavior should be at least a little bit more specific.')
