Previously I spent a couple years making presentations using Keynote, and then recently dabbled in Google Slides. \nIn my experience the #1 advantage Pitch has over Slides is that it is easy to make beautiful decks, and easy to work with non-designers collaboratively because I can pre-define all the document styles and just tell them not to customise any font or colour settings. The ability to upload custom fonts is also super useful.<p>There are a couple of things I wish Pitch supported, like vector image uploads and better looking diagrams and charts.<p>Overall I’m a big fan, and can’t see myself ever opening Google Slides again.<p>If you’d like to see an example of a presentation created in Pitch, check out these two. The first is the Supercast deck, and the second one of many delightful “What’s new“ presentations from Pitch themselves:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.pitch.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;public&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;e6b7e457-430f-4975-b589-9463f4729d9e&#x2F;5e8556ae-6604-48ca-a2ae-08df8a916697" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.pitch.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;public&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;e6b7e457-430f-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.pitch.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;public&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;9787c433-3dc0-465b-acf0-8b52359a6590" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.pitch.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;public&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;9787c433-3dc0-...</a>')
