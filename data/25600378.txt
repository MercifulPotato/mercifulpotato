Hell, Bitcoin Core developers have known for years, that&#x27;s why they never endorsed a base block increase. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve put all their energy into adding upper layers with transactions secured by flimsy game theory rather than flimsy hashcash. That&#x27;s why they pushed for SegWit, purely because it would make the complicated transactions necessary to run those upper layers not more expensive than direct transfers. That&#x27;s why they added a bunch of ways to tack on fees to unconfirmed transactions, and talked a bunch about a &quot;fee market&quot; (even though that&#x27;s not how Bitcoin transactions work) because it was obvious someone had to pay for all this stolen electricity.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that Bitcoin hasn&#x27;t just failed to meet it&#x27;s goals, but that it&#x27;s goals aren&#x27;t something the average person should want. The explicit goal of Bitcoin was untraceable payments you can&#x27;t cancel. In practice this means fraudulent payments cannot be reversed, and stealing Bitcoin is so cheap and easy to do we&#x27;ve literally caught Ruby packages designed to slip into developers&#x27; computers and steal Bitcoin. Cryptominers have also plagued the web to the point where browser vendors have to actively restrict what you can do in JavaScript.<p>(I&#x27;d also ALSO argue that anonymous payments are bad for society, and that financial privacy shouldn&#x27;t be a thing.)')
