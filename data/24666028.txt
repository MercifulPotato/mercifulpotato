It would be a valid question for most issues where ones has barely any other information.<p>But if you read a little about the price that japan (and this demographic in particular) has been paying and what they think about it, I&#x27;m pretty sure you won&#x27;t find anyone asking &quot;so what&quot;.<p>Your point on how USA (and other countries) should be making better use of their living arrangements is valid. I don&#x27;t think it compares to the situation Japan or most deeply densed urbanized countries in Asia.')
