It&#x27;s not difficult to open a Vanguard or Fidelity account and be able to get better pricing on retail trades, even if you&#x27;re paying a little up-front for certain trades. Nobody who&#x27;s trying to invest in the stock market can sincerely believe the Robinhood trades are &quot;free.&quot;<p>And Fidelity (for example) allows for other things that Robinhood can&#x27;t. You can choose to lend your shares for shorts:<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;fidelity-vs-robinhood-4587945" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;fidelity-vs-robinhood-4587945</a><p>&gt; <i>Fidelity can also earn revenue loaning stocks in your account for short sales—with your permission, of course—and it shares that revenue with you. Fidelity tells us that for two months of lending certain hard to borrow securities, 38% of accounts earn $100 or less, another 37% earn between $100 and $1,000 and the remaining 25% earn over $1,000. Robinhood retains all the income it generates from loaning out customer stock and does not share it with the client.</i>')
