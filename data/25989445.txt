Are you using it personally or do you use it as a team?<p>As far as I can tell, it cannot deploy models that use high dimensional input. It can log these models, and it can deploy them, but the &quot;deployed&quot; model can only accept two dimensional data.<p>This is an open issue[0] with open pull requests. We&#x27;re experimenting with MLflow for our platform (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>), but we automatically detect models, metrics, and parameters and then track that with MLflow instead of haivng people pollute their notebook code with MLflow code. We don&#x27;t like leaking that detail (tracking code) into the notebook.<p>We circumvented these issues (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;#deploying-a-model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;#deploying-a-model</a>). The models can either be deployed, or you can build a Docker image and push it to a registry and do whatever you want with it (run a container and invoke the model&#x27;s endpoint, for example).<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3570" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3570</a>')
