I&#x27;ve been thinking of moving there for a year or two to focus on my language skills and work on my startup.<p>I spent a lot of time in Obihiro, Hokkaido in my late teens and had a blast hanging out at the university. Everyone was super friendly.<p>When I traveled to even more remote towns like Hobetsu &#x2F; Mukawa, Makubetsu, Ashoro, and Honbetsu, the children would run up to meet me and want to take photos. (They don&#x27;t see foreigners often.)<p>I never spent much time in Tokyo, but I did spend a lot of time in Shanghai, Changsha, and other big Chinese cities and almost want to consider that a proxy.<p>Why is Tokyo lonely? Is it this city in particular? Is it a certain age range?<p>Post-college and into adulthood does it become lonelier?<p>Also, what&#x27;s the startup scene like in Tokyo? I&#x27;m considering something a few steps beyond VTuber streaming and think Japan would be a great environment to pull talent from.')
