If RH is low on money due to lending it out, then they have to stop lending. But the decision was to stop allowing buy orders on GME if I read and remember that correctly. What&#x27;s the issue? Don&#x27;t investors deposit money into their RH accounts and then purchase the stock from that money, giving RH a commission? That should be good for RH, so I&#x27;m not getting this. I probably just miss some info, hope I&#x27;m not asking a stupid question.')
