I want macOS to not suck for games. Apple and Nvidia have never gotten along for a variety of reasons.<p>Apple will probably continue to offer shitty GPUs in their MacBooks. That’s fine and maybe even a smart business choice.<p>But it means mac continues to suck for games. Which is unfortunate imho.<p>I think we can all agree it would be very interesting to see how much GPU power they can stuff in an iMac Pro and desktop class Mac Pro. If it doesn’t make business sense then so be it.<p>Realistically I’m hoping in 5 years that Nvidia releases a high-end integrated SoC. Tegra on Switch is fine. Keep it going.')
