On the actual cusp of the actual civil war, the overwhelming majority of Americans weren’t itching to kill each other and most just wanted things to return to normal. Of course, there were broad camps with radically different views as to the barriers to normalcy and considerable propaganda effort expended to nurture some of those views by people who <i>had</i> already come to the conclusion that a fight was, if not desirable, a necessary risk to secure their political goals.<p>(Also broadly true of the Revolutionary War, for that matter, and, really, most other internal and international armed conflicts in history.)')
