If the owner wants to sell the vehicle, require an odometer check and a final payment.<p>Basically - I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s a ton of extra admin cost here. Most folks will self report just fine.<p>Plus, we should be encouraging emissions inspections anyway.  At least in the US many states require yearly or bi-yearly inspections to confirm nothing is wrong with the emissions systems in the vehicle.  Good way to encourage basic maintenance and to vet manufacturer emission claims against real world data.<p>It&#x27;s tied to yearly vehicle registration there too, and includes an odometer reading.')
