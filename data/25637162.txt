If nothing else, I can quickly glance down there and see if the computer is powered on.<p>AMD ships them standard with their Ryzen processors, I guess the market for enthusiast range parts has decided that we want RGB hardware.<p>Personally I think case aesthetics peaked around the Antec P180 which looked like brushed metal fridge and was one of the first cases to care about sound isolation. No window panel, so nobody cares how much of a mess my wiring is, and I can buy the RAM that&#x27;s on sale instead of the one with color coordinated heatspreaders.<p>But if other people are into that, power to them.<p>Someday I&#x27;d like to do a &quot;desktop literally built into the desk top&quot; build and ditch the suspended computer mount completely, assuming I still even want to have a full desktop computer 10 years from now.')
