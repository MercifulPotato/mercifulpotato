The OS is particularly poor, as is the battery life. The Mac is a better frontend for Windows sessions through Citrix than a literal Windows device is-- gestures, scrolling, trackpad predictability, etc. I could not give two craps about the cameras. I don&#x27;t use my laptop as a camera. If I need a high-quality camera, I&#x27;ll attach one. If I have to do a video call without preparation, the receiver can deal with a &quot;mere&quot; 720p. Would I welcome a 4k cam on a Mac? Sure, if it&#x27;s free, why not? I&#x27;d rather have a microSD reader tho.')
