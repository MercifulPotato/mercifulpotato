Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603875754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902726, text='&gt; &quot;yes, that person worked here&quot;<p>2 reasons to do this:<p>1) In many (I assume all) countries companies run background checks. When I claim that I have worked for 10 years as role-XYZ in company-ABC, they need to somehow verify this claim. The (closed) question is &quot;Did Henry Bemis worked as role-XYZ in your company for 10y?&quot; And the answer is either Yes&#x2F;No (or a very slight variation of the asnwer, to clarify the role title (due to traslation or interpretation issues)(i.e. asking in English language for a role in Italy).<p>2) In Europe (were we get a good number of vacation days) the &quot;next&quot; employer will need some form of verification for your years of work, as the number of vacation days increase depending on the number of years you worked. Different ranges for different countries. Although the &quot;next employer&quot; does have a copy of your CV and can add the years, they should have the assurance that &quot;total of 10 years&quot; is actual &quot;10 years&quot;.')
