You realize this subject is centuries old and there is nothing new? It is important to study the original texts to get the real &quot;kernel&quot; of the subject before practice (lacking an accomplished Guru). It is the &quot;modern&quot; authors who are responsible for muddying the waters of this subject since most of them have half-baked knowledge and then market their &quot;experience&quot; (a lot of which is frankly fad&#x2F;hyperbole&#x2F;BS) to the gullible. Other than a few scholars like James Mallinson, David Gordon White, i wouldn&#x27;t trust anybody else&#x27;s translations&#x2F;interpretations&#x2F;websites.<p>PS: I took a look at the AYP website. It is junk and i wouldn&#x27;t trust it. When the author is advertised as &quot;Yogani, is an American spiritual scientist&quot; and equates &quot;Tantra == Sex&quot; it is nothing but a marketing scam. Stay away and read the original texts and form your own interpretation.')
