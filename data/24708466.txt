Her death makes this a much less certain Oracle victory.<p>To quote The Verge:<p>&quot;The absolute least important part of Ginsburgâ€™s legacy is that she was the most reliable vote in copyright law cases, tending to vote in favor of rights-holders. Her loss also means that Google v. Oracle is being heard by eight justices and is therefore prone to a split court. (In the 1996 software copyright case Lotus v. Borland, an eight-justice court split evenly and was unable to set national precedent).&quot;')
