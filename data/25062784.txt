The _worst_ cry I&#x27;ve heard our son do was when he had a double ear infection, it was immediately obvious from the shrill tone that he was in pain and needed to go the doctor.  There is also a slightly less desperate one where he&#x27;s stuck in something (usually leg&#x2F;arm in the crib, not really stuck but can&#x27;t yet reason out how to fix the problem).')
