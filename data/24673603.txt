Isn&#x27;t this generally highjacked by the timber industry to protect valuable &quot;product?&quot;<p>If that&#x27;s true, will this federal bill address that? It seems like it allocates money but doesn&#x27;t talk about the other 53% of the lands that are not federally managed. And, it doesn&#x27;t talk about whether the 47% lands are the problem or not. In Oregon where I live, the massive fires were ten miles from me in largely residentially adjacent lands. Are those going to be helped?<p>I love that this bill offers jobs to formerly incarcerated people that have been fighting fires.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong about my first assumption, would really like to know.<p>Also, I saw a statistic that said California needs to do prescribed burns of about a million acres a year to manage wildfire risk. They are currently doing only 40,000. But these massive fires over the last month are approaching that million acre number: does anyone know if next year we will be safer because of those fires?')
