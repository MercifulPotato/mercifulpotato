Imagine you want to leak a one page printed document.<p>If the covert signal (the employee ID of the leaker) is encoded with tiny dots then it could be filtered in or out with a band pass filter.  Filtering out the data can be done with a <i>fax machine</i> if you can find one.<p>But if the covert data is embedded in the original signal at frequencies close to the signal “frequency” then you don’t stand a chance.  The information band of written English provides a huge number of options for hiding other signals: spelling, choice of words, spacing, key phrases, capitalisation, the ordering of items in a list.<p>The government agency from where you are leaking — your adversary — has the <i>original signal</i> from which they adapted your slightly different copy that you leaked.  All they have to do is hide 6 to 16 bits of data in 2kb of English language.  This is trivial <i>because they have the original plaintext with which to encode and later extract the signal</i>.<p>How do you effectively tackle this, as a leaker?  A journalist is the one type of filter capable of obscuring covert traffic at these frequencies.  They read the document, summarise the implications, and then write that up.  I probably wouldn’t let them keep the original text though.')
