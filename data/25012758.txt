Reviewers barely mention them at all with perhaps a nod to a handset having a dual or triple LED flash.<p>Yet for myself the flashlight is very important.  It&#x27;s a tool I use if not every day then at least every other, and I want as powerful a light as possible.  For instance, I was crushed when my current phone, a OnePlus 6, had a flashlight only 25-50% as powerful as my previous, a Galaxy Note 4.  I would pay a premium for a phone with a flagship SoC and a very bright flashlight.')
