If the first message for an ordered key can&#x27;t be acked because it crashes subscribers, we can&#x27;t make progress on the messages for that key. If the first message, likewise, takes too long, then it delays processing of subsequent messages for that key.<p>Even without ordering, we still have to deal with variations of these issues. A message may still crash subscribers, be redelivered, and crash yet more subscribers. A message may delay the processing of other messages on the subscription.<p>Here&#x27;s one way to deal with crashing messages: keep a side-cache of processing attempts for every message ID and ack those that have been processed too many times before processing them. Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub has a dead-letter queues feature to do this automatically. (It is not yet implemented for subscriptions with ordering keys - one can&#x27;t enable both features.) We can do something similar for long messages - acking the message on timeout or processing more messages in parallel.<p>So, with ordering keys, as it stands, you do have the extra problem of dealing with messages-of-death (crash-inducing messages) yourself, but the long-processing time issue still exists in a slightly different form. Hopefully, we can add DLQs for ordering keys if there&#x27;s sufficient customer demand.<p>Disclaimer: I work on the Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub team, but this is my own explanation.')
