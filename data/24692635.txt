This can be <i>very</i> far from the people&#x27;s present intent.<p>So if you give the people too much power over the judge, they will transform law-execution into present-intent-execution, something we do not desire.<p>If law were totally unambiguous and evidence were totally unambiguous, we might be fully constrained. An elected judge would still be unable to appease the crowd. But we know something: law <i>is</i> ambiguous and evidence is also ambiguous. We need the human here to disambiguate and match against statement and then intent. And adding political necessities to that process hurts it.')
