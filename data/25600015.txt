Given how close the last referendum was the Brexit issue could easily be enough to tip the scales, granted it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what other factors might be in play.<p>I must admit that part of me likes the irony of the UK &quot;forging it&#x27;s own path&quot; resulting Westminster losing power and it&#x27;s states gaining independence.<p>As a side note, I think it&#x27;s better to refer to the northern Irish as republicans and unionists. The division is due to the partition of Ireland and not religious beliefs. The division lines might be the same but religious labels add irrelevant impactions. You don&#x27;t have to be Catholic to be in favour of reunionification and vice versa.')
