Unless the immune system has been exposed to something similar before (e.g. SARS&#x2F;MERS n.b. made up example I have no idea if the spikes of SARS or MERS are molecularly similar enough), no adjuvant means situation normal for the immune system. If there is nothing to signal to the immune system that this new antigen is bad then it will treat it as neutral suppressing any vaccine response, which is worse that if the vaccine had not been delivered at all.  &lt;&lt;<p>This is Completely false.<p>Natural immunity does not require adjuvent.<p>spreading out a scarce valuable resource by use of adjuvent is a standard practice.<p>ANY complex not recognized by the MHC will elicit an invader response, the immediate vigor of this response is attenuated by inclusion of adjuvent in the final formulation of the vaccine. we would all die  100% of the time if adjuvent was required to mount immune response, to infection.')
