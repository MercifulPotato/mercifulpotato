Item(by='serial_dev', descendants=None, kids=[25623824], score=None, time=1609696741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623289, text='There is a line between completely &quot;outsourcing&quot; raising your children (how I &quot;stereotypically&quot; imagine royal families might do) and getting help with the things that take all your energy but doesn&#x27;t really contribute to your relationships with your children.<p>Washing clothes, buying groceries, cooking every day are all things that must be done, but it can be done by another person (nanny, au pair, or even grand parents) without taking away (much) from your relationship with your children.<p>Just imagine the difference between the mood of a parent who cooked, cleaned, washed that day vs the parent who is relaxed as all those things were done by outside (paid) help. Same person in two totally different mood and energy level by the dinner comes. Also keep in mind that these things have to be done every single day, so while it might be okay to work through this backlog every day for a week, I&#x27;m sure your mood would change after you&#x27;ve done it for 10 years (assuming multiple children).<p>I heard once and I think it&#x27;s true, that kids don&#x27;t need 24 with their parents, they need the 2-3 hours (changing as the kids age) with them every day, but after that they get bored of daddy or mommy and want to do something with their friends or alone.<p>If you can afford outside help, it <i>can</i> actually make the time you spend with your children more delightful, you may bond more, and in the end have a better relationship with them also in the long term.<p>It can obviously go wrong, if you look at your children when they are 14 and you have no idea who they are because they went to the nannies directly, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it can be done right.')
