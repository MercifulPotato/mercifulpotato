Item(by='pfdietz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607551668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358003, text='Fusion will still require a containment building because of tritium and because of the pressure from volatilized cryogenic coolants.  The building will also require very strict control of tritium escape in normal operation.  Remember, a 1 DW(e) DT reactor will burn enough tritium in one year to contaminate 2 months total flow of the Mississippi river above the legal limit for drinking water.<p>Fusion will also require highly reliable equipement, just like fission.  Not because of safety, but because the fusion reactor will be complicated and very difficult to repair.  The reactor itself, even the magnets, will be irradiated and activated beyond the point where hands on maintenance could be performed.')
