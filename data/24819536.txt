I probably roll over and crush them pretty regularly, but they seem very robust. They&#x27;re very comfortable to wear for long periods (if you don&#x27;t roll over on to your side, that is). Excellent noise cancellation too.<p>I did have older&#x2F;cheaper Sony ANC headphones previously which broke at the hinges, but these seem unbreakable (touch wood).')
