Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=[24786488], score=None, time=1602749736, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24785673, text='&gt; I mean I can invoke Godwin&#x27;s Law<p>Firstly, the Nazis rose despite and possibly helped by speech laws.<p>&gt; My new favorite wiki page (for now) is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_tolerance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_tolerance</a><p>Secondly, Popper is not calling for speech to be supressed in any way <i>except</i> for those who choose violence instead of speech. The original[1] is better than a Wikipedia article that cuts off the important part of his words:<p>&gt; In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinionâ€¦<p>Hence he is supportive of the right to discussion for all. He contrasts this with those who won&#x27;t support speech and sets the limits:<p>&gt; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols<p>They&#x27;ve given up on speech so he gives up on tolerance, which is wise. Free speech is there to reduce violence and supplant it and nothing Popper wrote in the &quot;paradox of tolerance&quot; contradicts that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TheOpenSocietyAndItsEnemiesPopperKarlSir&#x2F;page&#x2F;n837&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TheOpenSocietyAndItsEnemiesPoppe...</a>')
