We view them as &quot;win or catastrophe&quot;, &quot;win or the nation will be destroyed&quot;.  The stakes being so high (in our minds) justifies (also in our minds) going to any lengths to win.<p>I think that, as our country becomes more secular, many people put politics in religion&#x27;s place.  &quot;If my side wins this election, it will bring the kingdom of heaven&quot; (however defined in your worldview).  The truth is, no, it won&#x27;t.  It may move things somewhat more toward your preferred configuration, but that&#x27;s all.<p>Sure, vote.  Campaign for your preferred side.  But don&#x27;t hold your political views with religious fervor.  Politics isn&#x27;t worthy of that.  Jesus wasn&#x27;t running in the last election; He won&#x27;t be in the next one either.')
