Apple hardware and design are indeed exceptional. Great HDPI screen, awesome trackpad, like the keyboard despite all negative rumors.<p>But when I was looking for another laptop recently, I obviously ditched Apple and picked ThinkPad instead for following reasons:<p>Only two USB-C ports, in fact only one usable since the other one is occupied by charger. Compare that to ThinkPad having multiple USB-A and USB-C, full HDMI, SD card reader, even Ethernet and docking station. Not sure how Apple can be considered for professional use.<p>MacOS is not great. I&#x27;ve been using all operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and I miss package manager the most in MacOS. It takes a couple of clicks (or a single command (`apt-get install`) to install trusted software on Linux. In MacOS world it&#x27;s still pretty normal to visit a random website a download unverified DMG installer. That&#x27;s like being stuck in 90s and I feel very unsafe doing that.')
