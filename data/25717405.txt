That’s only a guess of course.<p>2) the downside of losing my life savings would be far more devastating than the upside of doubling them- the risk&#x2F;reward profile is extremely asymmetrical.<p>3) the people who can trade the news fast will get out fast in the event of a crash, and the 401k people will be left holding the bag, which means that stock market volatility is essentially a way to transfer wealth from the middle class to the super wealthy.  I’m not interested in that.<p>To be frank I wish that 401ks didn’t exist at all and the government just increased social security payments a certain percentage every year.  If the economy is growing as fast as the payments then it shouldn’t be an issue right?  The fact that I am essentially forced to play poker with my retirement account is very frustrating.  The whole point of saving money for retirement is to reduce risk, it’s supposed to make me feel secure not give me one more thing to worry about.<p>But, my wife has all her 401k in stocks, so between the two of us we’re still split 50&#x2F;50, so I guess I exaggerate when I say it’s all t bills.<p>So that’s my thinking.')
