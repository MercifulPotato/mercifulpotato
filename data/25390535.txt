You said:<p>&gt; Once all the old&#x2F;vulnerable wood is burned up, it&#x27;s much more difficult for another forest fire of the same magnitude to happen ...<p>Which is demonstrably wrong when you liken _people_ to the dry brush, which is exactly what you did. We aren&#x27;t optimizing to minimize deaths in individual years (or else we&#x27;d just kill everyone right now and the death rate would spike and then drop to zero), we&#x27;re optimizing for general well-being of the population.<p>Your analogy is flat wrong, which is why I&#x27;m poking holes in it. It also belies a shocking lack of empathy for your fellow humans, which I frankly find alarming.<p>&gt; Where do you draw the line?<p>I have no idea, and I don&#x27;t think this is the venue to argue it, but I definitely don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re at it yet, and I would much rather err on the side of trying too hard to protect people&#x27;s lives than not trying hard enough.<p>For example, when death numbers from COVID were first being released, people compared them to car fatalities, going &quot;Why are we so worried? Car crashes kill 100x as many people in the same timeframe.&quot; The point is not &quot;we should not worry about COVID because other things are more deadly&quot; but &quot;there is an alarming new source of deaths, and we should be working to reduce death <i>as much as we can</i> in the interests of maximizing the population&#x27;s happiness.&quot;<p>EDIT: I mean, consider, the sitting US president called COVID &quot;a hoax&quot; for a good two months, then kept downplaying it for another two (&quot;it&#x27;ll be gone after November, you&#x27;ll see&quot;), and overall completely failed to make a plan at the federal level to, I dunno, provide more sick leave for people so they could actually avoid spreading it to their co-workers, or rent assistance for those out-of-work because we shut down the industries with high levels of communication, or support just wearing a mask when you go outside. We are so far and away from even a reasonable level of response to this it seems wholly disingenuous to pose the &quot;but where do we _stop_ intervening?&quot; argument.')
