I have about 3500 people on my mailing list and about 10 thousand occasional readers.<p>I can make reasonable money by selling my books online, having my own e-shop is great, because there is no need to pay various middle men.<p>2020 was a good year and my total revenue from this business is comparable to what a Google software engineer makes here in Prague. I used to code for living, this is a much less stressful way of life.<p>But the total amount of supporters necessary exceeds 1000 by a large margin. Even if 1000 people bought two of my books yearly, I would struggle financially.')
