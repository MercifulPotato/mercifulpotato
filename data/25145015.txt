I said I wanted a BRZ, Limited trim, Black, with a manual transmission, and asked what their lowest price was.  MSRP for this configuration I believe was $29K.  One dealership didn&#x27;t answer at all, the second offered $29K, the third offered $26K and included all the dealer-installed options like the cargo mat for the drunk, auto-dimming mirror with HomeLink, and wheel locks.<p>I definitely went with the third dealer.  Didn&#x27;t even feel the need to haggle any more than that.')
