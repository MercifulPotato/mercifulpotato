I usually go for the same workflow as you do, but it can take days between a branch being created and the moment I&#x27;m done with it. During this time, I often want to keep up with the latest changes on master. Other times, more than one person works on a feature branch, so they still need to git pull from origin&#x2F;feature-branch into feature-branch to get the changes from the other committer.<p>I would be very happy if I could just merge to master every day, but that is extremely rare for me and my team.')
