That being said, I&#x27;m not at all surprised by that response–like I said, having an offhand tweet of yours get significant attention, and then have people come after you and attack you on top of whatever corporate might have to say to you on the topic, is a great way to get something like that. It&#x27;s exactly things like these why most Apple engineers don&#x27;t say much or publicly affiliate themselves with the company–and I am sure that the people who decided to go after him were well aware of what what kinds of things happen after that.')
