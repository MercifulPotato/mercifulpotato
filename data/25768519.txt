You&#x27;re not being paid as much as Americans in Europe but you&#x27;re also treated far more humanely.  I think the question isn&#x27;t how to increase wages in Europe but how to get the rest of the world to adopt Sweden&#x27;s labor laws, assuming it has the most progressive ones.  I&#x27;m an American who would gladly accept Swedish rates with Swedish benefits.')
