Those make it easy for foreign propaganda to influence the public and hence run the countries from outside.<p>Thanks to The Great Firewall and the CCP rule, China is mostly immune to foreign propaganda. At the same time, China is using a lot of effort to affect countries with democracy and free speech, like India and the U.S.<p>China is obviously not alone in using propaganda to influence the politics of other countries. All big countries and corporations use it in their countries of interest all the time... in fact, they have been doing it for much longer. Everything from bribes to politicians to &quot;human rights organizations&quot;, &quot;foreign aid organizations&quot; to social causes in universities... everything is used to undermine national interests and put pawns for outside powers in governments.<p>Citizens of many democratic nations have been feeling this for a very long time... which explains nationalist sentiments rising in many countries... but that&#x27;s another story.<p>China is in a unique position in that it limits or prohibits foreign press, foreign media, foreign internet services, foreign aid organizations, human rights organizations... i.e. anything and everything that it can to stop foreign influence... but it uses a lot of those against its rivals.<p>The only defense against it is following China&#x27;s footsteps. India has recently banned several Chinese apps and websites. It has also kicked out Amnesty International. Other countries will have to do the same if they want to protect their national interests.')
