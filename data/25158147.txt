Don&#x27;t get me wrong, node and scala are both fun to program in. \nBut swift types (especially) structs that implement immutability throughout, as well as a, let&#x27;s say, slight &#x27;functional&#x27; bias in the language without enforcing it too strictly has really made me want to use it more on the backend as well. I&#x27;ll definitely check this one out.')
