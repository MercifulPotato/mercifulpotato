This argument about DRM and software rights and redistribution finds its roots in the failure of markets to distribute products that have infinite supply once they are created. Call it an &quot;Idea Product&quot;. Information can only be duplicated, not moved. It can only be shared, not taken. And since this feature means that &quot;Idea Products&quot; aren&#x27;t scarce, how to you price it?<p>The correct price is 0, just looking at it from first principles.<p>But we don&#x27;t like that because then these &quot;idea products&quot; have no incentive to get made, so we pretend like supplies are limited, we limit them with patents, we limit them with DRM, we limit them with laws, pretend it&#x27;s scarce so the market can price it.<p>To many, this is an acceptable result. Buuuut... must we use a market for absolutely everything? Even if it&#x27;s clearly broken in this use case and we&#x27;re just pretending it works? The fact that we are pretending is fine, even when someone&#x27;s life is on the line?<p>I think we need something like bug bounties for information. I think we need a different kind of market for novelty.')
