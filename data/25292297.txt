Item(by='rjkennedy98', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607019156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290474, text='&gt; The top three derogatory terms Facebook’s automated systems removed were “white trash,” a gay slur and “cracker,” according to an internal chart obtained by The Post<p>Literally in the article it says that anti-white comments by blacks were the top hate speech comments made. I’d like to hear your explanation why they needed to turn off the anti-white comment filter. Seems pretty obvious that there were so many of them that they had to turn it off or risk alienating certain groups (which is also corroborated by the article). What other explanation could there be? You can&#x27;t possibly believe that this was done because there were so many critical race theory students that had trouble de-constructing whiteness on Facebook which apparently is Facebook&#x27;s ridiculous position.')
