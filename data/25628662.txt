The ad network.<p>Example: TVguide.com&#x2F;listings. On most devices, I get a nondismissable audio ad when I&#x27;m looking at telecast schedules. I kill the audio immediately.<p>I never experience the bulk of the ad, and even if I can identify the product being advertised, I&#x27;ll form a strongly negative impression of them.<p>I don&#x27;t count this as &quot;engagement&quot;, but it&#x27;s charged as that.')
