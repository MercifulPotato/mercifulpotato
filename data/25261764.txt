You have two choices:<p>1. Leave a video up published by a non-scientific person which has possibly harmful claims.<p>2. Take the video down, get decried for censorship, avoid spreading what we know is a problem right now: misinformation.<p>I leave option 3, policing content out of the picture. People mistake what is happening now as policing but really it&#x27;s avoiding policing what they are doing now.<p>I am absolutely not on the side of just anyone with credentials being able to soapbox on platforms that don&#x27;t want to spread misinformation whether it is or it isn&#x27;t officially designated misinformation - better safe than sorry. I feel like I know the difference between band of fringe persons with Doctor in their name who have a controversial underdog belief and the official scientific sources for information.')
