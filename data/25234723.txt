But didn&#x27;t you have situations in which the amount of adequate responses you can give is a small set?<p>So even if somebody were to predict all your possible responses that still doesn&#x27;t mean that you don&#x27;t have free will. You do. But your choice set might be limited at the time.<p>I might be nitpicking here though. If what you are getting at is &quot;I let my spontaneous reaction pass silently in my head and THEN analyze how should I really respond&quot; then I am in full agreement -- I trained myself to do that too and I found it to be the option that maintains my inner peace much better.')
