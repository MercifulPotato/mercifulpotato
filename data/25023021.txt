When you look at it, you&#x27;ll swear it&#x27;s spinning in one direction -- say, counter-clockwise. In fact, you&#x27;ll be so sure it&#x27;s spinning counter-clockwise, that the idea it could be spinning in the opposite direction will seem impossible to you. But if you stare at it long enough, and intently enough, you can make it spin the other way.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed the same phenomenon with political views.<p>People on the left think that anyone on the right is a lunatic, and everyone on the right thinks the same thing about the left. I, as most people do, lean in one direction politically, so naturally any comment I see coming from my side seems reasonable to me. In fact, it seems impossible that a reasonable person could think any other way. But since I grew up in a family that leaned in the opposite direction, and I shared their same mindset in my younger days, I can now draw on that experience, and I can take a political tweet that everyone on my side thinks is insane, and I can stare at it, and just as with the spinning dancer, I can flip it in my head so it seems reasonable.<p>To me, it&#x27;s a testament to the power of the tribal instincts within us. We think it&#x27;s the other side that&#x27;s crazy, but we&#x27;re all under the same spell.')
