Item(by='phkahler', descendants=None, kids=[24814450], score=None, time=1602976279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813095, text='&gt;&gt; Why do you think modern CPUs still expose mostly C-abstract-machine-like interface instead of their actual out-of-order, pipelined, heterogeneous-memory-hierarch-ied internal workings?<p>Because exposing that would be a huge burden on the compiler writers. Intel tried to move in that direction with Itanium. It&#x27;s bad enough with every new CPU having a few new instructions and different times, the compiler guys would revolt if they had to care how many virtual registers existed and all the other stuff down there.<p>But why C? If you want languages to interface with each other it always comes down C as a lowest common denominator. It&#x27;s even hard to call C++ libraries from a lot of things. Until a new standard down at that level comes into widespread use hardware will be designed to run C code efficiently.')
