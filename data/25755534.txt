We&#x27;ve got lots of clay tablets because those survive well when buried. When Imperial Aramaic written on parchment began to supplant Akkadian cuneiform, we lose a lot of the written record. It&#x27;s created an odd situation where the written documentation of the second millennium BCE is often better than the first millennium BCE.')
