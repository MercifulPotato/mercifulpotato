I have been thinking over the problems with captchas and also came to the conclusion that a proof-of-work puzzle is a fair, private, and hopefully-effective solution.<p>You can look around for &quot;useful&quot; work, similar to how recaptcha was originally about transcription. If you can find some problems of the right difficulty that people want solved (e.g. I dunno, protein folding or something), then the electricity isn&#x27;t wasted and you might even be able to sell the solutions.')
