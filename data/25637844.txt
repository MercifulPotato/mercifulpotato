Where was this tried at scale? Where did we spend a fraction of the cost that we incur locking down an entire population. This just isn&#x27;t true.<p>&gt; Maybe, just maybe, the experts (and I mean the people who have spent their lifetimes studying the transmission of respiratory diseases) have already weighed in, their answers don&#x27;t look that different from when things started, and their assessments turned out to be mostly correct?<p>The hardest question is whether or not this is worth it, and nobody is asking that because politicians want to get reelected.<p>You are missing the point entirely. Virology experts are not the people who should be making these decisions. It&#x27;s not as if covid response is free, but they aren&#x27;t tasked with consdering the costs. They aren&#x27;t tasked with finding out what the right amount of death is. That&#x27;s the unfortunate reality and this is what the great leaders throughout history have all understood: there are no good decisions in times like this, merely least worst decisions.')
