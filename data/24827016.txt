The US isn&#x27;t a direct democracy for good reason, as that is essentially mob&#x2F;majority rule, and erodes the rights of individuals.<p>- If we&#x27;re referring to the US, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what the functions of other governments may be. The founding fathers clearly defined the responsibilities of the federal goverment, and it isn&#x27;t their job to protect you from any sort of harm. I don&#x27;t see how that would line up with anything in the enumerated powers. Ignoring the US, the act is still authoritarian whether you agree with it or not, as it&#x27;s an order from the top down which limits individual freedom. Again, whether people agree with it or not is a moot point.<p>- Your point here is anecdotal, and I don&#x27;t think selective enforcement of the law is nessecarily a good thing. If it&#x27;s not enforced at all, why make it a mandate and not a recommendation? Also the enforcement or lack thereof of a law&#x2F;order has nothing to do with the authoritatian nature of it.<p>While these points you&#x27;re making may be reasons you think it&#x27;s a good idea, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve made a case that it wouldn&#x27;t be authoritarian. I&#x27;m not even saying that inherently makes the idea bad, but you should call it what it is.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not against wearing masks. I&#x27;ve had N95s since before this pandemic and wear them whenever I go out in public, moreso to help proyrct others than myself. I am however very weary of granting the goverment authority like that and setting precedent during a national crisis that would erode our liberties long after the fact, like the patriot act.')
