Packages will say &quot;delivered&quot; but then either the photo is of someone else&#x27;s porch or there just isn&#x27;t a photo. I have their Ring doorbell and I offer to show them no events were triggered. They always say &quot;oh, we must have marked it delivered too early, please wait 48 hours&quot;. Then, 48 hours later they offer to refund me and I have to start over. I&#x27;ve asked if they can please only deliver via UPS but they say that&#x27;s not an option.')
