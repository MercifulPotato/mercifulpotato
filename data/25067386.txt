Here are some of my thoughts on this:<p>1. They own ALL of Friendster&#x27;s patents.  they are all encompassing regarding social networking.  No way any little guy can defend themselves.<p>2. someone said another obvious thing: ppl use different aspects of FB and not all.<p>3. after mons&#x2F;yrs of teaching your grandma to use FB, no way anyone will move away and reteach.<p>4. FB offers no complete like Goog&#x27;s Take Out scenario to easily reimport into another social network.<p>5. too many catfish.  I suspect only 25% are real people.  rest are entities, multi-accts.<p>6. too many simple thinking ppl are entrenched and won&#x27;t change.  comfort zone barrier too high to break.<p>7. governments worldwide now use them to control their people where in some coountries, every individual getting a cellphone must have a FB acct.<p>8. some countries like India use FB as their &quot;internet.&quot;  They don&#x27;t know www exists.<p>9. FB can only be brought down by itself and they are already doing a fine job of it.  There is a cycle for companies like this and although they now have a very long tail, there is an end to that tail.   Next generation will have to make that change over so at a minimum, it will take a generation to make that fall.<p>10. FB are already losing the next gen, so opportunities abound except for the patent fights that will happen.<p>Bottomline is FB a road most will need to travel on for now, but I suspect like hwys, toll roads can lead a path out for some while the rifrafts will stay on the sinking boat.')
