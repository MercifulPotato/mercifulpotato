Premium allows you to watch&#x2F;listen without ads and also allows you to download videos for offline use. If I pay for YouTube Premium, there should be no problem with me using youtube-dl to timeshift the content I&#x27;ve already paid for. It&#x27;s no different than using a DVR to record a show off a cable channel I pay to subscribe to.')
