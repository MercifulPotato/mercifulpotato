So I kind of understand (well, as much as layman can understand, lol) the vaccine that Pfizer and Moderna works. I guess it is a bit better explained on Wikipedia. So their vaccines inject mRNA to our cells which start producing antibodies. While this is brand new kind of vaccine, it&#x27;s hard to know long term effects of it, but there&#x27;s a chance that it could cause an autoimmune disease.<p>When reading about vaccine created by Oxford, the biggest concern seems to be that people could have or develop antibodies for the adenovirus after first dose. I&#x27;m guessing someone with HLA-B27 has even a higher chance of doing that. I understand that, but I&#x27;m still not understanding how it works. Is it same as the mRNA vaccine, with the difference that the adenovirus is just used to deliver it?')
