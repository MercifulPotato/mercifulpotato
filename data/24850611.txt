If you pop up a spectrum analyzer just about anywhere, you&#x27;ll see that the spectrum is vacant and deserted except for broadcast radio and the bustling ISM (free-for-all) bands holding approximately all of the traffic. If you have a really good spectrum analyzer, you might be able to capture brief blips of cellular activity, and if you&#x27;re near a radar you&#x27;ll see that of course, but by and large the spectrum looks like a ghost town of empty apartments with absentee owners using them as capital assets while the plebeians cram into the designated slums. The stark contrast between the wildly over-utilized free-for-all bands and the wildly under-utilized auctioned bands really looks like a strong argument against spectrum auctions.<p>I&#x27;m sure you could find an economist to argue that the present state of affairs is natural, good, and maximally value producing (producing ROI for investors, that&#x27;s what life&#x27;s about!) but from where I&#x27;m standing the FCC auctions look like an idiotic forward propagation of last century&#x27;s engineering limitations, no matter how sophisticated and lucrative the auctions themselves are.')
