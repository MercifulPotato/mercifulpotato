Don&#x27;t waste money trying to build first-party games when you don&#x27;t have scale, spend all your money on scaling. Specifically:<p>- Spend budget on getting more AAA titles released on Stadia on launch day. (like they did with Cyberpunk)<p>- Spend budget giving huge discounts on AAA titles to attract more users.<p>- Spend the money to get integrated into every Smart TV platform (Roku, Google TV, LG Web OS, Tizen, Apple TV, ect.). TV Boxes should include a Stadia controller in their box and a few months free.<p>- Advertise that you can play AAA console games on the TV &#x2F; Streaming box you already own.')
