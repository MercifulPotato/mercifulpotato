Reading between the lines, the CA who cross-signed their previous root doesn’t really want to continue doing so (or asked for a lot more money) because LE usage reached levels that are just too risky. I don’t blame them: a single bad actor found doing something particularly nefarious with a LE certificate might lose them the trust their business is literally built upon. I don’t see any other CA queueing up to help what is typically their commercial nemesis. And as they say, at some point they would have to do it anyway, might as well rip the plaster off.')
