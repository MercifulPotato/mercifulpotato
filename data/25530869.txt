As long as you workout enough, you get 1&#x2F;24th paid back monthly. The workout requirement isn&#x27;t too crazy, commensurate with 2 weekly workouts and some daily activity (like a walk), and based on heartrate (so effort-based, instead of performance based. if you&#x27;re out of shape and your heart rate goes up a lot from a simple walk, it&#x27;ll get recognised as a serious workout for you, because in a way, it is).<p>Not sure I&#x27;d have gotten it otherwise. But at the same time, it&#x27;s pretty easy to rationalise any cost when looking at it as a monthly payment haha. A 3-year usage and a 20% resale value on the SE ($280) will get you a $6 a month price. If that improves your daily activity by just 5 or 10%, that&#x27;s probably the cheapest medical intervention in your life, ever. That&#x27;s probably why the insurance companies offer cashbacks, it&#x27;s a cool model. They can give me a watch for free every few years and get in return a person who, on average, spends &gt;1x the apple watch less on healthcare costs, every year.')
