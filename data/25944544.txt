But you still need to write code for each language and each protocol right? Or can we encode the protocol-handling code using Tree Notation also?<p>I have always felt like web assembly was missing a well-defined system for extending the API and also a strong external module system.  Or even if you could not extend the API much, if WASI had UDP, and there was a good WASM module distribution system, that seems like a way that one could distribute protocols.<p>But also Ethereum 2 seems like a decent way to distribute protocols.')
