Item(by='Slackwise', descendants=None, kids=[25647916], score=None, time=1609865142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614755, text='&gt; I&#x27;m a PM for Confluence Cloud and we&#x27;re always trying to make it better.<p>Can you guys <i>please</i> make Ctrl-S save and <i>not</i> exit editing? My muscle memory is costing me 10+ seconds of load times every time I type a paragraph and reflexively save, getting dumped back to the view mode of a document. The slow load times exacerbate the problem tremendously. I honestly don&#x27;t know a single product that treats Ctrl&#x2F;Cmd-S as &quot;Save and Exit&quot; so this is just a baffling UI&#x2F;UX design decision.')
