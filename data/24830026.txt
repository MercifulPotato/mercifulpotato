Heavy advertisement of a &#x27;free&#x27; product targeted toward children seems like a prerequisite for adoption, but I&#x27;ll admit that this take is as light on actual analysis as the parent blog post.<p>I have mixed feelings. On one hand, it seems like the more toxic (to borrow the phrase) IRC users have moved over to discord, however it also breaks my heart when I find a FOSS development community that uses discord exclusively, as it&#x27;s not currently possible to use it without giving them a phone number.')
