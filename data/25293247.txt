But &quot;buying homes after saving for a down payment after a few years&quot; is not a reality in any major metro area at the moment, unless you&#x27;re fine with small, old, and far out in the suburbs.<p>Isn&#x27;t true for people I know in other major cities that are working professionals. Most peers I have in their 30&#x27;s are buying homes in other major cities - if they are engineers or have a spouse who is an engineer.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about people who work retail. I&#x27;m talking specifically about engineers. Engineers in most major cities in the US can afford to buy a home if they have a spouse who works some kind of okay job. This just isn&#x27;t true in the bay area.')
