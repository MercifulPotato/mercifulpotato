Failing that, its the information age so just use facial recognition - not as biometric locks, but to identify unique individuals and alert security of unrecognised people or people with face coverings.  Uniforms and battledress could even incorporate body-worn cameras in order to identify individuals both to the minion wearing the device, and also as a remote &quot;eye on the ground&quot; to the security team.')
