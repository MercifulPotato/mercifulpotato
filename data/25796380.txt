In theory that sounds good, if you move somewhere it gives you a little help meeting people. In practice, this means that a huge number of profiles I see are just people at the airport. It also means that I get most of my matches when I&#x27;m traveling. This way Bumble gives me the dopamine hit of getting multiple matches per day (which never happens at home for me), while reducing the risk I&#x27;ll get into an actual relationship and leave their service.<p>That, plus their shady handling of user email addresses, has gotten me to prefer other apps')
