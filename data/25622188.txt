Even with their push for manifest v3, you can still run arbitrary JS on any url. Which, of course, allows arbitrary spying and manipulation.<p>If they hobble that, though, a large portion of extensions become useless. I don&#x27;t personally see any real middle ground. It&#x27;s either a credible risk, or too complicated for practical use. The way manifest v3 hobbles practically required things like heuristics is a good example.')
