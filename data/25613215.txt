If you have a thousand shell entities, you are doing something else (and more common).<p>Isn&#x27;t it easier (and more effective to the goal) to query the attorney of record, Articles of Organization filer, registered agent (etc from the Secretary of State), and have a more stringent eye on what they do, rather than taking personal identities to the Treasury?<p>The fault is not the individual, it&#x27;s the supporting system that allows for thousands of anonymous LLCs to be coordinated - that only can happen through a support structure - that should be easy to identify through the current data.<p>Edit: also, yes, as another comment mentioned, thank you for chiming in. Very rarely do people get to speak to decision makers and advisors in these positions - this is real democracy at work.')
