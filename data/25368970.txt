You&#x27;ll see them listed as the winner on many of the geo blocks.  I don&#x27;t know how to get a map showing just the blocks they won.<p>Most of the non-SpaceX blocks are rural areas that have had terabits of fiber running through them for the last decade as part of long-haul intercity links.  Since the last mile of rural fiber is so much cheaper than the last mile of urban fiber (100% aerial, no trenching, no manholes, no ducts, uncongested utility poles, simple property boundaries, terminate at the property line not deep inside a multitenant&#x2F;condoized building) this is a massive windfall for the telephone companies -- especially CenturyLink.<p>The FCC created some very perverse incentives with this auction.  They actually made it more profitable for telcos to leave intercity fiber unused in the ground than to splice a strand to serve the neighborhood it passes through.  This led many providers (cough cough CenturyLink cough) to refuse to use or even license their fiber until they could scoop up this cash first.  If even one residence in the block has service above 25mbit&#x2F;sec the whole block is taken out of the auction.')
