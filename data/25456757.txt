I like the one for rework that shows neatly staked wires.  There are a couple of subtleties you could miss on this one though:<p>1) On page three, that exposed end of the lead is a defect if you&#x27;re NOT going to conformally coat the board.  If you don&#x27;t know what a conformal coating is, it&#x27;s a defect.<p>2) On page eleven, flux residue.  Sure, for NASA&#x27;s applications.  For most commercial applications, the IPC rule is &quot;excessive flux residue&quot;.  For prototypes, one-offs, and hobby projects, my rule of thumb is, if you can&#x27;t measure the difference removing flux makes, leave it there.   Incompletely cleaned flux can be more corrosive than undisturbed flux.  Also, no-clean flux should be called &quot;never clean&quot; flux.  Never clean it with ordinary methods because you will never get it clean.')
