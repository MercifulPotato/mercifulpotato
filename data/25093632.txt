It probably is, but the problem is that 1. Apple doesn’t really explain any of this stuff anywhere so a technical user may read about it and make an informed decision nor 2. do they really provide a way to alter the process to use someone who isn’t Apple: just because they are a good default shouldn’t mean they should be the only provider that your computer will ever trust. And I think 3. is anger that a system Apple put in place failed in an entirely foreseeable fashion and essentially knocked a bunch of people’s livelihoods offline without warning or explanation and people are sick and tired of their things breaking for opaque “security” reasons.')
