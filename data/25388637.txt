Imagine I am a country of one. I have $100 million of cash and export absolutely nothing. I buy an equity stake in some companies in some other country (Nigeria) and wooh boy it&#x27;s fast growing and I&#x27;m getting 12% returns. I then spend all of those returns buying goods from China. I&#x27;m a net importer and yet haven&#x27;t taken out a single loan.')
