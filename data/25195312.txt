I don&#x27;t think my projects are as essential as a kernel where the GPL would shine, and I also don&#x27;t want to hinder companies from using my software.<p>BSD is fairly similar to MIT, but I feel like the clauses cause confusion. Ideally, I think 2 or 3 clause BSD are the right choices (4 is fine too, but I prefer it less).<p>What other licenses are their to choose from? What would be the advantages of licensing under different terms?<p>I&#x27;ve also been curious if a CLA is a good idea or not, I&#x27;ve implemented it to one of my projects (using a GitHub bot) and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem, but I&#x27;m still unsure about the implications of licensing this way.<p>I&#x27;m also unsure about if Apache would be a good fit.')
