Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[24875642, 24875355], score=None, time=1603492155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873491, text='&gt; It could take millions if years of technological civilization to produce a machine capable of sustaining life for the hundreds of thousands of years necessary for interstellar travel.<p>For a generation ship, are you referring to all the machinery that can maintain a balanced ecosystem of plants and animals and humans in order to provide food for the people during the trip to the new planet, and to make all the things needed to keep those people healthy during the trip such as medicine and drugs?<p>If so, there may be a way around that. Send all your colonists as frozen embryos or frozen sperm and eggs. Your ship only needs life support then to keep alive the people who run the ship. For food, don&#x27;t grow it. Take it with you.<p>At first taking your food with you seems absurd, but if you had a food with the same caloric density as rice, enough of it to provide 2000 calories&#x2F;day to one human for 100k years would fit in a sphere with a radius of 24.4 meters. So once your technological civilization figures out a way to preserve food such that they can make a rice ball equivalent with a 100k year storage life, a generation ship with a small crew becomes a whole lot more feasible.<p>For replacement crew throughout the journey, you can do a mix of using whatever kids the crew produces the old fashioned way and using kids produced from some of the frozen embryos&#x2F;eggs&#x2F;sperm.<p>I think technological civilizations will reach the point of being able to do this well before they are millions of years old. We aren&#x27;t too far from being able to do it ourselves. We are probably farther out on the propulsion for the ship itself.')
