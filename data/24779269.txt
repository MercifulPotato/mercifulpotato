Most coronaviruses only cause mild symptoms, so there&#x27;s not been a need for one. SARS vaccine efforts died early because the disease itself died out and there was no impetus to continue searching. MERS is similar in that, even though it hasn&#x27;t gone away, it burns itself out so quickly that the need for a vaccine is relatively small, and therefore research efforts have been limited.<p>&gt;  Drug development is hard. Most candidates never make it to market.<p>For vaccines, something like 80+% that make it past Phase 2 end up making it past Phase 3. Its unlikely for most vaccines that make it that far to fail. We already have half a dozen candidates around the world at that point, with more on the way. If anything, its highly unlikely we won&#x27;t find some kind of vaccine. If not one that grants sterilizing immunity, one that provides enough protection that it makes the disease far less deadly, like the flu vaccine.')
