Only recently have I concerned myself with the sound quality of online meetings. :) Meaning I&#x27;m not the best to ask, but maybe better than anyone else you know. But again, I think anything that&#x27;s wired with microphone that doesn&#x27;t have to deal with what comes out of speakers (feedback) is going to be a big improvement, even headsets. And moving around is a factor, as I&#x27;m leashed to my desk (though with a long enough headphone cable extension that I can work the resistance bands during long meetings). If I were worried about background noise, I could switch to a dynamic microphone.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;ve got a headset you&#x27;re happy with and no one complains, I&#x27;d just use that if it were me. Again, I&#x27;ve got the &quot;good stuff&quot; lying around already, so I just use that. I would not recommend anyone else go that road unless they have other uses for the gear.')
