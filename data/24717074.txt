It would be a lot nicer to have a function signature that shows the limits than it is to have a failure and have to open the docs for the library to see what the limits are.<p>If the code is sound, it should have the same complexity anyways.  I.e. putting a non-empty requirement in the function signature is just as complex as adequately handling an empty array in the code.<p>My personal struggle is that statically typed languages are annoying to prototype (I don&#x27;t care if it segfaults on my laptop, I want to validate my idea).  My struggle is prototyping in something that I can easily transition to a strictly typed version.  I&#x27;m curious to try prototyping in Javascript and adding types when I move to production.')
