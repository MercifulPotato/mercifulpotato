Asking as a noob</i><p>Abstractions piled on top of abstractions. Something that might have been 5 function calls deep on either side with a carefully crafted packet in the middle is now 100s on each side.<p>We have a culture that prizes programmer happiness above all and this means everyone thinks &quot;this is a mess, I&#x27;ll put my own layer on top to make it nice, then work above that layer&quot;. Repeat 100 times and now you have processors literally 2000 times faster that struggle to even keep up with keypresses. But what noone wants to admit, is that it&#x27;s messy because the problem domain is messy and sometimes you just have to live with the mess and get some real work done. The programmers of old understood this.')
