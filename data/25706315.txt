Item(by='garmaine', descendants=None, kids=[25706610, 25709519], score=None, time=1610235406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704230, text='The proposed mechanism for HCQ (zinc affinity) implies that it would be most effective if taken before the onset of symptoms, perhaps even before viral load is high enough to test positive. Obviously this makes it challenging to do a study. Nearly all studies that Iâ€™m aware of are initiated on patients that are already showing symptoms, because the patients are enrolled at the hospital, and few have the necessary zinc supplication. The expectation is that these studies would show little benefit, and indeed that is the case.<p>There remains no studies with large sample sizes done as far as I know with HCQ+zinc given as a prophylactic measure immediately upon first exposure.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that this isn&#x27;t some crank theory about COVID. It is well known that zinc inhibits replication of RNA virus, giving the immune system more time to respond. I used to get colds 5-6 times a year, and the flu almost every year. When I learned about this effect zinc has, I started taking mega doses of zinc upon exposure, whether I&#x27;m close to someone known to be sick, flying through airports, or just caught in cold weather. I have not had cold or flu symptoms since I started this regimen about 2 years ago. Of course that is just an anecdote. There are, IIRC, observational studies showing this effect across larger populations.')
