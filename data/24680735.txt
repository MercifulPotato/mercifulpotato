What about all the people who were diagnosed with terminal cancer and were suffering from unimaginable pain? It doesn&#x27;t matter if you will get a crippling addiction if you&#x27;re going to be dead in 8 months anyway. From what I&#x27;ve read, Oxycontin was the first available drug that could be easily administered at home once or twice a day and gave meaningful pain relief even for the worst pain. The drug may well have made bearable the last months of millions of people.')
