Learning and looking for an opportunity to use Elixir and Phoenix.<p>Resume: On request<p>Email: hello@imjonathan.com<p>I’ve been doing full-stack web development for over 12 years, and programming far longer. My heart is on the back-end but I can do front-end, too. Rails is my first love, and though I sometimes wander, I keep coming back to it.<p>I’ve built everything from custom CRMs to advanced payment integrations to high-performance email broadcast and management systems (at a scale that was too large for MailChimp to handle).<p>I love slinging SQL (especially in Postgres) and am comfortable architecting and managing databases. I’ve managed Linux servers and done a lot of DevOps&#x2F;automation work.<p>I also have expertise in the challenging world of email delivery, and what it takes to get emails into inboxes and keep reputation high.<p>Finally, I have a traditional art background and a good eye for front-end design, and experience doing it when necessary.<p>Thanks for reading!')
