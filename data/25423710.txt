Item(by='freeflight', descendants=None, kids=[25424407], score=None, time=1607981892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25423054, text='<i>&gt; there&#x27;s nothing as dreadful as the sound of people boarding or leaving every hour through the entire night.</i><p>That really depends on the individual. Personally I really like that kind of background noise when trying to sleep. I will usually listen to music with headphones and what gets trough is dampened so much that it nearly qualifies as &quot;ambient&quot; music.<p>But I&#x27;ve spend quite some time as a kid in overnight trains travelling between West-East Germany and Yugoslavia, and even more time in my teens travelling by train across central Europe.<p>I kind of like the whole experience even without a private cabin. A bit like a travelling hotel with changing sights. I can take along a couple of books and whatever food and drink I like, without having to worry about weird security rules.<p>In contrast to that long-distance air travel evokes only negative associations for me: Dry circulated air, pressure on the ears, cramped seats, the feeling of being stuck in a completely sealed metal tube, the &quot;streamy&quot; noise coming from the engines is really annoying compared to the rhythm of the sounds a train makes. When walking around on a plane there is nothing really to see because you can only walk between rows of seats with very small windows, which makes me feel weirdly guilty.<p>While on a train I can walk the full distance back and forth, taking in some of the sights trough the much larger windows. It&#x27;s also considered much more normal than pacing between the seating aisles of a plane.')
