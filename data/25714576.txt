Been there, done that, and it sure sucks to do the month-long blues to bring deps of even a medium-sized app to a new version. But, not picking on Spring specifically, it&#x27;s implicit in Spring&#x27;s design as a grand unified wrapper for all things  infrastructure. Whereas building on the base technology Spring is wrapping (JEE, mostly) would in principle allow picking versions much more freely. However, at this point, with the partial starvation of former JEE packages, even that  isn&#x27;t a given (had troubles with pointless JAX-RS apps and deprecated maven plugins at a customer of mine last year, whereas Spring migration was relatively painless).')
