It&#x27;s a complete myth as far as I have been able to tell (research tells me otherwise by using huge setups, and there are a few commenters here that seem to have first-hand experience, some seeming more trustworthy than others, but clearly not a majority of people). I get that it&#x27;s (obviously) more than a myth, but I&#x27;m not sure it deserves the goo-goo eyes that it seems to trigger with many engineers, either. It&#x27;s a neat feature slightly above the gimmick status but gets way more attention.')
