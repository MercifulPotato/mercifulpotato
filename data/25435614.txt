My sense is initiating IP litigation is more the province of legacy tech companies like IBM and Oracle. (Who aren’t being targeted by these EU laws)<p>I’ve seen very little examples of Apple, Google, or Amazon initiating patent lawsuits. Especially against small players. If anything most of their lobbying and litigation seems to aim to <i>weaken</i> IP law. (E.g. Google v. Oracle)')
