That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to say.<p>I work more than the average just like many on this board. Well guess what? I&#x27;m more skilled than the average. And I have a wider range of skills than most (from software engineering to marketing). I didn&#x27;t get there by clocking 40 at each role or at my own businesses. And I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to build successful businesses without going deep into learning for years ahead of time.<p>To many - the extra work hours are a focus on their craft and learning. I&#x27;ll add marketing tech skills. Or customer acquisition skills. Or finance.<p>If I was reading marketing books for 7 hours per week that wouldn&#x27;t be equated with working. That would be called learning.<p>And to many people - that&#x27;s a huge part of their life.<p>Just because my hobby or thirst of information may include &quot;work&quot;, doesn&#x27;t mean people with knitting hobbies after they clock out 40 have a better work&#x2F;life balance.<p>To me - some of my work is a hobby because I find it fascinating and I&#x27;ll explore different industries much like someone may explore different cuisines in their home chef hobby.<p>Also - I still have more regular hobbies than most people I know, because apart from some Hacker News time, I don&#x27;t spend 2-3 hours daily on social media like most people.<p>I don&#x27;t get the work&#x2F;life movement (apart from employer abuse of some employees).<p>Do you truly enjoy your life or not? Life balance is more appropriate to consider.')
