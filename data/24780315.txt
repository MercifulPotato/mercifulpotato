Item(by='screye', descendants=None, kids=[24781639, 24783501], score=None, time=1602702422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779542, text='Agreed, but the self-driving one is the only place where I could differentiate between the two with reasonable confidence due to decent domain and insider knowledge.<p>The acquisitions of Cruise, Nutonomy and the like were so inflated for the tech they had, that you can almost call it being fleeced. It was a good idea to get these companies as acqui-hires, but for between $0.5-1.5 billion the big companies got algorithms that would be obsolete in a year and a few talent employees, who they could have obtained for faaaar cheaper. (Zoox by amazon at least made some sense)<p>What is hilarious, is that Waymo is still so far ahead in the data game that I doubt it is possible for them to even catch up. Self-driving has become a tech problem, and suddenly the likes of Uber, Google and Apple find themselves far better equipped to handle what is now a data science problem than any of these traditional companies.<p>My prediction:<p>The breakthrough moment for self-driving will come from Waymo or Amazon&#x27;s Zoox (the ones with tons of 3d data). The &#x27;winning&#x27; company will then licence the tech to every 3rd party car manufacturer and you will have an android like self-driving ecosystem, where they are all more or less the same.')
