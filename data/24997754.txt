It&#x27;s not like in the 90s when these were considered general purpose.  If you&#x27;re using them these days, it&#x27;s more likely due to needing to use them.<p>Java is still used for a lot of other things where a language like Python would be fine and likely more productive.  Also, I have a feeling that the large growth in go from #20 to #13 likely also came at the expense of Java.<p>That, and the pie is growing.  Python is taking a larger share of the larger pie.')
