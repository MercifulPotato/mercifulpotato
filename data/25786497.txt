Where did he get this idea? You are not supposed to take Psilocybes every weekend like recreational drug.<p>You do 5 grams like Terrence McKenna says and then wait a few months until you do it again. For beginners, 5 grams is not recommended.<p>As for anti-depressant effects, the last time I did it was June last year. I think it rewired my brain and I don&#x27;t feel as down as before.<p>I would take Psilocybe mushrooms over anti-depressant medication any day. It takes more than 3 or 4 times before I felt like its anti-depressant effect was more long lasting.<p>I like to thank the heavens for allowing me to live in a country where I can order medical marijuana and psilocybes with cash and arrive in my mailbox the next day without fearing the law enforcement.
