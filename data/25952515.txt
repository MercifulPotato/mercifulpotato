Item(by='striking', descendants=None, kids=[25953149], score=None, time=1611884543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950913, text='Although it does seem a little meta, I&#x27;d like to do you the favor of telling you why I downvote every time I see someone complain about their downvotes or their post being grayed out.<p>It&#x27;s boring. It doesn&#x27;t make for good conversation. It&#x27;s not falsifiable and there&#x27;s nothing to be said about it. You&#x27;re just unhappy about it, and it just bores me.<p>Maybe you feel like you&#x27;re being censored, but really there can only be so much noise amidst the signal. And really, truly, an overlong and doubly updated comment where you are telling us to have our way with you is the least signal you could possibly have generated.<p>There are lots of complaints to be had about HN, but this is not one of them.<p>And to be even kinder and open to changing my mind, I thought I might see which comments you were unhappy about having cast into the gray. Would I see some glittering gems worth rescuing?<p>Unfortunately (predictably?), said comments employ double question marks or otherwise read angrily, or otherwise are simplistic and disagreeable and bring very little insight to the table. (And, you have a number of comments that have not been downvoted, so it&#x27;s not like this is complete randomness or an inability on HN&#x27;s part to accept basic facts. There is a correlation to be observed, one that perhaps you&#x27;re ignoring.)<p>HN isn&#x27;t perfect, but I think you doth protest a bit much.')
