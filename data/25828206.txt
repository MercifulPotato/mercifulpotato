Item(by='coffexx', descendants=None, kids=[25833704], score=None, time=1611014021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25827505, text='&gt; What makes central authorities and mainstream popular media inherently more suspicious?<p>I&#x27;ll take a stab.<p>Central authorities tend to be and to become political in nature. Their incentives include, among other things, maintaining their funding and not looking bad (eg: maintaining a purpose for existing, excusing their own misbehavior, making any political benefactors happy). What they say will probably align with those institutional incentives first, before truth. It can also stop them from saying things they ought to.<p>Mainstream popular media does not exist to be an objective arbiter of truth but instead because enough people want to consume it. It&#x27;s a business, albeit a business that has an incredible amount of power over not only the public&#x27;s opinion, but what they should care about, both through what they report and what they don&#x27;t report. They will push as many emotional buttons as they can to keep you coming back. Because they have a lot of power over the public they are targets for actors wishing to advance their own goals.\nIndividual journalists are not a-political and you shouldn&#x27;t expect them to be. Assume all reporting is tribal (especially if you agree with it), and that not only is the story as presented probably biased towards their own view of the world but that they&#x27;ve probably also left inconvenient things out. \nPolitical creatures tend to associate with those they agree with, and are in turn controlled by the group. \nPotential ostracism from their in-group is another source of bias.')
