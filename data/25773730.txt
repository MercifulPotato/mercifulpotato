I expect to have to put aside very little for retirement.<p>In the UK, at least, I&#x27;m not sure this is still true. On retirement, I planning on getting nothing from the government once I get there, and it&#x27;s looking increasingly likely that I won&#x27;t be allowed to retire until slightly later in life.<p>That being said, I have paid off my student loans in less than 10 years of work, so I can&#x27;t complain about the cost and quality of education.')
