Now they have a beachhead. Sounds like a win-win.<p>There should be an additional tier between <i>e.g.</i> $1mm and $25mm. Though that still wouldn&#x27;t satisfy an absolutist constituency. So maybe this is the most efficient compromise.<p>&gt; <i>This has nothing to do with “doing the right thing”</i><p>Who cares? I&#x27;ll take effective solutions from self-interested actors over well-intentioned bumbling.<p>&gt; <i>everything to do with limiting the number of outraged letters to senators from devs</i><p>Sounds like a responsive political system.<p>If your concern is the App Store&#x27;s 30% take from large developers, good news: they have the resources to find recourse in courts. Small developers don&#x27;t. Given this has zero effect on Epic, it has zero effect on their case. (Just, perhaps, its lobbying effect in Congress.)')
