I also dont put control in hard to reach places. I just use outdoor sensors + smart bulbs.<p>Use case 1: Open all lights in yard at night when exterior gate is open or motion detected. Shut off after set amount of time of no activity.<p>Use case 2: light in shed&#x2F;basement&#x2F;garage on when door is open.<p>Use case 3: control lights via telegram &#x2F; get notifications as alarm system.<p>Use case 4: water sensors anywhere you can get a leak. (have been flooded while away)<p>Use case 5: you dont want to rewire the house but want to link multiple lights together.<p>Use case 6: you want to remotely enable lights outside from second floor to check what the dog is barking at.<p>I can go on.<p>What the guy did wrong was ignore failures and not have a way to deal with them')
