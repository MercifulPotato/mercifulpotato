The registry was used last year to remind parents to get their children vaccinated, when it turned out that most of those who hadn&#x27;t gotten their children vaccinated wasn&#x27;t against the vaccination program, their simply forgot.<p>It&#x27;s also used to remind the elderly that their are entitled to free flu-shots.<p>Previously I wouldn&#x27;t have been worried. I&#x27;ve always trusted our various governments to not misuse health records. With the current government I&#x27;m not so sure. The prime minister is enjoying record support, and it&#x27;s not that I believe a different government would have done better, it&#x27;s just the handling is down right creepy. Hoarding of power, bulldozing critics and make last minute half-assessed decisions all while the public is cheering them on.<p>The current attitude is that the COVID-19 vaccine is going to be 100% voluntary, but I also fear that is will only be in principle. If it&#x27;s as you say required for border crossing, transport and so on, it&#x27;s not really voluntary.<p>Danish experts have warned against forcing the vaccine on people could turn them against not only the COVID-19 vaccine, but the entire vaccination program in general.<p>Personally I think we should wait an see how many opt to not get the vaccine before dreaming up restrictions.')
