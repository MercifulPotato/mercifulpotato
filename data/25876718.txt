So the project sites started getting read by lots of users who don’t have GitLab logins and would never commit to a repo.<p>I wish there was a way to link my orgs logins with GitHub so non-GitHub licensed users could view the sites. I mean, I can do that but I have to then buy GitHub licenses and make them create GitHub accounts just to view project docs. That’s pretty expensive compared to just keeping projects on my internal GitLab.')
