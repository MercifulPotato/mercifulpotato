If I use equivalent materials (MDF), it&#x27;s still more expensive for me.  If I use good plywood (which is usually the right choice) or solid wood (which despite common perception is the wrong choice for almost anything involving large flat panels), it may be more durable but becomes significantly more expensive.<p>IKEA stuff may not last centuries, but it often lasts fine for its intended use.  I have a number of cheap IKEA Kallax-style bookshelves around my house.  They&#x27;re made of cardboard, hopes, and dreams, but have held up to all the loads I&#x27;ve thrown at them for years and even survived a couple of apartment&#x2F;house moves (admittedly, the big one would probably not survive another move).  How many people ACTUALLY want to keep the same piece of furniture with the same dimensions and styling forever?  How many people who want to actually manage to in the face of new residences, combining furniture with roommates&#x2F;partners, etc.?<p>IKEA is only one example.  The same arguments apply for other brands, including some &quot;real&quot; furniture.  I&#x27;m in the middle of building a queen-sized Murphy Bed.  All said and done, my material costs are approaching $2000 (without a mattress) and I&#x27;ve spent several weeks worth of evenings on it.  It&#x27;s been a challenging project, and I don&#x27;t regret it, but economically it would ABSOLUTELY have been better to buy one.')
