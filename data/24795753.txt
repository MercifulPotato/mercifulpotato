Installed the app and pressed the microphone icon, but didn’t notice the button. Was it even there?<p>But then after I’d uninstalled the app I went back and reread the article and saw it say to press microphone and then button for search a song, reinstalled app and then I saw the button there.<p>Still don’t know if it was there or not the first time around. Maybe I just didn’t see it? Either way, it’s there now. Using iOS btw.<p>I was curious to see how it would fare because for example when I’ve tried to hum into Shazam or SoundHound in the past they’ve never come close to finding what I was looking for.<p>But I read in the article that Google is using machine learning and that they have actually trained their hum to search on recording of humming so I got my hopes up.<p>So in the Google search app I hummed a part of the melody for the song <i>What is Love</i> by Haddaway and... it recognized it! I’m impressed!')
