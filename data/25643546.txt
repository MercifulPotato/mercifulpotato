That does sound like how one reaches a local maximum, to use the term from the article.<p>Think on it in a different way, most of the very revolutionary theories, those that changed how we see the world, were relatively more simple, they were generally simple enough that one fringe could develop them to a point where they shined so brightly as to be next to irrefutable. Things like how the earth might be round, and circle the sun.<p>We can&#x27;t expect the same to be true for more advanced fields, we can&#x27;t say &quot;yeah, this &quot;new&#x2F;underdeveloped&quot; idea does seem reasonable, but it does not solve everything as well as our existing theory that we&#x27;ve been iterating on for decades, so let&#x27;s not waste time on that&quot;.')
