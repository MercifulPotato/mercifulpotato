Item(by='zaroth', descendants=None, kids=[25873004, 25870558], score=None, time=1611267641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865113, text='I think your definition of “best of the best” needs updating.<p>Show me where Toyota has casting machines anywhere near the scale of what Tesla is using in Model Y, or board design, or AI chips, or even things like buying experience.<p>Fundamentally “best” can be reduced to <i>margins</i> because everything else shakes out in a competitive market. Tesla has the best margins, and they will bring that margin advantage down to the $25k price point and Toyota won’t stop them.<p>The other big number you can look at is depreciation and operating costs. Tesla has the lowest depreciation and operating costs per mile at its price point, making it substantially cheaper to own a $45k Tesla than a $45k ICE.<p>A $25k Tesla with the same fundamentals could be had for perhaps $200&#x2F;month with $0 down and would essentially obliterate any passenger car competition in any consumer environment where it’s possible to charge it.<p>I would not expect Tesla to have any compunction of selling a $25k vehicle under the Tesla brand. I don’t think their S&#x2F;3&#x2F;X&#x2F;Y cachet would be hurt by a smaller sibling.')
