It&#x27;s so unbelievable that people don&#x27;t realize that the USA has been a fascist police state since the days of slave patrols allying with banks and sheriffs, just like today&#x27;s police allying with chambers of commerce and police unions. By focusing so much on which party the fascists belong to, and ignoring the bigger pattern of corporate money flowing into a multitude of different politicians, we&#x27;re missing out on structural improvements that could actually make a difference in how free the typical person gets to be. It seems like everybody is thinking that things have changed when they are still the same. Disappointing!')
