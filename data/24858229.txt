One cannot change the world only affect it in a tiniest way. But when a majority of a group&#x2F;class are pushing same way they can affect history.<p>That was not apparent from your comment. But also, I think that you are using straw idea of aristocracy rather then real societal system as it existed in various periods. The whole thread started with my look at real world historical aristocracy. You used made up nazi guard that was &quot;just doing job&quot; to tilt big picture, but it was not fair comparison.<p>All this is under article about Marie Antionette who specifically I don&#x27;t really think was evil.')
