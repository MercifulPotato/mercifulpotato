This by definition creates a separation in the socio economic hierarchy.<p>It&#x27;s for a reason that usury&#x2F;interest is banned in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism for example. It&#x27;s a parasitic practice that makes the economy fundamentally unstable. This includes dangerous practices such as selling debt for debt (which triggered the 2008 crisis), and things like stock shorting (which, interestingly enough was also banned during the crisis, at least for some critical company stocks).<p>Get rid of these dangerous, immoral, and parasitic practices, and we&#x27;ll be on a strong path to improve things.')
