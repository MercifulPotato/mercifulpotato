Or it makes no biological sense to care about $variable, then we should have no requirements about making sure that $variable is correctly sampled in the test groups.<p>In this case, ethnicity probably has 0 impact on the effectiveness of the vaccine, therefore why does anyone care about the distribution of ethnic groups in the sample ?')
