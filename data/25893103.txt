The man can&#x27;t be trusted.&quot;<p>Krugman&#x27;s cited gc.cuny.edu paper is titled, &quot;Globalization: What Did We Miss?&quot;  It concludes, not that economists were <i>wrong</i> per se, but that they didn&#x27;t adequately take into account the <i>pace</i> of globalization: &quot;Basically, <i>the big problem</i> with surging globalization wasnâ€™t so much changing demand for broadly defined factors of production as <i>the disruption caused by rapid change</i>. And that rapid change appears to be largely behind us ....&quot; (Emphasis added.)<p>The summary in the University of Melbourne piece (the third cite) is to basically the same effect.<p>(I don&#x27;t have time to watch a one-hour YouTube video, but thanks for the link.)')
