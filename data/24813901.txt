It&#x27;s helped. We have evidence it works.<p>Yet, people, who i assume are smart people, say that we&#x27;re overreacting and we&#x27;re causing societal harm and taking away their freedoms.<p>I can only laugh and cringe...<p>History shows that those cities that took active measures in every prior epidemic survived better and recovered better and thrived after.<p>This isn&#x27;t our first pandemic, wont&#x27; be our last. Where we failed is we were woefully unprepared, our administration convinced people it&#x27;s not that bad but here we are months later, deaths are still pushing upwards of 1,000 americans a day and people are saying its no worse than the flu.<p>There is no evidence to support this argument unless you&#x27;re trying to deceive people.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to know statistics.  Take the worst flue year where we had 48k deaths that year. Covid is 5x worse that and we still haven&#x27;t even made it through an entire year.<p>Take our best flue year - 1986-87 - where only 2,868 or so died. We&#x27;ll be 100x times worse than that year with COVID alone and we&#x27;re just NOW entering the common flu season.<p>The basic math doesn&#x27;t support some of these studies that seem to use statistics for political gain rather than simple math for communicating the obvious differences.<p>And lets not forget - the death toll is only under control because we are taking active measures.')
