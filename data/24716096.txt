Based on my own experience, it would seem I have some level of it as well. I feel like in the past few years, after working a decade in software engineering, I&#x27;ve learned to utilize my ADHD tendencies pretty well. In several companies now I&#x27;ve acted in a role of some kind of lead engineer where difficult problems or live issues get thrown my way (I seem to get myself into such a role more often than not). Juggling several high priority tasks at once lets me focus really well on each in short bursts of time, and after that, I seem to enjoy the context switching way more than most other software engineering peers would (everyone else seems to hate it). I would add that, as an unrelated point to ADHD, I&#x27;m a person who can handle stressful situations fairly well, so it definitely helps with being the guy tackling production fires all the time. Not sure if it works for everyone, at least it does for me and I&#x27;ve had a thriving engineering career for 15 years and counting now. I don&#x27;t use any medication.')
