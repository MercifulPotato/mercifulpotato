I simply spent as little money as possible.  To me, it’s like people that want to lose weight.  You can stick to a diet or simply choose to eat less at all times.  Every time I spent, I figure out what is on discount and whether it’s a ‘want’ or a ‘need’.  I will indulge once in a while on late night food though.')
