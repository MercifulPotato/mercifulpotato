Item(by='Udik', descendants=None, kids=[25991178], score=None, time=1612183149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25985574, text='I&#x27;ve watched the second video and it still makes no sense to me.<p>&quot;if you have an organism that sees reality as it is, competing with an organism that sees none of reality but is just tuned to what&#x27;s called the fitness in the environment&quot;<p>The fitness in the environment? As I understand it, fitness is a property of the individuals, not of the environment. It&#x27;s defined <i>ex post</i> as the reproductive success of an individual. What does being &quot;tuned to fitness&quot; mean? I imagine (but can only guess) it means something like &quot;being served a pre-digested version of reality that maximises some signal-to-noise ratio&quot;. But that means that someone else is doing the job of actually parsing the relevant information in the environment before feeding it to an organism.<p>The second issue I have is with the concept of &quot;reality&quot;. Is there even such a thing? Real is what, in some sense, reflects useful properties of the environment- and it&#x27;s still an approximation. Is the steak real? Or are its proteins real? Or the atoms of which it is composed? Or the chemical bounds between them? Or the quarks? Or where it came from? Or its colour? Or its relation with our digestive system?<p>In the video he makes the example of a file: is it &quot;real&quot; that the file is an icon sitting in the middle of the screen? Well, for some uses it is. For others it&#x27;s sitting somewhere in the filesystem. For other uses, it&#x27;s a series of non-contiguous blocks. For others still, it&#x27;s magnetic fields on a disc surface. For others, it&#x27;s an abstract entity that can be printed on a sheet of paper or sent via email or encrypted. All these things are real, yet none really captures the ground truth of the thing, which is possibly unknowable.')
