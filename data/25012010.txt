Item(by='westoncb', descendants=None, kids=[25012166, 25012306], score=None, time=1604704297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010458, text='There are really two properties which are essential for a metaphor to convey understanding (which is not to say no other aspects have an effect—they certainly do, but I&#x27;m just trying to narrow down the &#x27;functional core&#x27; here):<p>1. It needs to be expressed in the terms of a subject already understood by the listener.<p>2. It should have a &#x27;structure&#x27; which is similar to that of the new, not yet understood subject.<p>These two things allow an identification to be made between something already understood and something not yet understood, granting new understanding.<p>The idea that the library should be &#x27;normal&#x27; is not essential; it just needs to be understandable. (granted if it became <i>too</i> unusual it could cause problems, but I&#x27;ll just leave it up to the reader&#x27;s judgement whether &quot;a library with 25 books&quot; is too large a stretch of the imagination)<p>What&#x27;s really nice about the above metaphor is that its structure matches the situation with coding very closely: technical debt is about the up front time-cost of introducing new systems of organization to replace ad-hoc, unsystematic methods whose cost-effectiveness decreases as project complexity (to put it loosely) increases.<p>While this is a pretty abstract notion in itself, the library scenario captures the same key points and dynamics in a way that&#x27;s comprehensible to anyone with an understanding that libraries use &#x27;systems of organization&#x27; (even if they don&#x27;t know an abstract term for it)—this still works even if the particular set up for the &#x27;library&#x27; in the example would not be found in the real world.')
