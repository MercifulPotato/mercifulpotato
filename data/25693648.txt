What if these people were going around insisting the Earth is flat, trying to force other people to agree with you, then increasingly lashing out when others don&#x27;t agree? Oh, and they are picking up new adherents by doing this as well.<p>Consistent enforcement of the rules (which Apple is not good at, I will say) would have avoided this becoming such a problem. Parler has been a cesspit for its whole existence, as far as I know, and approximately nobody would have cared if Apple never let them on the App Store. And fewer people would blindly believe that the earth is flat.')
