Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[25314496], score=None, time=1607174578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25314183, text='My first reaction when I read &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; in the title was &quot;cool&quot; followed immediately with &quot;oh it&#x27;s going to push some cryptocurrency crap, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<p>But honestly after reading the page it look fine to me. Oddly enough they seem to use cryptocurrencies as... currency. They don&#x27;t bullshit you by saying that you&#x27;re going to store your code on the blockchain.<p>Besides, while I long ago became tired of the cryptocurrency crowd reinventing squared wheels every other month, the problem of rewarding open source developers is still very much an open issue, so I&#x27;m willing to give it a chance, even if I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>This seems like a cool project frankly, at least on paper, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to discard it just because it bundles some optional Ethereum support.<p>Actually after downloading the upstream client my only complaint so far is that it&#x27;s yet an other bloated Electron app, but such is life in 2020...')
