This applies to both extensive simulations like dwarf fortress, to incredibly simple simulations like mega man. Combined with the fact they’re software, and thus generally available to be shared and modified without cost, they’re uniquely qualified to be a communal artistic medium — one in which others can modify, enhance, and extend the simulation capabilities.<p>There’s a reason games have (popular) modding cultures, where other mediums do not, and that same reason is why it is viable&#x2F;reasonable for games to be libre.<p>That most games are treated and developed like movies, rather than like simulations, is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding by the game designers&#x2F;developers.')
