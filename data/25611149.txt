I may rant it all day long about the things I don&#x27;t like about systemd and praise its useful features for a similar amount of time but, I&#x27;d never bring up &quot;I learn to everything from ground up again!&quot; as an issue.<p>Software evolves, everything evolves. We need to adapt regardless of we are system administrators of a big farm or a user of a measly Linux system.')
