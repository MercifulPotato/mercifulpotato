I found that, even as a programmer, presentation slides is one of those things that I just wish I&#x27;m using a WYSIWYG GUI editor to create. I remember trying out reveal-md; and a little while later, went back to Google Slides next time, and found it simply more liberating to write slides in a GUI. I&#x27;ll admit this may simply be personal preference though. Or I simply need to give it more time to  try to write slides in markdown?')
