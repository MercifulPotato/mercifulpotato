Many people find this counterintuitive.  The energy from combustion comes from the fact that all hydrocarbon combustion produces a large number of strong bonds in CO2 and H2O. Breaking oxygen bonds produces no energy and in fact requires energy -  it&#x27;s just that since oxygen bonds are weak it requires less energy than one might expect.<p>Edit: slightly changed wording')
