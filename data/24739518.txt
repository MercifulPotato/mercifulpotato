Pretty sure every action you do plays into The Algorithm.<p>There’s jokes about there being different TikToks based on this. Like “gay TikTok”, “farmer TikTok”, etc. As a point of reference, TikTok for the occasional time I use it will be a mixture of:<p>- farming &#x2F; horses &#x2F; archery<p>- construction workers and mechanics either doing really sketchy stuff or providing really useful stuff<p>- two strippers who tell funny&#x2F;cringey stories from work (I don’t follow them, they just keep showing up and telling ridiculous stories, which I listen to, which reinforces The Algorithm)')
