Or a computer in every car tweaking fuel injection. It&#x27;s not practical until it is. Electronics goes down in price. Algorithms improve. Insulation stays fixed or goes up in price. I would say it&#x27;s not a question of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when.&quot;<p>The answer to that might be right now (we couldn&#x27;t do it before, and we probably can today) or it might be in a decade. But electronics will keep falling in price. 10,000 microphones * $5 per microphone+electronics = $50k.<p>The advantages of cancelling an entire wavefront go well beyond passenger comfort too. Industrial noise cancelling systems are more about equipment life than about employee comfort. I had laptop screws unscrew on airplanes before, due to vibration. If planes need less maintenance as a result of active vibration reduction throughout the airplane, you&#x27;ll make up that $50k virtually overnight.<p>As a footnote, the crazy part here isn&#x27;t the 10,000 microphones, but the speaker-at-every-seat part. You&#x27;d almost certainly want both the microphones and speakers in the skin of the airplane. But that&#x27;s a story for another day.')
