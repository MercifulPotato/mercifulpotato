Consequently, the idea of eels having any type of social or economic value appears less normal to us the thought of other animals or commodities having negotiable value.<p>This makes it sound like we simply lost our taste for eel, but the truth is that the European eel is critically endangered after years of overfishing. I&#x27;m sure they were still a delicacy if they were available.\nJapanese eels popular in unagi dishes are also quite endangered and even though they&#x27;re farmed in aquacultures these days, these depend on wild-caught glass eels as far as I understand.')
