The problem to solve is things like Go packages that want to static-link their dependencies.<p>One way forward is to consider programs that want to static-link as being, effectively, scripts. So, like scripts, they are not packaged as complete executables. Their dependencies do not refer to a specific version, but provide a link to where to get any specific version wanted. The thing in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin is a script that checks for a cached build and, <i>if needed</i>: invokes the build tool, which uses local copies where found and usable, and downloads updates where needed, and links.<p>A package- or dist-upgrade doesn&#x27;t pull new versions of dependencies; it just notes where local, cached copies are stale, and flushes. On next execution -- exactly as with scripts -- invalidated builds are scrapped, and rebuilt.<p>It means that to use a Go program, you need a Go toolchain, but that is not a large burden.<p>It means that the responsibility of the package system is only to flush caches when breaking or security updates happen. The target itself arranges to be able to start up quickly, on the 2nd run, much like the Python packages we already deal with.')
