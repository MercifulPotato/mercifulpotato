Aren&#x27;t we rapidly going towards a future where a job is rare to come by?  Why not just pay a dude to bike around and sell chicken.  No software updates, no crazy backend to support it, is able to make quick decisions about where it should be to sell the most chicken, very little carbon footprint due to a guy literally using his own energy to ride a bicycle.')
