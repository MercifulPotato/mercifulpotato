To paraphrase, you&#x27;re saying that going in, before even seeing a contract, you should be prepared to agree to anything because it is your role to agree to anything.  And then you go on to say that it is their own fault for not moving to a location that forbids it.<p>The choices are not just &quot;like it or leave it&quot;.  Another is to recognize that the options being presented are unreasonable, and that the entire situation should be changed to make it impossible.<p>I agree that the solution is stronger labor laws.  I disagree vehemently that people should be forced to relocate as a condition of those stronger labor laws.')
