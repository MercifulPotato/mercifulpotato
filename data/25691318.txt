Venezuela does it pretty well, probably because they know there&#x27;s an invasion itchy trigger finger pointed at them.*<p>Poll workers for instance, get drafted from a lottery right near the election instead of a voluntary system so there&#x27;s no way a team of confederates could scheme behind the scenes.<p>There&#x27;s also multiple tabulating and verification steps. The ballots are both machine and hand counted. The people and machines are chosen at random and nobody could rig all the machines because nobody has access to all of them. Nobody can coordinate an effort for subordinates to rig them because again, the teams are formed via a random draft.<p>Test ballots get fed through the machines by teams of observers who get randomly assigned to polling stations for surprise inspections.<p>Furthermore the top 6 candidates  independently verify the tally. They each get essentially an open book of the records. Statistical spot check surveys are done as a further confirmation etc. There&#x27;s lots of international observers, etc<p>Every voter gets a copy of the ballot and a confirmation number that they can go and check the record of.<p>Maybe someone else can find a place where corruption in the tabulation could occur but it looks pretty airtight to me<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elections_in_Venezuela#Polling_procedure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elections_in_Venezuela#Polling...</a><p>* - It&#x27;s worth noting I&#x27;m not saying anything about the outcome of the elections or the politics. Voter intimidation and disinformation could still happen, lots of objectionable things. But their tabulation of  votes seems to be pretty clean. Dictators, if that&#x27;s your opinion here, can stay in power without lying about the vote count by, say, deciding what makes it on the ballot in the first place. For an extreme example, this election <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1936_German_parliamentary_election_and_referendum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1936_German_parliamentary_elec...</a> could have been exemplary - as clean as mathematically possible, and had the same outcome.')
