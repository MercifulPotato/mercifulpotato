Big business can be made to support local community and culture. Just because the Walmart headquarters are outside of my small town, doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have to pay a percentage of their earnings from the local warehouse to that community.<p>Also, minor grammar nit, you may have meant to use &quot;shell-shocked&quot; instead of &quot;shellacked&quot;, but shell-shocked wouldn&#x27;t fit the context you&#x27;re going for either.')
