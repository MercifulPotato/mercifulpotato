If you don&#x27;t know, that&#x27;s ok.<p>But arguing that &quot;The OP argument cannot be correct because other people made incorrect predictions about other stuff in the past&quot; is pointless and useless.<p>Maybe some application of quantum computing appears in the future that requires a quantum operating system, or maybe there is one such application that already exists today and we don&#x27;t know about. I don&#x27;t know of any, and like the OP I also think of Quantum Computers as &quot;accelerators&quot; (like GPUs, FPGAs, Xeon Phis, ...) for certain class of problems.')
