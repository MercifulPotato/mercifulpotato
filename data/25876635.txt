But now our votes are more alike when our &quot;tribe&quot; is alike - e.g. professional, rural, urban poor. Plus few people ever see their local representative except on national TV. So maybe the time for geographic districts has passed.<p>To get real minority interests some representation, and to solve the geography problem, I&#x27;d like to see a state say they&#x27;ve got 10 representative positions, and you&#x27;re all going to have a vote (or maybe 10). The top 10 vote-getters are then chosen.')
