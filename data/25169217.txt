Unless you&#x27;re looking at a System76 Laptop or at least a Thinkpad&#x2F;Dell that&#x27;s certified.<p>I&#x27;ve had a great experience with my XPS 13 so far. Everything (Headphones, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,...) just works, Dell even provides Bios updates. Whereas Windows 10 didn&#x27;t recognise that my headphones also have a microphone. Only downside is the limited battery management, this is definitely better on ThinkPads.')
