From what Iâ€™ve seen, the push to destigmatize mental health is done to avoid labeling and treat mental health the way we treat general health. For example, treat stress and anxiety as health concerns whereby you can&#x2F;should take time off if you need to recover from stress as you would a cold. Or, if having difficulty reducing your stress, to see a therapist without any social stigma.')
