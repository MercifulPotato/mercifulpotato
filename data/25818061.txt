Item(by='langitbiru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610943398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816896, text='I develop PredictSalary (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictsalary.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictsalary.com</a>), a browser extension that can predict the salary range of job opportunities. It&#x27;s free but one person told me that he didn&#x27;t mind to pay me if I added support for job opportunities in his country (UK). The extension has 700+ users now. I don&#x27;t know whether this number can be considered as significant user base or not.<p>Later, I&#x27;ll add the capability to predict the salary range of people from their Linkedin profiles. I would make this a premium feature. Let&#x27;s see how it goes.')
