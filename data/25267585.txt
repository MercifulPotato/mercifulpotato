Then I moved cities and went remote - no commute.  After about a month I missed it enough that I set up a few 30-60ish minute &quot;loops&quot; and walked one or two of them every day (i.e. 2  short ones or 1 long one) and this worked pretty well.<p>If I found myself making excuses not to go, I&#x27;d mix in an errand that was about a 30 min walk away.  Other people I know use a dog as an excuse for this sort of pattern too.')
