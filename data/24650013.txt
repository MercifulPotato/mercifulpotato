The vast majority of results don&#x27;t replicate. It&#x27;s super-easy to come up with results like this paper just by playing around with what you control for (with a 5% of a false positive each time) until you get the result you want. It&#x27;s almost impossible to tell if this happened. There are many similar issues.<p>&gt; You can use this reasoning to dismiss, or more likely, to cherry-pick probably 95% of all scientific results from economic&#x2F;medical&#x2F;social&#x2F;nutricion&#x2F;climate science.<p>And you should! You should believe results only once they&#x27;ve been replicated multiple times, by multiple communities, with multiple methodologies.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d say the onus on sceptics in this case<p>The onus is on the people presenting the result, in all cases. That&#x27;s the scientific process. The authors need to defend the null hypothesis as vigorously as you can.<p>&gt; This paper is likely headed for a serious economic journal, where it typically goes through at least days of labor to scrutinise the execution&#x2F;details&#x2F;methodology in peer review. I&#x27;m not invested enough to volunteer for that.<p>Have you ever gone through a peer review process? Seriously?<p>I understand you&#x27;re not invested enough to do that, but neither are the reviewers. It&#x27;s a volunteer position with no credit or upside. Most give a cursory skim, and either accept or reject. It&#x27;s no better than chance.<p>Seriously. NIPS did a study, and found it is literally no better than chance.<p>Of my own papers, I&#x27;ve only had one where peer reviewers did an in-depth read. For the rest, acceptance was completely random. Reviewer comments often have little relation to the actual paper (many reviewers just skim the abstract and the intro, and don&#x27;t even fully read those).')
