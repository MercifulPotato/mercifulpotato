When my child was a few months old something clicked and the constant crying wasn&#x27;t bothering me anymore. Since then, things that used to irk me are no longer affecting me. But I remember saying to myself that the baby isn&#x27;t in control and they&#x27;re not trying to be annoying on purpose, all babies cry (most of them of course) and there&#x27;s no reason to get annoyed, it won&#x27;t help me or anybody. I think it helped. Now at most I get a bit stressed out when the crying is very loud and incessant, but it does not register the way it used to. I remember the in first weeks I was a wreck and a lot of it was my own doing, I was anticipating the future distress and was getting annoyed in advance.')
