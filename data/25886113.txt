Item(by='GekkePrutser', descendants=None, kids=[25891075], score=None, time=1611436160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881954, text='I don&#x27;t like IRMA because it makes it too easy for sites to verify identity (even though they don&#x27;t get more information than what they ask for, and in some cases only proof that the attribute exists rather than the information itself).<p>I just think it provides a &#x27;sliding scale&#x27;. With IRMA it becomes much easier to validate identity. Right now sites have to ask for a payment or ID card which people are obviously very hesitant to provide. So websites only do it if it&#x27;s really necessary.<p>With IRMA it becomes too accessible. I don&#x27;t want to ID myself every time I sign up for some hobbyforum or whatever. The internet should remain as anonymous as possible. IRMA makes it possible for websites to ask for identity information in a quick and painless way and that makes the actual asking more prevalent (&quot;drempelverlagend&quot; as we say in the Netherlands). More and more sites will add ID validation as a result.<p>Personally I like the internet as it is.. There used to be a saying &quot;On the internet nobody knows if you&#x27;re a dog&quot;. We shouldn&#x27;t strive to change this IMO. The problem isn&#x27;t just that I want to ID myself in a privacy-conscious way. I just don&#x27;t want to ID myself at all.')
