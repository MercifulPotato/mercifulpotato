That seems oddly zero sum to me (which is why I alluded to it before). It suggests that there never are real productivity gainsâ€”in the sense that any resultant wage increases are followed by compensatory inflation.<p>Yet even if that were true, if we treat this purely as zero sum (and don&#x27;t account for economic growth), we can still easily look at _distribution_ of wealth and income, and the trends there (as I noted elsewhere), both in the US and the developed world more broadly, are directionally consistent with less income due to labor and a greater role of capital ownership.<p>I don&#x27;t think this inflationary argument (which may be valid) would explain why capital ownership would be an increasing share of overall wealth. I tend to think this is better explained by (crudely summarizing) Piketty&#x27;s thesis that the Kuznets curve is simply wrong, that (unfortunately) war and commensurate economic upheaval is associated with a flattening of inequality, and that the long period of relative growth and stability in the west almost inevitably leads to increasing inequality and a relative weakening of the labor force.')
