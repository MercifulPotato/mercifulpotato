Did you experience this? Were there things you might have wanted to change about your lisp which were inhibited by the use of Fexprs?<p>&gt; FEXPRs and FSUBRs were ... meta-implementation\noperators that relied on the meta-circular definition of EVAL<p>&gt; The problem with FEXPRs is that they are far too powerful and place too many constraints on the implementation.<p>&gt; FEXPRs were <i>designed</i>\naround the fact that the language had a meta-circular definition that was\nimplemented via recursive descent of list structure.<p>&gt; A FEXPR, on the other hand, is a program that is deliberately\n<i>not</i> abstracted away from the concrete representation.<p>&gt; A FEXPR manipulates objects on both sides\nof the isomorphism (yuck), so Big-P and Big-P^-1 cannot be factored out\nof the semantics.')
