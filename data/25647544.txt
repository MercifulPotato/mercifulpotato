You can get up and running very quickly by just giving someone a URL (probably with a pre-unpacked image)... I&#x27;m not sure of where I&#x27;d use it outside of teaching... but it&#x27;s quite impressive.<p>Teaching seems like a great use case. Maybe they&#x27;ll use similar licensing as their Cheerp compiler [0] and provide a basic community tier. You could give students a foolproof (?) way to run a controlled set of applications locally without the confusion of setting up a local VM host or the expense of hosting virtual machines for the class. That assumes your students have decent computers.<p>Actually, this would be a nice way to sideload real applications onto Chromebooks. Certainly more secure&#x2F;accessible&#x2F;maintainable than unlocking all the default protections and side-loading Linux first.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leaningtech.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;cheerp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leaningtech.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;cheerp.html</a>')
