I sometimes use Excel when I want to see a CSV file formatted nicely, but apparently Excel has bad support for CSV files, opening them unparsed (e.g. each line of the CSV taking up a single cell.) Apparently you have to use the &quot;Import CSV&quot; wizard. When building apps that export CSVs, many times customers have had issues with special characters appearing weirdly, so I&#x27;ve needed to format the files using some sort of DOS character set.<p>Apple Numbers and Quick Look opens CSV files without any issues whatsoever.<p>Why is CSV support in Excel so poor?')
