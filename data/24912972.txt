That you feel I have so much contempt for my &quot;fellow man&quot; because of this disagreement of ours is wild. I may just as well bemoan - in equally bad faith - your contempt for honesty, transparency, or reality.<p>It&#x27;s funny that you took this so personally.  I said explicitly I was talking about people who want to suppress the speech of their fellow citizens.  Yet in the next paragraph you claim that&#x27;s not what you want.<p>I don&#x27;t care how well intentioned anyone is in their desire to suppress the speech of their fellow man.  It is ultimately an evil and condescending stance that history shows is bound up with the very worst bloodshed and human suffering that men produce.<p>People who are supporting the current drive to hide opinions and ideas they dislike from everyone else should be ashamed of themselves.  Of course they wont be, and we&#x27;ll all suffer the pain and social destruction that is sure to follow as a result.<p>The cure you are promoting is much worse than the disease you can barely articulate.')
