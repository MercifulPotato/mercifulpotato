Item(by='Dig1t', descendants=None, kids=[25308471, 25309830], score=None, time=1607116459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307908, text='&quot;Do X or I&#x27;ll quit&quot; is a childish way to negotiate, its akin to a child throwing a tantrum if they don&#x27;t get their way. It&#x27;s extremely unprofessional and not something a team player would do. I think its clear why they took her up on her offer.')
