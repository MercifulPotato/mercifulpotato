It provides a very natural pathway to understanding the inner workings of the computer.<p>Supermon has been around since the PET days. I had no problem exploring my C64, I just had to load it from disk.<p>However, did Apple 2 have anything like an Action Replay cartridge. Not only does it provide normal machine language monitor capabilities, but it does it through an NMI (non-maskable interrupt) that takes over the entire system, freezes it, and allows you to inspect all aspects of the hardware, including <i>write only latches</i>. It includes sprite editor, font inspector, and can even &#x27;core dump&#x27; the entire C64 into a suspended state that you can load and resume.<p>This was used to &quot;crack&quot; copy protection much of the time by just dumping a freezed copy of the game after it had fully loaded.<p>&gt; seven expansion slots of the Apple II<p>The C64 had both a User slot and a cartridge slot, in addition to RSS-488 serial bus which allowed daisy chaining like Firewire. So for example, you could plug 2 joysticks into the joy ports, a Ram Expansion Unit (REU 128k or 512k) into the cartridge port for GEOS or your BBS, and a RS-232 UART into the User port to get 9600 baud modems working.<p>My C64 had a 9600bps modem with UART in the User port, an Action Reply in the cartridge port, two printers, two disk drives. I never needed many &quot;slots&quot;. The Apple II did not have the ability to talk to a printer or external disk drives without an interface card.')
