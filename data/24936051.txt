It looks really unlikely. The documentation is all a decade old. It&#x27;s written in Java, but there&#x27;s no Javadoc. There are a ton of modules written for it, so somebody clearly cares about it, but it looked very outdated in terms of its technology.<p>I ended up going with boardgame.io, which provides far less, but for my simple project I didn&#x27;t want all that much (mostly, solving the hassle of getting game state synchronized among players). Not that I really wanted to write Javascript rather than Java, but the web made a better target platform than Java Swing.')
