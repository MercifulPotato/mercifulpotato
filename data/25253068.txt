I had fears of having heart problems, or in my head, and at some point in my life I went to doctors and they all sent me away, they couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong. The more incompetent ones might have more suspicious, because they were playing it safe. Better to order more tests and not find anything, than be confident and make a fatal mistake.<p>One of them even went as far as telling me &quot;Man, there&#x27;s so many people sick ou there and you&#x27;re here wasting your time and money while you&#x27;re damn healthy. Go enjoy life :)&quot;<p>Maybe doctors think differently in the US or you were just unlucky?')
