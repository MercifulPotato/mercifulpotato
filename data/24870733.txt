If the race tightens by a few points and the polls are off by a few points, then a very tight race in Pennsylvania is plausible and due to his Electoral College advantage Trump would have a plausible path to victory that doesn&#x27;t require anything shocking. It just requires several unsurprising things aligning in his favor. The odds are against that, but it&#x27;s a real possibility that doesn&#x27;t involve saying that &quot;polls are meaningless!! Fake news!&quot;.')
