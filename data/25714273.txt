Item(by='stiray', descendants=None, kids=[25714407], score=None, time=1610283551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713937, text='&gt; In some countries, you&#x27;re almost applauded if you manage to screw over your boss &#x2F; company, by simply getting paid without doing much at all. For many, it&#x27;s the dream situation - to just clock in at work, do nothing, get paid, and go home.<p>I think that this is direct result of exploitation of workers - devaluated work and very low wages regarding to the amount of work you are expected to do. People are normally trying to improve their life situation and if there is no perspective, they try to make the improvement by minimizing the work done.<p>If they are miserably paid they will &quot;raise the wage&quot; by doing less for that money and I think that this correlates with all the places where I have observed this behavior.')
