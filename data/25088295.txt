The semicolon is hardwired in many programmers hands anyway. I don&#x27;t think it should be a design goal to get rid of it. Instead, the compiler&#x27;s&#x2F;interpreter&#x27;s job is to help the programmer to avoid bugs, and with a little syntactic redundancy, the parser can already help out with a few syntax errors. I love gcc&#x27;s -Werror=misleading-indentation.')
