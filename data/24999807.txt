What happens in between is up to them.<p>There are plenty of other rules.  Some seem obvious, others less so.<p>(1) It has to be a single car, not a relay.  This means you cannot just hop between prepped&#x2F;fueled cars.  No pony express runs.<p>(2) It has to be &quot;driven&quot;.  No packing the car into an aircraft.  No aircraft&#x2F;car transformers.  No putting your tesla on a rocket.<p>(3) It has to be unescorted, at least not be government officials.  Blocking&#x2F;support cars maybe, but no cops escorting you through traffic.<p>(4) It has to be on public roads.  No paying to have roads shut.  With today&#x27;s crop of billionaires, closing large sections of highway to &quot;film a movie stunt&quot; is an option.<p>Documenting that you have abided by these rules, that you haven&#x27;t used two identical cars and flown the driver, means you basically must produce video footage.  Video footage means you have documented your actions and any number of police agencies could arrest you on the spot.')
