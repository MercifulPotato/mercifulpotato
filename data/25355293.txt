It is free as in beer (LGPL) at least on desktop. You can sell a proprietary commercial application using Qt without paying a dime as long as you dynamically link Qt (which can be included in the installation bundle).<p>(But you shouldn&#x27;t. There is little need to distribute closed source software anymore. If you are shipping a binary with valuable trade secrets, then it won&#x27;t be secret for very long. You can do server-side rendering of all the UI like all the large cap tech companies do then it won&#x27;t matter if the client application at the edge is open source.)')
