DICE spoke about it a GDC talk last year and recommended that the <i>any hit</i> shaders that are used for alpha testing (i.e., transparency) should be avoided if possible since they&#x27;re rather expensive.<p>Their big problems is trees, since leaves modeled as flat squares with their the actual leaf shapes in textures (that are completely transparent around the leaves).<p><i>&quot;Trees are our biggest problem in ray tracing. No matter what we do they&#x27;re by far the slowest thing to trace, and they&#x27;re much worse than on rasterizer, and if you have any ideas of how to ray trace trees efficiently, we&#x27;re very happy to hear them. We&#x27;ve asked a lot of very smart people and no one has come up with a good answer yet. You can choose between geometry and alpha testing and both are kinda crap.&quot;</i> - It Just Works: Ray-Traced Reflections in &#x27;Battlefield V&#x27;, GDC 2019.')
