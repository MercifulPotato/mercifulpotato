No, the law explicitly does not demand a platform be &#x27;open&#x27;, or neutral or censor free. That is completely nuts, because it would imply hackernews and your personal blog would be legally liable publishers as soon as you start to moderate content. Which is obviously silly because any content-specific platform that controls what it serves would be legally liable and effectively unable to operate on the internet.<p>230 grants platforms both freedom from liability and gives them the ability to moderate. They do not need to pick.')
