Hopefully the registrar will never need email confirmation to log in (assuming my DNS setup is there).<p>Still, I&#x27;m worried that could get me kicked out of my registrar illegitimately.\nIs there anything that can be done to mitigate this aside from using something super expensive like MarkMonitor?<p>Earlier my account at namesilo got disabled silently when they decided by themselves that my corporate credit card was somehow fraudulently used by me. I got it resolved eventually, but I fear something similar could eventually lock me out completely.')
