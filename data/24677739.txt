Wouldn&#x27;t give up the licensing scheme for the world. We&#x27;ll soon release a proprietary fork (Rack for DAWs) of our GPLv3 software (Rack) as a new funding source. It&#x27;s the perfect funding scheme and has no major disadvantages. The author makes profit from a fork of the software, which requires&#x2F;causes the GPL version to be actively maintained (since new functionality and bug fixes of the proprietary fork often derive from modifications of the GPL software). And the user has a choice of using the open-source&#x2F;free software, which they can freely run, review, modify, and share, or purchase the proprietary software. By Economics 101 theory, a &quot;trade&quot; is always mutually beneficial if the user&#x27;s intrinsic value of the software is greater than the purchase price.<p>As mentioned by others, we can&#x27;t accept patches to our GPL software without a contributor license agreement (such as a paid contractor position), so make sure you&#x27;re aware of this before choosing the dual-GPL&#x2F;proprietary scheme for your own software. This isn&#x27;t a big concern for us because in my personal experience, a patch that actually saves me time in the long run is very rare (See <i>Quality</i> section of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VCVRack&#x2F;Rack&#x2F;blob&#x2F;v1&#x2F;.github&#x2F;CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VCVRack&#x2F;Rack&#x2F;blob&#x2F;v1&#x2F;.github&#x2F;CONTRIBUTING...</a>. You get what you pay for.) But I&#x27;m perfectly fine with doing everything myself or through hired work.')
