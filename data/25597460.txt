That is also hounding people out of science.<p>I disagree with this: why is it hounding people out of science?<p>Let&#x27;s say I publish a paper that literally says &quot;Gender&#x2F;race&#x2F;whatever can&#x27;t do science&quot; or &quot;Group X has N points lower IQ than group Y at the mean&quot;.<p>Who does that keep out of the field? And how?  I think it keeps nobody out of anything.<p>Unlike the cancel-culture playbook (call their boss, name and shame, call the cops citing emotional violence, etc.) publishing a paper like that has virtually no effect on any members of the group in question.')
