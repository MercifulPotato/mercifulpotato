The regime in Iran defaults to lies and disinformation when covering up its own miserable failures. Remember when they initially denied that Iran&#x27;s military had downed the Ukrainian plane? Same deal; they lie until they are cornered. I am more inclined to believe Ziya Sadr.<p>For Americans who don&#x27;t understand Iran&#x27;s regime, compare it to Trump&#x27;s cries of election fraud; the claim is intended to point a finger that distracts from the actual problem (him losing the election fair and square). The blame in Iran is always placed as far from the leadership as possible, even for centrally managed utilities like the power grid.')
