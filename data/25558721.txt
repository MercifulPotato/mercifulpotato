My family has a vineyard in the central part of Istria. In our case we do everything ourselves, but I know that professionals use hired hands, both documented and undocumented ones.\nWe stooped using the copper sulfate for the exactly reasons you describe. My dad (who does most of the work) has a somewhat allergic reaction to it so he tries to compensate with other stuff.\nBTW, it seems that you have quite a nice success story there although the begging of it is quite familiar to many of us from Croatia. (low wage, s*ity bosses, shady working conditions)\nI see your point with the greenhouse. You are right, thinking in terms of output per square meter, it doesn&#x27;t makes sense to have anything that is dormant and doesn&#x27;t produce a stable revenue, unless it&#x27;s something very specific for which the market (customer) is prepared to pay a huge amount. Considering the region we are talking about, the thing that pops in my mind and falls in the super-high return category is the truffle. (and they are trying!)')
