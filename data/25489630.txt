Thankfully my fleet of fun to refurb ancient ThinkPads find their reason for being, getting pressed into heavy everyday use. Overnight I&#x27;ve become a sys admin and in the months since migrated everybody to Arch Linux for ease of maintenance. Pretty happy with the setup. Icing on the cake my 9 year old brags to his friends about his kick ass Linux setup and the advantages of a tiling window manager. For the record the kids are running an X220, a T420 whilst I&#x27;m developing on a T440p. But sometimes I borrow one of the kids machines just because the keyboards are sooooo good to type on.')
