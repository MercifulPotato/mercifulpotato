Item(by='nerdponx', descendants=None, kids=[25523232, 25523973, 25522643, 25529578, 25526219], score=None, time=1608758690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521787, text='<i>several steps backwards from even just editing code in Windows notepad.</i><p>Maybe for you. For myself (a professional data scientist) and every other professional data scientist I have worked with, notebooks are useful and better than Windows Notepad, otherwise we would all be using Windows Notepad.<p>This is such a strongly worded post that I have to wonder what exactly you are trying to do with notebooks, that makes it not just suboptimal but <i>atrocious</i>. Because it sounds like you&#x27;re using it for something other than its intended purpose, in which case <i>of course</i> it&#x27;s atrocious, because you&#x27;re using a tool for something other than what it was designed to do.<p>If you think of a notebook like a tool for literate programming, then sure, I can see why you might have issues with them. They don&#x27;t integrate well with text editors, other tooling such as test runners, or even the Python import system. I would strongly recommend <i>against</i> writing a library in Jupyter. I would strongly recommend <i>against</i> writing low-level CUDA code in a Python notebook. I would weakly recommend against writing production ETL pipelines in a notebook (although if your ETL pipeline is just untested spaghetti code, you might as well do it in a notebook).<p>Notebooks are not competing with IDEs, text editors, or any other dev tooling. Notebooks are an alternative to REPLs. If you use a notebook like a super-powered REPL, you are going to get a lot out of it. I can&#x27;t think of a single complaint about a notebook that can&#x27;t also be leveled at an &quot;Editor+REPL&quot; type of workflow, and I can think of many problems with the Editor+REPL setup that are solved by notebooks.<p>If you prefer using Spyder and RStudio with the console and plot window, that&#x27;s great. I honestly do too. There is a lot to dislike about Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab specifically. But notebooks in general, and Jupyter specifically, are still the most efficient tool I&#x27;ve found for doing something, keeping track of &#x2F; taking notes on what I did, and displaying the results in a way that I and my colleagues can easily understand what I did.<p>There are also other notebook formats such as RMarkdown and Pluto, both of which have much nicer plain-text representations than Jupyter Notebook. I&#x27;m a big fan of those, too. But there are tradeoffs in every design and I&#x27;m not about to malign the Jupyter project (or its ancestor IPython) for its choice to use JSON.')
