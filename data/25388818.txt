Drivers are part of the problem and firmware is the other. Other folks in this thread have gone on to explain it better than I can, so I&#x27;ll just point you to them.<p>That said, I think things like the new firmware update manager that connects device creators to the Linux ecosystem so they can provide smooth and regular updates to users are pivotal to solving these kinds of problems.<p>I&#x27;ve had less problems on PopOS due to this. Firmware updates have at times completely eradicated the more usual problems I experienced with Linux, which in an uneducated guess, probably boiled down to interoperability.')
