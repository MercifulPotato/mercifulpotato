Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25793936], score=None, time=1610728560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787254, text='&gt; Further, the common denominator you&#x27;re seeing goes back much, much further than BSD itself.<p>Interesting, I didn’t know that! There’s definitely an essay to be written here about the evolution of this “Unix system-call convention” over the decades, going into how this table of calls survived each transition and port mostly-unscathed. (Given that we’re throwing actual source syscall tables back and forth as proofs, there’s definitely some narrativizing to be done here, <i>The Old New Thing</i>-style.)<p>I assume the syscalls weren’t retained in ports with the goal of “binary compatibility”, given that these descendant Unix ports were on different architectures that couldn’t literally exec(2) binaries from their ancestor. Guesses:<p>• Toolchain compatibility?<p>• Some shared cross-compiling assembler&#x2F;linker that nevertheless had hard-coded syscalls?<p>• (The perhaps never-achieved-in-practice goal of) emulation-assisted descendant cross-compatibility, ala z&#x2F;OS?<p>• The existence of hybrid&#x2F;transitional minicomputer generations, that had application processors for both the old and new architectures (or application processors that could execute <i>on both ISAs</i>!), such that at least some of the systems being ported to <i>could</i> exec(2) the ancestor’s binaries straight from tape?<p>• Or just the expectation that, despite Unix and C being so intertwined, there were still enough people writing ASM for these machines — using a non-macro assembler — who had developed reflex-memory for the existing syscall numbers, that it would be a bad idea to change the table out from under them?<p>&gt; the userland simply linked into kernel symbols and called &quot;read&quot;, &quot;readdir&quot; etc directly<p>So basically, the original Unix was a DOS, rather than a kernel&#x2F;supervisor. Was that just because the PDP7 didn’t have virtual memory management, or was it a conscious design decision that was later reversed?')
