There&#x27;s no proving it will work or not in short terms, but nobody can deny that persistent propaganda has a long-term effect on the whole population. You have think about a kid&#x2F;youth who listens to some propaganda for years when growing up.  If say you show an ad for a new Apple product. A small part of it is to inform consumers about it, the longer larger part is to enforce the Apple brand which has been happening over many years. You can&#x27;t say well it is not quite working so let&#x27;s stop doing Ads.')
