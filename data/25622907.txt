Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609692822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622767, text='&gt; That&#x27;s my definition of &quot;true explicitness&quot;, where all code which executes at some point is available locally.<p>But no control flow construct satisfies that. Jumps are the whole point, and the unit for structured control flow is the block (what&#x27;s the next instruction after `break`, `continue` or `}`?). defer is just as structured, just as local, and just as explicit as C&#x27;s control flow constructs.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also familiar syntax to the entire generations of programmers.<p>True, but learning Zig takes a day; two tops. Where it differs in syntax from C, it does so for good reason, and it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a complex language where different syntax is an additional burden. C&#x27;s `for` syntax just doesn&#x27;t make sense (`;`, which everywhere else in the language denotes sequential composition, means something different in the `for` header). Is an additional 2 minutes of learning, in a language that has very little syntax, not worth fixing something that&#x27;s unpleasant in C?')
