Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607562766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368079, text='&gt;Do you believe that the government should be able to force people to host content against their will?<p>I am in favor of regulating the very big players like utility companies are regulated: you don&#x27;t get to refuse customers electricity or clean water just because you do not like them.<p>In general, you want liability safe harbor (DMCA, section 230)? Then you have to abide by the same freedom of speech contract the government has to abide by. You want to moderate the content on your platform? Go for it, but then you&#x27;re on the hook for moderating all of it in a timely fashion.<p>PS: Companies are not people (SCOTUS may disagree). I&#x27;d very much differentiate between a for-profit operation and personal stuff when it comes to certain types of legislation.')
