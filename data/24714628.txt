The conformal invariance of Maxwell’s equations allow us the possibility of such signals surviving the crossover from one aeon to the next-provided that the wavelength is long enough\nto avoid excessive scattering by charged particles in the early stages of the subsequent aeon.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Alternatively, there is the idea of information panspermia, introduced in [12],\nand attributed as ”Solution 23 to Fermi paradox” in [2], i.e. the propagation of the ”life codes” by the use of such\nsignals, like the bit strings of human genome and of other species of terrestrial life&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1512.00554.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1512.00554.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Information_panspermia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Information_panspermia</a>')
