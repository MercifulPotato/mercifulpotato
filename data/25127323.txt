In no way is it about the government&#x27;s &quot;banning&quot; the existence of such a platform.<p>It&#x27;s about whether or not the government should blanket protect companies from normal legal liability when they make publishing&#x2F;editorial decisions over their users&#x27; content.  That&#x27;s what Section 230 does.<p>If Section 230 is removed or amended to the liking of Republicans, it won&#x27;t be the government that punishes Twitter for their editorial&#x2F;censoring decisions - it will be everyday people who can make a libel case based upon harm that Twitter caused them.
