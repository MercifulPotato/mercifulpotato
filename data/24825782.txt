Item(by='throwanem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603111345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824999, text='To your second and third points, if you have a drill&#x2F;driver with a torque setting, use that and turn the torque right down before running screws into MDF.<p>(The torque setting is the numbered collar behind the chuck on your driver, if it has one. It won&#x27;t be calibrated to anything, but lower numbers mean less torque applied to the fastener before the driver stops turning it.)<p>A low torque setting vastly reduces the hazard of splitting the MDF, or chewing up the bolt&#x27;s drive socket, if you&#x27;re a little careless on the trigger. Then you can hand-finish with a regular driver.<p>I&#x27;d hesitate to use a thread locker on Ikea bolts. They&#x27;re cheaply made and very mild, so it&#x27;s hard enough to get them out without stripping the drive as it is; there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to break Loctite and not end up needing to grab a bolt head with vise grips. (And that&#x27;s <i>if</i> you break the Loctite before the drive strips. I wouldn&#x27;t count on that.) At most, I&#x27;d say wait until you know there&#x27;s a problem with a fastener backing out before you start thinking about gooping it up with something, and even then probably start with something less aggressive than even blue Loctite - a tiny dab of superglue, maybe.')
