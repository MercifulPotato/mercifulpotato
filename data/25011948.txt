Item(by='NoodleIncident', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604703624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010776, text='It&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s so buried, but I actually like the proposed idea of separating the noun and adjective forms of roguelike. &quot;Run-based&quot; is never going to catch on, and there&#x27;s some adoption already; just roll with this.<p>&gt; It seems that most roguelike fans accept using “roguelike“ as an adjective, for example “roguelike platformer” or “roguelike first-person shooter”. While slightly confusing, this makes sense: a game is a combination of two genres, it has all the properties of the genre appearing as a noun, and the compatible properties of the genre appearing as an adjective. We can also have “first-person shooter roguelike” (DRL) or “platformer roguelike” (a grid-based turn-based game where the structure of the level is similar to that of a platformer, e.g. Fuel or Bump). Although some people do this incorrectly (e.g. “deckbuilding roguelike” is wrong, “roguelike deckbuilder” is better).')
