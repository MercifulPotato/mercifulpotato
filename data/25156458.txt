Apple could hire engineers to maintain this stuff, if they wanted to spend the money. It would not somehow make the rest of macOS worse—no one is required to use old APIs.</i><p>It&#x27;s not about not forcing developers to use old APIs; there are lots of developers who wouldn&#x27;t upgrade their existing apps because they still ran.<p>It&#x27;s just human nature to not want to update your apps if they&#x27;re working fine under Rosetta or using Carbon and 32-bit APIs.<p>Among the many other issues this would cause, people would expect 32-bit Carbon apps to run on an M1 Mac; trying to do so would make Rosetta much more complicated.<p>The other thing is by pushing the leading edge, it gives upstarts a way to enter the market against incumbents. It&#x27;s doubtful Affinity, which makes fabulous design apps [1] would been able to gain a foothold at all if old versions of Photoshop, Illustrator and PageMaker&#x2F;InDesign just ran forever because Apple kept backwards compatibility with old APIs and frameworks.<p>And unlike Adobe, Affinity takes full advantage of Apple&#x27;s latest APIs and frameworks in a way Adobe never has, to make them competitive.<p>It also discourages developers from using newer, better APIs to move things forward. Apple developed some amazing technologies in the 80&#x27;s&#x2F;90&#x27;s they discontinued when MacOS X became a thing, like QuickDraw GX, HyperCard, OpenDoc, OpenTransport, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced every Mac transition starting from the classic Mac days (16-bit 68000) to today, with 64-bit Intel and ARM processors. There&#x27;s not anything off the top of my head I&#x27;d want to use today from back then.<p>I also started the first Newton users group in the world at least a year before the Newton MessagePad shipped in 1993. I know people who are <i>still</i> pissed that Steve Jobs canceled the Newton when he became iCEO in 1997.<p>There does come a time when you have to move on.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;affinity.serif.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;affinity.serif.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;</a>')
