As some sibling comments here have noted, there&#x27;s a level of self-assuredness that feels increasingly disconnected from reality, like PG&#x27;s become a synecdoche of SF VC-fuelled startup culture as a whole. Whether that&#x27;s him changing, or me, or the world, I&#x27;m not certain--but I still look forward to them simply because the ensuing discussions here on HN tend to have some gold in them.<p>Edit: typo on “synecdoche” (original was “synecdouche,” which could be read as clever&#x2F;juvenile but was simply unintentional).<p>Also: my original phrasing (which I’ll leave intact above for context) was vague; I specifically meant to express that the more recent essays resonate less with me than the older ones once did. I haven’t reevaluated the older essays; it’s been ages since I went through them.')
