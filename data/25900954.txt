Said differently, the headline should be something like “Janet Yellen Will Consider Ways to Limit the Use of Cryptocurrency <i>for Illegal Transactions</i>”. I.e. stuff for which it’s already illegal to transact in dollars. At this point, she’s not coming for your Bitcoins, though unfortunately I think framing crypto as directly adjacent (or an enabling mechanism) to illicit activity is a step in that direction. But honestly this has been a criticism leveled at Bitcoin for years and nothing has changed.')
