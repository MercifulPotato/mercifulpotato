Many years ago, I went through something loosely similar (actually it happened like 3 times in different ways).  The gist is that I started to suspect there was &#x27;another level&#x27; going on with a group of people, some kind of hidden ritual relating to some kind of secret power, and that it was at least partly nefarious&#x2F;evil.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot since, and I think much of it was being a situation where boundaries and intentions were unclear, and having that crash headlong into the belief systems I&#x27;d been raised with.  My mind was reaching for explanations for my sensory overload &amp; the firehose of novel data coming in-- so the war between &#x27;demons&#x27; and &#x27;angels&#x27; I had been repeatedly taught was real as a kid was what it latched on to.<p>I have learned since then that this is one of many common adverse reactions to tripping in a bad situation.  I strongly, strongly encourage therapy!  Uncertainty in this area can lead to misguided forays into cults, conspiracy theories or even a psychotic break.<p>By the way, I had never heard of darkpsy, so I decided to check it out.  It&#x27;s definitely interesting to me sober (I like weird stuff), but I would absolutely <i>not</i> want to listen to this back in the days when I was tripping.  What was done to you was cruel, whether it was really meant that way or not.')
