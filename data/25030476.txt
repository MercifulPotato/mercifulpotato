We carry some ideas from the 8008 in our x64 processors.  I remember &quot;The Computer Hobbyist&quot; producing a two-column monthly newsletter using a computer-connected typewriter, and a program on their 8008 that justified the text right-and-left for those two columns.<p>My question is: I recall there was a &quot;-1&quot; version that was somewhat faster than the stock version.  Did they accomplish the extra speed by doing silicon tweaks, or did they just sort the lots into speed grades?   And if so, how fast can one push these chips?<p>Last question is about why the Osbourne and other such portable computers took so long to appear; I had a battery-powered B&amp;W TV set (used 9 D batteries) that worked great in those days; and it could have been easily driven by an 8008 battery-powered system, making a truly portable computer.')
