The disgusting content was literally its reason for existing, despite all of the bland &quot;we&#x27;re just a free speech site&quot; stuff.<p>And I have yet to hear anyone discuss how &quot;anything goes&quot; and social media do not mix. It&#x27;s much easier to turn a community toxic than it is to keep it healthy, and healthy communities (of any sort) need moderation. Certain people have turned this fact on its head and want you to believe that &quot;completely free speech&quot; and &quot;healthy communities&quot; are compatible because they want to overrun healthy channels with their garbage.')
