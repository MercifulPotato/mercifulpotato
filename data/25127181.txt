It&#x27;s true that Apple hardware is expensive, but the reality really is that you can buy <i>less expensive and also cheaper products</i> than Apple sells. But if you want to buy something of the same quality as an Apple product, you&#x27;re paying Apple-like prices.<p>There are cheaper Android phones than the cheapest iPhone, but if you want iPhone-like specs and vendor support and build quality, you&#x27;re paying $600-$1000 just like Apple charges. You can buy $200 Windows laptops or Chromebooks but if you want the MacBook-like performance and vendor support and build quality, you&#x27;re paying $1000-$2000. Compare the excellent Galaxy S to an iPhone, or the excellent Dell XPS (or X1 Carbon or Surface etc) to a Macbook and you&#x27;ll find similar excellent performance and similar excellent build quality for a similarly expensive price.<p>The reality is that Apple only competes in the higher end of the markets. There are cheaper options but anything that&#x27;s directly comparable to an Apple product is going to be priced similarly to an Apple product.')
