Almost all unions or stable jobs have people who believe they &quot;control&quot; the jobs.<p>They will attempt to destroy you and your family any way possible.<p>I&#x27;ve personally been the victim of targeted harassment campaigns. I was punched in the face in broad daylight on the way to work. Someone vandalized my home, stole every valuable item I own and threatened my daughters life. My car was damaged and the mechanics wouldn&#x27;t fix it properly because they were afraid of retaliation. My wife&#x27;s car was repeatedly vandalized to get her spending money on a mechanic and then eventually force her to buy another car. Someone even hit me with an electronic weapon while I was sleeping and burned me, I still don&#x27;t know how the fuck someone got hold of an electronic weapon.<p>The entire point of these harassment campaigns is to force you to spend money on luxury garbage, mechanics, car dealers, house cleaning services. etc.<p>If you contact the authorities for help, no one is going to help you out of fear of retaliation. They give you lip service even if you have video evidence (I have actual audio, video and image evidence all of this happened)<p>I had an actual conversation with someone last night who drove past my house asking why the police were at my home:<p>Me: &quot;Someone left a threatening letter on my door.&quot; Person: &quot;If you just purchase enough from us we can call up our friends and get you help otherwise there is always cancer.&quot;')
