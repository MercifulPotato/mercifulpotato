However, it does says that people currently conflate the two because nobody talks about them to the point that reading is a proxy to measure comprehension effort.<p>You are correct in saying that I argue that it is not appropriate to employ reading as a main means for assessment.<p>Code is certainly not literature, but it should still be studied. In fact, assessment specifically talks about the intent. If the intent is different, such as learn a new language, reading is appropriate. Reading is also appropriate when the problem fits on one screen. It starts to be inappropriate as soon as you start to scroll.<p>I also do not say that tools should be limited to code either. Every aspect of a system, including its history, runtime, tickets, customer feedback, is data, and it&#x27;s all relevant. We should be easily able to integrate any of these in our reasoning.<p>I agree with the observation that code can vary greatly. In fact, it is for very reason that out-of-the-box-clicking-tools will always fail to provide meaningful value. They bake the question in the click, but because of context is unpredictable, we simply do not know the question before we have the problem. That is why the specific tool we&#x27;d need should come after the problem, not before it.<p>And yes, a system is a phenomena that should be approached through the scientific method (this is the essence of what moldable development is). Developers are already doing that implicitly. We should just make it explicit. All sorts of possibilities will arise after that.')
