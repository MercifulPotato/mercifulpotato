Programs still have commercial breaks, so all of the commercials are PSAs developed for&#x2F;by the military, hence why you saw that commercial.<p>Human trafficking is a real concern overseas, including in US military areas. The PSAs serve two purposes; to educate troops so they make good decisions and for leverage to hammer them when they don&#x27;t.
