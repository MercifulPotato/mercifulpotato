They can detect that someone is a different intelligence level.  Most people will react the same to someone with much greater intelligence as someone with much less intelligence.<p>Secondly,  intelligent people modulate their communication to be what the people they are talking to expect.  They won&#x27;t use big words at the bar, but will totally change in an academic or professional setting.<p>One way that &quot;smarter&quot; than oneself is revealed is when a person predicts or anticipates something.  That could be experience, or just indicates that they had already processed the situation to the same level.')
