Item(by='supergirl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610233551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25705726, text='social media should also be considered infrastructure. but not only social media. everything we use online.<p>email is another obvious example. there are 1000s of email providers, but migrating is a pain. for example, I can easily switch mobile provider because by law I can keep using the same phone number. that should also apply to email. I write a lot more emails than make phone calls so the law needs an update. same for social media. I should be able to easily move from provider to provider. if twitter bans me, I can move to another one and keep my handle and followers and messages. why should twitter be allowed to ban people at their discretion? they are just a medium at this point. the content that is being generated has nothing to do with twitter. the electrical company doesn&#x27;t care what I use their electricity for. I could be using it to commit a crime and they still wouldn&#x27;t ban me (as long as I pay of course).')
