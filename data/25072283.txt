I didn&#x27;t want to run browsers or any other programs because of the potential for frame drops. Youtube music works alright, but hopefully they continue to improve the terrible interface and ideally have the ability to play the audio track only of songs. I don&#x27;t like the videos running while listening to random remixes&#x2F;mashups that only youtube has since it will cause frame drops.')
