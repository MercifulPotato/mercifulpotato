If they are all so well known, then, well, write down exactly how to do it properly and make a list of all attack classes together with a convincing argument why your guideline prevents them.<p>But that would open up responsibility on the author&#x27;s side, and who wants that? It&#x27;s oh so much easier to just blast out a rant with some bits of information that are enough to illustrate your rant&#x27;s point but far from sufficient to actually be helpful.')
