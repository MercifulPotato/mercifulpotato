I recommend getting 16GB because I recently clocked out the 8GB because of firefox + jupyter notebooks (plotly consumed like 6GB). Overall, it&#x27;s been great but there are still things broken natively. However, the Rosetta(2) makes the experience seemingless. The biggest problem I have is remembering to isolate the x86_64 and arm64. For instance, having miniforge setup for Python becomes a PITA since one version is meant for the M1 natively and the other is the x86_64 build. But since I got my Mac Mini, I barely use my early 2020 MBA anymore.')
