Item(by='klmadfejno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605791589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147341, text='One thing I&#x27;ve noted is that scary monsters designs don&#x27;t really have any effect anymore (did they really ever?). If a spoopy monster&#x27;s head splits in half and two more fleshier ones spawn out with visceral scream... well whatever, I guess it will have a different attack pattern now. What&#x27;s really scary is enemies you don&#x27;t understand, with unexpected or undefined behaviors, weird dynamic animations, or norm breaking behaviors that don&#x27;t feel scripted.<p>Mr. X of the RE2 remake was very good at this (for the first playthrough at least). The original amnesia monsters were pretty good for a bit too. Both grew kind of tiresome after you were familiar with their mechanics.')
