Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608421424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480005, text='&gt;&gt;Maybe you&#x27;re lucky and the way you play doesn&#x27;t expose you to a lot of the things people are complaining about but it seems kind of silly to dismiss complaints of game mechanics as &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;.<p>I think you&#x27;re probably right, I&#x27;m 25 hours in and I haven&#x27;t been in a single fight with police other than one scripted side mission. That&#x27;s kind of what I meant - in GTA I just start going on a rampage randomly because it&#x27;s a fun thing to do, seeing how the city reacts around you. In Cyberpunk I just haven&#x27;t felt the need at all, there&#x27;s too much focus on the story.')
