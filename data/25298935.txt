I Did 160 problems (likely low for many people) before my last job search, and I now make 3x what I used to. I gotta admit it&#x27;s a hell of an ego boost to crush coding questions in interviews; being completely in the flow and cranking out flawless code.<p>It makes me wonder how much money I left on the table the last 10 years, because I went the route of great software engineer -&gt; great interviewer, instead of great interviewer -&gt; great software engineer.<p>Also, I have to say I really came to enjoy doing leetcode, and learned (really re-learned) a lot of interesting things.')
