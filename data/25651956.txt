They have to compete with faster, cheaper, more reliable hardwired connections, and can only benefit from hobbling WiFi.<p>WiFi 6E is necessary and potentially revolutionary for indoor spaces. If you’ve ever lived in a large apartment building, then you have probably seen the huge number of neighbor WiFi routers with varying signal strengths interfering with your WiFi connection. I’ve found WiFi to be completely unusable for gaming for that exact reason, and have to use a MoCA adapter instead.<p>WiFi 6 helps, but most devices on 5Ghz are still not on WiFi 6, and won’t be for a long time. Any non-WiFi 6 device on the same channel will interfere with the more advanced devices.<p>WiFi 6E not only introduces a new 6Ghz band where every device is using WiFi 6, but it also has significantly more channels, allowing for more routers in a limited area without interference.<p>On top of that, it has higher speed and lower latency than even WiFi 6 on 5Ghz. I’ve seen some claims that it might be used for wireless VR headsets, though that remains to be seen.<p>This is a technology apartment dwellers don’t even know they’ve been dreaming of, and it should not be delayed.')
