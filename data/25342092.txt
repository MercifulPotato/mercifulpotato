Nobody here cares about the subtle differences you see between  &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morals.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the question: if you have the opportunity to save hundreds or thousands of lives by breaking a minor law, are you justified in breaking that law? Many of us would say yes. The alternative is absurd, it doesn&#x27;t hold up in the real world. How many widely accepted historical heroes do we have who broke laws to save lives?<p>tfehring&#x27;s point still stands, and I think you should respond to their post using the meaning that they obviously intended before you get mired down in a more pedantic debate over the technical definition of individual words.')
