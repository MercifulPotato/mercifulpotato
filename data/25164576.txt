One of the arguments against nuclear has always been &quot;but it&#x27;s so expensive&quot; and yet the engineering of the plant itself is not particularly expensive relative to similar capacity coal or gas plants[1]. When we were discussing the &quot;Ultra Safe Nuclear&quot; (www.usnc.com) [2] I commented [3] that expense was more soft costs than engineering from my own experience of looking into the cost of nuclear. This paper just does the math and makes it more explicit.<p>[1] Yes, that is multiple plants to create the equivalent amount of capacity.<p>[2] <i>Ultra Safe Nuclear</i> -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24505727" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24505727</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24511751" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24511751</a>')
