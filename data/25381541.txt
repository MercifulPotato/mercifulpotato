It was incredibly difficult and all of the money I raised on Kickstarter went down the drain due to bad suppliers and inexperience. Without the upfront investment of many people, I probably would have been put off; as getting production lines up and running, mold costs, etc. are in the 5 figures. Once you have a bit of a backing though, you can afford to make some investments that may or not pan out. For example the glass I prototype needs molds made just to see if the idea in my head will work, each of which is a few thousand bucks. A lot of times, they don&#x27;t pan out and the mold is trashed. But when it does work out, it makes up for all of the failures. Happy to answer any specific questions if you want to reach out via email (in profile).')
