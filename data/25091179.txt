The application should include:<p>a. A simple page with:<p><pre><code>  i. Some graphical elements to resemble the Company look &amp; feel (see attachment for inspiration)\n\n  ii. An input text box that will take in a numeric value between 1 and 10 characters\n\n  iii. A button\n</code></pre>\nb. A Graphql Back-End (you could call it http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-graphql-server)<p>c. A mocked REST Service (you could call it http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-service) with the following endpoints: &#x2F;person, &#x2F;facility and &#x2F;exposure<p>2. The button:<p>a. Will be disabled for invalid input values and<p>b. when clicked will call the Graphql Back-End, which should perform the following, and return the end\nresult:<p>The server calls the mocked service on http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-service&#x2F;person&#x2F;$input$\n(pass the input value in place of $input$)\nThe service will respond with the following structure: {\n&quot;val1&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n&quot;val2&quot;: &quot;&quot; }<p>The server then calls http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-service&#x2F;facility&#x2F;$val1$ (pass in val1 from call to person as $val1$)<p>The service returns the following structure: {\n&quot;val3&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n&quot;val4&quot;: &quot;&quot; }<p>Then the server calls http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-backend&#x2F;exposure&#x2F;$val2$ (pass in val2 from call to person as $val2$)<p>The service returns the following structure: {\n&quot;val5&quot;: &quot;&quot; }<p>Eventually the Grapqhl call should return val3 and val5<p>3. Upon completion of this chain show an overlay that contains the result of multiplying val3 by val5.<p>4. You donâ€™t need to do the full styling, instead please focus on single elements to show off your skills. Animations are also welcome.<p>5. Please add a README.md to your submission that explains how to use the system<p>Enjoy')
