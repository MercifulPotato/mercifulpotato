It&#x27;s an extremely useful tool for setting up the same machine it&#x27;s running on using the local connection type. I&#x27;ve been involved in projects where we setup a small-ish bash wrapper script that can be curled onto a linux machine or mac that installs Ansible, asks a few user specific up front questions, and then installs the rest of a relatively complex development environment. It took a while to build, but makes setting things up so much easier to deal with.')
