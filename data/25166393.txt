Sometimes it&#x27;s the fault of the OS &#x2F; framework vendor for aggressively deprecating stuff (like Apple does). But most of the time my observation has been that a lot of companies simply won&#x27;t budge and won&#x27;t even hire an intern to try and recompile their app for the new platform. Sad.')
