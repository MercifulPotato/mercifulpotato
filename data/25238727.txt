Educators spend many years studying pedagogy, and what is and is not developmentally appropriate. They get rapidly good at telling which kids need extra help, and who can go read independently on the rug.\n2. healthy childhood of few concerns without the relegation to daycare is the root of greatness\nCorrect. This is the true secret, all children must have a safe place where they can independently learn. Anxiety about family, money, food, is generally terrible for learning.\n3. best formula for helping kids get interested in science by  Neil deGrasse Tyson is: &quot;Get off their back!&quot;.\nLargely Correct. Schools should provide more time for self-study and play. A longer day with less direct teaching and more exploration and play would do wonders for many children. Several countries already do this (Not enough)\n4. passions born in childhood change lives\nCorrect, but not everyone will have this drive. Personality matters. There are dandelion children, and orchid children. Some will succeed no matter where they grow. Some wilt and die without constant care.\n5. relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from youthful passions is a solid formula for success\nPartial, see above. Personality is more important than IQ up to a point. Nobody can teach you personality, they can only repress it.\n6. mass production of great teachers is no easier than mass production of genius\nWrong. Enough &#x27;natural&#x27; teachers exist, but due to the disparagement of the profession in the US, as well as the poor relative pay, most choose something else. If we valued teachers, and paid them well, this would change immediately. PS It has nothing to do with unions.\n7. in development, minor trajectory nudges within the push zone by inspirational tutors are welcome\nCorrect. This requires great teachers, but we can also leverage all the &#x27;greats&#x27; from other fields that are looking to pay it forward. More funding would allow this.\n8. pranks, rebellions, and disobedience at school are an expression of freedom and may foster better learning\nCorrect. More free time, more time for expression. Oddly, this is where American schools are much better than most European. In America, there is more room to be an individual, and most are not crushed with conformity and homework as they are in Europe.\n9. grants for kids to get to college are as good as grants for kids to skip college. All support for the youth is welcome\nCorrect, but remember personality? Most don&#x27;t know what they want to do or be until they are in their 20s. Many creative individuals are late bloomers, they don&#x27;t know what startup to start. They have not found their calling yet. Most are better off in college, doing more exploring.\n10. dropping out of college can turn out to be a good thing\nWrong. Yes, everybody likes these stories. Everybody likes these inspirational tales of drop outs. But you&#x27;re looking at major survivorship bias here. Most dropouts do not make it, at least not right away. Most would have been better off completing their schooling, because most do not have the personality to persist at a startup, or they are missing any of the other 20 or so qualities necessary to succeed. Most need to spend time learning those qualities, and many actually know that they do ... they don&#x27;t have the arrogance&#x2F;confidence to believe they can succeed yet.\nBill Gates is not wrong. All progress is made by inches, in fits and starts, in tweaks and small changes of degree, and by experimentation. Big sweeping changes just create 100 other issues. Any fundamental changes must be backed by solid evidence, and there must be agreement about what a good outcome should look like. Suppose the changes suggested create 100 more Bill Gates, but destroy the lives of 10,000 poorer children? Is that a good outcome? With limited time, money, and personnel, the tradeoffs are always immense.')
