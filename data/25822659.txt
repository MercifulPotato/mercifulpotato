It&#x27;s &quot;we hate him that&#x27;s why&quot;. Looks really unpleasant when you came looking for history as headline promises. Just to put things into perspective I live in a real unimaginary dictatorship, and still most people here can discuss history without artificially pulling current political news into it. That&#x27;s just US media&#x27;s special feature to push obsessions, anxiety, anger, and fear. My guess it&#x27;s calculated to keep attention  through emotion.')
