Out of million people only small percentage would become infected with covid and of that, only small percentage would die.<p>On the other hand, vaccine must be distributed to everybody. Alternatively to people who, by occupation, have to contact many other people, daily.<p>We don&#x27;t know yet if there are complications from the vaccine. It is not possible to judge long term effects of anything based on very short exposure.<p>The value of vaccine is in preventing <i>future</i> infections, but for a given person now it is not yet know if the vaccine is actually a good deal or not. Only time will tell.<p>Looking at this selfishly and from PoV of game theory, the best decision is to let vaccinate everybody else but don&#x27;t take vaccine yourself.
