It&#x27;s much faster. I think this is because it does not have to build up an environment from scratch, but instead caches some elements.\n2. It is more reliable. Those early steps that travisCI takes in building up an environment seem to be error-prone, leading to failures long before it got around to checking my code. Usually, these were bad-signature or failure-to-download problems with basic libraries, and they tended to go away after a few days or a week, but in the meantime, my &quot;badges&quot; made it look as though my code had failed tests, when it was more that the tests were failing of their own accord.<p>And the disadvantages of the switch?  None that I&#x27;ve noticed, so far.  Perhaps the bloom will go off this rose as well, but that&#x27;s life in the software world.')
