Overall what I came away with was that there are a ton of podcasts about subjects I&#x27;m interested in, but not a lot of them look that interesting. Perhaps because it&#x27;s Spotify, all my recommendations were music-adjacent. There were a couple episodes with interviewing musicians I like who don&#x27;t do a ton of press, so I added those to my episode queue, but overall I was mostly amazed at how much content there is that didn&#x27;t seem interesting to me at all.<p>Sort of reminds me of 15 years ago or so when it seemed like everyone had a blog (or two). Tons of content, but a whole lot of it not that interesting. In the end I ended up keeping the RSS reader and focusing on feeds that consistently delivered content I liked and I &quot;graze&quot; from there. Interestingly, this is essentially what I do with Podcasts.')
