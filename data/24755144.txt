Also a tonne of interesting engineering went into it.<p>The G4 tower was (in my mind) the last of the machines that was actually a pleasure to work on the hardware. The motherboard being on the hinged door meant it opened out giving you access to install cards or upgrade the CPU. It&#x27;s actually a pleasure to pop the side just for the sake of having a look. I&#x27;ve got an old G3 tower here that I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw away. Very cute, rounded, colourful outsides but serious engineering on the inside.<p>Everything since seems to have gone out of its way to make it difficult, unpleasant and in cases down right impossible to get into, upgrade or repair.<p>G4 Tower: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macstories.net&#x2F;mac&#x2F;the-power-mac-g4-line&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macstories.net&#x2F;mac&#x2F;the-power-mac-g4-line&#x2F;</a>')
