NextCloud encrypts files at rest and only those given permission can view them.  This does not protect against DO doing a memory dump of your VM, but that should only happen if there is a lawful request to access your droplet.  This is the same risk on any VPS provider.  So I would say that is probably one of the best methods to share family photos.')
