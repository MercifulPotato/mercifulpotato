OpenEMR has a lot of dedicated folks in it and has been a project of some sort of another for ~25 years at this point.<p>You can read quite a bit about open source in healthcare in my book, Hacking Healthcare. A bit dated but still in print.<p>Unfortunately there are massive headwinds against open source in US healthcare settings. Regulation requires certifications that cost upwards of $100K first time, $10K with each release, just in fees. Licensed data sets also make for real difficulties in licensing. Required 3rd parties like SureScripts are openly hostile to open source. Most largest buyers of systems are institutional and most current interpretations of law make it so that open source systems cannot be sold as &quot;sole source&quot; which makes life very hard to close and keep those deals. Finally, until a business model emerges that favors open source and patient health, everyone makes more money with lock-in and so that perpetuates.<p>Ask me anything.<p>Can confirm, a little concerningly, that code I wrote 17 years ago is still widely present in the OpenEMR codebase including my old office number for test patients, lol.')
