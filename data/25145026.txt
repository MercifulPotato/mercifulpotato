Also a dark hack, all car lot have a disclaimer that there is surveillance video and audio equipment on premise. This means you have been notified of surveillance, they can and do bug the cubicle. When they go back to talk it over with their manager many times they are reading you by your conversations going on in the cube and your body language.<p>I worked in counterintel for a while, so I have had a lot of fun with car dealers over the years. I won&#x27;t buy a new car (still drive an 87 Suburban Diesel) but from time to time my wife let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s time for her to get a new car. Anyways knowing that they can and do run surveillance can actually be used to your advantage.<p>Try it one time, when they go back to the manager, say to the person with you, let&#x27;s leave, I am not going to get what I want here and restate what you know the car is worth based on research. Leave enough meat on the bone for a decent commision and profit, but cut it close to a good deal. Get up and watch them be on the other side of the cube before you can even fully stand up. Manager will have miraculously come back 10-15% over the amount you stated. If you are not willing to walk from the deal, you are not getting a deal.')
