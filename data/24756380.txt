I am excited about Fortran in the browser.<p>The interesting thing of note is that Zig is in the process of creating their own backend, but I don&#x27;t see them dropping LLVM any time soon. An alternate backend is a great way to find bugs in codegen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewkelley.me&#x2F;post&#x2F;zig-programming-language-blurs-line-compile-time-run-time.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewkelley.me&#x2F;post&#x2F;zig-programming-language-blurs-...</a>')
