But leave it at the right place so that this review will have an impact.<p>Say you buy a new car at Honda and the salesperson scams you. You would not go on a car review website and review the Civic with &quot;1 star, the salesperson was corrupt&quot;. You would call the dealership and tell them &quot;this salesperson is crap&quot; or you would call Honda headquarter and tell them &quot;this dealership is ruining your name&quot;.<p>Why would this be different on Amazon? When a marketplace gives you a bad experience, you review the marketplace itself or the seller. Not the product, the company who makes the product has no control over the marketplace.')
