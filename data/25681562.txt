Beyond the fact it&#x27;s impossible to start using it right away without instruction, everything else is subjective and context-dependent.<p>&gt; My experience is that the time I spent learning it was well worth the investment.<p>How? I tried. But I still can&#x27;t see how its key shortctus are better than the common ones (i.e. how Esc,Shift+G (yes, I just googled it) is better than Ctrl+End) and how its power in applying bulk edits to many places at once can make me more productive (it would mean I write redundant code if it could). What other things does Vim have which other editors&#x2F;ides don&#x27;t? I also find coding without JetBrains-level smart code completion a waste of time.')
