Item(by='TacticalTable', descendants=None, kids=[24662823], score=None, time=1601647532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24662463, text='&gt; What I&#x27;m saying is for young people the opportunities for gig are relatively the same compared to 1991, except its in the different form.<p>You&#x27;ve explicitly named lotteries and acted as if they&#x27;re the same as actual gig employment. I have several instagram influencer friends, and a few who make youtube videos on the side. It&#x27;s their dream to go pro. You want to know their collective income, from a pool of about 10 people, who have been working at this for over a year? It&#x27;s under $100. That&#x27;s not a gig, that&#x27;s a lottery that costs time and energy.<p>If you want to talk gigs, talk about Wag or Uber. Which, are also definitely not the same gigs that the article was talking about.')
