If these are not helpful, the participant will be invited to sit up, take off the eyeshades and make visual contact with the therapists and the room.  The therapists may offer reassurance that such states are to be expected and are likely to be short lived.<p>&gt; Responding to marked agitation<p>&gt; If the subject displays significant or marked agitation and previously mentioned interventions fail, the therapist will consult with the physician regarding the possible administration of benzodiazepine or antipsychotic medication.  Medical intervention will be utilized only when agitation is persistent, and no other means to help relieve the agitation are effective.')
