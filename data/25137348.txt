Says the guy putting together your iPhone in China as well.<p>This is going to be a huge lesson in Supply and Demand for the workforce.<p>And contemplate that there are zillions of intelligent people learning to speak English and who can code (and do other things) very well.<p>I don&#x27;t think the American &#x2F; Western workforce realizes how fragile their position is in the long run.<p><i>Today</i> it&#x27;s about &#x27;remote work&#x27; but starting the moment the pandemic is over, there are 5 resumes from Poland, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Zambia, and Fiji - all of whom very qualified and will work for 1&#x2F;3 the cost to replace you. <i>And I mean you</i>. (Even CEOs and AI Researchers are replaceable, or at least, investors will believe they are).<p>These forces are unassailable in our current structure and in some ways it may not be good.<p>It may lead to further consolidation among the 0.1% as they gain more power.<p>And while the &#x27;power centres&#x27; may be located in the West, but they&#x27;re really just &#x27;international zones&#x27;, not really American&#x2F;Western in anything but civil and legal structure.<p>We saw the manufacturing jobs go out the door for the last 50 years, and frankly it was a boon for 2 Billion people have come out of &#x27;abject $1&#x2F;day starving poverty&#x27; into &#x27;survivable $20&#x2F;day humble-means poverty&#x27; ... but now the same thing will happen to white collar workers as well.<p>The Fed Chairman, usually very demure and super conservative and orthodox, even talked about how &#x27;we&#x27;re not going back to the way it was&#x27; - it&#x27;s not just remote working, it&#x27;s the insane amount of debt, perennial 0% and negative interest rates, aging workforce (including China), and frankly a surprisingly conflict-free world (it&#x27;s hard to believe that but it&#x27;s true) thriving on trade. It&#x27;s definitely a Brave New World - for those who&#x27;ve grown up and remember the Post WWII order ... it&#x27;s kind of spooky because the rules are being rewritten in a major way.')
