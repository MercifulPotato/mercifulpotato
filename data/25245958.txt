Then when they&#x27;re adults they lack any kind of critical thinking skills because they&#x27;ve been miseducated and they&#x27;re easy targets for disinformation.<p>I&#x27;m gonna guess you don&#x27;t have children. Children like easy-to-follow directions. They don&#x27;t understand nuance at all. It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s &quot;easier on parents and teachers&quot;, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s what works.<p>You add nuance later in middle and high school.')
