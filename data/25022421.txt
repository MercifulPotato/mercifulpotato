PA is one of only a few states that does not allow processing mailed ballots until election day (i.e. they can&#x27;t even open the envelopes). The Democratic governor asked to change the law to allow counting of ballots before election day, precisely so you wouldn&#x27;t get into this situation, and the Republican legislature refused.')
