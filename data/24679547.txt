You have groups of activists such as feminists that claim to be for equality of all (scope creep), but yet they are silent on important subjects such as this. Don&#x27;t be convinced that feminism simply doesn&#x27;t care about men&#x27;s rights, they sometimes actively work against them [1]. To suggest that men may experience oppression weakens their perceived oppression, therefore it&#x27;s in their interest to fight against it.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that men are outnumbered in higher education too. There is always talk of increasing the number of women in STEM fields, but never any talk of increasing the number of men in the arts, English or the -ologys.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am very happy to see equal opportunity. I am glad to see the riddance of &quot;toxic&quot; environments that discourage people from fulfilling their objectives based on arbitrary characteristics. But I also look at the future young men of today with genuine concern.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GO_X4DkwA_Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GO_X4DkwA_Q</a>')
