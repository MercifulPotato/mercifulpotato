It&#x27;s really not an interesting conversation when it leads into platitudes like &quot;everybody did this&quot; and &quot;nobody did that&quot; and &quot;an entire group of people is arrogant and obstructionist&quot; which neither of us have any way of proving or disproving. I wish this open-source-holy-war type of comment was not so common on Reddit and HN, it&#x27;s about as constructive as the endless Emacs and Vim flame wars.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to illustrate the trend that GNOME and XFCE (and KDE, and LXQT, and MATE, and Budgie, and Mint...) all have different goals and ideas for how applications should behave then yes, I would say that much is obvious by now, and it has only gotten more obvious over the last few years. If you have a technical solution to this then I&#x27;d love to hear it, but aside from that I don&#x27;t care to bicker about whose fault it is that your applications broke, because honestly no answer is going to pleasing for you to hear. Unless I&#x27;m mistaken then we aren&#x27;t paying customers, this is all just random no-warranty open source and there&#x27;s no support hotline that&#x27;s going to care about what&#x27;s broken.')
