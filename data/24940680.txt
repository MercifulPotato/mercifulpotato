B&#x2F;c they feel like they have to protect their group ideals against people deemed unworthy to live or even die in dignity. I wouldn&#x27;t call this &quot;racism&quot; - but I firmly believe that the psychological thinking pattern is fundamentally related and entangled.<p>Also interesting unpopular food for thought is that not just Murcans keeping African slaves is very much racist but also the reason for why one African tribe kept slaves from another African tribe and then sold them to American slave traders who shipped them to the new world.')
