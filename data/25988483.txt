If you can prove you have enough money at current prices then you are not forced to sell. GME is not a big company, even at current prices there are several funds that could afford to have a significant short interest from the bottom without getting a call.<p>edit: originially I said they could carry 200% short, but that is not true.  The biggest funds I can find could alone have shorted 30% of a GME at $3 and be okay at $300, but going much above that price or percentage of GME shorted would be a problem.')
