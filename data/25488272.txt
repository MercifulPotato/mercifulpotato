This take seems directly disputed in whatever season showed the sociopaths unable to figure out how Michael&#x27;s branch could possibly be profitable. That plot arc offers a more scathing critique than the author&#x27;s model lets on.<p>In fact, it reminds me a lot like Linus&#x27; critique of svn-- the idea of a design that is so perfectly antithetical to any of its stated goals that someone could blindly design a better alternative by merely asking at every turn, &quot;What would svn <i>not</i> do?&quot;<p>The Office seems to take the company (and any triangle it seems to fit) as similarly perfectly flawed. Consequently, Michael&#x27;s chronic&#x2F;comic incompetency reverses a critical mass of the company&#x27;s strategies for the branch to succeed.')
