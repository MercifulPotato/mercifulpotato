Its worst form is when the tone of the email is personal (first name in title, photo of said person, signed off by said person and bonues points for graphic of hand written signature), but it comes from a no-reply address.<p>I once received one of these after I was mistakedly billed too much for a product. The person involved had a C suite type role at an ISP. After a bit of searching, I found their personal work email address and forwarded my reply directly to that. It got a more or less instant response, roping someone in to help me and I was phoned twice by an obsequious rep afterwards to make sure I was satisfied with the outcome.<p>All I wanted was a normal email address I could reply to and expect a response.')
