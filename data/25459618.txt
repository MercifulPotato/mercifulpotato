The Dr. in this story seems like a made up persona to my untrained eye. Maybe a real person, but not sure about what else. Maybe even a useful idiot (term, not derogatory toward Dr. Pais) who thinks they are patenting things, causing the Drive and others to chase down all these meaningless stories and dead ends to keep everyone busy.')
