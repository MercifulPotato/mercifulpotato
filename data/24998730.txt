VS Code is fine for a lot of things, but not as powerful as intellij.<p>That said, main downside to IntelliJ is IMO speed and input lag in editor windows, mainly in TSX files. I admit it&#x27;s a complex language and the fact that Prettier runs on save probably isn&#x27;t helping either, but still. It has trouble resolving imports, some are done automatically, others you have to select a quick fix options for, and sometimes both work and you end up with the import itself getting munged.')
