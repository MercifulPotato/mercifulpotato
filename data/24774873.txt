And the Apple ecosystem is only one of many, so if one entertains the premise of this post, Apple being &#x27;better&#x27; than Android in this specific way doesn&#x27;t disprove the premise.<p>Also note that simply being able to install new(er) iOSes on older devices is only part of the battle.  I upgraded my iPhone 6 to its point of obsolescence: what was once an absolute joy to use became  so slow that using it for even basic web browsing was a painful chore.  One could argue that the availability of OS upgrades for old devices combined with Apple&#x27;s reluctance to ever back-port security and core functionality fixes makes the treadmill worse and not better.')
