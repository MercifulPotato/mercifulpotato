That was related to total votes and representatives in congress. If anything, Shay&#x27;s Rebellion was the real reason. The majority (farmers) voted with their guns to steal from the minority (bankers).<p>Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to eat for supper. Several Federalist papers are dedicated exclusively to this idea and the problems of previous democracies. Defending minorities (specifically religious minorities) was the primary reason for going with a Constitutional Republic instead.<p>The Senate was a similar concession that smaller or less populous states deserved equal voice to larger states. I&#x27;d note that if slavery were the reason for the formation, then the Senate would have been a <i>bad</i> idea as it stripped power away from the Southern states (as that article points out, Virginia alone had more than 10% of the total House votes).')
