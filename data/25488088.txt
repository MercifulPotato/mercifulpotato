The combined caps of Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, BMW, Honda, General Motors, Ford, and Nissan is only $629B. So unless Tesla is worth $30 billion more than all of those companies combined, either those companies are undervalued, or Tesla is massively overvalued.<p>Keep in mind, Tesla sold 367,500 cars in 2019, while those other companies sold over 34 million cars, or nearly 10,000% more. I realize that stock prices are based on future profits, and working capital is factored into it, but still, I just don&#x27;t see the rationale in an ownership stake in Tesla being <i>that</i> much more valuable.')
