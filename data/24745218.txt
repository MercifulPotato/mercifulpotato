My plan for the future is to do a masters in CS. One day I want to work in the US tech industry. I‘m not sure yet if I will do my masters in the US or in Germany. In Germany higher education is free, but if studying in the US would help with getting a visa (and later GC) it would be worth it for me. Do you think that studying in the US increases my chance of a visa, and how likely is it that I get one with a econ BS and an computer science MS?')
