For example, imagine that the job at the public company would &quot;evaluate&quot; the performance every 12 months by solely counting the number of projects launched. So if you&#x27;re doing great in a 18-month project, your score is 0 (since it&#x27;s not launched yet), and if you&#x27;ve been part of launching 3 small projects, then your score is 3, no matter how irrelevant or poor quality the projects were.')
