Obviously in safe Rust having potentially dangling &quot;pointers and references to things outside of the mmap&#x27;d area&quot; is a big no-no.<p>And note that even intra-area pointers would have to be offset if the base address changes. Unless you go through the trouble of only storing relative offsets to begin with, but the performance overhead might be significant.')
