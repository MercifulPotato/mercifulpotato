Modern science needs money, human capital and democracy.<p>Some Arab countries have money but have to use it to buy western consumer goods rather than invest it in knowledge or their own production capacity -- otherwise a coup might happen.<p>Autocratic Arab rulers are also understandably reluctant to invest in human capital. Knowledge and critical thinking are the basis of any scientific endeavor, but will also undermine their rule.<p>Finally sustained progress in science needs democracy to ensure technology is used in the interest of the many and not against them by the few.<p>To get things right, the Arab street needs &quot;only&quot; to get rid of their inept ruling class and cut the influence of their Western overlords. Islam is not the problem and will adapt to the new political rule, much better than Christianity could ever do.')
