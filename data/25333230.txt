Large container ships can carry 20k containers. If each of those has a spot, and you have to optimize, the search space is suddenly looking like 20,000!, which is just a wildly big number. So assuming you have some sort of technological solution and know where every container should go, b) you need to move all the logistics around so that containers arrive in the correct order to get loaded in the correct spots.<p>You need to do all this just to massively increase the complexity of your billing model to offer slightly different rates of insurance. I&#x27;m sure there are teams looking at ways to make this better (just stipulate in the contract that any super valuable containers arrive early so they&#x27;re loaded lower), but this is a HARD problem to solve completely.')
