The fact that packet-level firewalls work is reassuring.<p>It hadn&#x27;t been clear from previous reports that they all have to do with content-level filtering and VPN&#x27;s. In that context, it seems to make more sense for Apple to exempt its own critical services (like malware detection and security updates). Kind of the same way applications can&#x27;t overwrite system files either.<p>I am curious though: can anyone think of any real-world scenario where it&#x27;s a genuine problem that Apple traffic isn&#x27;t routed through the VPN?<p>When I think of normal uses for VPN&#x27;s -- security for online work and communications, evading censorship, bypassing geo blocks -- these would all seem to be entirely unaffected.<p>Is there <i>anything</i> at all an ISP or attacker could snoop on outside your VPN that could ever be genuinely threatening or privacy-invading? Or is there a worry that we don&#x27;t have a definitive answer to this because nobody&#x27;s catalogued everything Apple sends and looked for privacy vulnerabilities?')
