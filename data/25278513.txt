I receive a lot of PRs to open source repos I maintain, and I sometimes hire developers on a contract basis to take on coding tasks that are easy for me to delegate and spec out.<p>With open source contributions, I try to minimize my expectations of the author valuing my time as a maintainer because they&#x27;re contributing work for free and a lot of them just aren&#x27;t aware of how their choices affect the reviewer. But I do plan to link to this post in PR templates so that people can better understand how to contribute more effectively.')
