Since compound interest is so powerful it will usually outpace the house in value after 20 yrs or so. Plus where I live, renting seems to be cheaper for equivalent houses mortgage. Maybe cause everyone has rushed to invest in real estate and is renting out vacant homes. If hypothetically houses outpace investing in businesses, we will eventually run into a problem where no one can afford a home no? Also part of your payment in your numbers there goes towards interest so it slightly weakens your argument.')
