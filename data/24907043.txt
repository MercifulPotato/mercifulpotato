Everything remotely related to Chinese becomes under attack &quot;because CCP bad&quot;.<p>Imagine a world in which every article that mentions any American company, receives a torrent of comments calling for the banning of that company, because &quot;US government bad&quot;. And then, when one says that the company in question isn&#x27;t a state company, commenters simply say &quot;but they pay US taxes&#x2F;have to follow US national security law&#x2F;are monitored by PRISM, so they&#x27;re effectively a mouthpiece of the US govt&quot;.<p>If the above scenario happens, I can very well imagine many Americans getting pissed off at the unfair treatment, and becoming more nationalist in response. Actually, that is already happening in China: since COVID-19 many Chinese are absolutely dismayed at the international response, which they view as unfair and biased. Nationalism and support for the CCP is at an all-time high in China.<p>To people who hate CCP it sure feels good to criticize and oppose everything remotely CCP-related (even private Chinese companies) at every turn. But my point is: you can&#x27;t solve actual problems with this sort of attitude. Do you want to FEEL good, or DO good? I think more dialog and cooperation with China will do more to improve China, than by attacking CCP and Chinese companies at every turn, because the latter alienates Chinese people (already happening) and paradoxically make them more supportive of the CCP.<p>If China and the west come together, the whole world wins. If they attack each other, everybody loses.')
