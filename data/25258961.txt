You&#x27;re best bet is to hire someone to give you professional advice on how to invest the money and keep working.<p>The last thing you want is to try and retire now, run out of cash and then have to try and get back into an incredibly fast moving industry where ageism is real. You run out of money in your 40&#x27;s and its going to be hell on wheels trying and get back into the industry.<p>Compare that with reducing your stress, staying the course and continuing to add to what you have saved while growing the money you already have. Walking away when you&#x27;re 100% sure you can run the clock out would be a wiser move than trying to do it now when you&#x27;re young and borderline don&#x27;t have enough in the bank to do it.<p>Patience is the better move at this point.')
