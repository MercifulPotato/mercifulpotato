If not, then why are you defending the Trump administration&#x27;s policies to do just that, by complaining about Obama? Of course I don&#x27;t approve of Obama putting kids in cages for 72 hours either, but that CERTAINLY does not justify Trump separating them from their parents AND putting many tens of thousands of them in cages during the Coronavirus pandemic for much longer periods of time, then refusing to cooperate with the efforts to reunite them with their parents. Your argument is pure whataboutism and deflection.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;border-crisis-us-government-held-70-000-migrant-children-2019&#x2F;2572376001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;border-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;election-2020-democratic-national-convention-ap-fact-check-immigration-politics-2663c84832a13cdd7a8233becfc7a5f3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;election-2020-democratic-national...</a>')
