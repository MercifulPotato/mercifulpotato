I don&#x27;t want to be cliche at this point but I&#x27;m sure the Roman Empire thought they&#x27;d survived worse too.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself one of the &quot;scared of AI&quot; people but I do approach it with caution.  Even if &quot;AI&quot; doesn&#x27;t gain some power, there&#x27;s no doubt that using technology some _humans_ have gained _enormous_ power over others that hasn&#x27;t historically been possible, even for the most vicious of tyrants.  History has also demonstrated that some people can be really nasty when controlling others.<p>By no means am I saying FB, Twitter, etc are controlling tyrants.  The idea that people don&#x27;t do well with power seems relevant though.')
