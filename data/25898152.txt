I have friends from local bars but I also have ones from various sports clubs and other activities. Whether it&#x27;s churches, the local chess club or sports a city will provide a lot more of these niches for community.<p>Community doesn&#x27;t just happen, you have to go out and get involved in them, then you have to talk to people instead of sitting on your phone.')
