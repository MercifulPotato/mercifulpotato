As much as the difference between an entire compressed virtual machine (copy of a set of LVM logical volumes that have been copied with dd and compressed) being 4.2GB vs 5.15GB in size.<p>If it might take ten hours to transfer 900MB in some unusual environments, that&#x27;s a big savings.<p>Also there is a degree of asymmetry, in that it&#x27;s not so difficult for the system creating the xzip archive to have a lot of CPU (four CPU cores out of 12 or 16 on a dual socket current generation xeon system, or a threadripper). Since xzip is much more time consuming to create than to extract.<p>Or for any other environment where WAN connectivity is extremely limited in throughput.')
