Or AMD. Or Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;IBM who sold enough x86 to have money on the side.<p>I don&#x27;t buy that it would have been hard. Look at what Apple did with OSX with such a paltry market share and way before the iPhone money train came. First consumer OSX release was 2001.<p>Sure, Apple had a massive advantage by buying NeXT&#x27;s remnants and Jobs&#x27;s familiarity with it and the people behind it, but remember that Apple&#x27;s first choice was BeOS.<p>So anyone looking to push things could have got BeOS, or an army of Sun people as Sun killed off Solaris. The talent was out there.<p>Instead here we sit with Windows in a perpetual state of the two-desktop tiled&#x2F;old frankenstein, Linux DE balkanization and perpetual reinvention&#x2F;rewrite from scratch, and OSX locked on Apple.')
