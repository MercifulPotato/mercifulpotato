The comment I originally replied to was specifically talking about the environment in small companies, which is the environment I&#x27;m most familiar with, and my comments should be read in that context.<p>In my own businesses or the clients we work with, we too could add RDS quickly for something we were hosting on AWS. On the other hand, we could also spin up a pair of Postgres instances and configure streaming replication quickly if we were running on-prem or colo. Each approach has its pros and cons, and we&#x27;d look at each situation on its merits and choose accordingly. But IME, it&#x27;s more like choosing from a restaurant menu depending on what looks most appealing at the time. The way some people talk about cloud, it&#x27;s like they see it as choosing between a gourmet restaurant with a Michelin-starred team and the local burger van.')
