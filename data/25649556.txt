Competence doesn&#x27;t have an intrinsic ethical dimension.  It&#x27;s not unethical to sincerely try and fail, while the author does ascribe a pretty clear ethical dimension to moral incompetence.<p>I think humility is the better idea here.  The examples of moral incompetence all center around egoism.  Moral competence seems to follow from removing oneself and focusing on outcomes over personal validation.  It&#x27;s a call for helpers to serve and be humble.<p>I&#x27;ve had this thought before many times.  Having gone down this path a bit, I would caution the author: deciding &quot;I&#x27;m going to solve a big problem&quot; is at once incredibly important (to get to the solution) and deeply arrogant (what, _you&#x27;re_ gonna solve poverty?).  Don&#x27;t let the necessity for arrogance get in the way of your willingness to do good.')
