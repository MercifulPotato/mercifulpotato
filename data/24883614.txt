They target different audience,\nGoogle has many notebooks solutions: colab (free) colab enterprise (monthly) kaggle, ai platform notebooks and datalab. Colab is targeted to students&#x2F;researchers which are just experimenting, as there is no guarantee that kernel will run more than 24hrs. The paid version removes this restriction. AI notebooks is targeted for enterprise data scientists (Jupyterlab) which require patches&#x2F;VPC-SC&#x2F;IAM integration, security, etc. Datalab is the very  first version of the notebooks and that&#x27;s going away. Kaggle is mainly for competitions. In the end Google will have only 2 Notebooks colab and AIP notebooks')
