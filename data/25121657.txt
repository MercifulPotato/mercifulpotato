I am coding for a living, and I use git every day. I probably could sit down for a couple of days and fully understand how git works, but I&#x27;ve never needed it, I understand how basic git operations work, and I stay away from commands that I don&#x27;t understand. With GitHub desktop you don&#x27;t need to open the command line for any standard operations, I only need to use the terminal for cherry picking.<p>The reason I want to stick to the basics is because of one interesting thing I&#x27;ve noticed: a lot of engineers sincerely believe that they are git experts when they are nowhere close. And until I locked down the GitHub repo with admin privileges, that was a dangerous thing. So I&#x27;m trying to work a system where no one in a team where not everyone is truly expert at git only uses the basic commandset from git.<p>One thing I can say again to emphasize - git maybe the simplest Vcs you&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not a simple tool, and its most definitely not intuitive for everyone. If it is for you, that&#x27;s great, but maybe there&#x27;s a lesson here about how not everyone&#x27;s brains are wired the same.')
