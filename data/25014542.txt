Took zopiclone for a bout of insomnia but after two weeks I was dependent, either I wasn&#x27;t sleeping without it or the quality of sleep was terrible if I tried going natural. Got prescribed Quetiapine at 25mg, which at that dose is not for psychosis but sleep (or an adjunct for people with bipolar, which is not my case either)\nOnly needed 3-4 days of it and I could reset myself, back to normal sleep. Was already scared that I&#x27;d become dependent on this, but atypical neuroleptics in low doses are less associated with tardive dyskinesia. Do seriously consider it.\nOtherwise you could try an antidepressant with sedative qualities, like trazodone or mirtazapine, both very effective too. Best of luck to all, insomnia sucks.')
