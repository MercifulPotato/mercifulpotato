Reasons for me not making ADHD tools or for my general symptoms so far in life:<p>1)I get tonnes of ideas to work on, far more than I could ever create. 99% of them aren&#x27;t obviously anything to do with symptoms or ADHD at all. The projects that could help with ADHD have to compete for my time with ideas that solve some other thing I think of solving.\n1b) there have been some problems that with hindsight where magnified because of poor working memory or other symptoms, but since I hadn&#x27;t realised that&#x27;s why they bothered me so much, I&#x27;d talk about them to other people and the ideas would be shot down or tweaked for mass-market usage. Since I want to solve problems, and get paid for it at some point, if I&#x27;m told &quot;yeah that&#x27;s just you, nobody else has that problem&quot; it&#x27;s easy to think &quot;okay then, I&#x27;ll move on to my next favourite idea even though I really want this one to exist&quot;.\n2) it&#x27;s hard to get non-adhd people to get excited by products that solve ADHD issues (needed if you want to do any kind of funding, even family and friends round). For starters ADHD is really badly misunderstood by the general population. Many symptoms look like we&#x27;re not trying hard enough in some area of self care or organisation plus the acronym is straight up a terrible representation of the condition - it highlights only the most noticeable traits it shows as in young patients - not the areas that negatively effect people in working life. Also lots of big pain points for ADHD sufferers are felt to a much lesser extent by non-adhd, and so there are tools that are able to solve it for non-adhd but don&#x27;t quite work for us. A quick look or even a bit of usage can make a tool look like it solves the problem when it really doesn&#x27;t for us<p>Probably more reasons but this is getting long and I need to end this comment at some point')
