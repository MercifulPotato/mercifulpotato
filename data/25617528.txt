But this has been fixed for months now - originally not only it was not possible to run virtualbox (or vmware, ESXi is vmware type-1 btw, dont mistake it with free vbox) but also it was not possible to run docker either.<p>Edit: btw. this is why it took so long for WSL2 to be released to public; they gave time to most of the VM solutions to adapt to the fact windows would be running under type-1 hypervisor.')
