I was diagnosed with severe SA (40+ events per minute).<p>Sp02 is useful, but mainly to ensure you&#x27;re not dipping in o2 from leaks, bad fit, incorrect pressure, etc. It is not a diagnostic tool.<p>A sleep study can pick up things like restless leg syndrome, central vs obstructive sleep apneas, RERA&#x27;s, etc.<p>Regarding the &quot;brain fog&quot; - I know exactly what you&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;ve improved mine significantly via:<p>- Getting extensive blood tests to find any deficiencies. Turns out, I was deficient in vitamin D (really bad) and testosterone (which is produced during high quality REM stage, I believe).\n- Taking a boat load of supplements. L-Tyrosine, NAC, too many to list.<p>Sometimes PAP therapy doesn&#x27;t fix endocrine issues like testosterone. Going on TRT has been a game changer for both mental and physical improvement.')
