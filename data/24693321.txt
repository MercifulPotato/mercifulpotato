The risks are well-known to themselves, who are you to suggest that they cannot manage those risks?<p>Some people manage it their entire lives, while others do not. However, I&#x27;d trust someone driving who is well aware of their boundaries over someone who is not aware, any day.<p>My wife fell asleep at the wheel once, I just reached over and kept the wheel straight while trying to wake her up. I hope cars can do that in the future, for those times that I&#x27;m not there. And for the record, she&#x27;s one of those that has never fallen asleep before or gotten drowsy at the wheel.<p>&gt; Having climbed from societal rock-bottom to a decent position in the tech industry<p>I&#x27;ve done this as well. I&#x27;ve gone to war, I&#x27;ve seen things you likely can&#x27;t imagine without a bunch of CGI and special effects.
