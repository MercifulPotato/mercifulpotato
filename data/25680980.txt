Otherwise, you would see more solar there. Developing countries have much lower standards when it comes to building a new power plant, so don&#x27;t need to pay for sulfur scrubbers. The other factor is that unskilled labor much cheaper there. Solar and wind require much higher-skill labor as there is much more maintenance that needs to be done.')
