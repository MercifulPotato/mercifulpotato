Let&#x27;s assume they didn&#x27;t. The point of the post is that philosophers work on <i>how to talk about</i> facts.<p>&gt; When people say spare me the philosophy, they mean they want to get down to business in a practical way, which they know is possible.<p>Yes. This is the problem: oftentimes, they are dismissing the second-order effects or non-practical concerns, and the idea of the post is that it takes philosophers to stand up for those other aspects of what&#x27;s going on.<p>It&#x27;s the knee-jerk dismissal (which you&#x27;re engaging in, it seems like) that philosophers push back against.')
