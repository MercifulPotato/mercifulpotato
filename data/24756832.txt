Just don&#x27;t do it.<p>People sometimes (ignorantly and irresponsibly) recommend (or have recommended -- NFS is squarely in the legacy corner of technology) soft mounts in an attempt to deal with unreliable servers, i.e. prevent clients from &#x27;hanging&#x27; if the server doesn&#x27;t respond.  The real solution is of course to fix the darn server &#x2F; the network.')
