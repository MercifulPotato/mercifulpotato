A good chunk of TV watching is just watching to pass the time. Whatever&#x27;s trending on Netflix is good enough, coupled with a few shows you and your family are rotating through. Some exceptional shows do drive subscriptions for a particular service. But I think Game of Thrones and The Mandalorian are the exception. More common is watching Friends reruns or the new comedy that pops up on the front page of your streaming service.')
