Great filter! (unless it&#x27;s in our past)<p>- Many errors: Not as interesting.<p>As for why it&#x27;s compelling at all, the original point of the Drake equation was to make you think about it, and also realize that it&#x27;s very, very tough to get exactly one. Almost every set of numbers you pick results in either less than one (which we know isn&#x27;t true because we exist), or more than one. So the argument is, who knows how alone we are, but we&#x27;re not alone.')
