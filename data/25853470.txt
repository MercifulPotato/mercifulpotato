It&#x27;s close to the idea of &quot;eustress.&quot;<p>The human body can avoid all exercise and stress, but it becomes sickly and fragile. Ideally, humans regularly <i>seek out more and more stress</i> to grow stronger.<p>It seems we&#x27;re in a loop of responding to stressful speech by squelching it and avoiding it -- admittedly, through free choice, and not government action.   But, like people trying to get healthy by avoiding exercise, we&#x27;re getting sick in our silos.<p>(The silos, to be fair, aren&#x27;t stress-free.  There is a lot of anger and sadness in them. But shutting out all the unwelcome voices seems to be making people more fragile in the real world, not less.)')
