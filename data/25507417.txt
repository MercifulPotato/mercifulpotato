The idea that American households would spend an extra $230&#x2F;year on average on movie rentals, if only those nasty content pirates would get out of their way, is just absurd. Especially when you consider that most American households were never using these illegal streaming sites in the first place. Most of that average would have to be propped up by teenagers and college students who simply don&#x27;t have an extra $2000&#x2F;yr of disposable income to spare.')
