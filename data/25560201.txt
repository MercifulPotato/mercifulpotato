The suburb I grew up in was and still is plenty walkable (though it is admittedly even more bikeable&#x2F;driveable) and has plenty of places for kids to have adventures. Of course, I&#x27;ve definitely been to many suburbs that are completely unwalkable by design, but not every suburb is like that.<p>(My sense is that more recently-built suburbs tend to be more heavily designed around a presumption of car ownership, but that&#x27;s just based on my own experience.)')
