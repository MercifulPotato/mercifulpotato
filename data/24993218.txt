It&#x27;s a core part of how we decide behaviour.  We recognise our family, friends, and foe, and act accordingly.<p>But writing?  It doesn&#x27;t exist in nature.<p>What does exist in nature is something similar, of the size, detail and information content of letters and words.  These are animals such as birds on trees, in the sky, or on the ground in the distance.  They are only a few pixels high, like letters, and their body language tells us a lot.  Imagine a couple of crows on a branch 50 feet away.  Or a flock of seagulls on the horizon at dusk.  What do they tell you?  It depends on what they are doing.  Are their wings flapping Y shapes, K shapes, or is it a smooth, gliding Y shape?  You can tell in an instant what&#x27;s going on.  That&#x27;s because your brain has this module to analyse their behaviour in real time.')
