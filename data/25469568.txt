We&#x27;re the Duckbill group - a consultancy that focuses on lowering huge AWS bills.<p>We&#x27;ve historically been skeptical of SaaSs that try to do what we do - they&#x27;re often complex, expensive, and not that useful.<p>That said, since we analyze our clients AWS bills for a living, we&#x27;ve built up some pretty powerful internal tools. They&#x27;re not &quot;a saas to fix your aws bill&quot; - they&#x27;re small, focused power tools built by experts to tell you a specific set of things about your AWS spend. And so we&#x27;re starting to open some of these up as Ducktools. If a certain theme song pops into your head, now you know how I&#x27;ve felt the whole time I&#x27;ve been working on it!<p>DuckTools is:<p>- Individual apps focused on solving specific spend problems, like &quot;converting expiring RIs to SPs&quot;<p>- Billed as a fixed monthly fee - no hard-to-predict &quot;X% of your bill&quot; pricing<p>- Priced per app - only pay to solve the problems you actually have<p>- Simpler and easier to use than other cost management services.<p>Anyway, we&#x27;re pretty beta right now, and would love to talk to people with aws cost problems to help inform the direction we take this product. If you&#x27;re at all interested, fill out the form on the site - I&#x27;d love to hop on a call with you!<p>I&#x27;m also happy to answer questions here as well.  :)')
