In other words, learn to learn. For example,<p>I heavily rely on mnemonics and I have a field for them, thus for the German word &quot;vertrauen&quot;, which stands for &quot;to trust&quot;, I have the following mnemonic: ”I trust Ver to heal my wounds”. Ver is a friend doctor of mine.<p>For Japanese it helps me to have also mnemonics for kanji sounds(ka - cat, ho - hole), then make stories based on them.')
