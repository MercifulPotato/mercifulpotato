While i doubt that it would have made a considerable dent, the election was far from &quot;free, fair and legal&quot;. The protestors intent obviously was not to slaughter politicians. That would have happened as a start. Showing the people that control you that you are displeased with their actions will do considerably more than &quot;voting harder&quot;. Especially if their ballot just gets burnt.')
