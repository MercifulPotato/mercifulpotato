Standard C++&#x2F;JAVA (as far as I know) talks to hardware through a software layer (the OS&#x27;s system calls). This takes time. Time you can save by cutting out the middle man.<p>There are apparently ways to do this <i>with</i> an OS running in parallel as well though when you have multiple cores available apparently (see another comment to this thread).')
