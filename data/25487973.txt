Bravo.<p>But since we’re on the subject; maybe put less value into financial trade which is the contemporary value store propping up the exploitation of billionaires.<p>Perhaps buy fewer gadgets that prop up the economy they grift on from the masses agency.<p>Perhaps be more for raising taxes to distribute wealth to communities that can use it if you’re that worried.<p>Above all perhaps avoid centralizing authority over agency in private power. A pattern we keep buying into as a species only to realize it rather makes things worse for the majority.<p>Put your agency into something that tackles artificial social problems (stock values, disposable widgets sold!, not enough money for M4A or community uplift in poor areas) instead of (sad as it may be) human issues that have existed forever, and there’s precious little we can do about it. Even if billionaire sex cabals vanish, are you going to scour the world seeking out every tribal instance? Or are you simply reaching for acceptable semantics from your perspective?<p>In other words: walk the walk when it comes to pushing back against immoral behavior as you see it. Semantic battles here over specific instances are self congratulatory and empty if we’ll simply equivocate away structural changes.')
