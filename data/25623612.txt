(Because even with the lowest level access on the device, modern microphones are not so unsophisticated, there&#x27;s no universal way to access it in a way a manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t catch onto sooner or later<p>Or Google did this but only on phones they own or something?<p>It&#x27;s nonsense.')
