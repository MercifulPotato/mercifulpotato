Even if Garda decided to cover the losses out of their revenues, I&#x27;m not sure its that easy to get, say, a million dollars in quarters, even if you have a million dollars in funds.  (and certainly it&#x27;d be hard to do if your trying to hide the fact that your doing it from the Feds).<p>Presumably the reason the banks keep these vaults is because they need the actual currency to be available when needed.  There are much easier and cheaper ways for them to store money.')
