It wasn&#x27;t cheap according to the current consumer expectations for a MF, but after having bought printers in the 90s I consider it a bargain. I&#x27;m in love with this thing, it does everything you&#x27;d expect from a business printer right, flawless networking, wifi without a hitch, any printer language support, lots of memory, duplex scan to tiny PDFs you can send anywhere including a flash drive, you name it.<p>There&#x27;s amazing quality stuff out there, it&#x27;s just not consumer grade.')
