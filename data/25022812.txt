You&#x27;re probably only a few degrees away and know someone that knows someone already, if you don&#x27;t then I bet you&#x27;ve got an idea on the sorts of people to ask. Once you&#x27;ve got contacts there&#x27;s a massively redundant and decentralized supply chain that can deliver to your door quicker than amazon. This is especially true for more common (which varies by location) drugs.')
