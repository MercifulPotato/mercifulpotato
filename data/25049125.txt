Item(by='tinyhouse', descendants=None, kids=[25049325], score=None, time=1605032227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046121, text='&gt; Even the founder probably got less than a mid&#x2F;senior level FAANG employee would get (and the FAANG employee had no risk)<p>Not really... he&#x27;s been working on the startup for 7 years. Let&#x27;s assume he had an average salary of 150K during those years. Plus he got $3.7M on the acquisition (it&#x27;s not clear from his post if that&#x27;s what he takes home or if it&#x27;s pre-tax). That&#x27;s 4.75M.<p>Now let&#x27;s assume a senior engineer in FAANG with a an average salary of $350K for 7 years. That&#x27;s 2.45M. That&#x27;s a very rough comparison and not taking into account taxes (the FAANG engineer is likely to pay more money in taxes overall).<p>But the bigger difference is how he spent those 7 years. He spent it building and managing his own company with all the freedom in the world. Compare that to a senior engineer in FAANG...<p>Update: someone in the comments mentioned he&#x27;ll likely not need to pay any federal tax on the acquisition money. That makes a huge difference and the take home gap is much larger than my initial estimate.')
