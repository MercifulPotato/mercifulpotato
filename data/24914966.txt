I do not see what moral claim we have, at all.<p>Markets don&#x27;t always work, but here&#x27;s a place where they&#x27;ve worked exceptionally well. We are in a wonderland of available content. It has never been easier to find something great to watch or listen to. If Disney wants to charge me $100 to watch Steamboat Willie, what do I care? I&#x27;ll just watch something better, and probably not pay anything for it.')
