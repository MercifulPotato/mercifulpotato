It is not inherently the case.<p>The new Mars rover was about as expensive as the complete development of Orbital human flight at SpaceX. And for that SpaceX was also able to finish the most advanced reusable rocket and make it human rated.<p>Actually getting humans onto Mars together with robots to work locally will actually produce a much bigger bang for the buck. Having local labs, local control of robots, human scientists directly on sight. It would also advanced the technology for transportation, agriculture, medicine and so on.<p>Specially with SpaceX already development the technology need to build a base on Mars, not taking advantage of it and only sending rovers out there, is in my opinion a bad policy. Its both bad from a scientific and from a political view.<p>Endlessly doing low-G research and getting more details on Marsian stones, is simply not on the same level as human permanently occupying Mars. And a Mars base is in my opinion not outside of the current budget if it were spent in a smarter way.')
