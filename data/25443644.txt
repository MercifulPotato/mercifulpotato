Some topics attract first responses from libertarian anti-authority types, such as crypto and intellectual property.<p>But even so there&#x27;s a kind of overlap. It&#x27;s anti-authority when it comes to obligations, and pro-authority when it&#x27;s about property. Or more generally, anti-authority about us, pro-authority about them.<p>That&#x27;s not so much &quot;contrarian&quot; as simply &quot;selfish&quot;, but it does have the &quot;pent up energy&quot; that dang mentioned. And yeah, I do think you see a lot more selfishness on HN than in the past.')
