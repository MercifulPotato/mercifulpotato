I also wonder the magnitude of the impact of Twitter&#x27;s actions. I sort of also wonder why some public figures are subject to fact checking and others are not.<p>Censoring really ought to be driven by the individual, not the platform. By getting involved in censoring certain parties, Twitter is implying here (whether intentionally or not) that its platform is a source of truth. That&#x27;s a horrifying notion on its own. If anything my trust in Twitter (what little I had) is basically gone. It has nothing to do with politics. The minute a social media platform starts meddling with user content (especially the content of public figures, especially especially the current POTUS, whoever he is), I no longer believe anything I see on the platform.<p>It&#x27;s hard enough to know what to believe without questioning the authenticity of people&#x27;s statements.')
