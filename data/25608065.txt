Anyone who is only moderately motivated has retrained, because working for low pay half of the year is not appealing to anyone who can pass any doctorate program.<p>Even if you took the position that only the good ones are getting funded, spending 50% of your &#x27;good&#x27; researchers time is a tragic waste of human ability.')
