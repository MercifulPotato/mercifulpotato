However, that doesn&#x27;t factor in that most of the usage occur in urban areas, where most of the country&#x27;s population lives. The consequence of the spectrum auctions&#x2F;allocations is that someone living in rural wyoming can&#x27;t use the 1Ghz to 7Ghz band (numbers made up) for himself, even though nobody else is using it. Is that a shame? I suppose, but only if he&#x27;s a radio enthusiast. For the vast majority of the population, this unused spectrum doesn&#x27;t impact their lives. They can still use their 802.11ac 5Ghz routers and get 500 Mb&#x2F;s transfer speeds in their homes.')
