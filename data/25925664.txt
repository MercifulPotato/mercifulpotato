I&#x27;ll miss hit a few of the weirder key placements before my brain switches over but it happens pretty quickly.<p>An unexpected side effect is I actually type a lot better on my laptop&#x27;s keyboard now because the Kyria encouraged me to use all of my fingers (my ring fingers were almost never used before). I don&#x27;t type noticeably faster, just much more comfortably.')
