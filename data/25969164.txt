Do they leave the hospital and you hire them, or are they just fired and have to find a hospital you haven&#x27;t taken over yet (what happens when there are none in their city)? Is there a way they could remain embedded in their hospital community whilst also providing expertise to your service, potentially you could get a wider variety of questions through your service this way too, to grow the range of things you can handle.')
