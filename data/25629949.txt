If outsourced workers produce the same economic value they will eventually get paid the same amount. Incomes in China are rising, not falling. Poverty is the result of low productivity and if you increase productivity you decrease poverty.<p>Imagine if you are building cars worth $20000 for $5000 and undercut western companies. Your car is worth $20000 so instead of undercutting you can just sell it for $20000 and take $15000 profit which then leads to more demand for employees which then leads to increased incomes once unemployment is down.')
