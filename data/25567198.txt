Obviously they can.  In fact, most of these occupations you mention function on word of mouth, anyway.<p>Sorry.  Getting people to click on ads is still bullshit.  The harm Facebook has done to society, especially over the past 5 years, completely outweighs the fact that someone you know used it to boost their astrology business.')
