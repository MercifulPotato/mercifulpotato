The &quot;meat stick&quot; you get at the store is not just &quot;salted meat&quot;. It is not a preserve, it is a processed food. Look at the ingredient label, they use a lot more than just &quot;salt and meat&quot; to make that stick and it is pretty sketchy to put that stuff in a person&#x27;s body.')
