Item(by='bbarnett', descendants=None, kids=[25327420], score=None, time=1607294463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326419, text='I don&#x27;t show my ID to &quot;anyone asking for it&quot;, but to those whom I choose.  Further, it is not a &quot;public document&quot;.  If it were public, I could demand that (for example) the license bureau give me a copy of yours.<p>As well, there is a massive difference between showing it for a second to a person, and uploading a digitized image of it.  In the former, there is no copy or record of it made.  It is merely examined for authenticity, against my face or signature.. then immediately returned.<p>Meanwhile, the digital copy can be further endlessly copied, and without me seeing it happen.  I must trust that it is deleted, trust it is never copied, trust the org does not have a leak, trust all her employees, and the list goes on and on and on.<p>Control, you see, is vital in this equation.  Trust, and control.  Trust, that I <i>have</i> control.  Some of my ID has identification numbers on them.  I do not want them to be recorded, and immediately snag back my ID if someone attempts to write them down.<p>Can I see someone copying my digitized ID?  Snag it back, if I mysteriously become aware of it?  No, no I can not.<p>FYI, I actually looked at some of your comment history, for I was absolutely certain you were a professional troll.  I see you are not, yet this is how strongly my mind sits in a state of vast befuddlement.<p>ID theft has been international news, countless laws exist to protect ID, identity.<p>Yet, you just shrug this all aside, and &#x27;meh&#x27; the whole thing?')
