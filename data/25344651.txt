Which can be done, but is still a massive effort.<p>Unless you really know (and guard) all the exits and control the surface, how could modern tech render them useless?<p>For primitive caves(targeting Taliban), I believe there was a weapon developed where shockwave (and gas?) would kill anyone inside, but if you have multiple blast doors and air filtration inside, you still have to cut or blast your way inside.<p>And fighting in an enemy underground network is not something any soldier would look forward to.<p>So I guess the modern way to take the swiss bunkers out, would be<p>a) really scout them out<p>b) target critical infrastructure (bunker breaking bombs)<p>c) destroy all the exits<p>or<p>d) infiltration with commando troops<p>or<p>e) blow up the whole mountain')
