Ledger-cli lets you make programmable scripts but it uses a text file to store the transactions, gnucash can use a SQL backend but doesn’t give you api endpoints.<p>Its still early stages and I have so much work to do for it to be usable enough for accountants (who will need a solid GUI). But its at a working stage if you are comfortable with CLI and SQL databases.<p>Seeking feedback - is this useful for you?')
