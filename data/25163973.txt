Item(by='RobinL', descendants=None, kids=[25165264], score=None, time=1605900741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163818, text='I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s entirely fair.<p>For instance, I host content on my personal website [0] that is written in using Observable, and in fact the site provides guides to allow anyone to export content[1] and embed elsewhere online.<p>My content can be entirely under my control if I save my libraries out of the Observable API as a tarball[2].<p>I genuinely think the differences between Observable and &#x27;pure&#x27; javascript are driven by the vision for a more powerful way of using javascript for rapid prototyping, rather than any attempt to make it proprietary.  I think these ideas are revolutionary and Observable is one of my favourite working environments as a data scientist.<p>I also think that Mike Bostock has shown good faith, and dedication to the open source community through decades of work, which he&#x27;s always given away for free.<p>With all that said, if ObservableHQ and its API were to disappear overnight, the lack of an editing environment would make it difficult to update existing content and so I think there is space for a offline version of the editor.  As far as I understand it, nothing&#x27;s stopping a third party building this.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.robinlinacre.com&#x2F;energy-usage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.robinlinacre.com&#x2F;energy-usage&#x2F;</a>\n[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@observablehq&#x2F;downloading-and-embedding-notebooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@observablehq&#x2F;downloading-and-embed...</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RobinL&#x2F;robinl.github.io&#x2F;tree&#x2F;dev&#x2F;tgz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RobinL&#x2F;robinl.github.io&#x2F;tree&#x2F;dev&#x2F;tgz</a>')
