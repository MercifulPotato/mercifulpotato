They committed sedition--I copy-pasted the actual definition of the law. It doesn&#x27;t matter why they were trying to break law, they still violated the law.<p>This presumes that your perspective on the alleged fraud is factually correct. If we don&#x27;t presume the facts of the matter one way or the other, it looks like they may have been petitioning their government for redress.<p>&gt; Let me put it like this: if I were to kill the President, I would be a murderer. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I think he&#x27;s a deranged nutcase whose continued presidency would irrevocably damage the country: I would still be committing first-degree murder<p>I think the same argument applies to vote fraud. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you hate the president (or think him incompetent, or whatever), vote fraud is vote fraud.<p>&gt; Some cosplayers did pretend to make electoral vote certificates to compete against, but cosplaying an electoral vote does not meet the legal requirements to create a valid electoral vote certificate.<p>So they are trying to prevent the cosplayers from successfully impersonating actual electors.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not going to respond to all of your points because my blood pressure can&#x27;t take this, but I will close out with this comment: what happened yesterday is the electoral equivalent of lynching.<p>Thats hyperbolic and undemocratic.<p>&gt; Even if you think it is justified, it is still an extralegal attempt by a mob to execute their will, damning the due process of anyone they come across.<p>Yeah I didn&#x27;t support their actions but its kind of like the protests last summer: riots are the language of the unheard.')
