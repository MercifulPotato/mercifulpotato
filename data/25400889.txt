But if you chose to buy instead of build <i>everything</i> most of that would not exist.<p>So there&#x27;s a paradox I see which is akin to the credit system where only people who don&#x27;t need credit are offered it: you can only &quot;afford&quot; to buy instead of build when you <i>have the engineering competence to build</i> - that&#x27;s when you can intelligently choose not to.<p>On the other hand, if you lack the internal competence to build and for that reason choose to buy? That&#x27;s when all the bad things happen. You&#x27;re going to get screwed by your vendor - they are going to know you aren&#x27;t technically capable of supporting yourself, they will give you stupid timelines, blown out costs, unreasonable constraints (&quot;it has to have a 16 core, 256GB RAM server or we won&#x27;t support it&quot;) etc etc. You <i>will</i> end up with the worst case of vendor lockin and a system everybody hates.<p>So one of the pitches I make when people are making this decision is that you should be building at least some things, because the strategic cost of not doing that affects everything else you do.')
