Every single crossing on the line is in a deplorable state of repair where rails are loose enough that they bounce around when cars and trains run over them. A highway grade crossing had collapsed in on itself and they ignored it for a year. They had to be forced kicking and screaming to start fixing them a couple years ago and the work is still ongoing. I wouldn&#x27;t trust the assholes running these companies or the FRA to maintain safe infrastructure for dangerous cargo. Their current tactic is to punish the towns that complained loudly by ripping up the crossings and then not working on them for a month.')
