Jane Street is extremely good at marketing themselves; before I ever worked there I received over $500 worth of &quot;swag&quot; (including a free iPad) just for attending talks and hiring events. The official recruiting strategy is grassroots where recruiters have anonymous reddit&#x2F;hn&#x2F;blind accounts to praise the company semi-anonymously. So you have a bunch of accounts posing as real employees or students talking up the company and the prestige of working there.<p>They sell exclusivity and mystery, but they definitely pay top of market salaries. I don&#x27;t personally believe the actual interviews are any harder than top FAANG companies but they did seem to recruit exclusively from FAANG and&#x2F;or top engineering schools.')
