So given that, it would make sense to carry over JS fp-&gt;int semantics into WASM. WASM is in effect a successor to asm.js.<p>It&#x27;s certainly <i>also</i> not too hard to compile&#x2F;jit for new architectures, but that was not the initial intent or what guided the early&#x2F;mid-stage design process.<p>If you examine the current WASM spec, it doesn&#x27;t appear to specify semantics at all for trunc. I would expect it inherits the exact behavior from JS.')
