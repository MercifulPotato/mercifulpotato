Easiest thing to quit in my life.<p>This is likely on the low end for most people and it was about ~100 transactions in total, but at least now I have an extra $600 every year to save or yolo.<p>(also I hate Starbucks now after realizing ~80% of their products contain a significant amount of sugar.
