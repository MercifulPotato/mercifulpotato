For every successful shipped roguelike with actual players, there are probably a thousand hobby roguelikes with no users but a happy developer or two wiling their time away. This is not a particularly lucrative corner of the gamedev world, so most are in it for the intrinsic motivation.<p>Handcrafting a level generator is a <i>lot</i> of fun. Training an ML model might be fun too, but it seems like a very different sort of activity, and not necessarily one that appeals to roguelike devs.<p><i>&gt; so long as an appropriate loss function can be crafted (in practice this isn&#x27;t very hard and proxies can even be used in tricky cases).</i><p>I&#x27;m skeptical that this is as easy as you suggest. Everyone thinks making something &quot;fun&quot; is easy until they sit down to try. Fun is the knife-edge between familiarity and surprise. Optimizing for it is probably in the same order of difficulty as predicting the stock market: If you train your generator to be <i>particularly</i> fun in a certain way, players will quickly grow tired of it, which isn&#x27;t fun.')
