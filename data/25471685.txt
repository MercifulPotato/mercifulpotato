I&#x27;m just saying... it works. And it works very well. Predict your own behaviors, be honest with yourself, and then nudge yourself into improving yourself through greater reasoning.<p>If you know that X will make you overeat, then avoid X from the start. If you know that Y makes you feel full, then eat Y. Etc. etc. That reduces the amount of measuring you need to do when dieting, because you can start to trust the nerve-cells in your stomach and&#x2F;or brain chemistry  for when you feel full and&#x2F;or hungry.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with a lot of diets: they don&#x27;t recognize the efficacy that a little bit of psychology and prediction can do. Everyone&#x27;s psychology is slightly different: what works for one person doesn&#x27;t work for everyone else. So you need to customize it to each person.<p>But once you figure out someone&#x27;s psychology, you really can &quot;manipulate them to better themselves&quot;. That includes yourself. And its a lot less stressful than trying to &quot;willpower&quot; your way throughout the hours, days, or weeks.')
