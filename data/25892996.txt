Much has been written about anti-intellectualism in these circles, where most of us have distinguished ourselves from the rabble by intellectual pursuits. But intellectuals would also rather write thinkpieces about how the majority of American history has been whitewashed (and... male-washed?)  And I can&#x27;t even say they don&#x27;t make good points! Can most African Americans really be expected to rally around the Constitution or the lofty ideals of the revolution? I&#x27;m thinking they probably have a different perspective on that. A different experience of America and its history.<p>That&#x27;s not even to mention this generation&#x27;s disillusionment with the 1st amendment, the rejection or reinterpretation of the 2nd, the gradual erosion of the 4th. The association of constitutional &#x27;audits&#x27; (YouTube that for a good time) with right wing conspiracy nuts. The conflation of patriotism with jingoism. I don&#x27;t know how much of a rallying point the constitution can be going forward. And I wonder where that leaves us.')
