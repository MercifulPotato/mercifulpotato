Also big corps have AB tested the hell out of everything leading to a UX that converts the most and hence is probably the best.<p>Complaining about bad UX and then not showing many examples but merely a few outliers also is a bit misleading.<p>To me it seems a possible way forward with UX is adaptivity. We need to make users reach their goals in the way they want it (hence subjectivity). Any static UX in the way of that is by definition bad. Good UX should adapt, evolve and morph for the user at hand. And it should do this dynamically and not compiled before hand by a few UX think lords that know how it should be done.<p>Just my 2 cents.')
