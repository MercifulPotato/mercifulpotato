In 2013, when I was 25, I received a high paying job offer to work at FB. Going to SV was a long-time dream, but in the end I took the hard decision not to take the offer. Ultimately I really don&#x27;t like what FB does. The perks and salary don&#x27;t compensate for that.<p>I&#x27;m still on HN, LinkedIn and WhatsApp. Every time I open LinkedIn I&#x27;m shocked at how addictive the feed is. I go there to message someone and before you know it 10 minutes have gone by and I forgot what I went to do in the first place. WhatsApp is really great, except that is owned by FB and they still extract value from me.<p>In 2015 I turned off all notifications on my phone. Quiting FB and no notifications have really improved my state of mind.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with how I use social media, but I&#x27;m very worried about how my kids will be able to handle it in their teens.')
