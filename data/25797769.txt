Much to my surprise someone <i>else</i> suggested it and within 30 minutes all of my groups had moved over and with very little loss of membership.  I was shocked at how quickly things moved, including my parents in my family groups, and how willing non-tech people were to move.  YMMV, but it may not.  Give it a shot.')
