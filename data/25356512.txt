They can run snatch-and-grabs on the streets of Italy. Nobody even knows all of the off-the-books operations they&#x27;re running in the horn of Africa.<p>The domestic United States is pretty boring by comparison. What, are they going to hassle the 7&#x2F;11 guy? Why would they even bother? Congress would throw an absolute <i>fit</i> if they caught wind of it.<p>It&#x27;s not because they can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s because they believe their own bullshit and get to do <i>way</i> too much cool Rambo&#x2F;James Bond stuff outside of the United States.<p>Regarding the police. They&#x27;re not exactly the <i>enemy</i> of the people. Our relationship with the cops is sort of complicated in this country. It&#x27;s more that they&#x27;re an institution with a <i>lot</i> of freedom and discretion, relatively poor training, low entrance standards, they have guns (and we have a lot of guns too), and they&#x27;re loosely operated by a checkerboard of local and state agencies, rather than being a monolithic state entity.<p>A lot of the calls our police go on are mental health-related, and it burns a lot of cops out. Add that to poor de-escalation procedures and training, historical emphasis on policing of drug-related crimes in a way that that disproportionately affects minority communities, and well, there&#x27;s trouble brewing.<p>If you ever get a chance (I know it&#x27;s a cliche), but watch &#x27;The Wire.&#x27; It&#x27;s an HBO TV show that is pretty entertaining and does sort of go into a lot of the subtleties and problems of institutional policing in America.<p>I got a little sidetracked there, but in answer to &#x27;what makes you think that the organizations whose goal is to protect the state, and not the people would be any more benevolent?&#x27; I say because it&#x27;s more boring and congress would throw a fit. And I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re benevolent per-se, but there is a LOT of believe-your-own-bullshit patriotic sentiment in this country that is hard to understate. We have an almost fetishistic worship of our military, and the notion that they &#x27;fight for our freedom&#x27; and &#x27;protect&#x27; us. That also carries over into the intelligence community to a great degree.<p>But, with the ongoing efforts to overturn the most recent presidential election, and the President&#x27;s usage of federal resources in the summer protests, I have to say a lot of us are having to rethink a lot of stuff.')
