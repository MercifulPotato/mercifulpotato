It&#x27;s just that Google&#x27;s is designed with a gate slightly ajar. Continuing with your pet analogy, it&#x27;s as if you could only get a dog or a cat, and it only eats food made by one specific manufacturer. You can convince the cat to eat almost whatever you have, but the dog won&#x27;t budge. Want a parrot or a hamster? Tough luck.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the OP article. You made a device, then you sold it. You shouldn&#x27;t get to control it after sale because you no longer own it. Plain and simple.<p>I don&#x27;t care about manufacturer &quot;supporting&quot; something. I bought it, it&#x27;s mine now, I&#x27;m on my own, and please don&#x27;t get in my way of modifying the thing I bought because I have the right to do so.')
