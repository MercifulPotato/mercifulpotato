The MAX is an entirely safe plane to fly without MCAS. It stalls more easily, but the safe flight regime is not in any way remarkable -- there are plenty of aircraft that stall even more easily than the MAX in wide use.<p>The problem was never that the plane&#x27;s flight characteristics were unsafe, it was that they were different enough from the older 737&#x27;s that it wasn&#x27;t reasonable to fit them under the same type certificate. So MCAS was added not to make the plane not stall, it was added to make the plane not stall <i>if flown like any other 737</i>.<p>This is both why a failure of this magnitude could slip past the regulators (MCAS was never described as critical for flight, so it could do with less redundancy. In a failure condition, the crew could always just turn it off and fly without.), and why it&#x27;s failure is so goddamn galling (a barely-tested computer program that was not needed for safe operation was given the controls to literally fly the plane into the ground for reasons that were best described as marketing).')
