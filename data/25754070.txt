Not because many students would use it, but because it teaches how a CPU actually functions without abstraction. I&#x27;ve used it only once, and even for that, I was mainly transcribing from a textbook. But understanding assembly was key for me to solve many computing problems over my career.<p>In other programming activities, understanding computing at the assembly level enabled me to realize that the bug I was chasing was actually in a library or, god forbid, the compiler.')
