The US never really relied on fossil fuel from the Middle East in the last couple decades.<p>That oil was important for Europe and most of all Japan and China. And that is still the case in many ways. Of course now the US maybe doesn&#x27;t want China to have cheap oil anymore.<p>If it was about securing US oil, war in Venezuela and Canada would be far more sensible.<p>And even then the US didn&#x27;t need to do anything, everybody would have happily sold the US oil without the need for any kind of war or US troupes of any kind.<p>The US increase intervention was required because of policy growth, where the US wanted an ever increasing control over these places for things other then oil.
