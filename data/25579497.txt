And It&#x27;s not something everyone&#x27;s addicted to. I&#x27;ve mostly stopped consuming &quot;regular food&quot; in favor of Huel. Funnily enough it has made me appreciate the few meals i eat way more, since the rest of the meals are literally the same Huel Vanilla flavor.<p>Exercise makes you feel better long-term, even light exercise such as walking helps, where I would argue the negative reinforcement is low. People are just too busy &quot;being controlled&quot; by corporations feeding them the next dopamine kick. NFLX and FB mostly is my understanding.<p>I understand that It&#x27;s easy to become obese in 2020 where you barely have to get out of the couch to get food, but i find it arcane how people can let it get so out of hand. It&#x27;s happening slowly but steadily in Sweden too, my understanding is that bad food is cheaper in the US than here though, which makes us cook more overall.<p>Dieting doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to mean saying no to tasty food, just eat a bit less of the bad stuff.<p>When i was a little kid my mother would give me 100$ a year if I didn&#x27;t eat candy (what a deal!?). So i withheld completely (except on my Birthday and xmas) for ~5 years. Since then I don&#x27;t have the craving for any candy or sweets. Takeaway being it is probably important how you&#x27;re brought up. I find it exhausting to get my 2.2kcal that I&#x27;m supposed to consume daily.')
