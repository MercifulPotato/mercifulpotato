Just learned to relax through it, and the symptoms would lessen after I left.<p>I go to get diagnosed, and they give you a nebulizer with something that triggers symptoms if you have it. I didn&#x27;t visibly react, so the tech did it again, then measured the difference in my breathing. Whoops, the lack of visible response meant that I should have stopped after one dose.<p>So, I couldn&#x27;t leave until after enough doses of an inhaler that it went back to normal. About 7 hits, I looked like I was sunburned for a while.')
