My argument is even if you&#x27;re being good and skipping candy&#x2F;soda...etc that just the normal food you eat is loaded with the stuff. White bread, most cereal, sauces...goes on and on. There are items without it, but it&#x27;s more expensive and certainly hard to say no to the sugary stuff even when we knows it&#x27;s bad.<p>I&#x27;ll cede that I misspoke when I said it couldn&#x27;t be found at all, but it certainly takes more effort.')
