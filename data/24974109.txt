You were just using it to download mp3s instead of find out how many people got blown up in a synagogue halfway around the world.  Not to single you out because I was doing the same thing.  Also there&#x27;s clearly more information on the internet today, but we also use it differently.  Social media did change how we consume information and created feedback loops we didn&#x27;t (specifically) have in 1999.<p>I think you have hit on something very important to internalize though.  We tend to look at the past, and especially our youth, through rose tinted glasses.  It&#x27;s important to maintain a realistic perspective on history as it relates to the current day, especially because we know more about the past now than we did then.<p>My mom thinks the 1960s were a wonderful time to be a kid because that&#x27;s when she was a kid.  She might be right, but I struggle to say civilization was better in 1960 than in 1990 or even 2020.  It&#x27;s all a matter of perspective.<p>To put it another way if we think the world was best in our youth we probably also think it went to hell when we became adults and started looking around.')
