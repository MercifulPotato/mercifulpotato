We can do more to control the virus, and we can do more for people dealing with the fallout of mental health issues exacerbated by the pandemic. That these two very related things are seen as mutually exclusive is the real bummer of this whole scenario. The number one priority is not controlling the virus or helping people with mental health or addiction issues. The &quot;number one priority&quot; is helping people who are struggling, pandemic-related or not, period.')
