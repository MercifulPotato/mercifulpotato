I did not meant to imply that I based my work on the Massalin paper, just that I liked it. As I said, my work is SMT-based and more closely related to Regehr&#x27;s &#x27;souper&#x27; or the one described in Gulwani&#x27;s &quot;Synthesis of Loop Free Programs&quot; in PLDI &#x27;11 (I think).<p>While STOKE is interesting, I have trouble understanding why they even call it a &quot;superoptimizer&quot;. The point of appending &quot;super-&quot; to optimizer was to get away from the (strictly speaking incorrect) practice of referring to compiler improvements as &quot;optimizations&quot; (when they don&#x27;t achieve optimal outcomes).<p>STOKE is &quot;stochastic&quot;, so it cannot realistically claim to always find optimal sequences. So it&#x27;s just another &quot;improver&quot;, or if you will, an &quot;optimizer&quot;.')
