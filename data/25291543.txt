No individual should be explicitly punished for the sins of an individual ancestor. But if some huge group of ancestors commits an atrocity against a target group that has effects lasting generations, to the point where that target group still suffers the ancestral hatreds to this day (just look at the dead posts in this thread - on <i>Hacker News</i>), then it&#x27;s not exactly an outrageous occurrence if the society gives some boon to the targeted group. Of course, society is a zero-sum game, and a boon to any is a burden on others, but that&#x27;s how the entire system works - there&#x27;s no getting away from the physics of that. But to say the other groups are &quot;punished&quot; with no further context implies something worse than that. There&#x27;s no way to compare this scenario with an individual person committing a crime against another.')
