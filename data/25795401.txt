Both hardware decode, play steam games, are stable, support the latest kernel etc..<p>However, latest steam games (and proton in particular) is better tested against Mesa (AMD OSS drivers), so it&#x27;s the place to be for gaming on linux.\nAMD also tears less on Linux, and supports Wayland (though Wayland support could be the reason for less tearing).<p>Either way, I&#x27;m fully AMD now and wouldn&#x27;t go back. I see zero downsides, and a few upsides.')
