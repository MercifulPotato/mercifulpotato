That&#x27;s the point of an open ledger. If you want &#x27;untraceable&#x27; BTC, you have an big burden to do so (buy it for cash in a parking lot with no cameras and using an alias).<p>The problem is the second you start buying things with the BTC and sending them to your house, your anonymity is shot.<p>There are coins (like Monero) whose purpose is to make transactions more untraceable but BTC is intended to be traced.')
