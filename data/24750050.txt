They could just launch it.<p>I would note that a lot of Google&#x27;s activities involves <i>foiling</i> SEO. Sure, they allow it too but if Google&#x27;s search criteria was a fixed target, 100% of the results would be garbage spam. A lot of what Google does now is bad but the company is still a wall against a vast sea of worse. Most criticisms of &quot;big tech&quot; doesn&#x27;t take into account that the troll&#x2F;spam&#x2F;SEO complex exists independently from these companies - sure, this complex is a product of how these companies operate but it&#x27;s also a product of how things have to work in the Internet and frightfully enough, the cost of doing involves the cost of beating this complex back (establishing boundaries, some of which are nasty compromises) no matter who&#x27;s in running the connections. And where does this money come from?')
