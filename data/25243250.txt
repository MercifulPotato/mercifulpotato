It&#x27;s the same reason it can work so well in real-estate. In small franchise attempts, most people get stuck in the first few units, their margins don&#x27;t kick off enough cash and entropy eats at them persistently. Fat margins are your primary protector against the zillion problems that will try to kill you early on. Anyone that can successfully build a self-sustaining expansion (in franchising) on tiny margins will always have my utmost respect, it&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to do.')
