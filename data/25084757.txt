At work when I finish I just lock the screen saver and walk away. Having 64gb of ram is also nice, for all the VM&#x27;s I need to run. Desktops if not build for gaming can be quieter than equivalent laptops, etc.<p>Same at home. I used to have only 1 computer at home. But for fun(i do electronics and some programming on my own) I use linux, for games I use windows, got tired of dualbooting, so its  just easier to have 1 dedicated computer for everything.<p>I still have my laptop somewhere, but rarely use it, since when I am not at home or office, my phone is enough for most situations.<p>Silence, not messing with cables every day, more ram + My computer is in the same state as I left it for work are my main motivators.<p>Gaming pc is just mz hobby so i probably shoudn&#x27;t even count it.<p>PS: oh and I forgot storage.  having multiple ssd&#x27;s is just so convinient.')
