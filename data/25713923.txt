Pravda and Izvestia only printed &quot;approved news&quot;, we made fun of them here in the west while in the Soviet Union is was said &quot;there is no news in Pravda, no truth in Izvestia&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to go there and will speak up against this type of censorship no matter who gets censored. Let the law be the bar which needs to be passed to be allowed to publish, not some ideological stance. If you do want to use ideology as a guideline to what gets published you a) have to be honest about it and b) don&#x27;t get too claim protection as a common carrier, i.e. you will be responsible for what gets published through your channel.')
