You&#x27;d end up with a puck the size of a data tape that can archive a petabyte of data and needs to be plugged in to a 5 watt power supply for long term storage.  That&#x27;s not super onerous.  Then consider that tapes need to be stored at exactly room temperature with 20-50 percent humidity, while this puck would barely care about environment at all.  And you could plug it directly into a computer without a $5k drive.  Honestly it sounds pretty good to me.  We just need to drop the price of flash by a factor of 20 to make the scenario happen.')
