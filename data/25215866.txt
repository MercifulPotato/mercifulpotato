The physics that most people learn is primarily classical mechanics plus a bit of electricity and magnetism.  There is some discussion of other aspects of physics, but it tends to be limited to discussion.  You need some degree of mathematical understanding in order for physics to have a meaningful impact.  The mathematical basis is important since it gives the ability to test the validity of physical models.  This ability to verify or falsify a model is fundamental to science.  High level discussions of a topic usually ignore the mathematics, which means they are asking students to accept something based upon authority.  That is problematic since it is far too easy to choose an authority based upon criteria other than verifiable truths when one doesn&#x27;t have the tools to verify what is being said.<p>* Technology also has to play catch-up.  Physics has always been an expensive field since it pushes the boundaries of engineering.  The precision instruments of past centuries may appear as quaint as a (quality) modern ruler, but they were pushing the limits of the times.  That being said, there is a difference in scale.  Pushing the boundaries of physics may have taken the resources of a nation in the recent past and wealthy benefactors in the more distant past.  Some of the more recent experiments, though admittedly exceptional, take an international effort.<p>I don&#x27;t really think that physics is coming to an end.  I do think that some areas of physics will stagnate until humanity catches up with it.')
