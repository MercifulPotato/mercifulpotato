They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”<p>you can assume he meant something other than what he said, but his words were in reference to &quot;When Mexico send its people&quot;, so it is not &quot;delusion&quot; to say he referred to &quot;people from Mexico&quot;.<p>he so generously acknowledges that only &quot;some&quot; of them might be good people.<p>what do you think he meant when he said &quot;they&#x27;re not sending you&quot;?<p>what do you think he meant by saying Mexico &quot;sends&quot; people to the US?<p>the media was right to treat that comment as indefensible.')
