People were asking about favorite christmas (crap can I even say christmas?) movies. I actually have one, but then I was thinking, this is an older movie, and who knows, maybe it&#x27;s now controversial in some way. Were any of the actors caught up in a scandal that should make me now dislike the movie? People may judge that I like a movie with X terrible person. Honestly, I&#x27;d rather just not say anything.')
