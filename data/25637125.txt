I really have no idea what non-engineering jobs are like, but I feel like they probably require less screen real-estate and text entry, and so don&#x27;t demand the same ergonomics that writing software (or doing CAD modeling, etc.) requires.<p>I can tell you that I personally hate being away from my desktop.  I like the feeling of the office chair, I like my ergonomic keyboard, I like having a ton of monitors to organize my triple-wide Emacs window, some terminals, some browsers for documentation, Slack, Discord, a music player, etc.  But... other people probably don&#x27;t do as much I&#x2F;O with their computer, and can probably lay in bed and get stuff done.<p>When I worked at Google I always saw people sitting on bouncy balls typing away on their laptops, and I guess they got stuff done doing that, so I just chalk it up as &quot;I don&#x27;t personally understand it&quot;.  I like my desk, but I see no reason to require people to sit at desks all day if they&#x27;d prefer to be in bed.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for them, they&#x27;ll probably stop doing it.')
