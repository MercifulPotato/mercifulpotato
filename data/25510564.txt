I am deader than a virus without chloroplasts existing elsewhere. Viruses need a host for the productive bit, I had food for the non-reproductive bit. Viruses don&#x27;t break down fast enough compared to their abundance to cause extinction, so why fault them for optimizing?<p>People commonly theorize that virus came from rump parasitic cells. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if at some point a huge virus with a membrane accidentally picked up enough stuff to become a cell again. To go back to chloroplasts again, it would be like how brown algae is an ex-heterotroph.')
