I should have mentioned I&#x27;ve been a user of andOTP for a few years so that&#x27;s why I brought the comparison up. I wish more projects (including Aegis) mentioned what distinguishes themselves from very similar options.<p>I think the fact that Aegis allows you to import from a number of other authenticators, notably proprietary ones, is an important feature in getting people to move over to an open source equivalent, which is something I respect.<p>One minor correction to what you said though - andOTP doesn&#x27;t relock every time you switch apps. I tried this just now to verify this.')
