The speaker <i>can</i> do this, the speaker and the hearer both know that the speaker can do this, and it is a common understanding between the speaker and the hearer that the speaker intends the hearer to receive a particular representation of events: this is the purpose of communication. This being so, the speaker presenting events out of their temporal sequence would be perverse. If the speaker knows the hearer will assume she is presenting events in their temporal sequence, she <i>must</i> present them in this sequence or explain that they are not so presented. To do otherwise would be understood by the speaker and hearer as deliberate deception.<p>So the sequence comes not from the semantics of &quot;and&quot; but the pragmatics of speaking itself. In fact, you don&#x27;t need &quot;and&quot; at all. If you leave &quot;and&quot; out -- asyndeton -- and list things, they will be understood to be in temporal sequence if they are the sort of thing that occur that way. &quot;I opened the door. I went out.&quot;<p>All of these &quot;meanings of and&quot; can be explained via pragmatics and a very simple meaning of &quot;and&quot;. The meaning I provided was intended as a hand-wavy gesture in the direction of a more formal theory.')
