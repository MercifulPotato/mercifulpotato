And parts can be fenced with much less risk than entire bikes. I doubt that trackers provide any actual safety improvement, neither in the small (what will <i>you</i> do with the information you might get?) nor in the big (will trackers eventually reduce the number of thieves?).<p>What might help, I think, are serial number registries.
