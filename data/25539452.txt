After the Super Nintendo I was deep into computers and programming. The place I used to go to rent video games also started to rent CD ROMS. I went down there one time to rent a CD ROM and saw the N64. Back then video games stores also worked as an arcade, where you could play a system for 30 minutes paying a small fee. So I decided to try this new system, the N64. The game I choose was Mario 64, or course. I did not know where to go, how to play, what my goals were... I remember back then feeling that I outgrew video games. This was around the year 2000. Wasn&#x27;t until 2009 that I decided to play with video games again, I bought a used xbox 360 from a friend. I had played Mario Paper 64, but on an emulator, and way after the game was released. Cool project thought, thanks for sharing.')
