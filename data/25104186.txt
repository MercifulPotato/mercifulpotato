This way you can finely tune the pressure.<p>Researchers and doctors tested early prototypes and they found the design was smart and very promising.<p>It was tested on very complicated lung simulators, and then two pigs.<p>Following those studies, french authorities started to look at our project and gave us funding (around 500k euros). Allowing us to have access to 2 ASL 5000, the rolls of lung simulators to try our prototypes.<p>Many different local companies (engineering, manufacturing) help us as well.<p>A complete team (5 people) made internally all the paperwork for French Health Authorities so they can approve clinical trials.<p>After a few months, the Makair was approved for Clinical trials and 2 hospitals started to try it on patients.<p>Meanwhile, we are working on CE marking and production lines. Multiple countries are interested.<p>If we had to start again, we would choose the same design.')
