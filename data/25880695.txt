Why? Because you don&#x27;t really pay them, it&#x27;s too low to matter and never covers the time spent anyway (even at the minimum wage). Yet, now people are not giving it, it became part of a transaction and it completely changes how the reward mechanism in the brain is stimulated: when giving, you&#x27;re proud of yourself for giving, when in a transaction, the amount matters.<p>In order to have a net positive effect, such a program would need to be able to generate an income, not necessarily a engineer market-level one (because you could have students working on this) but at least something above the minimum wage[1], not just tips.<p>[1]: and at this level, you&#x27;d still not attract more affluent kids who don&#x27;t need a job.')
