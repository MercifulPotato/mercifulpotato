As part of a &quot;communication class&quot; we were taped, and then saw our own recording. Video was not as common at the time as it is nowadays, but to me it was quite shocking: I could barely understand myself!<p>It was not only the accent (now weaker with time), but also mumbling plus talking too fast. It was a good experience. Definitely motivated me to pay more attention when I speak, slow down and articulate more (the accent part was not the main issue there ;).')
