There are lots of theorems that we suspect to be true that have never been proven to be true.  In fact, Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems state that there will always be statements that are true, but can never be proven to be true.<p>Fields should be as mathy as they can be, but no mathier.  Otherwise it&#x27;s just fake formalism, as you said yourself.<p>&gt; Let me put it to you this way. Anytime you see the word &quot;Design&quot; it refers to a field where we have little knowledge of how things truly work.<p>You are setting up a false dichotomy between knowing everything (which nobody does, certainly not scientists or mathematicians), and knowing nothing.<p>There are plenty of fields with &quot;design&quot; in the name that are quite rigorous: analog circuit design, digital signal processor design, microprocessor design, compiler design, etc.')
