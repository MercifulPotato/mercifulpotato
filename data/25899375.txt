Why don’t you blame them? You understand there’s nearly a billion dollars a year that goes to homelessness, right? It’s become a business at this point and the people running it have no interest in solving it because that means the gravy train ends. Ordinary working people can’t and shouldn’t be responsible for every single social problem out there — that’s why we hire people whose jobs it is to do that. Otherwise, hand back the damn tax money and we’ll start figuring it out like you want us to.')
