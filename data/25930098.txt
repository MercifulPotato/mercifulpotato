Item(by='fastball', descendants=None, kids=[25931897], score=None, time=1611764443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926684, text='Actually, as part of &quot;Electrify everything&quot;, it would probably be good to replace a significant chunk of the banking system with a cryptocurrency layer (maybe bitcoin, maybe not).<p>With green energy, digital gold is a lot more green than physical gold. Bitcoin is like electric cars â€“ not super green right in this moment when the grid is still dirty, but all it takes to make it greener is to green up the grid.<p>Meanwhile the classical banking system: uses all forms of transport which green up slower (armored cars, planes, etc), requires crazy amounts of construction (I don&#x27;t even want to guess how much cement has been used in the construction of physical banks all over the world), all those buildings use energy for AC&#x2F;lighting&#x2F;etc, require huge amounts of manpower to manage trust in the system (people <i>definitely</i> aren&#x27;t green), and <i>also</i> need their own datacenters anyway. And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m forgetting some things, where as with BTC pretty much all consumption is baked into mining, which again just gets greener automatically as the grid gets greener. Nobody is running a Bitcoin mining operation off of diesel generators. If you did the math (impractical given the breadth of the existing banking system), I think you&#x27;d find Bitcoin is <i>already</i> far greener than the existing banking system, by a huge margin.<p>And cryptos like Ethereum have the potential to 10x&#x2F;100x&#x2F;1000x that with things like PoS vs. PoW as well as the fact that Ethereum smart contracts can not only replace banking but probably other industries as well, such as title companies and various other middlemen.')
