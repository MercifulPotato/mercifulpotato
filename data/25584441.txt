Item(by='steelframe', descendants=None, kids=[25586502, 25584614], score=None, time=1609353016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583727, text='tl;dr: I expect to get something with shoddy build quality from Newegg, but at least the reviews seem non-gamed.<p>After a few months of lackadaisically making sporadic attempts to order an RTX 3080, I finally threw in the towel and ordered a prebuilt machine which will come with whatever brand 3080 card is in stock at the time from Newegg. I could really use the CPU upgrade anyway, and the markup on the parts isn&#x27;t at all bad compared to the markup from scalpers, who I refuse to do business with on principle.<p>The reviews on Newegg at least seem not-gamed. They&#x27;re largely, &quot;Quality parts slapped together and shipped unprotected, so I received the box with cards and RAM modules unseated and case parts bent due to being thrown around during shipping.&quot; I&#x27;m going to end up merging parts from two systems to produce a watercooled variant anyway, so all I really care about is just getting the parts, in particular the 3080, at this point.')
