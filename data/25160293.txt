The entire setting needs to be an old man telling young kids about the old glory and trying to convert them from Christianity.  That is about the only way you can justify only showing those actions: his memory, and latter life surrounded by Christian means he wants to remember only those parts. But now you really need to get the player to realize that this his a romanticized past - the player must spend a lot of time seeing contradictions in the player (that is it becomes obvious some things didn&#x27;t happen the way the player played them!).  There are a lot more implications of this line that I can figure out in a few minutes.')
