Is support of BLM a political statement or one based on race? If it’s a political statement, then opposing it, isn’t a potential Title VII violation as political preference isn’t a protected class? But if it’s a racial issue, could someone make a case the opposing it is a Title VII violation?<p>I have no idea what the answer is, and wouldn’t want my employees engaged in such a discussion as it could potentially come back as a lawsuit.<p>In that same context, I wouldn’t want James Damore writing his memo. Equally, the reason he was writing his memo was possibly because there were other conversations happening around race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. If those conversations were encouraging the advancement of the disadvantaged members of one of those classes, you could argue that is a violation of Title VII.')
