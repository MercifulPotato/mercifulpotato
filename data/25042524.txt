Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604978226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026847, text='Tesla has multiple EVs, and has had EV models longer than Tesla has existed.<p>They don&#x27;t have a network of EV chargers because they implemented the industry standard, so their EVs can charge at any charging station except Tesla&#x27;s.<p>Tesla doesn&#x27;t have much of a solar panel business either; SolarCity went from being the world-leader to one of the smallest non-regional solar panel businesses in the country.<p>No other automaker has an insurance business. This is because it&#x27;s not a competitive advantage to have an insurance business. The reason Tesla has one is because their cars are so expensive to insure due to parts shortages and labor costs that their cars would be prohibitively expensive to insure if they didn&#x27;t step in as insurer of last resort.<p>And probably most importantly, as many industry observers have noted: Tesla&#x27;s market position is extremely fragile. Now that they have actual competition in Europe, Tesla is no longer dominating EV sales. It&#x27;s pretty much being kept alive solely because the big U.S. automakers are keeping it alive so they can buy clean car credits from it. (Tesla has never come close to posting a quarterly or annual profit with selling these credits.)')
