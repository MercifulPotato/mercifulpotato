If you are a fraudster, obfuscating IPs is something worth investing in to get by the ad network, not the publisher. There&#x27;s no need to invest in fooling the publisher (in fact, appearing fraudulent to the publisher can be an <i>objective</i>).<p>Secondly, 15 times in a short period of time from the same IP might just be the ad system targeting a particular group of people who all use the same NAT (which does indeed tend to happen). So it might not be fraud at all.')
