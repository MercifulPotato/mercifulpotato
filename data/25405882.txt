In theory, urbit can be updated seamlessly through the chain of sponsorship (galaxy &gt; stars &gt; planets) and if a start or planet don&#x27;t like their sponsor (lord?) they can pack their bags and look for another sponsor (urbit is contained inside a single folder).<p>Maybe an personal server running a single app can have a similar experience (I remember urbit crowd comparing themselves to sandstorm) but it would be harder to migrate (in theory)')
