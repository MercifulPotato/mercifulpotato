A problem exists and creative people develop an innovative solution to said problem. The solution then becomes popular and a singular goal of uncreative people who deploy said solution everywhere and push it to its logical extreme.<p>I remember seeing this in the mid-2000s when HTML tables were shunned in favour of &quot;divs&quot;. I saw people reinventing tables using divs and CSS to display tabular data. Completely missing the point, of course.<p>This is an example of that for me. How can I possibly trust every single website I visit? It means nothing to connect to a news website, say, and see the &quot;green padlock&quot;. Who am I trusting exactly? That I&#x27;ve successfully connected to some load balancer that is operated by &quot;super-trustworthy-tech-news.com&quot;? What&#x27;s the use in that? Am I supposed to trust them more than some man-in-the-middle just because they own a domain name?<p>But maybe it&#x27;s for privacy? If you want privacy you use tor. HTTPS does nothing for privacy when it&#x27;s the same tech giant on the other end that is collecting all the data. It just means that said tech giant gets exclusive access to that data. Great.<p>All this does is train people to not care about security and to just trust us to do the right thing because they are too stupid to get it. Sooner or later there will be an event where a government compromises a CA. Bad luck. Some Americans already decided this was a solved problem and that this could never happen.')
