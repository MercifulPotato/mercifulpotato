I have a similar inclination as you regarding the story&#x2F;dialogs of cyberpunk thus far (stereotype-ridden, many dialogs&#x2F;texts are a waste of time etc.) and I also wouldn&#x27;t really compare the two games gameplaywise too much (Cyberpunk is a hybrid of open world and structured levels). However, what I really adore about cyberpunk and what makes it very likable to me is the artstyle and world and feeling graphically. It&#x27;s just so beautiful with these vibrant colors and different parts of the city, especially when it rainS ;) \nAlso, the characters&#x27; believable facial expressions really add to the feeling of being in this cyberpunk world. That makes the game worthwhile to me.')
