For example, I&#x27;ve seen services for general-purpose tasks such as job scheduling or generating PDF reports which required devs to change the code to add a new job type or report type. These services were replaced by services where the new application-specific types could be defined through an API, which meant that those services were &quot;done&quot; and reduced the amount of work required to use them.')
