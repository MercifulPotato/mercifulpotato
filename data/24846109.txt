It will probably give you better analysis tools and allow you to profile&#x2F;trace the libraries which are probably providing the performance.  At least Score-p, Extrae, and TAU have Python support and have sophisticated viewers with support for call trees and inclusive&#x2F;exclusive views.  When I looked (maybe a couple of years ago) I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the Python ecosystem to do that, though there may be now.')
