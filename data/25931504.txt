I don&#x27;t care too much about the charge time or cost myself as even with the hiked rates, charging is generally comparable or cheaper than a gas fill up (which only strikes on road trips for me).<p>What I really care about is how much time I&#x27;m interacting with the charge equipment.  It sucks to be standing outside in the freezing cold waiting for your card to maybe get accepted only to find out that for some dumb reason the machine decides to decline it (forcing you to use an app which you likely don&#x27;t have).<p>There&#x27;s no reason all EV charging can&#x27;t be a better experience than gas charging.
