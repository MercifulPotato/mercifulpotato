I could come up with other criticism of string theory that your post does not cover, but you do present some very good points. That being said, I disagree with the following bit:<p>&gt; For example, you can use string theory to study the structure and behavior of black holes and holography, something called AdS&#x2F;CFT, an area that has been incredibly successful.<p>Here, &quot;successful&quot; only means that other (famous) string theorists have found those ideas worth pursuing. Then, other people, in turn, picked up the idea because the former people had praised it and then they, too, would receive praise. (It&#x27;s almost like what people on Reddit call, pardon my French, a circle jerk.) However, AdS&#x2F;CFT hasn&#x27;t produced a single bit of verifiable experimental evidence in the realm of black holes. It&#x27;s not even clear what AdS&#x2F;CFT has to do with our (clearly non-AdS!) universe.')
