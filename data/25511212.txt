Item(by='runarberg', descendants=None, kids=[25511861], score=None, time=1608671022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508504, text='&gt; a better explanation might be, historically, <i>passage of time</i> leads to war.<p>My point exactly. Say that wars break out naturally with some Poisson-like distribution. When the war breaks out, the scale of it is gonna be in relation to the current arsenal of the warring parties.<p>So given your comment, I can revise my comment to say:<p>Historically—and mathematically—military build up leads <i>more devastating</i> wars.<p>Although that is not entirely true. As if nations didn’t hold militaries, there wouldn’t be wars between nations.')
