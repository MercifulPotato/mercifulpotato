We (humans) had wet markets filled with animals, including the very bats that carry the base virus. It&#x27;s the perfect breeding ground to create a pandemic-level virus and probably a few thousand more viruses of lesser impact.<p>The question of <i>how it got to Wuhan</i> all the way from Southern China remains unanswered. There weren&#x27;t any bats sold on the wet markets, nor has any other host animal been identified.<p>The virologists working in Wuhan <i>did</i> travel all the way to Southern China to collect bat coronavirus samples and they did perform gain-of-function experiments. Viruses - even highly pathogenic ones - have escaped labs on numerous occasions. There is a plausible scenario here.<p>There is another plausible scenario, which is that &quot;ground zero&quot; for Sars-CoV-2 is actually Southern China, just like Sars-CoV-1. However, the virus wasn&#x27;t <i>discovered</i> there first, because it didn&#x27;t cause enough illness. The outbreak in Wuhan, the 9th largest city in China, would&#x27;ve been discovered by chance.')
