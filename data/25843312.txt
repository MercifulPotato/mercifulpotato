Smaller cities are poorer but livable like eastern europe. The countryside is basically a third world country.<p>Traveling through US or Europe you won&#x27;t find people living in cinderblock shacks with a dirt floor and no plumbing. In China it&#x27;s still the norm outside of cities.<p>There&#x27;s not anybody starving to death, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider China a wealthy country, not even close. There&#x27;s very wealthy areas but a large fraction of the population still survives on a few thousand dollars a year.')
