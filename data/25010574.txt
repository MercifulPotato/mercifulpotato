How does .bashrc get replaced in that example? You mean the hijacked remote returns .bashrc instead of boring-spreadsheet.ods? That means it is only a problem if you are in $HOME (but still a problem). Further, how does the remote complete the SSL handshake if it doesn&#x27;t have the private key, and if it does, isn&#x27;t that a bigger problem?')
