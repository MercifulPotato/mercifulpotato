Thanks for sharing.<p>It&#x27;s not every day that I see the name &quot;Mortimer Adler&quot;.<p>He also wrote a book called &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; that I somehow stumbled upon in high school. That was the start of my love of reading (yes, I got off to a late start!). Not sure if any book changed my life more than that one.<p>Will have to get Syntopicon.<p>Here&#x27;s a web page for the book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegreatideas.org&#x2F;syntopicon.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegreatideas.org&#x2F;syntopicon.html</a><p>At a glance looks like a great start, but works better as a git repo&#x2F;collaborative ongoing project, and needs someone to take the reigns.')
