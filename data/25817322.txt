I think this could be extended to create a program that finds the best practical moves for a given level of play. Instead of just predicting the most likely human move, it could suggest the current move with the best &quot;expected value&quot; based on likely future human moves from both sides.<p>As an example, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a position where the best technical move will lead to a tiny edge with perfect play. Current programs like Stockfish and Alpha Zero will recommend that move. It would be better to instead recommend the move with a strong attack that will lead to a large advantage 95% of the time, even if it will lead to no advantage with perfect play. It seems one could extend Maia Chess to develop such a program.')
