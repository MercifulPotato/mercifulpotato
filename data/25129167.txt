Your mind has been trained to skip over a lot of those symbols and get the meaning from the surrounding code, and in the near term, it costs extra work to suppress that habit and actually see the symbols.<p>Over the long term, I don&#x27;t think symbols are harder to read than keywords.  C itself provides some evidence for that:  imagine reading C code if experience with another language had conditioned you to look past * and &amp;.  That would be terribly confusing, but for an experienced C programmer, those symbols leap out of the code at you because you know that they carry a lot of meaning.')
