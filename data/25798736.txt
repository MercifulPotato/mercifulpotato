I think that&#x27;s unequivocally a good thing, but it does lead to explosions of libraries and toolchains of questionable quality which iterate rapidly. There is SO MUCH JS stuff out there that even just the bad stuff greatly outnumbers what you have in Rust or Go. It&#x27;s the same reason why PHP has such a bad reputation. It was used and abused by non-developers just getting shit done for years that if you casually looked around the PHP world 10 years ago everything looked like crap. Quite frankly I&#x27;m over the elitism that so often accompanies these discussions where people ignorant about how other domains work make huge assumptions about the quality of said ecosystem. It&#x27;s classic Dunning Kruger.')
