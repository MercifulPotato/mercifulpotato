Item(by='LocalH', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611772667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924178, text='The current climate is one of not allowing people to &quot;start a new website&quot;. Sure, one can quite technically run their own platform, but the minute it becomes significant there seems to be a risk of shutdown via external pressure. Deplatforming is a very dangerous tool, the likes of which I think should only be reserved for the most heinous crimes. I have zero qualms about deplatforming a child molester, for example. But there was just a story on here about how someone lost their job simply for <i>having</i> accounts on Gab and Parler. Not for any content they posted, but for the mere existence of the accounts.<p>Even as recently as the 80s and 90s, liberals were much more likely to be anti-censorship. Now people who claim that label are all for shutting down &quot;bad&quot; things, without understanding that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are largely human constructs, and the things that are considered &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; can and will change over time. What about in the far future when bigotry inevitably becomes commonplace and systemic in a much worse way than humanity has already seen? Do we really want to just hand these tools of suppression and control to people like that on a silver platter? The entire point of freedom of speech is supposed to transcend that sort of control.<p>To go on a slight tangent, it&#x27;s quite similar to how many traditional Christians in America would wish for their religion to have special privileges in law, when they don&#x27;t realize that it would open the door for any <i>other</i> religion to do the same, should their population grow to the numbers they&#x27;d need to influence policy. The very same people who would wish to make Christianity privileged would bemoan Islam one day becoming the majority religion and instituting Islamic law via those same legal mechanisms. Nobody I&#x27;ve talked to face to face in my area has any kind of answer to that one.')
