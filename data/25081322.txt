The fact that I was able to identify deficiencies, make a plan, and execute that plan - that&#x27;s just kind of lucky. If I was too emotionally dysregulated to follow through on plans, I&#x27;d be hosed. Or if I wasn&#x27;t intellectually capable of identifying problems and forming viable plans, I&#x27;d be hosed.<p>And even on a day to day basis: I feel like my ability to program is a product of decisions my past self made. My current self isn&#x27;t responsible for my capabilities, he&#x27;s just the beneficiary&#x2F;victim of past choices I&#x27;ve made.<p>Maybe this is all a little woo, I don&#x27;t know. But I feel like the only reality is the one directly before me, and the only meaningful choices are the ones I make in this moment.')
