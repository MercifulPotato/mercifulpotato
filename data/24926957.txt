My wife is blaming me because, finally, after more then a decade and a half she started to care less of what neighbors and&#x2F;or extended family members think of her. For me personally I care only what 3 people think of me and that&#x27;s her and our kids. Everybody else, parents and siblings included get a mouthful from me and I could not care less if I offended them.I always tell them &quot;My money, my life - who doesn&#x27;t like me stop interacting with me&quot;')
