All the numbers we have now should be considered &quot;half vaccinations&quot;. Very soon (if this hasn&#x27;t already happened), we&#x27;ll be hitting the point where people start getting the second dose. Assuming the second dose takes as long to administer as the first dose, the rate of people getting the first dose will be cut in half.<p>I think the logistical challenges of administering the second dose will be even worse. You have to contact and schedule all of the first dose people, you need to have them actually show up when they are supposed to, and you need to have sufficient doses on hand.<p>I am expecting that a large number of people will, voluntarily or otherwise, either not receive the second dose or receive it later than they are supposed to.<p>Areas of the US that are looking &quot;good&quot; now in terms of the rate of vaccinations may look far worse very soon.')
