Isn&#x27;t it an FPS in an open-world environment just like most big budget releases? Like GTA, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, The Witcher, Assassins Creed, Red Dead Redemption, etc, but with a cyberpunk theme instead?\nAll previews and gameplay bits I&#x27;ve seen are basically just like those games and with nothing really truly unique or new except for the cyberpunky environment. I&#x27;m hoping for maybe a fantastic one-of-a-kind story that will make it justice but with all the hype around it, if it doesn&#x27;t end up becoming the best thing since sliced bread, I&#x27;m afraid it may end up being a big disappointment, although I hope I&#x27;m wrong.')
