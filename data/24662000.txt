The croissant were nearly as good as the ones I had in Paris.<p>And that&#x27;s just the food.  Cultures, languages and customs mix freely here.  While there certainly are distinct cultures, they are welcomed and often incorporated into the broader culture.<p>I think that you&#x27;d find that to be true in most urban areas (and many suburban ones).<p>That said, there are many places in the US which are not culturally or ethnically diverse at all.<p>Which isn&#x27;t surprising.  The US is <i>big</i>.  It has ~75% of the population of the EU in an area more than twice the size of the EU.<p>Consider how homogeneous some areas of the EU are.  Why is that?  Is it because they&#x27;re all bigots and &#x27;limeys&#x27; don&#x27;t want &#x27;frogs&#x27; around, etc?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thrillist.com&#x2F;venue&#x2F;eat&#x2F;new-york&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;absolute-bagels" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thrillist.com&#x2F;venue&#x2F;eat&#x2F;new-york&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;abs...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mofongo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mofongo</a>')
