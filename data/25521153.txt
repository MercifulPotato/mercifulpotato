If you get a question like that, they probably want a bunch of questions before you start on an answer. Like, &quot;which part of the process are we designing? The software stack, interfacing with logistics companies, customer service?&quot;<p>It seems frustrating, but they&#x27;re looking for people who will drill down and make sure they fully understand a task before they run off to solve it. Asking for clarification is usually a good thing in an interview, especially since the interviewers don&#x27;t always think the problems through completely.<p>The lack of feedback seems like a liability thing. A very small number of people will sue because they don&#x27;t like the reason they were given, so the company decides not to give detailed feedback.')
