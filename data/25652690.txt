I have Clocksin &amp; Mellish&#x27;s <i>Programming in Prolog</i> (2003, 5th ed.) and liked it as a good introduction (or more expansion, I had dabbled in it previously and &quot;knew&quot; the language but not the full depth of it). I&#x27;ve read good things about <i>The Art of Prolog</i> by Sterling and Shapiro, but have not read it.')
