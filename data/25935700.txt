The criticism is invalid because <i>true</i> OO would never do that. It seems like a No True Scotsman. Notably, when you whittle away all of the things that aren’t <i>true</i> OOP, you seem to be left with something that looks functional or data-oriented (something like idiomatic Go or Rust). There isn’t much remaining that might characterize it as a distinct paradigm.')
