As an artist, most of the personal sites and portfolios she sees are filled with images and videos. As a software engineer, most of the sites I see are just text and any images used typically don&#x27;t fit the site&#x27;s style very well. But it got me wondering if there were some really nice personal sites for engineers which do this well.<p>As a note, for personal site, I mean a site which covers someone&#x27;s work history, skills, projects, etc. I&#x27;m specifically not linking to my own to make it clear that this isn&#x27;t an advertisement.')
