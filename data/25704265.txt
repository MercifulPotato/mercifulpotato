I didn&#x27;t find the description in the article matched the book. The nostalgia in the book is that of the character not of the author. There is a reasonable ironic distance between the two. The narrator is an unloveable middle aged prick really. What works well in the book is how threadbare and futile the social contract is shown to be. The character and their life illustrate it brilliantly without it seeming preachy.')
