Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605790044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146821, text='&gt; This seems like a similar comment that would have been made about drum machines<p>I doubt that. Simplified and (semi-)automated instruments have been around for a long time since there is legitimate interest in such tools from musicians.<p>The difference here is that people have a tendency to regard machine generated output as more &quot;correct&quot; (whatever that means). The same psychological mechanisms that make Level 3 autonomy in cars and aeroplanes so dangerous can lead to a future where a closed loop automated content generation (e.g. train the next gen GAN on output from the previous gen GAN) kills all creativity and conditions us to prefer the generated aesthetic.')
