You don&#x27;t have any clue what you&#x27;re talking about. Fractional reserve banking exists to create money regardless of how much money is being printed. Inflation is the measure if price increases overtime. Velocity does not equal inflation, it indicates greater consumer demand for goods and thus can signal rising prices.<p>The government does borrow money. It borrows it from a central bank by selling it bonds. Bonds for which the public owes the future payments. Thus the government borrows from the public.<p>Put down the Marx and new monetary theory bullshit. Money has value, money has meaning, money is real. Your understanding is flawed.')
