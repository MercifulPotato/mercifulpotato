I recall distinctly one evening helping a group of sophomores with their intro linear algebra homework. It was early in the semester, the deadline for dropping classes was a week or two away, and they just weren&#x27;t getting it. More than likely they were going to just wash out.<p>As we were plugging away through an example exercise in the textbook, I said something like &quot;so this is a vector and this is a matrix, so to multiply them you need to do <i>this</i>&quot; and one of them said in exasperation, &quot;well how&#x27;d you even know that&#x27;s what they were??&quot; and it finally clicked that no one had explained to them basic notational conventions. They didn&#x27;t know that the bold and italic variables in the textbook actually meant something. This was compounded by professors using different notations on the blackboard during lectures - typically lowercase letters with overbars for vectors and poorly-rendered double-struck capital letters for matrices.<p>It took 5 minutes of listening to understand what the real problem was, and 5 minutes to fix it, but really it just took empathy. I don&#x27;t know if those students ended up dropping the class - statistically they very well could have. But if they did I hope it was because they found something else to be passionate and curious about, and not because they were bullied out of it.')
