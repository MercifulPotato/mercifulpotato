If you go to the city there are no agents of third party marketing agencies keeping notes of your movement and what items you look at in the stores to profile you.<p>Imagine going to the city and there is this trenchcoat and hat wearing private agent following you all day and you go into a store and see him handing the salesman a note and pointing at you, and then the sales guy comes over to you and says &quot;good day - do you want to buy <i>red things?</i> and you are like &quot;actually i am looking ...&quot; and the agent is now uncomfortably leaning into you conversation, &quot;... for green things&quot;. Sales says &quot;sure this way, please&quot; and the agent is writing &quot;green!&quot; in his notebook, circling it three times. That is what the internet is like today. And you look around and everyone has these agents following them, keeping notes. You ask someone about it they say &quot;well most people don&#x27;t even notice them&quot; or &quot;that is how things are&quot; or &quot;people shouldn&#x27;t expect not to be spied on by private corporations&quot;. So you hurry home while from every side street more agents come and try to follow you until you have this horde on your track and you hasten into your door with a crowd outside holding up signs like &quot;buy red things!&quot; and &quot;green thing is green!&quot; - but you are now at home so you relax and walk through your hallway to your room and say &quot;computer: play some <i>licensed music</i>&quot; and guitar music starts playing and -shocker- there are agents in your living room, one sitting on your couch playing the guitar, one is standing in front of your bookshelf taking notes of its content and another one is looking through your fridge, then stares directly at you and holds a sign up: &quot;buy food&quot;<p>The internet is nothing like outside.')
