I can not get the entire update for Big Sur downloaded before it fails. If I could use a resumable download manager which I often do, I could get it finished.<p>Is there a way to get a direct link to the image&#x2F;file so I can download it myself, outside the update manager? I am a mac developer as well but there are no links in the developer download section like there used to be ages ago.')
