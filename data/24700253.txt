All that comes from fossil fuels.<p>Totally, but all of that also allows us not to have 30-50% of the population working in farming. If you have enough money and enough time, you can absolutely live with a smaller foot print by producing your own food, but it&#x27;s not something that scales well. And I&#x27;d argue that you probably have skills that would serve humanity better if you applied them to larger problems than plucking weeds, that is: you could have a much larger impact on saving humanity&#x2F;the planet&#x2F;the universe&#x2F;your soul by not producing the food yourself and spending the time you save on other things.')
