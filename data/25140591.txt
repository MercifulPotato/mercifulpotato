This matter is even worse in the US that a LOT of police departments were literally made after the emancipation proclamation (or somewhat before), to capture runaway slaves. This is the history of policing in the US.<p>I think what it generally comes down to is a LOT of Americans, and a lot of people in the world haven&#x27;t learned the history of their own country. People probably know more about WW2 than they do about the history of abuse in their own country. I unfortunately was one of these people and until I decided to listen to people and start studying the history of America I understood a lot of the things I stood for were based on essentially lies.<p>I do think saying &quot;lets abolish police&quot; without the context of &quot;why&quot;, or &quot;wait what about the murderers?&quot; is harmful. I think people on the left generally assumes too much of people, and assumes that they&#x27;ve also spent many hours reading and understanding and discussing history.')
