It seems to me that the reason these institutions appear more progressive is that American conservatism is becoming less and less in touch with the truth.<p>I think it&#x27;s a feedback loop at this point, but as for &quot;which institutions&quot;, the media and the academy are pretty prominent institutions that have largely come to <i>describe themselves</i> as activist institutions, including making arguments like &quot;objectivity props up the status quo&quot;. Obviously these aren&#x27;t monolithic institutions, and you still have a lot of variety within (especially the academy) with respect to the degree to which they&#x27;ve become progressive orthodoxies.<p>&gt; The problem is that when these questions are answered &quot;the right&quot; just dismisses the answers as biased.<p>Again, I posit that&#x27;s because the media and the social sciences have a track record of progressive bias. If they made a concerted effort over time to demonstrate good faith and a commitment to the truth wherever it leads (as opposed to outright identifying themselves as activists, although their honesty is worth something), I think far fewer on the right would reject a given claim as &#x27;biased&#x27;. Even if I&#x27;m wrong, it must be something. There are a lot of people arguing that it&#x27;s hopeless to interact with the right because they&#x27;re fundamentally worse people or something, but clearly we haven&#x27;t always had such a large contingent of &quot;the right&quot; who have completely divorced themselves from mainstream epistemology, so something is driving this change, and there&#x27;s no reason to believe we can&#x27;t stall or even reverse the phenomenon.')
