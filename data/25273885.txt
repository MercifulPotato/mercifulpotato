A direct analogue of an asic PoW fork in case of a sustained attack.<p>&gt;and thereby convincing victim nodes that he in fact is the victim of false slashing because the victims will only discover the slash-claims much after the attackers &quot;valid&quot; blocks?<p>It&#x27;s not possible for &#x27;false slashing&#x27; to occur, because slashing requires presenting conflicting votes.<p>&gt;Isn&#x27;t the slashing mechanism also reliant upon mere hope that the network topology randomly happens to be in favor of non-malicious peers?<p>topology doesn&#x27;t matter in this case, 2&#x2F;3+ consensus is asynchronous. 2&#x2F;3 of stake is required to finalize blocks, so the attacker would finalize his own chain without slashing.<p>There are some ideas about 99+% proof consensus which rely on topology and nodes being online (which means they can observe that censorship is happening) but it&#x27;s not currently implemented. Eventually I expect it to happen, making attacks a practical impossibility, by coupling asynchronous 2&#x2F;3+ consensus guarantee with synchronous 99+% guarantee, effectively automatically coordinating anti-censorship forks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;99_fault_tolerant.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;99_fault_tolerant.html</a>')
