Unfortunately if we wanted to be scientific we&#x27;d probably need something like 3000 bit timestamps to do planck time until heat death of the universe. XFS could have lasted the better part of the stelliferous era if they had chosen struct timespec, but even that has the problematic nanosecond granularity limitation. It&#x27;s not the stone age and seconds have a very clear definition these days in terms of the number of hyperfine transitions of caesium, so I would have hoped new data structures would at least choose that.')
