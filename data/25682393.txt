It&#x27;s just a digital version of physical envelopes, which people also use to make sure they don&#x27;t overspend.<p>If you look in your spending account and you have $80 left for the month, you&#x27;re gonna budget around that, buy cheaper meals, hold off on purchases, etc. If you look in a singular account and it&#x27;s a few thousand (covering your rent, insurance, utilities, etc that&#x27;ll all get withdrawn on some day), you&#x27;re a lot more likely to accidentally overspend and overdraft.<p>If you set your money aside for expected expenses when you get it, it makes it a bit easier to know exactly how much you have left over and can actually spend (or save, or invest, etc) that month.')
