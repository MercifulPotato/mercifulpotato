Having a fast and slow cycle isn&#x27;t a bad idea.  The problem is rather that the slow cycle has too much power, and additionally uses a different electoral system from the fast cycle, so it&#x27;s not just an extra brake on overly-radical mistakes, it&#x27;s a potentially long-term gridlock.<p>If at least senate &quot;districts&quot; were equivalent to house &quot;districts&quot; (i.e. all state-based or all more regional, and both equivalently proportional), then it would be very unlikely to have long-term gridlock; instead a senate would simply serve as braking mechanism during electoral upheaval, and that&#x27;s perhaps a valuable feature.')
