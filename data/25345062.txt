The baddies du jour isn&#x27;t the root cause, just a link in a long causal chain.  It&#x27;s a cop out to say focusing on the baddies du jour is part of a multi-pronged approach, the other prongs aren&#x27;t there or consist of perfunctory hamfisted interventions.<p>But it&#x27;s not really a surprise, our current approach to mental health is one of sweeping problems under the rug and hoping the rug doesn&#x27;t notice.  It&#x27;s treated as a heartwarming story when someone is talked down from the side of a bridge, because comparatively nobody notices that they spend the rest of their life at a just-below-jumping threshold level of misery.')
