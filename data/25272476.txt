It does like to make varchars everything it doesn&#x27;t type-convert automatically. We also had to explicitly rename objects, mostly indexes - it like to truncate names, often overwriting previous entries when it truncates the name. Beyond that, there&#x27;s some procedures and application code to rewrite (it&#x27;s a Rails app built atop an older database that didn&#x27;t follow standard Rails conventions) but I&#x27;d say automation and semi-automation (ie smart find-and-replace) got us 80% of the way.')
