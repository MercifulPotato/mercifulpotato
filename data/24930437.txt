He learned to code in the 1980s on a Commodore 64 when he was in his 60s, built HAM radio gear, etc. My father who is now in his 60s is also an exception, so hopefully for my sake it runs in families.<p>These are exceptions though. Statistically most people do stop learning as they age, and from what I&#x27;ve observed I would tend to suspect it is due to motivational decline more than decline in actual ability (barring dementia or other issues).')
