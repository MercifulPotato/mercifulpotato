It&#x27;s where all text starts for me (comments, emails, long iMessage&#x2F;FB&#x2F;SMS messages, etc). It&#x27;s go great mobile and desktop clients (native). You can use MD or you can pick from one of the other editors they support. I came to Drafts from NVAlt + SimpleNote for mobile access and it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;ve tried a few other &quot;hip&quot; note apps (notion, obsidian, etc) but they either have bad or non-existent mobile apps or are just too heavy for what I want. If Drafts could handle pictures&#x2F;files I would be over the moon. I understand some of their reasoning behind not doing that but it means that I currently pay notion monthly so I can use it for 1 project that needs, at a minimum, for me to be able to put pictures inline. (Note: I want Drafts to &quot;manage&quot; these files&#x2F;photos, I know I can add in a MD photo and it will show in preview but I want to be able to store the photo on the note itself).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdrafts.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdrafts.com&#x2F;</a>')
