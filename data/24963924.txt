For example - &quot;the neurons in the part of the brain failed to express the transgene I wanted to use to study them.&quot; To actually write a paper about that null result requires substantially <i></i>more<i></i> experiments to form hypotheses and test them. Moreover, my lab is far from being an expert in the esoteric ways that this can happen, so when I try to submit the paper, the experts ask for even 10x more experiments. So I&#x27;ve gone farther and farther from the questions that are &quot;important&quot; (reflect my interests, expertise, and funding).<p>But this explains the value of scientific meetings and poster sessions where I can just tell this random tidbit to interested people <i>without the burden of peer review</i>.<p>An interesting recent development I&#x27;ve observed once was a <i></i>tweet<i></i> describing the fact that a dye (Texas red) labels brain vasculature even when injected subcutaneously. This random fact is not in the literature but is quite helpful from a procedural perspective. I think that science twitter has a potentially super valuable role to play in reporting unexpected or otherwise difficult to publish findings.')
