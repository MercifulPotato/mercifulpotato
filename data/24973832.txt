I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard anyone make reference to it in conversation.<p>The Seattle has 79% more area than San Francisco and San Francisco has 17% more people. How does it make economic sense to have a Subway when so much of the city is zoned for detached single family homes and there is acknowledged seismic and flooding risk?<p>In 2020, wouldn&#x27;t it be far more future proof and likely cheaper to plan on smart streets with self-driving pods like Dubai is doing with its Next platform? The moment autonomous on-demand P2P system is viable, it&#x27;s going to turn subways in less densely populated cities into albatrosses.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kJlQaCIUHTI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kJlQaCIUHTI</a>')
