You&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m a 38-year old male with two small daughters. I&#x27;d rather see ads for things that market towards 38 year old men and 3 year old girls over random ads for products marketed towards other demographics.<p>Privacy concerns aside (only because other people here will articulate them better), one of my big issues with targeted advertising is that it sucks at its job. I don&#x27;t see ads for things I want. I see ads for things I researched once and then decided against. I see ads for things I purchased a month ago.<p>Targeted ads as described above almost sounds like a service for me: here&#x27;s some curated things you might be interested in. But that&#x27;s not what targeted ads actually do, and consumers are not meant to benefit from them.')
