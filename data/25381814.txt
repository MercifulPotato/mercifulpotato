If you make the hardware that the CPU integrates with, and the OS that runs on the hardware, you can do a lot of optimization.<p>Intel CPUs don&#x27;t know what memory they&#x27;re talking to, i.e. they have to support a variety of memory.  Likewise they don&#x27;t necessarily know what OS they&#x27;re running; how it context switches, etc.  If it&#x27;s virtualized, etc.  Sure they have optimizations for those common cases, but the design is sort of accreted rather than derived from first principles.<p>To make an analogy, if you know your JS is running on v8, you can do a bunch of optimization so you don&#x27;t fall off the cliff of the JIT, and get say 10x performance wins in many cases.  But if you&#x27;re writing JS abstractly then you may use different patterns that hit slow paths in different VMs.  Performance is a leaky abstraction.')
