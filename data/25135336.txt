This implies it is the first to have to deal with retro gaming emulation from a financial standpoint.<p>Nintendo platforms tends to be the most emulated ones with very good emulation. Also dev community tends to focus on Nintendo emulator far more.<p>Neither Sony or MS had those problems.<p>I suspect things are moving slightly for the Playstation world, but even with that Sony don&#x27;t have a such big IP they can control and distribute them-self.')
