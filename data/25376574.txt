Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25376913, 25377052], score=None, time=1607624147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372741, text='Please don&#x27;t be a jerk on HN, especially in response to someone else&#x27;s misfortune, even if they brought it on themselves.   Maybe you don&#x27;t need to treat these people better (though why not?) but you owe the community better if you&#x27;re posting here. If you wouldn&#x27;t mind reviewing the site guidelines and taking the intended spirit to heart, we&#x27;d be grateful. Note these ones: &quot;<i>Be kind</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t sneer</i>&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>p.s. I skimmed through your recent commenting history and it looks greatâ€”just the kind of thing we want here. Sharing some of what you know is exactly what we want users to do. But please don&#x27;t be supercilious about it, as in this comment and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25372847" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25372847</a>. Ignorance doesn&#x27;t deserve humiliation, and that ingredient poisons the ecosystem (and eventually starts a degrading spiral, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25373520" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25373520</a>). The rest is good.')
