This was specifically designed to give the provincial governments access. They are completely within their right to do this.<p>You might wonder if it&#x27;s a PIPEDA&#x2F;phipa violation or in Ontario we have Intrusion upon seclusion laws with tort damages for privacy violations. So the police for example could be found in default damages of $10,000 for these privacy violations. Not a problem for the police, they have the right to access it.<p>The interesting this is that Thunderbay is doing this. The thunderbay police are some of the most corrupt police in Ontario at the moment. There&#x27;s a report which I have read that confirmed systemic racism by the thunderbay police. They would declare crimes against natives as non-crimes. They&#x27;d take natives, strip them naked and drive them out to the middle of nowhere and tell them to leave thunderbay. There was also a surprising number of dead natives in the river of tears that the police wouldn&#x27;t investigate.<p>Not surprising to see the thunderbay police involved in more controversy.')
