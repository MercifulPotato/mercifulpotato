Before Christmas (and after the Tier 4 restrictions were introduced) there was a huge queue of people without symptoms that were very interested in finding out whether they had Coronavirus.<p>I found it quite strange, since if you were staying at home and had zero symptoms, why would they need a test? However, somebody let slip that they were getting tested in order to get confidence travelling home to visit their family... Therefore, while people were locked-down, I think many worked around this.')
