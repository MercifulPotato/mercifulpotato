Item(by='hiq', descendants=None, kids=[25737838], score=None, time=1610400698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735800, text='&gt; 1) ... you have no idea if &#x2F; when individual messages will disappear.<p>There&#x27;s a small clock between the sending date and the (double) tick which indicates just that.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s recent, but if you select a message then click the &#x27;i&#x27; (information) at the top there&#x27;s a countdown that says exactly in how much time it disappears.<p>&gt; 4) Functionality is different on a phone vs a desktop. You can&#x27;t do nearly as much on the desktop version.<p>Which features are you missing on the desktop version? They seem to have implemented calls recently, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s still missing. I mostly write text messages though, so I wouldn&#x27;t know.<p>&gt; 5) It&#x27;s funky when you change phones. You can&#x27;t like sync all your old messages from one device to another. It&#x27;ll pull them on to a Desktop client, but it won&#x27;t pull them into a new Mobile phone client. Dunno, just bad UX.<p>Is it better with e.g. WhatsApp? You have to transfer the backup files anyway, right? If you&#x27;re on Android it should boil down to transferring the backup files, just like with WhatsApp. It does suck on iOS from what I&#x27;ve read.<p>&gt; 6) Signal is still based on phone numbers... I don&#x27;t trust phone number based 2FA, so I don&#x27;t really trust Signal to be based on phone numbers either.<p>Phone numbers are a problem, but they&#x27;re on a good track to get rid of them while still providing the same privacy. In the meantime, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a security risk if you have a random pin.<p>If you compare Signal with Discord, Slack and Microsoft Teams, Signal will never win on features. AFAIK these are not E2EE and they don&#x27;t really try to reduce the metadata or even data known by the servers. Basically a feature vs. security trade-off.')
