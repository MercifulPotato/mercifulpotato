Upshot: due to unprecedented warming and drying, California had tens of millions of dead trees. No amount of &#x27;forest management&#x27; would have prevented this. And it was due to large regional climate changes.<p>This &#x27;whistling in the dark&#x27; about simple explanations for climate change is not helping anybody.<p>&lt;edit&gt; Yes there was lots of thrashing around, and not all of it helped. But the last decade of drought created simultaneously <i>150 Million dead trees</i>. It might have taken the combined industrial output of California for a decade to get them all cut, hauled and disposed. There was no time, most of the trees were in impassable terrain, and heck that activity would inevitably have created a few unintentional fires.<p>What was done or not done, couldn&#x27;t have blunted the tsunami of dead wood that inundated the state. Arguing over a teacup in a tempest is fun but not informative.')
