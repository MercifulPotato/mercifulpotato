I wish it had been available when I learned Chinese back in the mid-80s. I remember having to look up the pinyin in one dictionary to get the character(s) and then count strokes to look it up in a different dictionary to get a definition in English. I&#x27;ve been forgetting Chinese for the last 30 years but after looking at this app and seeing what learning tools are available now I thought it might be fun to pick it up again.')
