Item(by='qwertox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602363764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24741510, text='The context of this thread is audio processing, so having I2S (Inter-IC Sound, with DMA) on board is really valuable, as is having an additional core.<p>In my case, I can order a bundle of three esp8266 13.79€, or a bundle of three esp32 for 17.99€, both as the most lazy, fastest delivery option on Amazon. If you know that you don&#x27;t need the extra features of the esp32, save yourself the 4.20€ (1.40€ per board) to keep the cost down. But if you&#x27;re new to it and want to explore the possibilities of a modern µC, it would be a mistake to save in the wrong place.<p>Even consider getting a LOLIN32 Lite (three for 19.99€), since the width of the board is smaller than the normal esp32 and esp8266 dev boards, which then lets you use both sides of a breadboard to plug in cables. All the other boards are so wide, that on a normal breadboard you will have to decide which side of the board you want to have a row of externally accessible pins, and on the other side all the cables must be plugged in below the board (search for &quot;LOLIN32 Lite width breadboard&quot;)<p>Saving on cost can also be a premature optimization.<p>&gt; Or are you referring to hobbyists?<p>Any context that is not production.
