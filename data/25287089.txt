The browser uses 6 parallel TCP connections to fetch resources, and a packet los in one of the TCP connections wouldn&#x27;t stall the other ones. QUIC only fixes this for HTTP&#x2F;2.0 which uses a single TCP connection with multiplexed HTTP streams; a single packet loss on the TCP level would stall all multiplexed streams on an OS level.')
