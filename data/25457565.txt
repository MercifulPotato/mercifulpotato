Think about observing an image by rotating it and projecting it orthogonally to the rotated direction. Take a bunch of these measurements (basically a radon transform) and then you can invert the process using the back projection algorithm.<p>The resolution of the image is proportional to the bandwidth of the waveform and the distance traversed by the satellite during the collection process.<p>This article is a bit of an exaggeration and Capella is certainly not the first or only SAR service.')
