I&#x27;d tolerate (and swiftly kill!) them because our users really loved having a place to meet. (This was back in 2011, ironically, reCAPCTAHA landed in 2012)<p>Unbeknownst to me those links were part of a larger spam network where thousands of low-quality links pointed back to my site, presumably to those fake accounts(?).<p>When the penalty hit the process of trying to figure out what the heck went wrong and trying to do something about it -- identical.<p>In short, I&#x27;ve been penalized out of existence because of an obvious and in my humble opinion, easy to identify spam campaign. Sadly Google placed the cleanup burden on me, and try as I did nothing actually helped. The article&#x27;s mention &quot;hidden&quot; penalties feels...accurate.<p>I often tell folks when you perform a Google search you&#x27;re given worse results than you deserve. My site and goodness knows how many others have been placed so far below the fold that if we&#x27;re not outright killed, we never reach the users and potential we should.<p>No biggie if the search market were more diverse, sadly, that is simply not the world we live in.')
