Item(by='lbeltrame', descendants=None, kids=[24888597], score=None, time=1603647802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887949, text='&gt; Masks do very little in open spaces.<p>I wonder then why many countries enforce them in open spaces. Note, this meant as a honest question.<p>&gt;  We still don&#x27;t have the data but I think a large part of infections is happening at home were prophylactic measures are highly impractical and impossible to enforce.<p>Some research on current evidence was published in Science last month[1]. With the exception of some specific &quot;job related&quot; events (like meat packing plants) or public gatherings, most of the transmission is in fact in the household.<p>&gt;  the assumption being that students are acting as silent spreaders (due to the low morbidity in young people), reaches home and multiplies easily there.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this a few times, but as far as I can see the current data are absolutely inconsistent. And the largest contact tracing study from India (recently published) was done with closed schools, so no information from there either.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;science.abd7672" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;scie...</a>')
