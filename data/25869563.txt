Item(by='supermatt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611303286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25869326, text='Well it doesn&#x27;t need to be a global network of stratospheric balloons - i.e. there are related aspects that could be undertaken with much more limited funding on a local scale.<p>For example, if you wanted to use a laser link to communicate between two ground-tethered weather balloons, you would need to account for the movements of the balloons to correct the link alignment. Lo and behold, first patent on the list (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loon.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;patents&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loon.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;patents&#x2F;</a>) is for that exact thing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US8634974B2&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US8634974B2&#x2F;en</a>).<p>What about control the descent of a balloon by letting out some of the gas? You know, like flight balloons use, but &quot;with a computer&quot;. Yep, patent for that too.<p>LOADS of the patents are basically &quot;mesh network but with ballons&quot;<p>These are obvious things you would need to do, and yet they are patented.<p>In short, they took away the ability to do ANY balloon based communications - not just a stratospheric global mesh network of current maneuvering autonomous balloons.<p>Of course, this shit shouldnt be permitted. The patent system is broken, as we often discuss around here.<p>IMHO, if these megacorps had ANY honour, they would release all patents to public domain - with revocation clause from another entity if that entity creates a derivative patent without same license. THAT is how to foster innovation - everything else should be a trade secret.')
