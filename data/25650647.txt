The waiting list was a year long through 2016, and in LA at least there was still a waiting list well into 2017.<p>No there wasn&#x27;t.  Leaf sales dropped 43% from 2014 to 2015 and were even worse in 2016 for a number of reasons.  The first was the Bolt was announced in early 2016 and the Model 3 in mid 2016 [1].  The second reason was the 2016 cost $5000 more than the 2015 because of a larger battery that only gave it 27% greater range (107 miles total)[1].   The third reason was that cosmetically it was unchanged from prior years [1].  The final reason was that there was an influx of cheap Leafs on the market[2].<p>The only waiting list in 2016 was for receiving your EV Rebate from the state[3].<p>The waiting list for the original Leaf was only 20,000 compared to the Model 3 which exceeded 300,000.<p>&gt; BMW, VW, Toyota, and Ford have all launched new models in significantly greater numbers over shorter timeframes and with fewer employees than Tesla.<p>Ok? Incumbent car manufacturers who have been building cars for 50+ years can ramp up manufacturing of a new model ICE faster than a company that&#x27;s just over a decade old that had to build an entirely new factory from the ground up.  That should surprise no one.<p>So what about EVs?  VW only managed to product around 30k of the ID.3 in 2020, it wants to build 300k in 2021.  Ford&#x27;s new Mach-E is limited to 50k units in 2021.  Why? Both are due in large part to production constraints with the battery.  The battery problem isn&#x27;t going to go away and everyone, including Tesla is being throttled by it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autoblog.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;facing-bolt-tesla-nissan-ev-leadership&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autoblog.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;facing-bolt-tesla-nissan...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autoblog.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;16&#x2F;cheap-used-nissan-leaf-ev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autoblog.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;16&#x2F;cheap-used-nissan-leaf-e...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandiegouniontribune.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;energy-green&#x2F;sd-fi-vehicle-rebate-20160923-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandiegouniontribune.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;energy-green&#x2F;s...</a>')
