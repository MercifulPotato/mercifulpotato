The Constitution is a good guide for setting up a system that allows depressurization.<p>The US Civil War (1861-1865) called, it would like to have a discussion about &quot;depressurization.&quot;<p>The founding writings are fine examples of political philosophy, but the government that we have today in any western liberal democracy would be alien to those authors.<p>The United States today has a government informed by its constitution of 230 years ago, but it is equally informed by a long history of profound social change and (at times) bloodshed.  The document of the 1780s can inspire, but there are better models to imitate if need be.')
