The strangest is the idea of going back and killing baby Hitler. When you attempt to do that, the universe, in it&#x27;s self righting ways makes the assassination attempt not work. Since Hitler is a pretty big enemy for a lot of people, many people over time try to go back and kill Hitler.<p>Hitler, on the other hand is just living his life as an Austrian child and young adult suffering from constant attempts on his life from people who he has no way of knowing. He gets the idea that people are always out to get him (because they are) and becomes evil, and uses the assassination attempts to justify creating the Holocaust.')
