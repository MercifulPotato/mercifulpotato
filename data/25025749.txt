But then, every app within the platform is very much antagonistic to this goal - it also wants to have full control over user&#x27;s data and interactions. So structurally, it&#x27;s the same problem - but it manifests itself separately at every level of the stack - at least where commercial software is involved.<p>It&#x27;s all a matter of culture. Proprietary software wants to take control, so it&#x27;s opposed to general interoperability. Contrast that with e.g. the modscenes of games like Kerbal Space Program, where mod authors (i.e. authors of what are essentially apps, running on the platform of the game) go out of their way to be interoperable with everything else, often implementing compatibility features inside their own work that target other popular mods.')
