Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=[24962405], score=None, time=1604257838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960531, text='&gt; Due to the scale limitation of sound verification, a system primarily designed for arbitrary-level specification and verification is more widely applicable than a system primarily designed for end-to-end verification<p>I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;designed for arbitrary-level specification and verification&quot; boils down to here, or how it would differ in a useful way from an end-to-end-focused design.  It seems like it would be relatively straightforward to embed something like, e.g. TLA in a proof assistant.  The main features of TLA, viz. temporal logic and non-determinism, are well understood as special cases of modal logic, which can in turn be modeled via quantification on &quot;possible worlds&quot;.  So I&#x27;m not sure how a systen that only focuses on e.g. TLA is &quot;more applicable&quot; and &quot;less niche&quot; - But I would be happy to be proven wrong here.')
