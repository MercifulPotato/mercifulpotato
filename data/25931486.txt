The short positions outstanding are 150% of the available shares even today.  Its a short squeeze even more than its WSB pumping it.  And apparently the short sellers just keep coming back for more.  They can play that game if they want and I dont feel bad that they lose all their money.<p>Second, theres no such thing as &quot;short seller pressure&quot;.  The act of shorting does not lower the price of a stock mechanically.  You could argue they are forming a negative narrative but I would call that fair game.  You&#x27;re allowed to say a business is crappy.<p>Third, WSB pumping and dumping stocks is scammy and definitely not good for the markets.  Thats just a mechanism where the early pumpers clean out all the idiots who follow their trade.')
