That’s nice and convenient. What I object to is things being controlled by a company’s internet service, commanded by the user’s smartphone. One just requires my smartphone, the device and an internet connection, the other adds the company as an unnecessary middleman.<p>That&#x27;s not quite right.  For all practical purposes, internet control also requires a server sitting on a public IP address somewhere, and that&#x27;s where things start break down.<p>1. If you run the server yourself, then you&#x27;re dealing with patching it and otherwise supporting that infrastructure.<p>2. If a third party tries to run a server as some kind of service, they&#x27;re stuck supporting all the protocols and schemas of all kinds of internet connected devices, since AFAIK there are little to no standards.  Then there&#x27;s the problem of funding such a project.<p>With both of the above situations, the device also needs to support configuring a different server.<p>3. If a manufacturer runs the server, then you avoid most of the problems of the above options, but then you&#x27;re at their mercy, and liable to loose functionality at some indeterminate point in the future.<p>The invisible hand of the market, PBUH, appears to have determined that 3 is the best (most profitable) option.')
