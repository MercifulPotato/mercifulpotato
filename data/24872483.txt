The resolution of an electron microsocope is dependant on the energy of the electron, but higher energy electrons rip your sample apart. The trick that cryo-em does is to stiffen the structure of the protein by embedding it in a glass matrix (the glass is actually just really cold water that is prevented from freezing). Since the protein is stiff, you can use higher energy electrons, and thus get a higher resolution.')
