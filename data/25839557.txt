But when it happens, then it’s wrong because it’s hate speech, not because it’s blasphemy.<p>It’s also worth noting that in many, or perhaps most, cases of blasphemy the root of the problem is preventing someone from harassing others in the name of their religion.  Good example is Poland, where people are being sued for protesting against Catholic discrimination of minorities.')
