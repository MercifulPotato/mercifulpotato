Not just a tag, but if you were going in for a procedure, could you even say &quot;I want to be sure I will not be treated by anyone not covered by my insurance plan&quot;? Because basically all the forms you need to sign upon admittance essentially say &quot;We can charge you whatever we want and you are responsible for paying it.&quot;')
