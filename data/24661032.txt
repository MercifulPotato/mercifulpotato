Mostly all white Polish people, huge proportion is single religious denomination, at least notionally (Catholic Christian). The &#x27;discriminatable&#x27; minorities are very small and not very visible, but when they are discernible, boy do they get abused.<p>Where non-white non-christian non-straight people appear, they seem to be at way too high a risk of verbal or physical violence. Hard to know about discrimination at jobs etc., but wouldn&#x27;t surprise me. Poland refused to accept Syrian war refugees, but reluctantly agreed to accept some Syrian Christians (so it&#x27;s none of those &quot;terrible Muslims&quot;). No help - so many still got beaten up and chased away.<p>That said, I agree with the original comment. Racism in Poland is _completely_ different in Poland, and mimicking US projections of it is counterproductive, and frankly, offensively patronising.')
