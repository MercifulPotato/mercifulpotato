You can optimize electric grids than a very hard usually (historically this was combinatorial optimization problem). When PDAs started becoming a hit, Apple was working on the newton, another company, General Magic, was basically created anti JVM with programming lang called Telescript and very desktop oriented MagicCap which would have empowered users to probably eventually create apps. General Magic was very innovative. Java&#x2F;JVM was heavily defined in the research community in Sun (which was very innovative before Solaris lost out to the more free). Then Sun eventually after failing to monetize the JVM, was bought by Oracle. Oracle sued Google because they had used Apache Harmony (a open source JVM). For a while Oracle did nothing with Java and it feels like they were trying to milk it for $.<p><pre><code>  It was basically an implicitly defined user driven decentralized JVM allowing users to create their own messages. Keep in mind these were very different days. In the semiconductor world, it was a battle between Intel and it&#x27;s clones (IP). In the mobile world, things were still using more primitive microcontrollers for the most part. It was still a telecommunications problem before multiple parties in the IEEE started cooperating and fixing error codes. I guess depending on you age, you can also think about this way, It was a physicists who inspired the to justify it for energy saving reasons, but it in networking terms, these were still days of AOL sending everyone cds. Eventually AOL bought Time for their content. Keep in mind that initially the iphone didn&#x27;t allow for external apps to be intended, TeleScirpt tried to empower humans and developers alike, and the company, General Magic was basically spun off of old Apple. Apple almost run out of money before buying NeXT. \n</code></pre>\nIt feels like to me the it could possible be that Apple could have never created the iphone in the first place, or a more innoative erlier era MagicCap which did actually go out of business but great ideas with a green minded initilaized. There was no cloud back then, but there was a mini-cloud that TeleScript was designed for. It allowed any user numbers to basically upgrade the &quot;tele phone numbers&quot; with a tele-e-address where multiple people could basically implementation a needed set of services via this type of messaging system, which eventually could a have turned into a app into a desktop (this was the original skewmorphic dsign). Google didn&#x27;t even exist at the time. I remember google beta, and even formation of the company barely escaped the com cash. I keep in mind this triangle in my head (it will be a linear standard norm triangle). The Google::Oracle lawsuit seems to be about two third party corporations allow a computation vs composition of apps by other stacks of other apps.  Which one do you value more the value of that law suits numbers, the energy savings, or any combination by combinating some number of names the google::apple::sun::oracle::general magic. WÔ∏è')
