He explicitly did not call for violence.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating how often this kind of technicality is used to justify bad behaviour.<p>For example, to convict a politician of corruption in the US there must be an explicit quid pro quo.  If it&#x27;s just implied, or somehow indirect?  Totally fine.  Why?  Because the definition of the bad act has been so narrowed, people&#x27;s expectations so lowered, as to make it trivially easy to skirt around the law while still engaging in corrupt behaviour.<p>It&#x27;s really quite clever!<p>Similarly, you&#x27;ve apparently decided that the only form of incitement to violence is if Trump literally tells his supporters to shoot his enemies.  Nothing else counts.  As a result, Trump can say things like<p>&gt; “The bottom line is, the court is saying, ‘We’re not going to touch this. You have no remedy’.  Basically, in effect, the ruling would be that you got to go to the streets and be as violent as Antifa.”<p>or<p>&gt; &quot;Proud Boys - stand back and stand by. But I&#x27;ll tell you what, somebody&#x27;s got to do something about antifa and the left&quot;<p>Well, that sure sounds like incitement to me.<p>But because he&#x27;s not literally saying &quot;So let&#x27;s go shoot them&quot;, well, then it&#x27;s not incitement!  No big deal!<p>It&#x27;s actually what makes Trump so damn effective.  He&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> good at saying things without saying them.  He&#x27;s a walking dog whistle and he&#x27;s made an art out of plausible deniability.')
