Item(by='scoopertrooper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605506438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107900, text='&gt; Is there anyone shipping an ARM motherboard and ARM chip? I think the &quot;openness&quot; is also defined by what the market offers. All I see are non-extendable notebooks.<p>The closest analogue to what you described in the ARM world would be plugging either a Computer-on-Module or System-on-Chip into a carrier board. Today&#x27;s ARM deployments are presently largely focused on energy efficiency, so they make heavier use of integration than typical x86 deployments.<p>e.g. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toradex.com&#x2F;computer-on-modules&#x2F;apalis-arm-family&#x2F;nxp-imx-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toradex.com&#x2F;computer-on-modules&#x2F;apalis-arm-famil...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toradex.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;partner-network&#x2F;hardware" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toradex.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;partner-network&#x2F;hardware</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toradex.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;carrier-board" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toradex.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;carrier-board</a><p>&gt; Also until you can run non-linux &quot;desktop software&quot; on one, it will always feel like a &quot;tablet&quot;<p>There are millions of linux users around the world that would challenge your assertion that desktop linux doesn&#x27;t qualify as anything beyond a tablet. In any event, Windows already runs on ARM and some rapscallions have already got it up and running on a Raspberry Pi despite Microsoft&#x27;s present prohibition on doing so. I&#x27;m sure Microsoft will free up the licensing in due time as market demand presents itself (if only to allow interoperability with M1 Mac VMs).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xyLdAs_roIA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xyLdAs_roIA</a>')
