Two weekends each month they showed an old movie. Classics from Casablanca, Laurence of Arabia, Fiddler on the Roof, to The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and War of The Worlds.<p>Tickets were $4-5, boxes of popcorn and soda&#x27;s of reasonable size were a $1-2 each, all movies lead with a cartoon and had an intermission.<p>Best of all the ushers. They would kick you out if you made too much noise and wouldn&#x27;t let you take your seat if you got up too often.<p>It&#x27;s a real shame that movie studios have cut the theaters margin on movies so thin that the theaters can&#x27;t bring their snack prices down, nor offer a better experience (like kicking people out who can&#x27;t shut up).')
