We’re an early startup helping low-income folks upskill and afford vocational training (think truck driving or nursing) with zero-interest loans. It’s a bit like Affirm meets edtech meets workforce development — deeply mission-oriented work helping people get ready for an economy that’s left them behind, and also an exciting engineering challenge as we’re working with a modern stack and awesome team.<p>This is engineering role #4 at a 10+ person company with some phenomenal talent and great culture. We&#x27;re hiring for both front-end and back-end roles, with a focus on someone who has had 2+ years of experience working on front-end (React, TypeScript) or back-end (TypeScript). We have an SF office and a distributed team — on-site post-COVID and remote available.<p>In my time in tech I have never come across a company that is as mission-oriented as ours — while still very much focused on building a successful business. For many of our customers, Dreambound represents a lifeline to economic stability. We are backed by USV; leaders at Affirm, Twitter, General Assembly; and some of the best VCs&#x2F;angels in the business. It&#x27;s a GREAT opportunity to join an early-stage company.<p>You can apply here and mention HN, or email me directly (brandon@ the below domain name):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dreambound.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4046711003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dreambound.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4046711003</a><p>We&#x27;re also hiring for operations, growth, and sales roles!')
