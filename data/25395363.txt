Pushing these radicals onto radical websites only further radicalizes them. That should be an axiomatic fact, yet nobody seems to understand it.<p>First off, that&#x27;s not an axiomatic fact, that&#x27;s the definition of an empirical question. Secondly, even if it was true, who cares? You can&#x27;t enlighten every crazy person on the planet, it&#x27;s a waste of time. The goal of effective policy is to isolate radical elements to a point where they can&#x27;t target mainstream communities of people who hold malleable beliefs. That is effective prevention.<p>I also see absolutely no evidence that the thesis of further radicalisation is even true. Here in Germany we have taken fairly strong, preventative measures to tackle hate speech and conspiracies online. It seems to have mostly worked, we have I think, one of the least polarized populations right now, broadly speaking. Insofar as there are fringe elements in their dedicated spaces, because they are in dedicated spaces, they can be monitored.<p>edit: another important point I forgot to mention, a lot of radical activity today uses commercial platforms for revenue to further fund their cause, maybe nowhere as evident as in the US where that sort of political activity seems to be a legitimate business. Depriving extremists of those revenue streams alone probably does significant damage to their cause.')
