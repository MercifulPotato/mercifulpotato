You&#x27;ve purchased free range dairy products<p>Free range or not, cows still need to be artificially inseminated (read: industry term to fancy dress &quot;cow rape&quot;), the calves still need to be weaned off after only a few weeks with their mothers (once the colostrum part is over) and&#x2F;or be given formula milk substitute while humans drink what&#x27;s rightfully the calf&#x27;s. Leaving the calf with the cow is absolutely not profitable. Also, the mother cow needs to be culled after only 5-6 years of living because they cannot bear children after that; cows naturally live for up to 20 years. Free range cows still end up in the same slaughter house, so you&#x27;re indirectly funding the beef industry. Oh, and by the way, if the calf is a male, it&#x27;s killed right away or sold to the veal industry.<p>It&#x27;s disgusting and cruel regardless of how much space the cow had to roam in; every other aspect of its life was miserable. Not knowing this is okay, but if you&#x27;re reading this and the sibling comments, you really have no excuse any more.')
