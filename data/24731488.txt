Computations (as we typically view them) are modeled as mathematical functions. Typically, computer scientists implement these mathematical functions in software with code. Ubicomp people will certainly do that, but they&#x27;re also trying to design hardware which performs computation as well.<p>Significant amounts of work go into making ubicomp systems as energy efficient as possible. Inevitably, you design specialized hardware which doesn&#x27;t operate under normal paradigms and does indeed appear to be magic.<p>Take SATURN [1], for example. It&#x27;s a microphone powered by ambient speech. Energy is harvested though triboelectric nanogenerators (TNGs).<p>Or take Serpentine [2]. It&#x27;s a special cord which contains TNGs. Interactions with the cord (pluck, twist, flick, etc.) can be uniquely identified in hardware simply by the generated waveform. There&#x27;s also no power source here.<p>The reason things like SATURN and Serpentine come off as magical is because energy-harvesting technologies are not the present standard. We expect to need a power source for our electronics. However, every real-world interaction imparts forces. With clever and efficient hardware, the energy imparted by these forces can be captured and utilized.<p>That said, this new paradigm also introduces new challenges. How do you ensure one of these devices is off? You can&#x27;t just unplug the power cable anymore. A possible solution is clearly delineating between the sensor and communication portion and placing a physical switch between these two elements. Since someone here mentioned privacy concerns, I&#x27;ll just say that any privacy concern will need to be addressed at the hardware&#x2F;physical level with ubicomp devices.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmobile.org&#x2F;grav&#x2F;research-highlight&#x2F;saturn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmobile.org&#x2F;grav&#x2F;research-highlight&#x2F;saturn</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3290605.3300775" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3290605.3300775</a>')
