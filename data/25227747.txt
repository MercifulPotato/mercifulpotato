Instead of having time to actually think about their software and optimise it, it’s all about throughput and making the economists happy. That’s why projects use various ready-to-use frameworks and get bloated very quickly. And time to look at the whole monstrosity and think about how you can slim it down “is not reasonable” as nobody pays for that. Users are supposed to get a better computer instead.')
