This doesn&#x27;t really prove anything either way. Sure it <i>could</i> be the case that they&#x27;re printing USDT backed by nothing and using it to by cryptos, but it could very well be the case that they&#x27;re printing the USDT in response to real deposits from people who want to get into crypto. Since USDT accounts for a significant portion of the crypto market, it&#x27;d be more suspicious for price to go up without a corresponding large amount of USDT being printed, because that would mean prices are going up without more money being poured into the market.')
