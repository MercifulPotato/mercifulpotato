We were one of the first users in the world of the XMLHttpRequest ActiveX object that the MSXML team released through subterfuge (I know because we hit every defect head first).<p>Since then I directed development on a number of absurdly rich and powerful platforms across telecom and the financial world. We were leading the respective industries when everyone was pushing Java, Flash, XAML&#x2F;WinForms, etc at various junctures (each coming and faltering). We had a better than native mobile &quot;app&quot; using web tech.<p>I was one of the early and vigorous public proponents of SVG.<p>These applications, going back up to two decades ago, demolish the overwhelming bulk of web apps people are working on today in design complexity, actual functionality, and so on.<p>Yeah, I have a pretty good notion about &quot;modern web technology&quot;, and often it feels like farce.
