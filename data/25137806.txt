And look where we are now.<p>The truth is that software development is an inherently complex process. You can automate the menial parts of it (and you probably should), but can never tackle the core of its complexity. Writing performant programs is hard and always will be. Writing correct concurrent programs is hard and always will be. Constructing easily understandable and refactorable business logic implementations is hard and always will be. And there is no silver bullet.')
