The problem is not with the idea, it&#x27;s with the (usual) implementation, which is that if you don&#x27;t appease the type-checker it won&#x27;t let you run your program.  I&#x27;m perfectly fine with a type checker that only gives me warnings but still allows me to run the code even if it isn&#x27;t satisfied.')
