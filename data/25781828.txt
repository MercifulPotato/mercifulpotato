Item(by='maranda', descendants=1, kids=[25782104], score=2, time=1610655180, title='Need to find a great, cheap, virtual event platform for a dance show?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I seriously need some help, I hope it&#x27;s ok to post \n here! I’m holding a virtual event that will be live-hosted (by me), where we will share four individual, pre-recorded dance films, and hopefully have a live Q+A with the choreographers afterward. I have three things I’m looking for:<p>BEAUTY. The subject of the show is dreams, all of these dances are inspired by dreams. Because that&#x27;s such a visually rich topic, I really want to be able to aesthetically curate the online experience -- so somehow, people don’t just land on a sterile online event page, but something more visually engaging that could frame the dance films. I’d like to be able to make the online experience colorful and textured, but in my preliminary research I haven’t found any platform that could accommodate this. If there’s some kind of other tab&#x2F;area in the platform where I could share images or drawings, I think that could work too. (Wishing for something more aesthetic than the black squares on zoom.)<p>INTERACTION. Of course for the Q+A aspect, it would be great to be able to have some video chat element in the service. The choreographers will be tuning in from separate locations. That said, I don’t think each audience member needs to appear on video. If there was a chat feature that would be amazing too, so the audience could “applaud” and discuss the films.<p>PRICE. I can’t spend more than a couple hundred right now, 500 at the <i>very</i> most. Unfortunate but true. A lot of the platforms I’m seeing are really geared toward corporations doing marketing and networking events, and the prices are in the thousands….that’s really not my world, I’m a super small time choreographer curating this two-day event and trying to break even.<p>Thank you so much for reading this!')
