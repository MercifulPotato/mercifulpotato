Still do. But ultimately, that would mean &quot;learning&quot; to not believe my own physical reality. I&#x27;m very much into intersubjectivity, but this is the one exception. That would be different if any of those doctors had actually seen me <i>during</i> an episode. The only time that happened however was when I was visiting friends. I had an episode while just hanging out there (holiday season stuff) and there happened to be a physician in the house when it hit. That guy never asked whether what I&#x27;m feeling was real. So it&#x27;s that guy and me, vs a bunch of people who have never seen it happen.')
