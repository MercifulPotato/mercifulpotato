The developer experience in go is nowhere near the developer experience in Elixir.  It&#x27;s just so much easier to write scalable code in Elixir than Go.  Sure it&#x27;s not as fast, but it&#x27;s not god-awful slow (speedwise, you&#x27;re doing better than python django, for example), and for 90% of people shopping for what elixir and go offer, the network is the bottleneck.')
