Item(by='monoideism', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603713631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893237, text='OK, I probably should have just left this as a &quot;cryptographic co-processor&quot; rather than TPM (or else used &quot;a TPM&quot;). But I believe there is some blurring here:<p>- My understanding is that the Intel root of trust for secure boot is in the PTT, which is essentially a software-implemented TPM with some extra features (so right, &quot;system firmware&quot;). It&#x27;s true that PTT is part of the ME. But it&#x27;s still a firmware-based TPM.<p>- With AMD, they use a cryptographic coprocessor whose name I forget but which is similar to PTT and which contains either a hardware or firmware-based TPM.<p>- With ARM, I&#x27;m pretty sure they use TrustZone, which is analogous to a TPM.<p>But yes, I should have been clearer.')
