Nobody thinks about me as much as I think about me, but some make decisions, be romantic, professional, based on what they think about me, that is my appearance, my status, my money, my family.<p>As usual, the truth is between the straw-man extremes, which are in this case &quot;nobody is ever concerned about me&quot; and &quot;everyone is thinking about me all the time.&quot; Now, it is not that older people realize that nobody is thinking about them and they were previously mistaken when thinking otherwise, they simply become aware that people are not thinking as much about them anymore, since they starting to be (or are) out of the game.')
