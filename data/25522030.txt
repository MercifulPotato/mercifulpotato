Item(by='renewiltord', descendants=None, kids=[25523539, 25522185], score=None, time=1608756473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521725, text='Considering that Matticus there knows about LW and Rationalism, it seems obvious he isn&#x27;t saying to zero out your coefficients.<p>Imagine I give you a dictionary purporting to contain descriptions of the referents of the following words: (I assume you know what a sprint is, but not a bilparyoti or a zambungar)<p>* sprint - to run at a rapid pace for a short distance<p>* bilparyoti - a kind of bright blue butterfly, found in Congo-Brazzaville<p>* zambungar - a muddy colour, specifically that created when a landslide enters a clear river<p>Now, based on knowing that &#x27;sprint&#x27; is &#x27;correct&#x27;, what is your probability, posterior to being supplied the dictionary, that you know what a &#x27;bilparyoti&#x27; references?<p>Now, imagine that I tell you that the &#x27;bilparyoti&#x27; is wrong and you are able to be convinced that the &#x27;bilparyoti&#x27; is wrong. Is your prior for the accuracy of the &#x27;zambungar&#x27; reference the same as the posterior after being supplied the information about the &#x27;bilparyoti&#x27;?<p>Matticus, there, presumably laments the fact that the zambungar accuracy probability has not moved. Rationally it should move towards zero. By varying amounts, certainly, but towards zero. With his friends, P(zambungar_correct | bilparyoti_wrong) = P(zambungar_correct|bilparyoti_unknown), truly a situation worthy of wailing and gnashing of teeth.')
