BUT, let me muddy it and make it harder to make your point feel so confidently clear-cut:<p>Scenario.  WhatsApp groups begin to be used as gathering places.  Open secret.  Bomb or explosion or storming of a government building ensures.  Question:  is it a question of national security to investigate and pressure to censor or eliminate the platform, and if not why not?<p>Scenario.  The bomby extremist-y people on Parler make up .05% of user base.  99.95, while being mostly right-wing, aren&#x27;t bomby or national security-threatlike.  Question:  is the tradeoff of punishing the platform by making it disappear, <i>worth</i> it as the only alternative platform to Twitter (which is relied upon by government, health authorities and journalists as the one true place)?<p>I have no problem with arguments in favor of censorship.  I DO have acid reflux when I see the lack of nuance, the strong confidence and wording like &quot;pretty clear.&quot;<p>No, censorship is <i>never</i> pretty clear and always warrants skepticism and conversation.')
