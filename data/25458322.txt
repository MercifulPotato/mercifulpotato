It&#x27;s cheaper (except for the really industrial sliced junk) and better than most that you can buy and if you let it ferment overnight there is not work involved in kneading it.<p>My usual recipe is 500 g plain flour (flour here is about 11.5% protein), 400 g water, 8 g salt, 1 g dried yeast.  Mix, leave overnight, fold over a couple of times, wait one hour, heat a conventional oven and a cast iron casserole with a lid until it reaches 230 C, drop the dough in the pot, put on the lid, cook for 35 minutes at 230 C, take off the lid cook further for 20 minutes.  Total time I spend actually working is probably less than ten minutes.  You can use any container suitable for cooking dry at that temperature.  Keeping the lid on keeps the moisture in and helps develop the crust.<p>Adjust the times depending on how brown you like the crust.')
