You can’t suspend that right without narrowly tailored due process for each of 330 million Americans. (This cuts both ways — there are several things that are effectively impossible because “due process” doesn’t scale regardless of the purpose.) This is the reason no State implemented real “lockdowns”, the Supreme Court has overturned such attempts many times historically, it is settled law at this point. States actually have <i>fewer</i> restrictions than the Federal government in this regard.<p>Similarly, effective contact tracing by the government is illegal in the US, ignoring that the disease was endemic before anyone even noticed. It isn’t just illegal, the US infrastructure is intentionally designed to make it extremely difficult to do at a technical implementation level, with the idea that it would hinder potential abuses. You could modify the systems to make contact tracing work, ignoring legality, but it would require at least a year of lead time to do the technical implementation.  Many senior people in US government <i>did</i> ask about this early in the year and were repeatedly told that implementation would require a very long time both legally and technically. So they dropped the idea.<p>No amount of “real national commitment” will address these issues, and denying that these limitations exist isn’t the basis for a constructive policy.')
