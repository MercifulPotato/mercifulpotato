It depends on what context. M as in thousand are roman numerals, whereas M in greek would be million.<p>It&#x27;s not counterintuitive at all, obviously the context here means that it&#x27;s million, as you wouldn&#x27;t note thousands as 2,450M in any way, it&#x27;d just be 2450. So the only remaining option is that it means million.<p>It&#x27;s not even remotely confusing, I&#x27;m sorry.')
