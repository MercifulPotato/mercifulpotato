They then got on their soap box to try to peacefully protest this outcome, which is legal, and what politics is about.  They were cancelled and shut down at every avenue trying to exercise speech and protest.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s the legal right of Twitter to do this, it&#x27;s that it is an extraordinarily demotivating action.<p>When people try the ballot box, and then the soap box, they&#x27;ve got one box left.
