When talking about some lisps, he wrote [1]:<p>&gt; <i>As names, car and cdr are great: short, and just the right visual distance apart. The only argument against them is that they&#x27;re not mnemonic. But (a) more mnemonic names tend to be over-specific (not all cdrs are tails), and (b) after a week of using Lisp, car and cdr mean the two halves of a cons cell, and languages should be designed for people who&#x27;ve used them for more than a week.</i><p>In particular, the last sentence. I find arguments that go &quot;but this looks confusing to a beginner!&quot; unconvincing. Language syntax and notation should be aimed at actual practitioners, not beginners.<p>----<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21256727" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21256727</a>')
