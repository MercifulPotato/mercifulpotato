Scan the WiFi networks from the client, pass it to your server and call the geolocation API from there. That way the upstream geo service provider wouldn&#x27;t know which client it belongs to.<p>Otherwise you are just using the google&#x2F;apple geo service. Granted this approach would work best in urban areas and wouldn&#x27;t work at all in unpopulated areas. You&#x27;d need to fall back to GPS or the OS location service in some cases.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is practical, just an idea from a privacy conscious individual.')
