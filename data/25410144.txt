And sometimes duplication is better than depend y hell. \nBut other times more as traction is better.<p>In true it’s an optimisation problem where both under abs over abstracting, or choosing a the wrong abstractions lead to less optimal outcomes.<p>To get more optimal out comes it helps to know what your optimisation targets are: less code, faster compilation, lower maintenance costs, performance, ease of code review, adapting quirky to market demands, passing legally required risk evaluations, or any number of others.<p>So understand your target, and choose your abstractions with your eyes open.<p>I’ve dealt with copy paste hell and inheritance hell. Better is the middle way.')
