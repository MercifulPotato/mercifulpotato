Item(by='johncolanduoni', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605505670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104323, text='Firecracker is a virtual machine that exists to provide a container-level interface. It is not designed for nor capable of running a full virtual machine. GVisor is even less virtual machine like: in fact it originally only worked via a ptrace sandbox and added a KVM-based interface (without a real Linux guest kernel) latter to improve performance.<p>I point to snap and flatpak because outside of browsers they are AFAICT the only attempts to sandbox user applications on Linux. It would be disingenuous if there were some other apps or distribution channels doing a better job that I hadn’t mentioned, I’d love to hear of some.')
