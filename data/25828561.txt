We used have multi-generation households: kids, parents, grandparents, maybe even great grandparents all helping out - everyone learning from a seemingly infinite amount of knowledge.<p>If we weren&#x27;t in this current dis-eased state then also the community of rational, reasonable people, would be ready and able to rally to counter any threats in the physical world.<p>What concerns me the most is the online bubbles of irrational, propaganda filled narratives, where if you attempt to engage and counter their narrative at all with reason, you&#x27;ll be near immediately banned&#x2F;blocked.<p>These irrational mobs will find a way to communicate in groups, and they may begin to use encrypted private messaging exclusively. The only solution to this is strong community - online and offline - along with creating a culture of healing, to open people&#x27;s hearts and minds; we already know these mobs are being influenced by foreign bad actors who want to destroy democracy and cause turmoil, so they need to be confronted&#x2F;addressed as well.<p>If we can&#x27;t get these online mobs under control somehow, to reach them and start helping them reason, if things escalate to guerilla-like civil warfare, then we&#x27;ll have to start creating borders around our cities with identity verification required. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to that, if it does it could be within 20 years though. It really depends on the policy that gets put into place - people need a UBI and at least 80% of their health needs covered, otherwise dis-ease progression, including stress, leads to lesser educated people with less critical thinking ability, and more hate for the system they will blame for their hardship and suffering and want to destroy said system.<p>Edit to add: lazy people downvote, add a qualitative reply instead.')
