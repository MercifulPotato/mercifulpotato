Wild west was fun while it lasted but we need to be aware we are in control of a flying chunk of metal going at high speed controlled by people who probably aren&#x27;t experts and haven&#x27;t practiced emergency avoidance maneuvers enough.<p>The annoying part right now though is that while we are figuring it all out, regulations are changing fast and often. It seems you could almost buy a drone and be in different legal framework by the time you fly it. Certainly inside one season the reasonably expensive (for us) dji my friend and I bought halvsies went from completely unencumbered to needing licensing because it was over 250g. In USA it seems they went through a few frameworks last few years as well. Which I understand, it&#x27;s a new territory and moving fast... Just makes it a bit tricky to stay informed, legal and compliant.')
