In this case the mRNA in the vaccine instructs your cells to create copies of the &#x27;spike protein&#x27; portion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.  After being created by your own cells, these proteins enter the blood stream, trigger an immune response and ultimately immunity to viruses having that spike protein.<p>This is extremely targeted immunity vs. natural immunity generated by an infection, in which your body will create antibodies for all sorts of proteins in the virus.  The broader resistance from natural immunity sounds good, and does have some benefit, but it also increases the risk of making your body react to its own tissues, creating an autoimmune condition.  On the other hand, one potential downside of the mRNA vaccination is that if the virus mutates the spike protein sufficiently to resist the antibodies generated by the vaccine, you&#x27;re back to square one.<p>&gt; From what I know, the COVID-19 vaccine is only effective in reducing symptoms for those who get inoculated. Is it accurate to say this vaccine does not prevent infection or help develop an immunity?<p>As others have mentioned immunity does not mean &#x27;zero infection&#x27;, it simply means that your immune system is primed to stop the infection quickly by having antibodies for the spike protein.')
