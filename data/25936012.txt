But I like the stock! So today I bought more at $330. I&#x27;m not worried that the aftermarket nominal price is just below that, because I think that&#x27;s just fake short ladder figures on very low volume - I&#x27;m still HOLDING - when the short sellers are truly forced to buy back to cover their shorts the price will go to the moon. The real squeeze hasn&#x27;t even begun yet.')
