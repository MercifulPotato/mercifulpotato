A lot of times I have to help them out with git issues, and can always to that using the GUI. When I see them work in the command line, it&#x27;s always so slow for them to type in things.<p>Want to switch branches? Click lower left and select your branch.\nWant to sync with server? Click lower left on the sync icon\nWant to commit? Just type your commit message and CTRL-Enter. Stop wasting time adding files on the command line.\nWant to prune your origin branches? Click on the Git menu and prune pull.<p>For this last one, I always need to look up the syntax when doing it on the command line.<p>Git is already complex enough (compared to SVN), so if you&#x27;re junior, for god sake use the GUI menu!')
