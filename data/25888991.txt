You see, in my industry there are very few players, and the current version of their software depends on much functionality and rather exacting specifications from products which are made using ArcGIS 10.2.1.  Not 10.2.  Not 10.2.2.<p>This is a very conservative hunk of software because this is not a &quot;move fast and break things&quot; industry.  This is a &quot;people die when we screw up&quot; industry.  So they haven&#x27;t moved from ArcGIS 10.2.1 for our version.  Change <i>is</i> coming but they have to be careful.<p>So ArcGIS 10.2.1 comes with a python install of 2.7.2 (I am pretty sure it is .2).  And you are very strongly advised NOT TO UPGRADE THAT in big bold letters on the relevant help pages.  So I need to use 2.7.2 to manipulate some stuff out of ArcGIS 10.2.1 to do &quot;stuff.&quot;<p>And there I sit.')
