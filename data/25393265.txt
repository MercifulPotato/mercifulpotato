We&#x27;re really good at developing vaccines, and they&#x27;re a category of drugs that is by far the most sensitive to any kind of side effect. This disease is dangerous enough and also widespread enough that I don&#x27;t see any plausible argument that would make the vaccine more dangerous than the disease.<p>And the risk is actually almost entirely age-dependent, the other risk factors weren&#x27;t that significant in studies.')
