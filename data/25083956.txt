Unfortunately, the message will be lost by those who are most in need of hearing it. That includes many of the readers of this piece who think <i>their</i> side are the victims and the <i>other</i> side are the creeping fascists.<p>Hate to break it to you, in the United States we&#x27;re screwed two ways over. Both the left and the right in the US have paramilitaries (antifa, proud boys). Both the left and the right in the US have enemies lists, and have effective propaganda wings that eviscerate opponents and call basic and decent democratic norms into question (free speech, elections). Both sides use identity and demographics to sow division and resentment between groups.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s some hope for the shrinking, rational middle that two creeping fascisms cancel each other out, and will in the future. But that&#x27;s a pretty long bet to make, too.<p>For the rest of us paying attention and who, in the words of the piece, &quot;think about fundamental things&quot;, it has already started and it is very, very scary where it may end up.')
