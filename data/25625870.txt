Item(by='slaymaker1907', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609713287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625362, text='One big advantage when writing average code is that while Rust emphasizes generics and makes them easy to write, C++ makes it so difficult that you try and avoid it at all costs. Big, complex projects are going to probably use polymorphism all over the place in my experience which is not really captured by benchmarks.<p>However, one advantage for C and C++ for such projects is that they make it far more pleasant to do bulk allocations. With C, you just need to group your mallocs and cast the memory and C++ offers placement new where you pass in the memory explicitly. With Rust, you need to reach into unsafe Rust (rightfully so), but unsafe Rust is very unpleasant to write.')
