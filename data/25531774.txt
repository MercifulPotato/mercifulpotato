I asked him whether it was necessary for the procedure and what they were used for and he couldn’t really give me an answer beyond it’s nice to be able to compare the finished product. So I told him when I came back in for my post-op I’d be more than happy to pull up a before picture on my phone for him to use to admire his work. I even let him take the “before” photo on my phone. I’m sure he thought I was a paranoid tinfoil hat type but he really didn’t seem to mind.')
