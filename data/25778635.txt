The profit margins on this stuff is insane.  And the volumes of money typical people spend on this stuff is also insane.<p>(speculation here) The insurrection is probably opening the door for new customers.  I would not be surprised to hear a people in zero-gun households are now seeking to acquire their first one.  That allure of &quot;protection&quot; is strong.  And urbanites represent a huge untapped market for guns and tactical gear.  So it makes sense to push ads on these people.<p>Going from zero to one is the biggest leap.  I bet there&#x27;s usually some event for people that primes them to pull the trigger.  You buy that first one for protection, but the next ones are because they are fun, fashionable, or an investment.  I know a fair number of people with gun+related collections which exceed the value of their cars.  The fact that gun collecting has become fairly profitable in the past few years seems to have really spurred a frenzy of buying.  If you can buy something for $800, and sell it for $1300 in three years, then why not buy as much as you can afford?  This then fuels shortages, raising prices.<p>So yeah, it might be very much _not_ you, right now, but I bet they are hoping enough ads will change your mind.  I mean, you want to be the cool, macho person that you family and friends turn to for protection in these trying times, right? &#x2F;s')
