Sure it&#x27;s a bit annoying at first, but it quickly becomes natural, and you don&#x27;t have to use all features at first. It has allowed me to improve my touch typing a lot. Learning a programming language is a lot more work but hardly anyone ever complain about it.<p>It&#x27;s been maybe two months and I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else than vim for serious code editing.')
