Yes this is the general guidance we&#x27;re using too (0.1&#x2F;1&#x2F;10s), and one that we&#x27;re reinforcing at every level of the company.  This link does have more detail than I&#x27;ve seen in other places though, so it&#x27;s an interesting read.<p>However I&#x27;ve not seen guidance on whether these should be P90 or P95 or P99 measures for example though.  We&#x27;ve selected something internally, but obviously selecting amongst three &#x27;measurement points&#x27; could drastically change general user&#x27;s experience.<p>(HN is throttling my replies so apologies for delay)')
