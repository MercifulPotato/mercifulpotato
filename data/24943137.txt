In my personal experience having no commute was crossed with having no childcare. This created a dynamic with me and my wife where we worked  essentially split shifts which may have appeared to be more hours, but with significant gaps dedicated to watching the kids. Normally the commute also included a commute to daycare&#x2F;school which was sort of dual purpose commute and child supervision.')
