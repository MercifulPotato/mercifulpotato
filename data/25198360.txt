Now please explain how to replicate it.<p>SLC&#x27;s strategy for homelessness is audacious and progressive. Leftists like me sat up and took note. Why can&#x27;t we do the same in our own areas?!<p>Utah reminds me of the Nordic countries, specifically Finland. High homogeneity allows those societies to more easily find consensus, break out of dogmatic strategies that no longer work.<p>One data point about homogeneity (no cite, sorry) is a study of conservative support for raising taxes. Conservatives in more homogenous areas happily raise their own taxes, at about the same rate as majority liberal areas.<p>FWIW, Some of Utah&#x27;s approach to social problems is my kind of conservativism. I grew up in the church. We did the food banks, adopting refugee families, missionary works (rites of passage). Not knowing any better, I thought this was the norm, and that I was a conservative. While I&#x27;m not a big fan of Mormonism (or religion in general), I love that society&#x27;s commitment to mutual aide.<p>--<p>Meta: I became interested in American Affairs when Ezra Klein interviewed Julius Krein.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;21528267&#x2F;the-ezra-klein-show-trumpism-donald-trump-joe-biden-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;21528267&#x2F;the-ezra-klein-show-trumpism-do...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Affairs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Affairs</a><p>I love that the next generation of thinkers are reexamining big ideas with fresh eyes, that they&#x27;re ignoring the framing and battle lines drawn up by Boomers and Gen X&#x27;ers (like me).<p>In my own activism and political participation, I&#x27;ve observed that Millennials (aka Gen Y?) are more interested in getting things done. Much to the consternation to most of us blue hairs. But I love it.')
