I don’t demand democracy in my business relationship with in-n-out when I order a burger nor do I demand democracy when a company pays me for some software development.<p>I do demand democracy from a government that makes laws I cannot opt out of and controls the courts which enforce all disputes in my life.<p>Even the largest companies in the world can be avoided by someone who doesn’t want to do business with them. The same is not true of the government.')
