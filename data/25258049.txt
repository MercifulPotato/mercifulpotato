You still need industrial biologists to generate and validate AphaFold structures, interpret the results as part of the bigger picture, and to finally design the drugs. And, then, of course you still need to validate the drugs in experimental systems (first the test tube, then mice, then humans).<p>So your second guess is correct - one of the steps is much cheaper now, which marginally improves the entire pipeline. As a result, drugs should now arrive to the market faster.<p>As a side note, I am curious what happens to the field of structural biology in 10 to 15 years from now. Every research university has a large structural biology department with super expensive Xray&#x2F;NRM&#x2F;Cryo-EM machines, and armies of students who routinely spend 4-6 years of their PhD trying to solve a structure of a single protein. If AlphaFold works as advertised, NIH will gradually shift funding to other problems.<p>(It was predicted that it&#x27;d be taxi drivers, not professors, that AI got first. Ironic.)')
