That is sarcasm, it is a recurring topic for most of last decade till now.<p>Inductive reasoning suggests that Tether dollars are mostly and usually created accurately as they have weathered state actor lawsuits, some segments of the market itself choose competitors primarily for better transparency and a lack  bad history.<p>Given the similar percentage growth of similar stablecoins like USDC and DAI, there just is a market for stablecoins where capital completely skips bitcoin to enter the digital asset market. USDC issuance size is just as large as Tetherâ€™s has been in the recent past, while Tether was weathering the exact same controversies as it has today. This suggests there is just a market for stablecoins, simple as that. This actually bolsters the general credibility of Tether functioning mostly as they always claimed it did where Tether was created only in response to deposits on Bitfinex (except when it wasnt, but usually).')
