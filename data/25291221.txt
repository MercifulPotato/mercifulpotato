In many cases, the services launched are essentially MVPs that were only created to serve a handful of customers&#x27; needs. If a huge whale of a customer says they want hosted Jupyter notebooks on AWS (just a theoretical example I picked because I saw someone criticize Sagemaker, but I don&#x27;t have any specific knowledge of Sagemaker), then AWS will create that for them, <i>but</i>, AWS doesn&#x27;t actually do &quot;one off&quot; services for a specific customer, so they will also launch those hosted notebooks as a public service.<p>The result is of course that this service was built with one customer&#x27;s use case in mind, so it might not serve other customers&#x27; use cases very well, which leads to some negative perception. But ideally AWS then goes and incorporates feedback into the service, turning it into a &quot;tier 1&quot; service rather than an MVP. It just takes time.')
