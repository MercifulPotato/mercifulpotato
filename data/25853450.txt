A third-party app can&#x27;t pretend to be another app for push notification purposes (unless you jailbreak?).<p>Second, so if you can&#x27;t access push notifications for async, then you need to poll or keep a websocket open. That&#x27;ll nuke your battery life.<p>Third, the mobile platforms are quite hostile to this. There&#x27;s been plenty of third-party YouTube clients that have been removed, and even more stupid things like controlling smart lights on your local network through their official, deliberately unauthenticated LAN API needs an approval from the manufacturer of said lights.')
