It wasn&#x27;t Robinhood&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s not like they told the user to do it.<p>IIRC FINRA has regulations <i>explicitly</i> prohibiting this situation. In this situation Robinhood was either negligent in not verifying a trading regulation that explicitly exists, or was incompetent enough to not know about it.<p>While blaming the user may apply in some way here, it is Robinhood&#x27;s responsibility.')
