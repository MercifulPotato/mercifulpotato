Item(by='Taig', descendants=None, kids=[25587127, 25588316], score=None, time=1609357574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='I recently launched a website that allows users to book a locksmith for emergency door openings (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slozzer.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slozzer.net&#x2F;</a>). The main goal is to ensure a safe and reliable process, because the locksmith industry has a terrible reputation for ripping off and exploiting customers (at least in Germany, for whose market the product is designed for).<p>Unfortunately, only after several weeks of development I found out that it is not possible to run Google Ads for locksmith keywords, because in the past they were exclusively occupied by scammers. Now I&#x27;m torn between abandoning the project or getting involved in the tedious SEO battle with little chance of success.')
