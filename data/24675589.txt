I can very easily tell for myself when a site is down, and it&#x27;s not hard to find most companies&#x27; service status page.  Sure, if a few days later we get an interesting&#x2F;detailed post-mortem from the company, I&#x27;d find <i>that</i> interesting, but &quot;X is down&quot; does not tickle me intellectually at all, and just wastes a slot on the front page.  The inevitable speculation as to whether it was a bad deploy, a bad configuration update, a DDoS attack, whatever, is just not really interesting, though I guess (IMO unfortunately) enough people here find it interesting.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m here commenting, so somehow I got enticed to click through to the comments, so who knows what that says about me...')
