If billionaires could truly influence markets, we&#x27;d have seen it on the stock market. Instead, we saw the Fed.<p>I am not proposing  to get rid of the government, that leads to anarchy. A government is required to uphold the rule of law and, for markets, to sustain contracts. I would also argue that they should tax externalities. The trouble starts  when governments go beyond that and start regulating and influencing the markets, ending up corrupting them.')
