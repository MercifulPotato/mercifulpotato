Do you want to guess which political party those people tend to associate with?<p>Also, should we be more or less mad about this than someone trying to overturn fair elections like is happening now? Do you want to guess which political party is trying to do that? Do you want to guess if it&#x27;s the same political party which believes in The Market™?<p>So you may not think it matters who people voted for, and that this <i>should</i> be a universal feeling… but that&#x27;s not what reality is. Do you know what other things <i>should</i> have universal consensus?<p>* Taking a pandemic seriously.<p>* Climate change.')
