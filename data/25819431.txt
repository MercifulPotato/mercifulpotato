Bernard was discontent as well. In fact a good chunk of the book is describing his discontent and inability to fit in, despite his status.<p>On top of that, he eventually goes to an island full of such discontent and intellectually curious spersons.<p>However, limited discontent does not equal dystopia, or a lack of utopia. People can be discontent in a utopia as long as it is stable (which it seems to be in BNW).')
