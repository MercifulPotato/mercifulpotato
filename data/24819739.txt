Hopefully you inspire many others here to take that all-important step.<p>Not a native english speaker. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Not sure if you actually meant &quot;eccentric&quot;. I initially thought you were addressing a niche segment of folks who wanted eccentric (slightly strange) content on their blogs just to spice things up. For example content like this - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;utility-pole-surfaces" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;utility-pole-surfaces</a> would fit the description of content I would describe as &quot;eccentric and delightful&quot; content. If that&#x27;s not what you meant, you can re-evaluate that main tagline.<p>Maybe put that line &quot;Get Premium content on a budget&quot; front and center. That&#x27;s a great line!<p>Don&#x27;t worry too much about getting the grammar right. Focus on putting it out in front of many people as possible.
