This leaves full agency in the hands of the driver throughout the application, unlike a drug which is a point-in-time decision which leads to a long chain of events outside the patient’s control. A better example would be something where a manual operator was displaced by an automated one, especially where the operator was a non-professional and the use of the thing is risky and already kills many people. Perhaps there is an analog in trucking or machinery.')
