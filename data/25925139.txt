That may be in the end just depend on execution though.<p>But powershell e.g. prints errors that look like stacktraces (it&#x27;s been a few years i don&#x27;t remember exactly) with type information. And while that may be desirable to some, when using bash i&#x27;m using a UI as a user and not programming and i don&#x27;t want to read a stacktrace. I want an error message in english telling me what&#x27;s wrong.')
