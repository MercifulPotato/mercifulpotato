I&#x27;m saying that, by definition, &quot;functional programming&quot; <i>means</i> that expressions can&#x27;t have side effects; which means that if you are doing &quot;functional programming&quot;, then even if the language you are programming in allows expressions to have side effects, you are not making use of that feature, but are writing your expressions to make sure they <i>don&#x27;t</i> have side effects, since that is what functional programming requires.')
