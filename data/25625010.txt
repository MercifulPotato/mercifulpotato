Companies often don&#x27;t understand the &quot;directionality&quot; of purchasing behavior.<p>For instance, I recently bought a new iPhone directly from Apple, and I bought a case for it on Amazon. Now two months later, Amazon is recommending that I buy an iPhone (...which I bought two months ago from Apple).<p>Buying a case an then waiting two months to buy the actual phone would be a very strange thing to do, but Amazon seems to think I should do this.')
