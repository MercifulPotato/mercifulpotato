One site has simple rules, don&#x27;t fight, put effort into your posts, make sure your posts are interesting to engineers. And they&#x27;re known beforehand. The other just decides halfway through any controversy how they are going to handle it and usually errs on the side of being heavy handed. There&#x27;s no telling beforehand just by reading ToS what Twitter will do.<p>I could probably say anything right now, and as long as I backed it up with data, or just thoughtfulness, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be banned or censored here. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that happen on this site. You can have free discussions here. You could, theoretically, have a free discussion on Twitter if you genuinely were not interested in discussing anything controversial. For most topics of disagreement though, on twitter you have to police your own speech.')
