Or on a bigger project, with other people?<p>The only time I&#x27;d maybe work without feature branches is on a solo project that hasn&#x27;t been launched yet. But even then, probably for a quick prototype. As soon as there&#x27;s a publicly deployed master, it&#x27;s feature branches each and every time. Too much can go wrong ;-)')
