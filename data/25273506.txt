Social Media &quot;friends&quot; and separately a circle of ACTUAL friends.  You would get more access to the data shared by actual friends.<p>The best part of it would be that unlike in a CRM I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep this data up-to-date. My (actual) friends would update their own data, only. Everybody would need to only keep their own data which they want their actual friends to see up-to-date.')
