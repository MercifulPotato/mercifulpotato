If your goal is to give your children unfiltered access to &quot;reality,&quot; parents are entirely unnecessary after birth.<p>Hey I have a different opinion than you. I think you should respect that rather than say parents are unnecessary after birth. That&#x27;s rude.<p>First off think about it logically. Why indeed do parents have to protect children from things they will not only be exposed to as adults but things they will inevitably seek and successfully expose themselves to BEFORE they become adults.<p>Your job as a parent is to protect your kid from actual harm and to teach your kid and feed your kid and guide your kid. Your optional side job is to protect your kid from &quot;reality&quot; that&#x27;s your own personal choice and there are actual scientific observations of the result.<p>The podcast below actually illustrates a scientific study on the subject:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;invisibilia&#x2F;378577902&#x2F;how-to-become-batman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;invisibilia&#x2F;378577902&#x2F;how-to-be...</a><p>A part of it actually follows two blind kids with different parents and different parenting choices.<p>One parent chose to protect his blind kid from reality.<p>The other parent gave the blind kid a bike for a birthday present two weeks after the crazy blind kid lost his two front teeth from running into a wall.<p>Do you want to know the end result of sheltering a blind kid versus encouraging one to explore reality? Watch the podcast to find out. Very interesting if your a parent. Let&#x27;s just say one blind kid (now adult) now walks around the world as if he can see and literally uses echolocation to navigate the world. The other blind kid walks the world as if he&#x27;s a crippled blind man.<p>Here&#x27;s another one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;377517810&#x2F;world-with-no-fear" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;377517810&#x2F;world-with-no-fear</a><p>Also about kids. Talking about how kids today only wander around their homes while kids in the 60s and 70s wander around the whole town by themselves. It&#x27;s attributed to different parenting styles and fear of exposing kids to the real world.<p>Parents in the 70s were much less fearful about protecting kids from reality. Parents today are scared of everything. But the illogical difference here is that from the 70s to now, crime has actually gone down. Your kids today are more safe than ever before but parents are more restrictive and scared than they ever were before.')
