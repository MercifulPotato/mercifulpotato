Laying her death at his feet is an overstatement, but &quot;misogyny, gaslighting and open sexual harassment&quot; isn&#x27;t.<p>Virtue signaling a fictional character created a couple of hundred years ago. Nice! You are the hero we desperately need.<p>&gt; &quot;How now, a rat!&quot; That&#x27;s not madness or heat of the moment:<p>That&#x27;s open for debate. But we are talking about a character who sees his dead father&#x27;s ghost. Also most would chalk it up to the &quot;heat of the moment&quot; as the scene led to the murder. If he saw polonius walking down a corridor, he wouldn&#x27;t have killed him. So, &quot;madness and heat of the moment&quot;?<p>&gt; Hamlet&#x27;s nowhere near the greatest villain<p>He isn&#x27;t a villain at all. He&#x27;s a tragic figure.<p>&gt; but he&#x27;s not a good person, either.<p>He&#x27;s not a bad person either, virtue signaling aside. That&#x27;s what makes him one of the greatest characters in literature.')
