All valid use cases involve a transfer of stored value. (eg. money, securities, collectable stuff)<p>For everything else there&#x27;s a much cheaper option, even for time stamping. Anything involving &quot;proving&quot; something, meaning making some assertion at some time is not a good case. For those look at certificate transparency for a better example of how to handle that. When people say &quot;storage&quot;, I say no. All valid cases which involve that are really about the handling of payment for storage, not the storage itself.')
