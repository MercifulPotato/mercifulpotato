I&#x27;m in a happy monogamist relationship with Apple (h&#x2F;t NYU Prof Scott Galloway).<p>There&#x27;s no question their awesome products are largely due to their keiretsu, monopsony, and other anti-competitive practices. So despite my own joy, I also support breaking up Apple, for the greater good.<p>The same applies to Google&#x27;s offerings. Google Chrome cannot be allowed to operate without oversight. Once a product or service becomes an important pillar in a market, it must be held accountable.<p>2- Fair and impartial courts.<p>Governments make markets. Google (et al) act as sovereign governments running their private markets. This is unacceptable.<p>We all must have the right to negotiate contracts, appeal decisions, and other misc tort. To be adjudicated in an open, fair, impartial courts overseen by professional and accountable judges.<p>In other words, I demand the rule of law.<p>Again using Apple as my example. As a customer, I benefit hugely from Apple&#x27;s App Store, where they vet and curate entries. This is awesome.<p>But Apple must be held accountable for all of their decisions. All participants must have the right to sue for damages. In a fair and impartial court system, independent of Apple&#x27;s total control over the market.<p>Similarly, however Google is administrating the Safe Browsing infrastructure, it must be transparent, accountable, auditable.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m still working on this messaging, phrasing. Criticisms, editing, word smithing much appreciated.')
