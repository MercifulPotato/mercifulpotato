Item(by='kenjackson', descendants=None, kids=[25321992], score=None, time=1607197848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316282, text='&gt; Do you believe she was let go because she was black or female?<p>Possibly.  I do think it is likely that she isn&#x27;t fired if she was a white male.  In my experience, people have more patience with people who are in their &quot;in-group&quot;.  This goes beyond race&#x2F;gender -- just look at sports fandom for an example.  Isn&#x27;t it odd that players for the team you cheer for can do no wrong, but as soon as they&#x27;re traded then they start doing a bunch of bad stuff, even the stuff they did while on your team actually now looks kind of bad.  In the tech industry role&#x2F;team&#x2F;company&#x2F;race&#x2F;gender are probably the biggest in-group delineations.<p>&gt; Do you believe that corporations generally accept ultimatums?<p>Yes they do.  The most common ultimatum is given before employment, where candidates will often give a minimum salary&#x2F;benefits they will take for the job.  I&#x27;ve seen and even been involved in these negotiations where a candidate states that they will not go below this offer, period.  And then we counter with a number below that but provide some other incentive we think may counter it.<p>There are other ultimatums I&#x27;ve seen in the workplace.  For example, &quot;I can&#x27;t work with XYZ or I&#x27;m leaving the team&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen the response come back as, &quot;good luck finding a new team&quot;. It&#x27;s always been to dive deeper into the relationship.<p>In fact I issued an ultimatum many years ago where I said I couldn&#x27;t travel any more due to a personal issue or I&#x27;d have to find new employment.  I guess you could say they yielded to my threat.  I like to think that I was just being honest and they helped find a way that I could still help the team, especially since I only traveled a couple of times per year.<p>&gt; Do you believe the message she sent out would never be a fireable offense?<p>I can imagine it being listed as a firing offense in some handbook.  I can also imagine that others who have written damning emails have gotten away with no more than a slap on the wrist (or less).')
