Many homeless people are insane. Not all, and it is more represented in TV than in real life, but it is still true. I guess it&#x27;s kind of a shame that media doesn&#x27;t represent homeless people better, but tropes do come partially from truth. And come on, a &quot;thinking brain dog&quot; is pretty funny.<p>2. No one wants to tune into a  noir PI show and watch struggles to pay the bills and roommate drama. And don&#x27;t be ridiculous, there are tons of shows that show people living in shitty conditions.<p>3. This point makes me think the article is satire. Seriously? It&#x27;s &quot;classist&quot; to kill stormtroopers since they&#x27;re probably just &quot;low-middle income people making ends meet?&quot;<p>4. I&#x27;m guessing this show is based off the middle ages, where commoners literally did have lice and rotting teeth. Don&#x27;t forsake realism for 21st century ideals of &quot;anti-classism.&quot;<p>5. This has to be a joke too. The reason collective action is &quot;villainized&quot; in those stories is because it went too far. Protesting is fine and whatever, but if you&#x27;re causing destruction then obviously your protest movement should be villainized. It&#x27;s not classist.')
