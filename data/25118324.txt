Are they a good alternative to Dokku? I&#x27;m looking for something to either deploy on a server to host all my sideprojects (though Dokku has been basically perfect so far), or on my home server for various things like Gitea, Nextcloud and random scripts. Is K3s&#x2F;K0s a good idea for either of those?')
