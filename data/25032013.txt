If I only want to trust Apple with my credit card data, right now I can do that and buy any app on the iPhone. In a multi-store world, I might then have to give my card info to other vendors because an app (Fortnite, say) decides to be alt-store exclusive. That would eliminate my choice to have a single trusted payment processor. If that current experience is part of _why_ I might like an iPhone, wouldn’t a multi-store world be limiting my choice since now both major vendors would be providing the same experience in that realm?<p>(I don’t mean to imply that one choice is necessarily more valuable than the other, just that they both exist.)')
