Prior to this, 200 to 240 hours a month was pretty typical and has been for the last 8 years. (I doubt it&#x27;s out of real concern for my health, my workload hasn&#x27;t been reduced).<p>What I&#x27;ve found was that in the times of idleness though I&#x27;ve thought more and more about suicide. The Christmas holidays were some of the first I&#x27;ve had to have an entire week to myself and I spent most of it was spent testing methods for speed, logistics, and discomfort, as well as scouting suitable locations; somewhere that would force an EMS &#x2F; police arrival on site by 10 minutes or so. Updated my will and managed to work out the logistics of transferring all my assets to to remaining family quickly when I finally make the decision to kill myself.<p>Never in my life has it gotten this far before; never really had time to seriously think about until now. I&#x27;d imagine that most people though would probably be more fine with a miserably but living workaholic, then a corpse dead of suicide.<p>As such, could you really say that is working long hours such is really unhealthy? Or such a terrible thing?')
