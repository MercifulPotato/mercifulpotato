Realistically, that&#x27;s not possible, and I wish more people accepted that it&#x27;s not possible. If a result is confirmed in many studies by many authors using many datasets and many methodologies, that&#x27;s how we know we can trust a result. I personally do not put much weight on a single paper&#x27;s results unless there&#x27;s something special about it.<p>The most important thing is that everything about the investigation is open: the methodology (including everything not found in the paper), the programs, the data. It&#x27;s more like posting code for a large project on Github and then new researchers make PRs to correct bugs or extend the program in useful ways.')
