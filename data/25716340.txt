I suppose Python could carve out an implicit behavior where the first or last argument is what gets fed into, but that feels potentially confusing as the calling syntax is now &quot;lying&quot; to you. In JavaScript doing a proper currying style isn&#x27;t too hard because of arrow-syntax, but using python&#x27;s function definition syntax to make a curried function would be hideous (not to mention, the standard library isn&#x27;t done that way). Maybe you could have a &quot;curryify&quot; higher-order function. Or, the final option would be to have an explicit &quot;insert previous value here&quot; syntax as a part of the pipeline syntax, which is something the JS proposal has played with. Makes things more verbose (|&gt; double(#) instead of |&gt; double), but is maximally flexible and minimally confusing.<p>In short: it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than it seems, but I agree that this style makes this type of thing 1000x more readable.')
