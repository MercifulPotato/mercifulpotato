It&#x27;s become much less dangerous but still quite depressing to walk through.<p>I started talking to people living on the streets and my opinion is that the problem can&#x27;t be fixed by throwing money at it. Some people don&#x27;t want to get free treatment, a shelter bed, or transitionary housing because of drug addiction, mental illness, a dog who can&#x27;t accompany them, etc. A lot of them travel to SF <i>because</i> of how much we spend on homeless people, and it used to be pretty common to find people reselling food bank donations on the street for a fraction of grocery-store prices.<p>If it was up to me, I would tell people that they either need to accept help to get back on their feet (I&#x27;ve witnessed the Homeless Outreach Team doing great work) or leave the city. However, espousing a &quot;get tough on homelessness&quot; attitude would be vilified by our political climate, so it won&#x27;t ever be up to me.')
