For many community banks, a combination of increased competition from big banks and fintechs, steep regulatory costs and out-dated core banking technology is making it nearly impossible to offer competitive products and services to their customers.<p>Neocova is building a suite of tools designed to help these institutions manage operations more efficiently. This includes products that allow them to streamline compliance requirements and make sense of their data to surface customer insights.<p>We are currently hiring for Frontend and Backend Engineer roles with 2-5 years of experience. Our headquarters are in St. Louis but we have a remote workforce concentrated in New York, Austin, Portland, Kansas City and Central Florida.<p>The roles can work remotely anywhere in the U.S. We are particularly interested in candidates with experience in React, Node.js, Express, Docker, pubsub and queue systems such as Redis, serverless functions, distributed computing systems, and OpenAPI &#x2F; Swagger.<p>Interested applicants can apply via the links below:<p>Backend Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobapply.page.link&#x2F;npSM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobapply.page.link&#x2F;npSM</a><p>Frontend Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobapply.page.link&#x2F;s9cZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobapply.page.link&#x2F;s9cZ</a>')
