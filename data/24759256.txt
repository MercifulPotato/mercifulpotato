Granted, i&#x27;m definitely no network admin, but i&#x27;m just used to the days when i&#x27;d hook up a simple Router behind a Modem and get basic firewall, wifi, etc features with a moderately complex and useful admin interface out of the box.<p>With Ubiquiti i had <i>no clue</i> what i wanted or where i should go. There were all these tradeoffs <i>(Cloud vs not)</i> where i didn&#x27;t even understand the context for making a decision.<p>Coming from a simple <i>(old)</i> TP-Link router next to me, the idea of needing some complex setup or an easy &quot;cloud&quot; option both seem bizarre. It&#x27;s a router.. what is Unifi offering that changes everything so much?<p>I still plan on eventually going Unifi since all my coworkers recommend it with glowing praise - but i keep kicking that can because every time i open their page it sounds like some big project. I just wanted a replacement Router + ~4-8ports + wifi haha. I probably would have already purchased something from Uniquiti if i had any clue what to buy from them.')
