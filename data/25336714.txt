It&#x27;s disgusting.<p>Like around here, the building code in one city requires a certain blower door score to pass.  But doesn&#x27;t require blower door testing if you say you followed certain &quot;sufficient&quot; practices.  There&#x27;s no way most of these houses would achieve a sufficient blower door test score, but they all &quot;comply with code&quot;.')
