I remembered it, but not its name, when I read the intro to this blog post and my question was going to be if youâ€™d tried it and what you thought of it but then a couple of paragraphs further into the blog post I learned that you are the author of Lunatic :P<p>But instead I would like to ask about the future of Lunatic. What is you vision for it? Like, is it a hobby project that you are doing for fun or is it an endeavor that you intend for to be powering big systems in production?<p>Furthermore, how will you fund the development of Lunatic? And where will other contributors come from? Will they be people scratching their own itches only or will you hire people to work on it with a common roadmap?')
