It&#x27;s so generic and lacking of any investigation or insight; I could copypaste this as a reply to any software project post on HN and it could vaguely apply in the same way (but not specifically apply).<p>Yes. And that is _exactly_ the point. These anti-bloat libraries either die or become the enemy they set out to defeat. We&#x27;ve been to this rodeo before, yes?<p>Nothing wrong with that per se. But we gain nothing by pretending this cycle doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Perhaps a smarter approach would be: I&#x27;ve replicated 80% of X&#x27;s features with 20% of the weight. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s missing.<p>Then if Library X puts on weight, so can you, if you want. But feather weight in and of itself is  not a benefit per se (especially when it&#x27;s likely temporary). It&#x27;s a feature. And too often we all gets sucked into the feature trap because we forget it&#x27;s ultimately about benefits.')
