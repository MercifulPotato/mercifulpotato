The setup in the first book is pretty engaging, the trisolarians are compelling antagonists, and i loved the power plays resulting from Dark Forest theory...<p>But the storytelling just falls flat in books 2 and 3, with the  overlong story-within-a-story and the needless romance plot. The... relativistic stuff (lets call it that to avoid spoilers) at the end didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all, and just felt tacked on to wrap up storylines i didnt care about in the first place.<p>Could have been 50% shorter imo.')
