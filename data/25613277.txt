All the opensource activity around the watch is also great. The biggest drawback to me is only 64k of ram. Thats a Commodore64&#x27;s worth of ram. The 240x240 screen is 57kbytes, it must have its own display ram.<p>Also NordicSemi never seemed to be particularly opensource friendly. I&#x27;m hoping for a future RISCV edition of this watch with more ram.')
