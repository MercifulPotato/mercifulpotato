DD and other app&#x27;s value is removing the friction of ordering and paying. Of all the participants in the supply chain- farmer, cook, business owner, delivery guy- the ordering app (tech) took the most outsized piece of the pie.<p>To be fair though, not all tech is similar. I don&#x27;t think people mind Amzn charging the seller 5-15% and paying the delivery guys whatever it takes. I hope food delivery apps become more reasonably priced- or then maybe Amzn comes after their margin!')
