But both are big capital investments, so you <i>could</i> argue you&#x27;re &quot;throwing away&quot; electricity you could&#x27;ve generated with that natural gas plant by not running it all the time.<p>Anyway, just my little contribution to how we think about curtailment. If you have a good grid connection and optimal storage, then you don&#x27;t end up needing that much curtailment (say 30%), although some is basically always optimal. See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;model.energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;model.energy</a><p>Oh, also, under-sizing the inverter relative to the solar array DC capacity is not even close to a one-to-one curtailment example. The solar <i>rarely</i> makes its peak power rating, so undersizing the inverter by 25% means almost no curtailment in the real world. Effectively, you&#x27;re increasing the AC capacity factor and it almost perfectly compensates (until you get very high ratios, but even then the amount actually curtailed is small). This has a bigger impact in places that have more cloudy or overcast weather. If you install more solar panels (which are a much smaller part of the total cost of the project than they used to be), you can compensate for not having as much sun without much increase in cost.')
