Item(by='Tehchops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603675938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891730, text='&gt;That is a really simplistic take IMO<p>Yes and it also comes across that the comment author hasn&#x27;t spent much time trying to hire for &quot;engineering&quot; roles.<p>If it only it were so easy to throw up a post for $engineeringRole promising some multiple of six-figures and expecting a deluge of competent, qualified people to show up.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for one of $FAANGco, and helped run multiple hiring loops. The roles weren&#x27;t quite in the 500k vicinity, but they were a fair bit more than 100k.<p>Finding competent, qualified, <i>honest</i> people amongst a sea of resumes was a non-trivial investment.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about finding some 10x&#x27;er who can run circles around leetcode problems and tell me the most efficient way to fill a 737 with ping pong balls flying upside down on the planet Mars.<p>I&#x27;m talking about people who actually understood and had experience with the technologies they had listed on their resume. People who had baseline competency with the basic skills required to merely <i>survive</i> at the job. I generally consider myself a pragmatist, and would allow some variance in detail if they communicated an overall &quot;big-picture&quot; understanding.<p>Nope. People who had listed &quot;fluent with Linux&quot; who didn&#x27;t know basic directory structure. People who listed years with a programming language that couldn&#x27;t write a for loop. People who explicitly described a multi-technology cloud-stack project they worked on, only to say in the interview that the project was entirely handled by a different department.<p>I estimate my success rate at this stage was maybe 10% in finding solid people.<p>Slide the pay scale up to 500k? An entirely different set of problems. People that can ask for 500k up front with a straight face know <i>exactly why</i> they can ask for 500k up front with a straight face, and so does everyone else who wants to hire them.<p>If you make all jobs, regardless of technology&#x2F;competency&#x2F;seniority pay 500k, then you&#x27;ve got a pretty sizable inflationary problem anyways. Either the really skilled people now will ask for 1 million, or the skillset has become commoditized, and the talent is moving to a problem domain that is more lucrative.')
