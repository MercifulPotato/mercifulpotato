I think in the end, nobody knows what situation people bought into exactly and how fast this will collapse.<p>People who got in late, risk not getting off in time, as GME is totally overvalued right now. There will be causalities from desperate, poor folks going all in for a lack of understanding their risk and believing the WSB hype. I don&#x27;t blame them for being &quot;stupid&quot;, as a few thousand bucks plus, can change your life, if you&#x27;re poor; I blame the ignorant people on WSB not educating about the <i>very real</i> risks involved. Tho, it&#x27;s probably a good time for everyone learning how all this works and paying 100$-500$ risk for this education.')
