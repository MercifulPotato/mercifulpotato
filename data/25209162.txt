Item(by='brian_cunnie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606312103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207721, text='&gt; The 2013 mac pro was a mess.<p>I appreciate that the 2013 mac pro wasn&#x27;t for you, but it was perfect for me: small but powerful. Firstly: RAM. I was able to install 64 GiB on it, which enabled me to run Cloud Foundry on ESXi on Virtual Workstation on macOS. Non-Xeon chipsets maxed-out at (IIRC) 16 GiB and then later 32 GiBâ€”not enough.<p>Secondly, size &amp; esthetics: it fits on my very small console table that I use as a desk. I have a modest apartment in San Francisco, and my living room is my office, and although I had a mini-tower in my living room, I didn&#x27;t like the looks.<p>Third, expandability: I was able to upgrade the RAM to 64 GiB, the SSD to 1 TB. I was able to upgrade the monitor to 4k. It has 6 Thunderbolt connections.<p>My biggest surprise was how long it has lasted: I typically rollover my laptops every year or so, but this desktop? It&#x27;s been able to do everything I&#x27;ve needed it to do for the last 7 years, so I continue to use it.<p>[edited for grammar]')
