If I am unable&#x2F;unwilling to moderate the comment section of a blog I host then maybe I should&#x27;t have one. I do not believe a completely open free-speech comment section is a requirement of a good or successful blog. Also, there is a business opportunity for those who want comment sections to pay for moderation services.<p>&gt; I must inform you that you are very, very wrong.<p>This kind of patronizing is neither useful nor conducive to mature discussion. Aggregate user-generated-content sites aren&#x27;t some kind of holy thing, forums, comment sections or otherwise. I want people to consider the fact that we may all be fine without them at all. Nothing stops people from posting whatever content they want on their own site. It just discourages aggregation of other people&#x27;s content.')
