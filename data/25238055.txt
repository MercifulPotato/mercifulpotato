I recall one printer wanting me to have a particular app.  Or, now, one expected to have internet access, which I don&#x27;t have at home other than my phone connection right now.<p>That said, I would still count this as having nice things.  When we got rid of our ancient printer and bought a current one, it does work more often.  Ironically, better from Linux, as I don&#x27;t have to install drivers; because of course it came with a windows disk that has installed some crap on that computer.<p>So, try this with what you could find at Goodwill some day.  Or work with a budget where you stay trying to get refills to work.')
