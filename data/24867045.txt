You end up having to trade off permanent positions against students.  But in some countries, including a lot of EU countries, training students is a hidden way to prevent unemployment.  And would you say that denying willing people a useful education just for less competition for faculty jobs is the ideal outcome?  What would the best choice be?  Not clear.<p>When a pie isn&#x27;t increasing, but the number of people is, things get uncomfortable.')
