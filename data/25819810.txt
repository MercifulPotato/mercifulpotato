Bitcoin in the same span did +286%.<p>My point was that government-issued currency fluctuates in value, sometimes quite significantly. This underscores the fact currency is a speculative asset.<p>&gt; What’s the point of Bitcoin then? Because at the level of transactions Bitcoin can handle, we would have a bunch of central bank-like entities trading Bitcoin between themselves and a shit ton of intermediaries.<p>Central banks wouldn&#x27;t be able to debase their bitcoin via inflation, and money printing for political ends would grind to a halt. Meanwhile, the currency unit BTC would work in every country. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a win over the status quo.<p>&gt; That is not in any way a given. With all this intermediaries it’s not that hard to create “money out of thin air” through various schemes and leverage.<p>If those schemes inflated the BTC supply in the slightest, they&#x27;d instantly fork off the network. If banks decide to issue cash backed by BTC, it would trade at a discount compared to BTC proper given the inherent lack of assurances. And it would be competing against myriad L2 blockchain protocols designed to enhance transactional capacity.<p>&gt; If you don’t interface with the network directly, your supposed guarantees go out the window, fast. And the global network today can’t possibly handle the daily interactions in any big city.<p>I don&#x27;t have an issue with major credit card companies giving out BTC-denominated credit lines. IMO BTC is bound to become global reserve currency in any future where government issued ecurrency comes into the foray, and the private banking sector is bound to issue cash and credit lines backed by BTC.')
