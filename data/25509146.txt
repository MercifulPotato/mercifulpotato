Wild theories are effortless to construct since they can be devote of facts, and variants are also effortless to create. Refuting requires gathering facts and evidence. Additionally presenting them in a way that&#x27;s relatively easy to digest for the audience is also difficult.<p>Take the recent US election for example. Very effortless to claim fraud and stolen election; just a couple of tweets in fact. Debunking them rather more difficult. Then there are the more specific claims, such as:<p>- China and Venezuela worked together to do this\n- Voting machines flipped votes\n- There were vote dumps at midnight\n- Dead people voted for Biden<p>All very easy claims to make, all rather more difficult to debunk sufficiently. Then, when one is debunked, another one easily pops up. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think it&#x27;s well worth the effort and we should fight disinformation, but effort it does take.')
