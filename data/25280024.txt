This might not be an issue if you&#x27;re already a dual professional household earning $200k+ or something where you&#x27;re deciding between $600k vs $1M houses, but more for whether or not a $80k income family should stretch and buy a $400k house or stick to a $300k house.<p>(numbers aren&#x27;t accurate, just trying to show that there exists a tier of society that does have to make those tough choices between living comfortably within their means and offering their kids a meaningfully higher probability of future advancement).<p>I used to meet people in the NYC area who commuted 1+ hour each way everyday to work 8AM to 6PM at least, they were all doing it so their kids go to the best school district they could afford.  I felt sad for them since it basically meant very little time with the kids during the weekdays, no gym, no visiting friends&#x2F;family, cooking, but they all did it.')
