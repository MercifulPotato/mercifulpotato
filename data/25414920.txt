I only read my first le Carré about three years ago: The Spy Who Came in From The Cold. A great book and I saw why he was so highly rated. Since then I&#x27;ve read a lot of them and came to see, once again, how there are good writers and GREAT writers; le Carré in the latter category. His set pieces and dialog are mesmerising. I&#x27;m glad to still have many books of his to read but they&#x27;ll always be ones I keep and can return to.')
