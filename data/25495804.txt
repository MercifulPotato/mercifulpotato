KDE gave you the full DE experience, but there was that pesky Qt license.  GNOME was full GPL&#x2F;LGPL and it felt like it was built to attract power users.  Skins were at the height of their popularity (remember Winamp?), and GNOME gave users an easy way to customize everything without having to muck with some arcane config file format.  Every release felt closer to some platonic ideal of a fully customizable yet easy-to-use DE.<p>Then came the iPhone, and suddenly the world went hyper-modern and hyper-minimal.  Restaurants names like &quot;The Heavenly Chicken&quot; are now old-fashioned; today the same restaurant is simply &quot;chicken&quot;.  GNOME was also affected by this cultural shift, and as you point out, ended up abandoning its core qualities.<p>I believe that hyper-modernism, like other movements, is just a fad, and in a few years we will &quot;rediscover&quot; modding.  Everything will be customizable, from the color of your keyboard to the genes that control your eye color.  Who knows, we might even shake the dust off the blink tag.')
