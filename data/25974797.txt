There are a number of other social phenomena - like lying, exaggeration, overconfidence, risk-taking, perceptual bias, etc. - where individuals espouse views that are <i>wrong</i> because being <i>wrong</i> is more effective (in the sense of better social status or reproductive success) than being correct.  Depression is likely the inverse of that: depressed people see the world accurately, but all of the mechanisms biasing toward survival involve distorting our perception of the world.')
