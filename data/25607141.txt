It wasn&#x27;t always this way. Back in the 80s when I first got into tech it was a lot more conversational and in the spirit of &quot;we really need help, what can you do for us?&quot;.<p>I think something more akin to a thesis defense would be better than what we&#x27;re doing now. Prior to the interview have the candidate write up a description of a project they worked on and particularly liked along with a set of slides. Have the candidate send this presentation to the main interviewer who will distribute it to all of the interviewers. The interview then becomes a presentation where interviewers can ask questions about the presentation. I&#x27;ve seen this done in industry, but it was only when we interviewed folks who were PhDs coming from academia - I don&#x27;t see why we couldn&#x27;t do this for all kinds of candidates, not just those coming from academia.')
