Old growth gets old, like thousands of years old because typically the disturbance types would be windfall and infrequent wildfires from lightning.<p>These events would cause patches where giant trees fall and crush neighbour trees, fires burn out patches and new growth starts. This means throughout a natural forest you&#x27;ll get patches with different ages.<p>This creates the ideal situation for wildlife habitat and other things. New growth forest, not planted in rows as other commenters mentioned, tends to also have a lot of shrubs and underbrush that get killed off in old growth forests. These types of canopies are great habitat for birds and such, they provide forage for deer and bears. While having surviving, intact old growth stands in the forests provides different kinds of habitat. It&#x27;s also extremely nutrient rich from advanced fungal colonies and hundreds of years of built up decomposing material.<p>These nutrients are passed from these older trees along mycelium networks to the younger trees and so on.<p>A healthy ecosystem in general will have a mix of succession stages in a given area. This provides the maximum benefit to life in those ecosystems.')
