If you mistake it for a cryptographic security product you are making a significant mistake.  The fact that is uses cryptographic techniques internally just means that it isn&#x27;t grossly incompetently constructed, but that doesn&#x27;t make it achieve any particularly strong notion of security against any particular attack model.<p>I strongly recommend people us it (at least on devices which are already compromised by mystery meat binary updates that could be remotely backdoored at any time)... just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to provide you with substantial security against active attackers (much less state level attackers or from Signal themselves).')
