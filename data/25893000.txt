Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611503685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892511, text='&gt; I envision even more inequality as a result of brexit<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible but since inequality has risen since 1979[1], which correlates rather well with the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU it might be hard to convince Brexit voters that they&#x27;ve made a mistake on that, especially at this early stage. I&#x27;m sure someone will be tempted to pipe up with &quot;evil Tories!&quot; or &quot;Thatcher&quot; but they&#x27;ll have to contend with all the quotes from staunch Labour politicians against the EU (in whatever guise it was in at the time), let alone explaining how joining the project coincided with the slow down of the post war narrowing of inequality and did nothing to stop it increasing later.<p>&gt; I just don&#x27;t see it playing out in any way that would result in an objectively better quality of life for working people<p>Don&#x27;t forget the sovereignty bit, one of the reasons the remain argument failed to resonate with so many was because it focused purely on economics (partly because of the weakness of that for remainers, partly because it reflects interests). Given what you say, that inequality continues to rise <i>just as it was previously</i> then to regain sovereignty will be a big win.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equalitytrust.org.uk&#x2F;how-has-inequality-changed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equalitytrust.org.uk&#x2F;how-has-inequality-changed</a>')
