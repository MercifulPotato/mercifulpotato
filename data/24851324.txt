I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d note it is an article, it feels like there&#x27;s no direction or point to this compilation of statements. If this is to advertise a company, I&#x27;d hope for a little bit of direction and organization to it -- especially if it&#x27;s being billed as written by a Python and ML instructor.')
