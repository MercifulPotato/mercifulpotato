It&#x27;s all made up&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>You will never, ever see the water level rise in a way that is directly visible. The effect is more frequent flooding.<p>I personally, have noticed a change in the climate. When I was a child, the river used to freeze in the winter and there would be metres of snow. These day the city government still hires snow clearers every winter, but they never have anything to do. Meanwhile, the summers are hotter and drier than ever. A couple of years a ago I went sunbathing in October!<p>Probably the best way of demonstrating this is to see the former arctic permafrost with you own eyes. I know people who have done this and they came away amazed. However, if you will not accept any 3rd party data as evidence this becomes quite difficult as you would have had to go there a few years ago to see the &#x27;before&#x27; state.')
