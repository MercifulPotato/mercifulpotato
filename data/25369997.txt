It&#x27;s so cool to see the engines looking sideways like a chameleon.<p>Raises a question: I suppose they fired 2&#x2F;3 engines not because of a failure, but because 3 engines would produce too much thrust.<p>That does mean that in a high stakes situation (landing) you can&#x27;t afford to lose an engine. I wonder if there&#x27;s any margin there for lighting the third engine in case of engine failure.')
