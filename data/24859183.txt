That&#x27;s especially bad when X vanishes and Y increases. (Here, X = people watching on phones, Y = people watching at home.)<p>To be &quot;not interested&quot; in Y is to be not interested in money.<p>Now, to pre-empt an obvious reply: yes, sometimes you do want to turn down easy money from a segment Y. But that&#x27;s primarily when you&#x27;re promoting a niche luxury product, where usage by Y will hurt your branding long-term. It&#x27;s not applicable to a product that deliberately attempts (and needs) to be mass-market, especially when it&#x27;s targeting transit users and people who have to idly wait.')
