Eventually the chain reaches some stationary distribution but in the meantime there will be some shift in the distribution potentially. Seems like you could model the chain to do some test of where the distribution shifts, if at all.<p>I imagine this is in the literature. Giving it a brief look I can&#x27;t find anything but I haven&#x27;t looked hard enough.')
