Item(by='rhn_mk1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608978303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541329, text='It&#x27;s disappointing how rigid society can be: it&#x27;s my way or the highway.<p>When someone doesn&#x27;t have a particular, not inherently required characteristic to access something, there should be a series of fallbacks, but all too often this just excludes people.<p>This can be seen in all areas of life, in different severities:<p>- the entire topic of accessibility is about letting people make use of the abilities they have despite the ones they don&#x27;t have. Not having functional legs doesn&#x27;t have to prevent people from filing a document in the office.<p>- technology which once was optional but never essential becomes required with time. Booking a doctor&#x27;s visit over the phone only, buying goods over the internet only, filing taxes only with a computer, accessing a bank account only with an Android program. All that with no fallback to the post office or a personal visit.<p>- the requirement to pass payments through an intermediary is getting more common. Gone are the days of paying bills or getting salary directly at the office, and the sphere of buying at the point of sale is losing the cash fallback, if stories from Asia are to be believed.<p>None of the technological changes are bad as options, but when they become the only choices, they work to disenfranchise people, especially ones related to banking and travel freedom. Debit&#x2F;credit cards are not accessible to a huge chunk of the world&#x27;s population, and even in Europe, getting a bank account as an immigrant can be hard.<p>Another thing that strikes me in the article is calling the condition &quot;disease&quot;, without providing any evidence that it has any negative health impact. On the other hand, it matches the definition of disability as something the society imposes [0]. That would make this a paradoxical case of someone not impaired but disabled.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aeon.co&#x2F;essays&#x2F;what-does-it-mean-to-consider-yourself-a-disabled-person" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aeon.co&#x2F;essays&#x2F;what-does-it-mean-to-consider-yoursel...</a>')
