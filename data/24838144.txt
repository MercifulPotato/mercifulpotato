Here&#x27;s one article though: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;22&#x2F;googles-remarkably-close-relationship-with-the-obama-white-house-in-two-charts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;22&#x2F;googles-remarkably-close...</a><p>But basically, a massive number of Google employees were installed in high-level positions of the Obama administration, and a lot of Obama administration folks got great jobs at Google. Obama installed a professor who wrote studies about how Google shouldn&#x27;t face antitrust scrutiny (who was paid by Google to do so) as the FTC Commissioner (Joshua Wright, who is now a lawyer at Google&#x27;s preferred law firm... he went from Google shill to government official and now back to Google work), and an FTC case against Google where staffers recommended litigation inexplicably got shoved under the rug.<p>Then you&#x27;d see things like a former Googler in Obama&#x27;s administration announce an initiative to budget billions of taxpayer dollars to buy computers for schoolchildren... unshockingly, these were intended to be Chromebooks, which get kids started early as Google account holders. (I believe Congress ended up rejecting this particular budgetary line item, or reducing it significantly.)')
