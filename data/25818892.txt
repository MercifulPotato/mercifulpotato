Compared to another comment, that&#x27;s _all_ it means to me when applied nowadays. The mainstream reception of the threat of witchcraft is what&#x27;s changed. You might see parallels with (theoretical) homosexual conversion in parts of the US, I suppose.<p>Speculating on historical drivers: coercive confession existed then as it does now. Some law-enforcement officers&#x27; careers depended on confessions. After 35,000 to 100,000 executions I bet the technique was pretty smooth.')
