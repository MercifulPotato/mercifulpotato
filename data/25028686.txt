From what I was able to learn, the CCF and MLV block road &amp; tire noise, but the butyl sound deadener products are still important to stop the sheet metal from vibrating and to stop resonance in the door cavity &amp; trunk.<p>25-50% coverage with butyl directly on the sheet metal is enough, since it doesn&#x27;t block sound, just absorbs vibrations. If you tap your doors or trunk lid, or if you swing the door shut, the sheet metal will have a tinny hollow sound, but after butyl all of those become more of a solid &#x27;thunk.&#x27;<p>Overall, the butyl stops the sheet metal from making its own noise and from amplifying the tire vibrations; then the entire surface needs to get 100% unbroken coverage of the CCF&#x2F;MLV to block all types of noise from entering.<p>Demonstration: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_ur_Rhi5js8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_ur_Rhi5js8</a>')
