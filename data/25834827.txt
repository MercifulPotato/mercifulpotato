Then a &quot;jq&quot; like utility would have more value. Having it co-exist with the current &quot;just a bunch of text&quot; isn&#x27;t ideal though, as you&#x27;d be stuck with something clunky like adding a switch to every command.  Or an environment variable that changes everything. Or a &quot;j-&quot; version of each.')
