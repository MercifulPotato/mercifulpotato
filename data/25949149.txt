I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just in Firefox, but I would recommend that you be a little more aggressive with the whitespace in the books.<p>I&#x27;ve found that iBooks has a great display stylesheet for epub and what makes it great is the ratio of text size to whitespace. It also limits how wide text can get - no need to spread it across the whole page. You could probably double the size of your margins to improve this.<p>I am also not sure if Firefox is causing this, but inter-line distances do not seem to be consistent and that is very distracting as a reader.<p>In both browsers the next&#x2F;prev page arrows are also weirdly off-center.')
