Told you (my other account I put a long noprocrast on). And if you did, who&#x27;s fault is that? You want to blame someone but yourself? That&#x27;s your responsibility, not mine, of course, because what you think and react is up to you, not me. You could have learned something, but you weren&#x27;t open to it. You pretended everything I said was wrong, because it wasn&#x27;t what you said, and didn&#x27;t conform to your view.<p><i>When you missed your opportunities to learn, because you wanted to look &quot;right&quot; instead:</i><p>1.<p>You: no one hunts at night, no blue light.\nMe: paper says night blue light.\n<i>Not you</i>: Ok, you&#x27;re right, blue light.<p>2.<p>Actually you: No solo human night hunters!\nMe: packs.\n<i>Not you</i>: You&#x27;re right, packs. But night?<p>3.<p>Actually you: NO evidence for night!\nMe: Night makes sense, here&#x27;s examples. But consider...No &quot;evidence&quot; for anything, neither of us know, we&#x27;re just thinking about it.\nNot you: OK, you&#x27;re right, night makes sense, and btw, you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;ve offered no evidence either. Let&#x27;s keep thinking<p>4.<p>Actually you: Still no evidence!<p>So the pattern seems to be, when you&#x27;ve been outdone in thinking, you retreat into a cave crying for more &quot;evidence&quot; when that was never the currency you dealt with in the first place, and you were content to base your existing views on zero evidence, but not content to hear views of others without evidence. What can explain that except a form or arrogance, where your view is someone necessarily &quot;more true&quot; than someone else&#x27;s? Or a form of fear, where you are unable to admit that someone knows something you don&#x27;t? (I find this to be common in engineers perhaps because their wallet size is tied to their percieved &quot;knowledge size&quot; ~~ but I always wonder, how can knowledge get bigger if you cannot say, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, thanks for teaching me&quot;)<p>You had at least 3 places you could have learned something, and explored the topic together, but instead of doing that...you just kept saying, basically, &quot;What you say is wrong, I&#x27;m right&quot;.<p>Maybe you just don&#x27;t trust yourself to think yourself to some new perspective, you need someone else (with &quot;authority&quot; or &quot;evidence&quot;) to tell you, &#x27;this has been &quot;proved&quot;, now you can &quot;trust&quot; it.&#x27; Or maybe you were just not willing to admit you didn&#x27;t know and choose to become open to learning something from someone else...because...you think you&#x27;re smarter than or more experienced than everyone so you couldn&#x27;t learn from them, as that would challenge your precious belief of your superiority? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what you &quot;know&quot; that makes you &quot;superior&quot; or not, I think it&#x27;s your ability to &quot;know&quot;, to be open, and to think. It&#x27;s possible we just have different ideas of that, and each of us is pursuing our own idea of the best thing to do. I get you want evidence, (who doesn&#x27;t) but it&#x27;s disingenuous to demand of others that when you don&#x27;t even demand that of yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t want to think you&#x27;re one of those irretrievably arrogant people who can never ever admit they were wrong, but I&#x27;ve often been optimistically biased towards seeing a fantasy of the good in people long past it should have been evident to me that the reality of them didn&#x27;t live up to that. Maybe you really are like that. But I prefer to think it&#x27;s simply a misunderstanding, and you were not understanding things or having a bad day or something.<p>So I wish you have a better 2021! Make it great :p ;) xx')
