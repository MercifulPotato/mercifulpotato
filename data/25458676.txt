I&#x27;m not gonna skip my dinner for that.<p>I hope this illustrates that, when death is involved, everything else becomes secondary, and we prioritize not death over everything.<p>So, it&#x27;s a bad analogy to use in Timnit&#x27;s situation where she will quit if she doesn&#x27;t get to see the identities of peer reviewers. This situation is not life and death.')
