Etebase already utilities to maintain consistency, so this can be done safely.<p>This question, and ones like it, are exactly why we created Etebase. Building encrypted applications is fundamentally different and comes with a lot of challenges. We plan on continue building all of the tools needed to develop using this different paradigm.')
