Legacy code.<p>Required very precise timing.  Something Basic didn’t have.<p>So we used for loops.<p>Need a 2ms loop. 5,000 iterations. Etc.<p>Worked fine for years, until we couldn’t order the same cpus.  Then machine ran way to fast.<p>So we set it up so that at boot time, it would calibrate how many loops equaled various milliseconds.   Problem solved.<p>Was a really weird early job.')
