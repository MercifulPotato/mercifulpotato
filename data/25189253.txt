Forth definitions always appear in &quot;reading order&quot;- words are declared before they are used- but the very first example on the Play home page inverts this convention. It feels rather like reading pig-latin, or perhaps ML wearing a Forth-skin-suit.<p>Forth&#x27;s hybrid compiled&#x2F;interpreted nature is at the heart of its expressiveness; so far as I can tell, this is entirely absent from Play. How would I define a word like &quot;when:&quot;, &quot;def:&quot;, or &quot;[&quot;?<p>In my opinion it would be clearer and more accurate to describe Play as simply a concatenative functional language.')
