The laptop shows up at this repair shop in early 2019, and the shop owner &quot;declared that because he is legally blind, he could not identify the person who brought it in&quot;.<p>Supposedly, this blind shop owner then gains access to the computer (doesn&#x27;t say how, was it unprotected?) and it contains lewd videos of Hunter (again, blind shop owner). So he copies the drive (which is likely illegal in Delaware) and then he reached out to the FBI, or the FBI reached out to him, or someone else reached out to the shop owner (i.e. Rudy) and told him to reach out to the FBI.  We don&#x27;t really know because they can&#x27;t get their story straight on that one.<p>Months later, and the FBI still hasn&#x27;t announced an investigation, so they go to Plan B and Rudy hands the (likely illegally ) copied hard drive over to the NY Post.<p>Even if you believe their story, the shop owner likely broke some laws by copying and handing over PII to NY Post. But I am personally more inclined to believe that either the laptop was planted by someone, or that shop owner (who is an avid Trump supporter) was in on the ruse, and that the laptop&#x2F;source material was not accidentally left by Hunter.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailykos.com&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;1986703&#x2F;-Dezinformatsiya-Rudy-Giuliani-and-Rupert-Murdoch-are-trying-to-con-America-and-failing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailykos.com&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;1986703&#x2F;-Dezinfo...</a>')
