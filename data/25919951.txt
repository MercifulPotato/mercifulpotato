She had a PhD when I started there, so I called her &quot;Doctor,&quot; but he didn&#x27;t, so I called him &quot;Steve.&quot; Well, Steve later got his PhD, so I was incredibly confused at that point.<p>We collectively resolved the dilemma by all agreeing to be on a first name basis. Now that I&#x27;ve spent significant time in industry and have worked with more people with PhDs than were in my department in grad school, I&#x27;ve come to realize I was being a little bit silly.  In my experience, at least once you get to the graduate level, anybody who insists on being called &quot;doctor&quot; seems a little full of it to me.  That said, I still think it&#x27;s appropriate for undergrads to call their professors &quot;doctor,&quot; when applicable, and I was always careful to do so whenever I was in the presence of any undergrads.')
