If-then implies causality (&quot;If my pants are dirty, then they need to be cleaned&quot;)<p>The big difference I see is with &#x27;OR&#x27; in programing the options are exclusive. Ex: &quot;Are you tired or hungry&quot; The answer is yes if you are tired. Yes if you are hungry, Yes if you are both. No if you are neither. This is natural English.  In programming if you are both. The answer is No.(False)')
