Here&#x27;s a comment from an Indian that I found on Reddit:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m Indian and the stupidity in these threads is palpable. Jesus<p>Firstly, the article cited by OP is an extremely clickbait and dishonest article<p>To clarify -- NO. There were NOT a quarter billion people marching down the streets.<p>The gist of the article is basically that there was a holiday strike organised by organised labor officials that simply AFFECTED 250 million people. And it essentially tries to imply that 250 million total workforce apparently participated in rebelious strike by the virtue of simply following the nation-wide holiday. Which is very nonseniscal<p>For context, the central government itself declared the strikes. And nation-wide and state-wide strikes have always been very common in India and happen at least 2-3 times every year and is fully supported by the government machinery and the constitution. Unlike the US, India does have some labor movement, but this doesn&#x27;t mean every single one of the people partaking in it are anti-government left-wing workers lmao<p>In reality, this was not even at the centre of the news cycle in india and most people don&#x27;t even know or care about the left-wing protests which is in the thousands (not hundreds of millions)<p>Despite what one would like to believe, the BJP continues to have a majority broad-based support overall.<p>State-wise though, it&#x27;s a different story. just like America, India has a North-South dichotomy<p>Every single state in the South is non-BJP and ruled by centre-left parties, with the exception of my state of Karnataka (which was headed by a center-left party until 2019 but was flipped to the right by the BJP) and Kerala, which is the only remaining leftist stronghold and ruled by the &#x27;Communist party of India - Marxist&#x27; (CPI-M). And almost every single state in the north is pro-BJP<p>Intrestingly enough though, Kerala (the communist state), is the most developed as per human development indices (almost 100% literacy rate, highest gdp per capita, &gt;1 Male-Female sex ratio, lowest child mortality, highest healthcare coverage etc). It unfortunately has had the highest unemployement for any state in the country.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;VaushV&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k3q7hi&#x2F;250_million_indian_workers_are_on_strike_in&#x2F;ge8d4xx&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;VaushV&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k3q7hi&#x2F;250_million_...</a>')
