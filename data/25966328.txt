You can use the alternatives 99% of the time and get what you&#x27;re looking for. Google itself is not a perfect algorithm. It&#x27;s exploitable, censorable, etc. It doesn&#x27;t always find what you&#x27;re looking for. You shouldn&#x27;t ever limit yourself to a single search engine, honestly.<p>I think YouTube is a far stickier service than Google Search, just because it&#x27;s acted as an informal video archive of the past 15 years of internet video history. But I fully recognize the risks with this monopoly structure in place and have started to embrace alternatives like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumble.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumble.com&#x2F;</a>. It&#x27;s time to disentangle from monopolies. Take your digital sovereignty back.')
