Most of the meals I make are vegetarian, some vegan, and I eat some chicken and pork. I do like a cheeseburger every now and then too.  My main protein sources are beans and eggs.  I eat a lot of pinto beans.  Great northern&#x2F;white beans are good as well.  Here are some recipe ideas:<p>Pinto Beans:\n- Chili\n- Refried Beans\n- Cajun Style Baked Beans\n- Gumbo with pinto beans \n- Tortilla soup with chicken and pinto beans\n- Peas and rice (kidney beans are used, typically)<p>White Beans:\n- Vegetable soup with white beans\n- Spinach&#x2F;Collards with white beans\n- White bean hummus<p>Chick peas:\n- Mushroom loaf w&#x2F; gravy using chickpea flour, oats, nuts, etc.<p>Tofu: \n- Goes in almost any Asian cuisine (Indian, Thai, Chinese, etc...) fry it for stir fry.<p>For cooking meatless, I recommend using mushrooms, yeast flakes and yeast extract for adding umami flavor.')
