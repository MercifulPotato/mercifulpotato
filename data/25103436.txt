Odd.<p>That isn&#x27;t what they are complaining about though e.g There are saying that some areas have <i>very high</i> turnout (over 95%) in specific counties. Even in countries with mandatory voting you don&#x27;t get past 95% of the population voting. I haven&#x27;t looked into these claims myself. So I have no idea if they are true.')
