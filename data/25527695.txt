At the time, AMD was years behind Intel in both performance and power consumption. There were constant jokes about the Bulldozer cores burning people&#x27;s houses down. The few remaining &#x27;team red&#x27; loyalists had been hyping Zen were largely ignored.<p>Then, boom. Over night AMD leapfrogged Intel, and now on the third generation has a firm lead in mid range desk top all the way up to high end server silicon. Obviously, Intel has major partnerships with most OEMs, so despite their shortcomings they&#x27;re still doing strong.<p>Of course, if ARM or RISCV really is the future this is just a blip. Honestly, I don&#x27;t see x64 going anywhere for at least 15 years - though hope I can look back at this and roll my eyes someday...')
