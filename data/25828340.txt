That&#x27;s well beyond the level of math that the average person would consider self-evident.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about this blog^[0] , but I wanted to find some charts comparing a well known risk parity fund to more general portfiolios. Trusting that they&#x27;re accurate, it looks like risk parity performed great in 2008, but hasn&#x27;t beat the market over longer periods of time. Even measuring from 2007 to late 2020, it appears a 60&#x2F;40 bond fund has beat it substantially.<p>Thus I&#x27;m not really sure what grounds there is to say risk parity beats the market. Certainly not by all measurements. I&#x27;m not a huge financial guy though, maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding something?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evidenceinvestor.com&#x2F;the-all-weather-portfolio-explained&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evidenceinvestor.com&#x2F;the-all-weather-portfolio-e...</a>')
