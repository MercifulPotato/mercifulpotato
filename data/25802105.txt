Signal has a strong reputation as a privacy-supporting app without any weird fringe Internet subculture attached to it. And I’m unaware of any public groups like you find on Facebook or WhatsApp.<p>De-platforming a private messenger like Signal would be a strong signal against an open, unmonitored Internet and raise too many eyebrows.
