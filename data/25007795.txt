For you that might be a deal breaker, but for a lot of users, this isn&#x27;t.<p>Especially since Microsoft is now &quot;serious enough&quot; about Windows on ARM, this is more about competing on price for low end machines.  Think about all the devices sold that have an i3 or less.  I&#x27;d bet that this processor is very competitive in terms of speed and power, so how much does it cost the OEM?')
