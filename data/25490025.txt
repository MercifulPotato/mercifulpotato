But... are you willing to vouch for the quality of healthcare in Spain or Italy, or some of the eastern EU countries like Romania? Because I lived in Naples and Rome for a combined 5 years and I was <i>not</i> impressed with the quality of healthcare I received compared to what I&#x27;m used to in America (for one, doctors don&#x27;t usually come in with lit cigarettes in america, though I&#x27;m told &quot;that&#x27;s a Naples thing&quot;).')
