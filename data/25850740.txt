Once, I was going to meet a landlord about renting an apartment and a white friend tagged along.  Got there, the landlord was like &quot;Oh. Sorry, no blacks.&quot;  I was like &quot;Okie doke.&quot;  My friend was outraged on my behalf.  I told him, &quot;That&#x27;s bad. You know what else is bad?
