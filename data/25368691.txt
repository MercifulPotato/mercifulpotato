All you have shown is that you have an ax to grind.  I haven&#x27;t talked about lockdown measures at all, only in response to you bringing them up. And at that I haven&#x27;t even said anything.  Like I said before, you have an ax to grind and aren&#x27;t reading what I am writing.<p>I will wade in here.  Lock down measure do restrict the spread of covid - that I won&#x27;t refute - and that is scientific in nature and if you are of scientific worth you can&#x27;t deny that.  It&#x27;s merely physics - if people don&#x27;t see each other there is no ability to transmit the illness.  The debate that you are referring to is whether the severity of the lockdown measures are worth the cost. Thats a political calculation.  I haven&#x27;t waded into that in any of my comments and don&#x27;t intend now.')
