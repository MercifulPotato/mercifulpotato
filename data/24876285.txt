Everything was written from scratch (including an all-nighter by me to get the frontend ready :D), and we&#x27;re very proud of the work we&#x27;ve done. I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions, although I might defer to my peers for some of parts of the model. It was a collaborative effort from the whole class, and some statistical analysis blog posts are coming in the next couple weeks!')
