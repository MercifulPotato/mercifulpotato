Itâ€™s amazingly effective at dehumidification.  If I ever have to change out one of my AC units I will probably go with a multi-zone mini split.  Being able to condition only the rooms that are in use and the super effective dehumidification the systems offer are a significant upgrade over traditional ducted AC systems.  Heat pumps on mini splits tend to be far more effective too.')
