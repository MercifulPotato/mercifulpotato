Item(by='gwd', descendants=None, kids=[24989370], score=None, time=1604492105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988159, text='&gt; I follow your logic and see your point...but it still seems like a stretch to label this as coercion. Where do you draw the line?<p>Do you mean for Uber and Lyft, or for 19th-century factory workers?<p>I absolutely think the 19th century factory workers had it better than the 19th century plantation slaves.  Exactly where we draw the line for &quot;coercion&quot; matters less to me than the recognition that such a lifestyle still wasn&#x27;t &quot;voluntary&quot;: they were forced into doing something nobody should be forced to do.<p>I don&#x27;t really know whether Uber or Lyft reach the level of coercion at the moment; but unless there&#x27;s something to prevent it, the same thing will happen eventually.<p>&gt; You can always try to argue that the lowest income earners deserve more. Who is to judge their life is too deep in &quot;survival mode?&quot;<p>I like John Rawl&#x27;s &quot;Veil of Ignorance&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;veil-ignorance&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;veil-ignorance&#x2F;</a>')
