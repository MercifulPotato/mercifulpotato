Couldn&#x27;t that leak the bucket name to a untrusted 3rd party?<p>What I am trying to say is your good from random people on the internet, but the minute someone compromises one of the systems that has legitimate access they could extract the info they needed to access anything that user accessed.<p>To be clear, I think the risk of this is low and still use security through obscurity myself.')
