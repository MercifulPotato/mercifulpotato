But not until then.<p>It looks like a good feature set and yes, I would love to use a solution from someone who focuses on auth vs. rolling my own.<p>I do think your documentation could be expanded. You have some examples of how to use it with Netlify, but I&#x27;d love to see example apps for other cloud providers as well (Heroku, in my case.) Similarly for the react-auth documentation - the basic syntax of how to use it is a good start, but a full working app demonstrating its use with role-based authorizations would put it over the top to prove to me it could meet my needs.')
