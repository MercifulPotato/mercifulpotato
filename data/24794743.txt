This is a simulated Security Operations Center, and Network Operations Center, used for training and competition :)<p>Signups for BOT(N|S) end today (16th October), check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conf.splunk.com&#x2F;connect&#x2F;boss-of-the-soc-and-noc.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conf.splunk.com&#x2F;connect&#x2F;boss-of-the-soc-and-noc.html</a> There are also frequent regional BOT(N|S) that are run, more details on the website.<p>Past datasets for BOTS can be found at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splunk?q=bots" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splunk?q=bots</a> , and many related Splunk Blog posts about it can be found at \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splunk.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tag&#x2F;boss-of-the-soc.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splunk.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tag&#x2F;boss-of-the-soc.html</a>,. These are freely avaialable, just download the data, copy to a Splunk instance (also free, as the data is already ingested), and you&#x27;re good to go and start practcing.<p>Disclaimer, I work for Splunk, and am helping coach in the APAC BOTN next week.<p>I&#x27;ll also link to the Splunk Attack Range, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splunk&#x2F;attack_range" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splunk&#x2F;attack_range</a> . This allows you to quickly spin up a small lab environment, then quickly hit it with a bunch of realistic attacks. All that data is then is then sent to a prebuilt Splunk instance for you to practice your investigation and analysis, and even integrate with Phantom, Splunk&#x27;s automation system. Check out the video for it at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xIbln7OQ-Ak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xIbln7OQ-Ak</a> .
