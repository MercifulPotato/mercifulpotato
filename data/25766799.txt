I assume they have pretty much almost all always been ARM.<p>All kinds of things over the years. For example, Qualcomm&#x27;s Snapdragon line.<p>And Intel was definitely pushing to get into mobile at one point. They made a big deal about processor compatibility from mobile up through the server. I still remember at one IDF, they made a big deal about how you wanted to run Intel for mobile (this was pre-iPhone) so that Flash would run the same everywhere.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s hard to make predictions more than a few years out and certainly x86 has a lot of inertia. On the other hand, there&#x27;s a lot more abstraction than there used to be and we know there&#x27;s going to be a lot heterogeneity anyway (GPU, DPU, TPU, FPGA, SIMD instructions, etc.) given the slowing down of CMOS process scaling. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>too</i> big a stretch to imagine that we&#x27;ll see a more varied processor landscape. (I expect ARM to gain share although I don&#x27;t expect it to dominate on servers--though I have colleagues who do expect that to happen.)')
