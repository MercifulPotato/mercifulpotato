Here, the connection with a mentor was sort of a &quot;free for all&quot; and one has to find a mentor and come to an agreement for a &quot;project&quot; or &quot;goal&quot; and one works towards that goal&#x2F;project with the mentor&#x27;s guidance. After that, the goal of that mentorship relationship is considered attained and you (could) start over.<p>- In another, there was no noise about mentorship. However, the way the reporting structure and work on projects was organised, it led to a phenomenon where everyone was working with someone their senior and someone who would be their senior&#x27;s senior. So, &quot;mentorship&quot; just happened all the time in your work. You didn&#x27;t have to look for it. It was just the way things were done.<p>The former, I found pretentious and absolutely useless. In the latter, I learnt so much and to this day, I have preserved some notes of things I have learnt from working with some people who are now considered industry leaders.<p>My suggestion is to seek out companies for whom technology is what drives their business and who work that way too. I&#x27;d also look for companies who don&#x27;t make a lot of noise about these things and just structure work in such a way that you are always working with those who are keeping an eye on your work (and I don&#x27;t mean looking over your shoulder) and can keep helping you grow as a natural part of work instead of having to seek this out outside of your regular work.')
