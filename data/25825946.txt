I had no idea myself! Perhaps I was the only one who didn&#x27;t know.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Criminal_justice_system_of_Japan#Conviction_rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Criminal_justice_system_of_Jap...</a><p>The conviction rate in Japan is over <i>99%</i> -- going to &quot;trial&quot; is essentially the same as being found guilty.<p>The prosecuting attorneys have a lot of discretion over what is prosecuted, and are effectively de facto judges. They may decide to simply not prosecute a case if they feel &quot;character, age, environment, gravity of the offense, circumstances or situation after the offense&quot; makes it unnecessary.<p>So it&#x27;s easy to imagine there might be some with quite an ego like Edgeworth or Von Karma -- and a protagonist like our heroic defense attorney would be quite the unusual attorney, indeed! I loved the games even without knowing any of that, but that really makes them all the more poignant and funny for me.')
