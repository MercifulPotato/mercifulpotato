Item(by='coward8675309', descendants=None, kids=[25458882], score=None, time=1608228020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457716, text='I don&#x27;t know what general principles people are arguing for here, but the facts at the heart of TFA relate to someone laying down an ultimatum to an employer — &quot;do these things or I&#x27;m going to quit&quot; — and the employer replying &quot;sorry to hear that buh bye.&quot;<p>That accepted conditional resignation (as someone mellifluously put it in an earlier HN discussion) is being interpreted by some as a firing. Having read the original letter, it sure sounded like a conditional resignation to me and, as a manager, I would&#x27;ve done my best to get the writer of the letter out the door ASAP.<p>Keep in mind that as an IC, I once worked for a company that imposed a 10% across the board pay cut without consulting me. I resigned the day it was announced, because my compensation is a term of employment mutually agreed to by my employer and myself, not something imposed upon me. So I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this.<p>As a general life rule, I go nuclear on people who play hardball with me, whether I am the manager or the managed.')
