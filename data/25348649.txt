Item(by='fredophile', descendants=None, kids=[25349350], score=None, time=1607449252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345243, text='&gt; so maybe you can gather some statistics on that<p>Here&#x27;s what a quick google search turned up.<p>This link [0] shows that US police kill over three times as many people, per capita, than Canadian police. However, I think there are other issues, like easy access to guns, that affect this stat so this isn&#x27;t really a very useful stat for our discussion.<p>This group [1] has been collecting info on arrest related deaths but a quick look only showed me links to how they collect data and not the actual data. It also looks like they stopped their surveys in 2012.<p>This paper [2] has some of the most relevant stats I&#x27;ve found for our discussion and covers use of lethal force by police between 2009-2012. From their numbers, 83% of victims were armed or believed to be armed (this includes toy guns, etc) and over 93% of the deaths were from firearms. If we assume that the 7% of deaths were the police didn&#x27;t shoot all apply to unarmed victims then 10% of the people killed by police were unarmed and shot. Their stats also show LEOs being killed in less than 2% of these incidents. Their numbers do show 9% of these cases resulting in an injury to LEOs but we don&#x27;t have numbers on non-fatal police caused injuries so I don&#x27;t want to compare apples to oranges.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;policekillings&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;policekillings&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bjs.gov&#x2F;index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=82" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bjs.gov&#x2F;index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=82</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6080222&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6080222&#x2F;</a>')
