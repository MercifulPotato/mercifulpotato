Ask any one who has started a software company, any one who does wordpress or any cms websites. You build lines of codes for people and people pay you, thats the magic. \nAnd yes you point out great it will need fund. It will need founders who know how to create wealth to fund such idea. Think if &quot;money&quot; was no object, what is the total monthly cost of living of everyone on the planet and then will work backwards on how much burnrate is needed to fund. etc etc..<p>Yes market imbalance is the reason for high pay, I am just pointing out thats the advantage tech group has and gets to execute such ideas.')
