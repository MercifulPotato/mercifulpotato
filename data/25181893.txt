Their opinions can&#x27;t be change, and they aren&#x27;t going to matter much soon.<p>And the other, newer, techie focused groups are getting more influence.<p>There isn&#x27;t much point in &quot;negotiating&quot; with the entrenched groups when they are never going to be convinced, and you can just usurp them instead.')
