This person has been causing problems for years, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opal&#x2F;opal&#x2F;issues&#x2F;941" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opal&#x2F;opal&#x2F;issues&#x2F;941</a><p>If people want to license their software under licenses like these, fine.  But I would hesitate to use any licenses authored or promulgated by this person; I do not believe Emkhe operates in good faith.<p>As a counter-example, look at rms.  I don&#x27;t use the GPL for anything I publish, but I really respect his commitment to promoting free software .  He encourages its use where he can and worked to back good and useful code written under it instead of harassing those who didn&#x27;t agree with him.  He got zealous and enthusiastic at times, just like everyone who really believes in something, but I believe he&#x27;s been making good-faith efforts to further his cause for a long time.')
