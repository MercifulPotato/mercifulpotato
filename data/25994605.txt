Item(by='curiousllama', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612216714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994052, text='&gt; That this thought experiment merits a web page is really quite astounding.  That I decided to write you an e-mail telling you that is even more astounding.  And that I don&#x27;t drink myself stupid following this exchange will be the most astounding non-event in the history of mankind.  I am baffled, shattered, and destroyed by the mind-numbing pointlessness of The Incompatible Food Triad experiment.  It makes me ill.  I promise you, sir, I will never again be the same after witnessing the sheer mind-blowing uselessness of that puzzle.  My life as I know it, is over.  I once was lost, but then I was found, and then I found your website linked to Wikipedia and now I am lost again, irretrievably lost in a dark maze, a pitch dark maze with the Minotaur of Bafflement hunting me down.  I shall not escape him, I shall not escape my doom.  No, good sir, instead I fall - far and away, even from myself I fall until I slam forcefully into the cold steel floor of my own mind, crippled and alone, dead to all sensation.  I am gone, sir, and I shall never return.<p>Loved the page, myself.')
