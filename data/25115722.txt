But not the virus itself.<p>That may mean that the virus was spreading earlier than thought. It may mean a closely related virus was spreading that generated cross-reactive antibodies (which we already know is happening with different antibodies). It may mean that COVID-19 was spreading, but later mutated into something more virulent. We just don&#x27;t know yet.')
