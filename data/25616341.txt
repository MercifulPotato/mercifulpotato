Indeed I haven&#x27;t been at Atlassian that long, but that&#x27;s not a good excuse: it&#x27;s my problem to own.<p>I appreciate the reinforcement of &quot;fix everything&quot;, and I assure you we&#x27;re trying our best to do so. As a PM it is my natural instinct (and literal job) to prioritize, so I&#x27;m always looking for more details to do so.<p>I can understand that my request for details can imply that I&#x27;m either not listening or not believing the feedback, but that is not the case -&gt; I do understand everything is slow and needs fixing.')
