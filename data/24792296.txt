There were several ways provided by Google how to export the pictures and upload them and they killed them all. The last good way was to link your Google Drive with Google Photos and then install it on desktop and let it download the whole library (and then install iCloud and let it upload everything). Google Takeout isn&#x27;t without issues, a lot of people including me had problems generating the takeout link, it failed for several tries and took days. And then they break Live Photos take on iPhone which were backed up by Google Photos, Takeout doesn&#x27;t export them in a proper way (maybe it does now, I don&#x27;t know).\nThere is just no simple way how download Google Photos. Compare this with iCloud which does this by default.\nSo what I did was kind of stupid - but it allowed me to transfer all pictures from Photos to iCloud in full quality and including Live Photos. I downloaded Google Photos on iPhone and then I selected as many pictures as I could by dragging the finger and then click &quot;Save to Photos&quot;. iCloud  will back it up. Rinse and repeat. You can&#x27;t select more than few hundred, so it took me a while to upload 70 GB.\nTotally worth it - I am never going back to Google Photos.')
