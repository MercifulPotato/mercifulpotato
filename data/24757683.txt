Item(by='hellosire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602527190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755359, text='&gt; As it happens I have seen articles in SPIE that do have a similar flavour: a well-established existing area of mathematics that has been re-&quot;discovered&quot; in a more limited form in another context without acknowledgement.<p>Again, citation needed. Not once have I ever seen this occur. But if you post one, I would be happy to concede as it is the integrity of the peer-review process I am concerned with. If you deem it unworthy and someone claiming a re-discovery, then it would be wise of you to write a letter to the editors to point out the error, or even better publish an erratum.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, I couldn&#x27;t quite untangle this sentence. Are you saying that I&#x27;m approaching the point of fraud because of my accusations against SPIE?<p>Your examples of GPT3 text being accepted would be an act of fraud, of which SPIE journals are more than competent (and it would be impossible to be in any way a coherent article) to reject.<p>Tai&#x27;s model, while not fraud, is a failure of the editors, of which there has been no similar cases that I am aware of. Again, I would be happy to concede for the sake of scientific integrity if you showed specific citations.<p>The point I am making is to defend this organization as it is honest and trustworthy in my field. I want to dispel any notion of impressionable people on HN that are susceptible to know-it-all-ism that it is in no way predatory or allows &quot;crank&quot; science.<p>While you think articles by companies in industry may be dubious, I think you also have a misunderstanding of the difference between conference proceedings and peer-review in this particular field and venue, which is why I doubt the extent of your involvement in this field of research.<p>Where is your line? If articles are not up to your research standards, then that is a different case. There is no need to bring up cases of GPT3 text or the dubiousness of Tai&#x27;s model as they are examples that cannot be applied here.')
