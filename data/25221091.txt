This is literally a case that makes no sense in the code ever, not one of the &quot;php used to do something magical for us&quot; but &quot;php used to keep silent about this buffonery&quot;, so if your code does that you have bigger worries ...<p>Almost every single one of those things are easy to fix, in that it requires mostly time not much if any redesign, and almost every single one of those things are also deprecated or on their way out since at least a decade.')
