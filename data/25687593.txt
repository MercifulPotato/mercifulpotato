If that happens then you must get a two thirds majority of states to agree on the proposal presented and it becomes a constitutional amendment. Entirely side stepping the federal government.<p>This power hasn&#x27;t been used in a very long time, and from my readings of Washington and Jefferson they intended us to use it. Perhaps this is a corollary to Chesterton&#x27;s Fence, call it Chesterton&#x27;s Button rephrased less elegantly than he or you put it: &quot;If your forefathers were willing to die to give you the ability to do something, you should question if that ability has not used in a very long time.&quot;')
