It wasn&#x27;t that way in my teens, back then I would happily spend entire evenings noodling around in it making graphics for web pages and demos&#x2F;games.<p>Nowadays just throwing text on a layer makes me want to throw my laptop.  That custom widget is so useless, maybe I should try a newer version as I&#x27;m still on 2.8 here.')
