They came from Drenthe 100 years ago to work at Philips, and now they come from India to work at ASML. It takes only one generation for them to mix with the locals, yet they keep an opener mind than eg the inbreds from Den Bosch)<p>Also the usual &quot;medium size city&quot; perks: the place is big enough for lots of stuff to do, nice bars and cafes etc, yet small enough to be able to randomly bump into people you know. As someone who grew up on the countryside, I find that a nice balance. That said, there&#x27;s an exceptionally large amount of stuff to do per capita. Eg neighbouring Tilburg is almost the same size but significantly less vibrant.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s super well connected. Notably, the direct train to Utrecht&#x2F;Amsterdam goes every 10 minutes, almost like a subway.')
