Building a machine to reproduce the behavior of living systems goes a long way back, and this mouse acting like a mouse makes me think of a great documentary on automata, spending some time talking about the people and politics around building these fantastically expensive robotic birds and swans and whole towns driven by a clock. [1]<p>Building a machine that mimics neural processing is just a continuation of that tradition. One other machine that amazed me is Paul Westons&#x27;s numa-rete, an early attempt at neural networks composed of 400 &quot;synapses&quot; which can count the number of objects on its surface without any CPU to coordinate it, just direct parallel analog computation. A good explanation is here [2], this was in 1961.<p>`What will be done is to show what is inside, revealing how little intelligence it really had. However, many uninitiated persons who tried and failed at the time to “trick”  it  into  error  by,  e.g.,  inserting  objects  within  holes  in  larger  objects were ready to believe that it was intelligent`<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NcPA0jvp9IQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NcPA0jvp9IQ</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160401023457&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcl.ece.illinois.edu&#x2F;revolution&#x2F;05_Weston.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160401023457&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcl.ece.il...</a>')
