Ycombinator has no credibility anymore IMO.<p>The moral of the AirBnB story is basically: Do illegal shit, laws be damned and also rack up a ton of bad debt. If you succeed you’ll have so much investor money that not only will you believe to be above the law, but the law will begin to believe you. And if you fail?
