Batteries have gotten a lot better, but I think you need to look at the whole car, not just the motor, to make a fair assessment of durability.<p>I do think that electric has a lower maintenance cost, even accounting for the battery, but it&#x27;s not that low that i think you can make up a 30k price difference.<p>If you plan on keeping the car for 10 years and drive 1000km per month. The up front 30k are 3k per year or 250 per month. That&#x27;s quite a lot of an additional fixed cost for not having moved yet.')
