I wouldn&#x27;t type code directly into the REPL; that&#x27;s not a pleasant experience in Clojure - but might be pleasant in Common Lisp or Smalltalk for all I know. The process that I and others use in Clojure most definitely differs from the process that the OP describes and I lack enough familiarity with Common Lisp to know if the process is more pleasant in that language. I assume it is and I must make time to learn Common Lisp properly some day.')
