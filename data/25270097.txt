The average person wouldn&#x27;t read studies and documentation or ascertain the quality - I barely can and check HN comments for many medical studies :) FDA approval is a very strong signal at least.<p>I&#x27;d rather avoid the supplements situation where manufacturers can essentially claim almost anything and most of the population isn&#x27;t aware that it&#x27;s a free-for-all. Manufacturers can still claim some function but at least there&#x27;s currently a disclaimer that makes average people question some claims.<p>I don&#x27;t really love the mix of deregulation and healthcare (even adjecent, see supplements).')
