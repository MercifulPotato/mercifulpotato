I mean, the MacOS of 15+ years ago iron-fisted it, and it was right most of the time, but glaringly not in a few cases (simple examples, the ability to reshape a window by any corner or edge was <i>conspicuously</i> absent on Mac for a long time, as was the right mouse button).<p>Best to let a bunch of free ideas duke it out.<p>Currently using Ubuntu 20.10 beta (releases in 2 days!) on ZFS on root, and got all my dev and games working, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it thus far. The ability to roll back to any point at which an apt install was made or attempted via zsys&#x27; integration with ZFS snapshots is nice. And ZFS is just... as glorious as an enterprise-class filesystem, basically. And all &quot;for free&quot;.')
