And the science was pretty consistent - calories matter above all else.<p>I don&#x27;t believe &#x27;the science&#x27; is consistent about this at all.<p>Tim Ferris cites lots of science when writing &#x27;The Four Hour Body&#x27; a decade ago, and decades before that Atkins had a fair amount of science to back up similar observations &amp; claims -- not all calories are equal.<p>Eschewing carbohydrates (a word that doesn&#x27;t appear in TFA) and filling up on proteins (appears once in relation to a supplement) and fats (appears only twice - once referring to being fat as a child, the other as an adjective for yogurt) will get you most of the way &#x27;there&#x27;, if &#x27;there&#x27; is gentle weight loss &#x2F; management that&#x27;s easier to maintain than calorie counting.')
