Because keeping the plane airborne is hard enough, I don&#x27;t think they have time for any other complex operation at all. Why didn&#x27;t they try to automate the U2? Keeping it in the air maybe be hard for humans but certainly not for machines and algorithms, especially in the times of AI and ML. The ground crew is then freed to do other more important tasks for a spy-plane.')
