Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611238109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858200, text='Exactly.<p>E.g, a possible example immutable scenario that doesn&#x27;t violate anything (with each number representing a discrete period of time)<p><pre><code>    1. An old man appears and says hi to me and disappear.\n    2. 20 years pass.\n    3. I obtain a time machine.\n    4. I travel back in time and return (in my absence from this time period, I&#x27;m at time step 1 saying hi to myself)\n</code></pre>\nThe key being that we tend to see this as:<p><pre><code>    1a. Nothing happens.\n    1b.An old man appears and says hi to me and disappear.\n    2. 20 years pass.\n    3. I obtain a time machine.\n    4. I travel back in time and return (in my absence from this time period, I&#x27;m at time step 1b saying hi to myself).\n</code></pre>\nAt which point 1b looks like a change from 1a, so we conclude there&#x27;s mutability. But if the universe is immutable, then 1a <i>never existed in the first place</i>. <i>I always, immutably had will have (sorry, I could not resist) travelled back in time to greet myself</i><p>And that removes e.g. the grandfather paradox, because a static, immutable representation of it that is consistent with our other rules (not having people spontaneously come into existence, for example) isn&#x27;t possible.')
