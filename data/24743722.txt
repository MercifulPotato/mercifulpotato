I was at a blackjack table and surrounded by midwestern salt-of-the-earth types. I had my badge on which flashed lights, and someone asked if I was &quot;one of those computer hackers&quot; and I said Yes (of course). <i>Then they asked me if it was true that the government could read everything they did on their computer!</i> The very first question! I hesitated, and said <i>yes</i>! The government can indeed read everything they do online! It made the whole table silent.<p>The mainstream media keeps publishing these hand-wringing articles about how America&#x27;s faith in institutions has diminished, as if Trump did it all. I argue that the total lack of privacy and argument from the Department of Justice that any privacy is akin to terrorism &#x2F; criminal behavior kills society more than what they think they protect.<p>Is not privacy a fundamental American principle?
