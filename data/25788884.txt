That&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re criticising.<p>&quot;Yet if you&#x27;re old enough to have gotten started in the time of JavaScript in the late &#x27;90s, or QBasic in the early &#x27;90s, or systems like the BBC Micro or TRS-80 in earlier decades, you should know what the author&#x27;s talking about.<p>Everything you need to program is just there. It just works, there&#x27;s no extra installation, you start a program and start coding.&quot;<p>Bash is 5000x more powerful and user-friendly programming environment than any version of rom BASIC ever was.<p>qbasic... well guess what? qbasic was not necessarily just there. It might be there. You have to type the command at a command line, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, you have to investigate %PATH%<p>Bash kills basic hands down, as a programming language mind you, using only it&#x27;s built-in features, forget the fact that it&#x27;s also a wrapper around exec(), and it is right there exactly like the the old rom basics were.')
