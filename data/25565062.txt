This started around 2012 and peaked around 2016 or so.<p>&gt;<i>However you seem like someone who enjoys pretending like VR is a little fad and doesn&#x27;t offer anything new to the game space- so whatever.</i><p>&quot;Offering something new to the game space&quot; is a spectacularly low bar compared to the oversold promise of consumer adoption and applications of VR.<p>And even at that, VR thus far didn&#x27;t even make a real dent in the gaming space, now that you&#x27;ve mentioned it. So much for all the 2012-2017 hype of the tech finally being &quot;nailed&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s doubly funny to me, because I have memories of the first VR fad, in the 90s. At least then besides the media hype, we&#x27;ve also got a few camp movies out of it (&quot;Lawnmower man&quot; and co).')
