Pretty much anyone can ask and answer questions in there, and it is not strict on Tor&#x2F;VPN users.<p>Some answers can get marked as answered by &quot;Some know person&quot;, to attract people with a social profile to comment as well. This can only be done if they email me telling me which question they answered, and i&#x27;m still working on that feature. What do you guys think?')
