Every interaction via a particle or otherwise is simply pushing a button.<p>But there is something kind-of-special about the box with the buttons and the lights.<p>Not every interaction is simply pushing a button that lights one lamp or another. Keeping the analogy, the result of an interaction between two particles may be a combination of the &quot;red on&quot;, &quot;green on&quot; states. You need to keep adding particles to have a box with buttons and lamps that works as expected.')
