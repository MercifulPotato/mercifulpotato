But rejecting all reports outright without even looking is really missing out on one of the key advantages that open source culture brings to the table.<p>This aspect is not specific to open source either. In my book, maintainers of proprietary software, and I&#x27;m one of those, are also making a huge mistake if they ignore bug reports from users. But in open source, it goes further, by inviting contributions even in form of patches for bugs or improvements. Not allowing any of those is what I call  stupid in the above post.')
