Their stock was on a one-way ticket to the dumpster, they were laying off staff with frequency, they were losing popularity to Snapchat of all things, people were pumping out articles about who was going to buy them out. If you want to know why it took them so long to ban Trump, it&#x27;s because Trump winning the presidency and making it his primary speech platform propped up the whole company.<p>You can try to minimize this all you want, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that Twitter is some runaway train that will survive without him, ignore the fact the government is starting to sniff around.')
