To save time, you can use canned tomatoes (half can of diced tomatoes).   Then add for flavor... basil, olive oil, lemon&#x2F;lime juice.  I sometimes add spoonfuls of ground flax seed and hemp.  The purpose of olive oil is to add some fat to satiate the appetite and also give it a buttery flavor.  The purpose of lemon&#x2F;lime juice is to mask the bitterness of raw greens.<p>If you prefer sweet smoothies, there are lots of youtube videos showing recipes with bananas&#x2F;apples&#x2F;blueberries&#x2F;cherries&#x2F;yogurt, etc.<p>EDIT ADD:  you can try spinach instead of kale or mix kale+spinach.  To add even more flavor, you can try sun-dried tomatoes (in jar of oil) but that ingredient makes it more expensive to drink every day.')
