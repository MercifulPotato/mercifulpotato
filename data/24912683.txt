All of my scripts have a -defang parameter which walks through the entire process, including placeholder log messages, but not actually performing the operation.  My run books always say to run your exact command with this switch first, to proofread it.    For some dangerous scripts, defang is enabled and has to be manually turned off.  Defang is also nice because it will tell you e.g. here’s the size of the backup you’ll be restoring, or the filepath you’ve composed based on your parameters, or confirming that you’ll be replacing an existing thing instead of creating a new one.  It has saved me many, many times.')
