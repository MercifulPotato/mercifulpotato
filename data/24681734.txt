For example, let&#x27;s say you have a bunker-fueled emergency generator for a hospital that you use only when the power goes out. The pollution it emits is negligible. But by banning bunker fuel, you&#x27;ll have to replace the emergency generator, at considerable expense and environmental cost.<p>With taxes instead, you:<p>1. bunker fuel will only be used when there&#x27;s high value for it, and you won&#x27;t have to add a plethora of exemptions into the regulation<p>2. have a revenue center for the government instead of a cost center - revenue that can be used to subsidize green initiatives')
