Almost every real world project will involve ambiguous instructions.<p>Obviously you don&#x27;t want to penalize the candidate for not reading your mind and guessing the definition you had in mind. But I do think it&#x27;s fair to give extra credit to candidates who notice the ambiguity and ask for clarification. Done well, an ambiguous question can be an opportunity for a candidate to demonstrate a strength, rather than a trick to unfairly penalize someone.')
