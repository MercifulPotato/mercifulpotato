It would boot early each morning, connect to wifi, pull latest weather and news, generate a png containing weather and news, show the png on the screen, shut down wifi, set RTC to boot again tomorrow and power down.<p>The problem I had is that eventually when it ran out of battery, I charged it and the process didn&#x27;t kick off again. Probably I just need to ssh back in a get it going again, but I lost interest at that point!')
