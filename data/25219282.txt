It&#x27;s <i>similar</i> hardware but with significant variations in power budget, RAM and disk size, connectivity, and so on.<p>This matters because the iPad electronics have to fit behind the screen, while the MacBook electronics live under the keyboard.<p>To make a PadMac the entire Mac electronics would have to fit behind a thicker unclippable screen, and the keyboard would have to be slimmed down to compensate.<p>Or perhaps the screen would be accessible over WiFi or even Bluetooth - but that would also affect the power budget and would have other issues. (Is a removable screen as useful as an iPad? Mostly, no.)<p>Building reliable clip&#x2F;unclip connections would be an interesting problem.<p>It could probably be done, and I would be surprised if it hasn&#x27;t already been tried.<p>But it&#x27;s certainly not a trivial engineering challenge, especially given power and cost constraints.')
