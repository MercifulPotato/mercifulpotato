I was indeed surprised after downloading the app because the business model was not known (I didn&#x27;t leave any reviews though). I haven&#x27;t purchased the previous version and have no experience with the app.<p>My issue is not about your business model in that comment, but with the App Store description not saying that the application is usable only by an in-app purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t even have downloaded it if that were clear. You should update the description to make it clear that the app is completely useless without buying an in-app purchase.')
