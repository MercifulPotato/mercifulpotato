Everything is improved in minuscule steps and by encapsulating everything in more modern carriers. A good example is MODBUS. They still carry the same data, the old way. Only thing is it&#x27;s either encapsulated in USB or TCP&#x2F;IP. Why? Because it works and allows perfect backward compatibility.<p>Since neither the hardware and the software has to run latest version of Doom (metaphorically), if the application is reliable, it&#x27;s left as is. Even if it runs on DOS 6.22.<p>Fun fact: There&#x27;s an auto repair shop in Poland which runs its main application on a C64 [0].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;a23139&#x2F;commodore-64-repair-shop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;a23139&#x2F;c...</a>')
