It&#x27;s content would not let it stand to survive mostly unchanged for thousands of years. There is fundamental non-religious tenants that give it value. Community, mental health from religious leaders, moral guidance for those who need it, etc. These are all things that have nothing to do with religion but because Religion offers these things that&#x27;s what gives them power.<p>Reddit for example, which is anti-theist, has lost its access to what religion provides. They have lost their community, mental health benefits and moral guidance. Ironic because reddit could have been exactly that void. In fact I suspect many people flock to reddit looking for community and discover the exact opposite. Likely getting trapped in the echo chambers.<p>Now apply that same logic as to why stoicism is becoming popular.')
