Why, because he has trouble beating Rafa on clay??<p>I don&#x27;t know why people bother to take umbrage at things without even <i>trying</i> to learn the context. What you are assuming the author claims doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere in the book.<p>He never says the Federer is a generalist. The only mention of Federer in the book is to contrast his childhood with Tiger Wood&#x27;s childhood.<p>&quot;By the time [Federer] finally gave up other sports—soccer, most notably—to focus on tennis, other kids had long since been working with strength coaches, sports psychologists, and nutritionists. But it didn’t seem to hamper his development in the long run.&quot;<p>In contrast, Tiger Woods famously focused on golf exclusively at an early age.<p>Woods specialised in golf from a young age. Federer didn&#x27;t specialise in a single sport from a young age.<p>Federer is never mentioned again after the 4th page of the book.')
