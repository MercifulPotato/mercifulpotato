Until a formalised model is built, there is no way to describe it&#x27;s behaviour that wouldn&#x27;t come down to writing down the implementation that&#x27;s currently in the compiler (apart from specifying it by example, which would be even more expansive).<p>That is the point some seem to fail to understand: said model is absolutely irrelevant if we already have production releases of an implementation of Rust.<p>A standard is not supposed to be academically rigorous. A standard is a specification of the current behavior so that multiple implementations can meet the current requirements, and thus ensure interoperability and compatibility.<p>It makes absolutely no sense to talk about &quot;a formalized model&quot; because rust is already used in production without said formalized model. The absence of said formalization is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that the current behavior is specified and set in stone so that it serves as a target set in stone that anyone in the world can target and expect to interoperate.<p>It&#x27;s terribly simple: if a rust v1.25 exists then it&#x27;s behavior and interfaces can be described. Obviously. That description is what a standard is: an implementation target set in stone that others can use as a reference.')
