Nobody else comes close. What would they call a documentary on Maxwell? “Waves haggis-man?” What would their clever title for Newton be? “Calculus apple-noggin sperdo?” Napoleon’s documentary is “big hat frog midget.”  How about calling your documentary of Freud “Pervert Schlomo” while you’re at it. What fucking pinhead planet are you from calling a documentary of Shannon “Bit player?” Die in a fire, you fucking philistines!</i><p>(Apparently the author missed that &quot;Bit Player&quot; is a play on the idea that Shannon played with bits, and is unfamiliar with the idea that association of a title with a common saying makes people more comfortable with the idea that&#x27;ll enjoy watching it)')
