I would only consider Excel and Word for very simple use cases. For example, I refuse to use Word for technical documentation. But Office and Excel are everywhere in large corporates; and simple tactical spreadsheets turn into monsters over time. One former employer had a spreadsheet &quot;application&quot; where triggering a sheet recalc (accidentally) would take out an entire grid of machines. I&#x27;ve never been in any position to stop this stuff from happening.')
