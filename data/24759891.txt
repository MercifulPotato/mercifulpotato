A database table with a scheduled full DELETE&#x2F;INSERT had slowed to the point of failure. It turns out, having slightly less IO than needed led the auto-VACUUM process to get further and further behind each time it ran.<p>My friend simply provisioned more IO and moved on. Another option would be to rewrite the process to naturally produce fewer dead rows. It would be great to have a third feasible option.')
