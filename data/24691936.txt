I recently tried to rewrite my resume in HTML and CSS because I was annoyed with LibreOffice&#x27;s (though Word would be no different) table handling&#x2F;UX - wherein my table ended right before the bottom page margin so I ended up with an unnecessary trailing blank page.<p>After switching to CSS grids, I had problems with alternating row background colors (I achieved it, but relied on knowing the contents when what I really wanted was a generic solution). Apart from that (and me wanting to group some elements together to make the markup a bit more semantic and `display: contents` having some weird interactions), it was quite a breeze. But, then I tried to print it to PDF, and discovered that browsers won&#x27;t split a grid row over two pages even if I tell it to, so ended up with more whitespace in other places... Am now trying to decide whether to just use table markup as one cannot specify colspans etc in CSS with `display: table-cell`...')
