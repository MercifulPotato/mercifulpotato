Start at 15% and ramp to 30% as the equivalent of a marginal tax.<p>On the other hand, the costs to Apple are essentially flat for all apps, so other than their own revenue, there&#x27;s no justification for the increased commission.<p>People can argue about whether developers get value for money from the app store (ie, what commission is appropriate for someone providing billing, local taxation, debt collection, all receivables risk etc).<p>People can also argue about whether Apple has a monopoly. If they do, it&#x27;s on their own hardware. So it&#x27;s not a market monopoly. If you define the market as &quot;app stores for Apple hardware&quot;.<p>People can also argue that Google and Apple have a price fixing arrangement.<p>They could argue back that they don&#x27;t, they both independently came to the same commission rates (or that Google followed Apple, so that&#x27;s not Apple&#x27;s fault).<p>They could also argue that they don&#x27;t control the market, depending on how the market is defined, eg &quot;mobile phone applications&quot; as a market has numerous other app stores.')
