Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611240493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858635, text='&gt; The question is: can I create a situation which can not lead to stability?<p>From the perspective of the universe there is no &quot;create&quot; or &quot;destroy&quot; because time is not experienced, it is just one dimension of its existence. The concept of &quot;create&quot; only exists from the perspective of a 3 dimensional being experiencing the time dimension. We believe we can choose the future because we believe it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but that&#x27;s an illusion of perspective. In a sense, this means that there is no free will, but that&#x27;s a different argument.<p>So to answer the question: no, because the fundamental nature physics drops the probability that you would choose such an action to 0, the same way electrons have 0 probability of choosing paths that lead to the gap regions in the double slit experiment.<p>&gt; And if so, what happens? Will it simply not work? Or will every situation lead to the possibility of stability?<p>From your perspective, every situation will lead to stability in the end, because the universe where it didn&#x27;t has a probability of 0.<p>&gt; Say, I travel back in time at the moment the universe &quot;ends&quot;, and from that point onward in the past I destroy all time machines with a certain technology. Then, no one can fix what I did, and no stable loop could exist.<p>&gt; I mean, my guess is that such a situation simply can not exist, therefore I can not experience it - I can not live in this universe where this is possible. So, I can only live in the universe where my technology somehow fails exactly when someone travels back in time to correct my loop.<p>Pretty much yes. Though universes in which the situation you describe is impossible to achieve regardless (either because time travel does not exist or because there&#x27;s nothing you could do to prevent it from being invented again) are significantly more likely.')
