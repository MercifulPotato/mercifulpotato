Browsers are not such tools; however, distributing software (say, a GreaseMonkey script) or instructions on how to make a browser evaluate the decryption JavaScript and download the video without implementing the policies would also be illegal.<p>Why is this so hard to understand? The law is very clear: when a protective measure is set up, be it in JavaScript, Visual Basic, or anything else, anything that gets around that measure is a crime to distribute.')
