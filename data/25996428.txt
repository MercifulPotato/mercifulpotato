Many are using it to play files that were downloaded from who knows where - it wouldn&#x27;t take much to find a bug in a decoder or some other component and then exploit it with a payload in a highly sought after movie.<p>It&#x27;s the main reason I contribute $20 a year to VLC. I know it&#x27;s open source and there are eyes on but between distribution, etc..., someone paid needs to be involved imho; please consider doing the same.')
