Amazon also has a dark pattern of seemingly withholding or slowly leaking new features. For example, the Kindle sees very little updates, and for new versions they just add one or two things that should have been in the previous versions but still leave off obvious things. This makes it so they get repeat buys from people. Take the Kindle Oasis for example. I suspect that they’ve had the warm screen ready for a while, but they didn’t release it on the prior version. They also have not updated it to use USB-C, and I would guess we will finally see that tweak in the next version.')
