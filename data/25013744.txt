It may also, or alternatively, be limiting copying.  See 1201(b)(1).  There appears to be a distinction in the suggested interpretation of 1201 between &quot;access controls&quot; and &quot;copy controls&quot;.  RIAA cited both 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1).   Circumventing copy controls may be permitted under the DMCA, however trafficking in the means to circumvent copy controls is prohibited.  Using youtube-dl in order to make a copy of a copy-protected video for oneself might be permitted under the DMCA, but sharing youtube-dl on Github could be prohibited.')
