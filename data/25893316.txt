We lived in Jack London Square in Oakland in a 700 sq&#x2F;ft apt until COVID made WFH easier. We moved to a suburban paradise in Colorado and life in the suburbs is so much better than Oakland. So much space for hobbies. I can drive 5 minutes and get anything I need. There is no noticeable crime. Cars are great. I own a truck and have a 16ft trailer. We can pack everything we own into the trailer and move somewhere else. These Millennials don&#x27;t want to own anything and are just jaded.')
