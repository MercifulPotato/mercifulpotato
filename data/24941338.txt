Guys, you are <i>destroying</i> your hiring pipeline.<p>I have stopped using Google search (DuckDuckGo is great), Google Chrome (Firefox is great), Google Domains (use Gandi &#x2F; Route53). The most difficult products to shake are Gmail, Docs and Sheets, but I am gradually weaning myself off.<p>The only signal that seems to get through to corporates is to vocally withhold your funds. PMs at Google probably underestimate the % of people on HN who control the company purse for software spending. Personally, there is no way I can risk locking myself or my employer (that just raised a Series B) into any Google products at this point.<p>If I were in charge at Google, I would put engineers and PMs &#x2F; POs on call immediately so they start talking to customers again.')
