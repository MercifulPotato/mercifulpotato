Item(by='Damorian', descendants=None, kids=[25976718], score=None, time=1612066228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975706, text='I&#x27;m confused... it&#x27;s verifiable fact... insurance claims from the riots are between $1-2 billion in damages... dozens of people died and between just a few cities thousands of police were injured, who knows how many protestors and bystanders... support for the movement dropped rapidly once things escalated... these are the facts. How can you look at this, and when someone says they witnessed just a small piece of it, say they&#x27;re &quot;irredeemably far from fact based reality&quot; and you just can&#x27;t let it &quot;slide&quot;.  Consider at least, that your extreme position harms your movement.  What is your exact criticism of my opposition? Or at the very least, to what I witnessed?')
