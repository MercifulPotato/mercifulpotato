In the future, Centos Stream is always ahead of RHEL point releases, and on day 2 they are close to equivalent, and on day 3&#x2F;4, centos is goes back to being ahead (at 8.4 and getting security updates), where rhel is at 8.3 and getting security updates.<p>Assuming that, on the day of a RHEL point release, the two distros are roughly equivalent in packages, with the caveat that the Centos package repos at that point move to the next release (8.4), so you don&#x27;t get any updates ( presumably mostly security related) in the 8.3 repos...  at that point - with those assumptions, if you were on the previous Centos (8.2) - would waiting for the RHEL release to upgrade to the next, now unsupported Centos point release (8.3) be close to roughly equivalent with what the situation is today in terms of compatibility&#x2F;stability? (I&#x27;m not sure what the answer there is)<p>Or - could just track behind a minor release to approximate the situation today with the caveat that you&#x27;re not going to get all the updates? Does Rocky linux end up just being the previous centos stream version with updates to the package repos?')
