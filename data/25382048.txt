For instance, my mother totally lost the use of one leg as a baby with polio. She has always worn a full supportive brace on that leg from foot to hip so she can stand up and walk (she&#x27;s never been able to run). She has always said she doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel disabled&quot;, but she checks yes on forms like this because she knows that this is the terminology used to cover things like &quot;I may need extra help evacuating the office in a fire&quot;.')
