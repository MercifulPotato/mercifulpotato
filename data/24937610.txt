To reach 16-bits of accuracy (or 100db attenuation), you&#x27;ll need 2.5 decades of buffer (1Hz to 500 Hz)<p>If you are seriously trying to tackle the aliasing problem, you&#x27;ll need a high-order antialiasing filter, most likely built by opamps and capacitors. Its not an easy calculation or design, but its something that&#x27;s basically taught to most EE majors. Butterworth Filters, or whatever. Tons of methodologies with tons of tradeoffs depending on what you want exactly. (Linear phase? Or sharpest cutoff? )')
