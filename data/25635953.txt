Germany&#x27;s trade surplus is 10% of GDP, this is roughly where China was at peak. Germany can win at exporting because: consumers are conservative and will accept large corporations milking them, and other countries in Europe are willing to let Germany export deflation to them.<p>It is one of the most unsustainable economic models (and the source of significant global financial instability...China&#x27;s trade surplus peaked in 2008, not a coincidence) and that is before you consider the need going forward for high levels of innovation, business creation, etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t say on earth: I managed that section, I said in the developed world. If you provide a counter-example then I will accept you are correct.')
