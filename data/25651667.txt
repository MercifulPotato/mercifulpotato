It likely would not have much to go on if you gave it the 1024 tokens for the image and then 256 for the text later since it doesn&#x27;t have much of a basis.<p>A network optimizing for both use cases (e.g. the training set is half 256 + 1024, half 1024 + 256) would <i>likely</i> be worse than a model optimizing for one of the use cases, but then again models like T5 argue against it.')
