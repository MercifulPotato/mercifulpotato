Mine was: &quot;defining your needs and striving to fulfil them fully by doing&#x2F;getting as little as possible&quot;.<p>And the main benefit - for me minimalism was the thing that initiated the habit of finding out my true needs. More concretely - I think it can help somebody who has a list of favourite books to read, movies to watch, an elaborate todo list, a &quot;Zettelkasten&quot; notes system, but is somehow for some reason struggling with procrastination or burn out. In my case I think I tracked it down (as weird as it might seem) to my mind wanting&#x2F;needing things which my body had no interest in and, in fact, was actively trying to get rid of.<p>The way minimalism helps with achieving that is quite straight forward - when you start stripping things down you are forced to decide what belongs and what must go. In order to decide you have to ask yourself - what am I really trying to achieve by owning this thing &#x2F; doing this activity &#x2F; writing this book &#x2F; going to these meetings. Then you find out the real goal and gain clarity that allows you to pursue your goals directly.')
