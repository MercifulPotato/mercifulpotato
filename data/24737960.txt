Even if they do the right things now, future leadership may decide to do the opposite and lie about it, values may change, goals shift. Try to treat them as groups of strangers that change every few years, not as individuals with a personality that you somehow feel like you really really know.<p>Still, free-as-in-freedom iPhones? Hell no! I give them money because they are not free-as-in-freedom, but provide a walled garden and defend it for me. I don&#x27;t think I could do this myself; I know lots and lots of people absolutely certainly couldn&#x27;t in the same way that I couldn&#x27;t perform open-heart surgery. On iOS right now it&#x27;s really, really hard to inadvertently give one&#x27;s data, money or identity to any random app, and even for people who are not in the cohort that somehow always accumulates browser toolbars, the security measures by device&#x2F;OS and browser vendors are the only thing that keeps them safe. This is an absolutely huge thing. If they break that, it&#x27;ll wipe out their mobile products.<p>I do wholeheartedly agree that they lock down too much and too hard. I get that it shouldn&#x27;t be easy to side-load software, but making it utterly impossible is a bit too advanced-user-hostile. And this particular action of theirs is wayyy over any line one could draw, and I absolutely think their brand should suffer big time for this.<p>But taking things to the other extreme – free as in freedom – I really don&#x27;t see how that could end well. Give the big app vendors easy, convenient ways to bypass all restrictions and they&#x27;ll make use of it, if only to make development cheaper, and then the small vendors and eventually the shady vendors will follow suit, and we&#x27;re essentially back at the Windows 95 security model with some permission nag screens that no one really cares about anyway, and then everyone gets scammed and flocks to whatever vendor still has a properly secured walled garden. If there is a way to open things up completely while keeping the platform safe and usable for absolute laypeople, I haven&#x27;t read or heard of it. Right now, I vastly prefer a locked-down but completely usable platform to some abstract notion of freedom.')
