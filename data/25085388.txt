Either way, it is nefarious.<p>I&#x27;ve been to every single counter-protest of the proud boys in Portland.<p>Who brings guns? Proud boys, 3%ers, PatPrayer, and Trump supporters.<p>Who doesn&#x27;t bring guns? Counter protestors.<p>Who gets arrested from bringing guns to a protest? No one.<p>Who protects the proud boys? The police.<p>Who gets shot at by police? Counter protestors.<p>I had a gun pointed at me by a Proud Boy amongst his militia several months ago. I&#x27;ve been bear-sprayed but thugs with ARs strapped to their bloated bellies. Don&#x27;t for one instant try to pull this &quot;both sides have mililitias&quot; bullshit.<p>It is so clearly right-wing propaganda.<p>P.S. And I know what  you are about to say next, &quot;But a Trump supporter got shot in portland...&quot; YEs, he did, and it was awful, and then the Feds shot the perp w&#x2F;o due process, while Rittenhouse gets a pat on the back. There were NOT heavily-armed groups of counter protestors on the left, but there sure as hell are from the right, all the time.')
