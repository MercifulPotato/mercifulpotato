Prevalence is the best way to understand the problem.</i><p>-- Guy Rosen, FB VP of Integrity (trust &amp; safety equiv.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;guyro&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337493574246535168?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;guyro&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337493574246535168?s=20</a><p>I&#x27;d really like to have an idea of typical views-per-post (or tweet) distributions on FB or Twitter?  These data don&#x27;t seem to be available.<p>E.g., in a single (hour|day|week|month|year), there might be (note these are <i>entirely fictitious</i> numbers):<p>- 1 post gets &gt;1 billion views<p>- 10 posts get &gt;100m views<p>- 100 posts get &gt;10m views<p>- 1k posts get &gt;1m views<p>- 10k posts get &gt;100k views<p>- 100k posts get &gt; 10k views<p>- 1m posts get &gt; 1k views<p>- 10m posts get &gt; 100 views<p>- 100m posts get &gt; 10 views<p>- 1b posts get &gt; 1 view<p>A few assumptions:<p>- FB sees ~5b pieces of content (+&#x2F;- 10x) daily.<p>- FB has ~2b DAU<p>- Views&#x2F;post follows a Zipf distribution<p>- Daily time-on-site ~ 1hr, 25 items (~2m20s&#x2F;post)<p>- Hence, 50 billion daily views over 5 billion daily items, with a Zipf distribution.<p>- Half of all posts get &lt;2 views (excluding submitter)<p>- Ultimate reach is predictable relatively early based on initial engagement.<p>I&#x27;ve got a hunch the actual numbers aren&#x27;t too far from these numbers (say, factor of ten), for daily exposure.  Though my sense is that actual tends significantly lower.  For Twitter ~ 10--100x <i>lower</i> than FB.<p>Note that predicted prevalence + moderation scale gives capacity to  vet content.  The ability to moderate about 1 million items&#x2F;day (roughly 2,000 human moderators at 500 items&#x2F;person-day) means catching virtually all items reaching &gt; 1,000 people, if not substantially fewer, which is a pretty good harm-minimisation capability.')
