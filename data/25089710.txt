Hence a loss, damage, or theft of your machine means the loss of all passwords saved by Safari.<p>I posted about it here recently: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24626562" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24626562</a><p>I switched to Firefox for this reason. I can&#x27;t afford to lose all my passwords.')
