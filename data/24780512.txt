This is why a very very large percentage of prices end in .90-.99<p>- This seems to be the first time Apple has done this and it sets a bad precedent.<p>- More than the precedent, it seems Apple is willing to do this to derive a little extra revenue, which at least in my mind is a negative for their brand.
