Item(by='t0astbread', descendants=None, kids=[25367982], score=None, time=1607555241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363268, text='This is not exactly a fair comparison because it is documented and configurable but I&#x27;ve recently found out apt on its default settings does something unexpected (for me at least) when removing packages (purge + autoremove): Normally you (I) would expect all automatically installed dependencies (depends&#x2F;recommends&#x2F;suggests) to be gone after this, if no other package references them in its depends&#x2F;recommends lists (which is what gets installed on the default settings).<p>However it turns out if a package suggests another package and that other package <i>somehow</i> gets installed, the suggested package will not be autoremoved anymore because autoremove honors suggests relationships as a reason for not removing automatically installed packages. While there are valid reasons for this (e.g. when installing something with --install-suggests) it also amounts to a lot of unwanted packages after a while of installing&#x2F;uninstalling software. I don&#x27;t know if this has an widespread name but I call it &quot;suggestion congestion&quot; for that.<p>Of course, one can turn this off by setting APT::AutoRemove::SuggestsImportant to &quot;false&quot;. And really, that is an awful problem to solve since you have to deal with different users and package maintainers with different expectations. And apt still solves a lot more problems that it creates.<p>But I&#x27;m now convinced that there is no such thing as a clean uninstall. At least not until the year of the stateless ZFS snapshot rollback NixOS desktop.')
