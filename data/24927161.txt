The result type (promoted type in the C++ case) will still be unsigned, yet will be in most cases (especially small ones) full of 1s where there were zeros, and won’t compute the expected modulus. Draw out the bit patterns of 1’s vs 2’s complement for (say) n=5 and n=65535 and see if I have it wrong.')
