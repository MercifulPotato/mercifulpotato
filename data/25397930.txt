The article also seems to imply that Willem de Groot is the person describing this &quot;feature&quot; as a modern addition to the CSS spec (it isn&#x27;t any such thing).<p>There is no such feature, this attack uses JS eval normally and does not rely on anything special in CSS the language. There isn&#x27;t anywhere near enough novelty here to describe this as anything distinct from any other old-fashioned XSS.<p>Flagged.')
