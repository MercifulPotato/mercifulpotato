The differentiator is the ability to feel pain. Some small bugs (animals) already show no pain response, but most animals do. It is said plant feel pain, but that&#x27;s a different kind of pain than pain in animals.<p>Vegans try --when possible-- not to cause pain on others, or reduce it as much as possible. We&#x27;re against the commodification of animal lives. We (vegans) know that driving a car kills some bugs, and pests are being exterminated in the process of crop production: yet for most of us this is &quot;not possible&quot; to get around, for now.<p>But for most of us it is possible not to consume animal products, wool, silk, go to zoos or buy pet form breeders.')
