And the fact the president did condemn them, repeatedly.<p>Trump passed the most comprehensive criminal justice reform bills of the last 20 years.<p>2020 Trump has the best percentage of vote share among republican presidential candidates from Hispanics, Jews, and African Americans of the past 50 years so maybe he isn&#x27;t quite as racist as he seems.<p>You could believe that school choice is the most important civil rights issue of our time.<p>You think that the government has not right to be mandating lockdowns, school closures, etc.  And have seen many instances of overreach from democrats.<p>Very low trust in the media and other &quot;ruling&quot; elites whom Trump seems to be constantly embattled.<p>There are of course lots of reasons to support Biden.<p>As VP he oversaw a very successfully timeframe of American history, with economic growth, political and social stability.<p>Trump has a tendency to say many things which are dog whistles&#x2F;outright racist.<p>Trump speaks about women in derogatory ways.<p>Instead of bailing out local governments and schools during the coronavirus, Trump was pumping money into large corporations.<p>Biden takes climate change seriously.  We are likely to see a green new deal.<p>Biden is likely to increase social safety nets during a time which is likely filled with economic uncertainty.<p>Biden isn&#x27;t doing saber rattling with China threatening a second cold war.<p>Biden&#x2F;Obama created a peace deal with Iran with the potential to bring stability to the region.<p>Its hard to judge policy, but Biden&#x27;s character is much much more appealing than Trump&#x27;s.<p>Biden is likely to bring a sense of dignity back to the office.<p>Biden is not a divisive figure and can help heal the country.<p>Biden is likely to bring police reform.<p>Trumps response to the coronavirus has been terrible.  He basically left it up to the states instead of showing leadership.  Moreover he was constantly spouting whatever nonsense it was that he was spouting.<p>Biden is likely to try and do something about the growing inequality in the country.<p>Biden has shown he can lead competently.<p>It&#x27;s hard because conservatives and liberals tend to not only have differing personality traits, they tend to have underlying philosophies, priorities and thought patterns (personal anecdote not science).  But we have to find ways to love each other despite our differences.  Much love, I hope Biden does great things for the country and the next four years are prosperous, full of love and happy.')
