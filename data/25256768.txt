Every city has good neighborhoods. What has people scratching their heads is that the worst parts of lot of cities are still a lot better than the bad parts of SF.  When the comparison is between Bangalore or Sao Paulo  and Zurich it&#x27;s easy to write off the difference as simply wealth.  But when the American &quot;shithole cities&quot; like Detroit, Buffalo, Gary, Reno, etc that the people of SF like to sneer at are in fact better in their worst parts than the crown jewel of &quot;muh fifth largest economy&quot; it really makes people wonder what the heck went so wrong.')
