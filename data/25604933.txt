I am not satisfied with that explanation.<p>Why now? And I am seeing this in Germany as well, which of course suffers a social divide, but much less extreme, or existentially threatening, than in the US. I assume the &quot;job exchange&quot; market is a natural monopoly, at least for its respective sections, and <i>now</i> there seems to be a race for it. But weirdly it&#x27;s for the most part all the same: Listings. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a sustainable model, which avoids the problems of the past&#x27;s iterations. Therefore I assume it&#x27;s driven by business folks, not people with ideas.')
