The affidavits exist, representing people that claim to have witnessed certain things.<p>So in a reasonable society with good discourse, we should be saying &quot;wow, that looks serious, so many people claim they witnessed crimes.&quot; followed by &quot;let&#x27;s all do our best to get these infront of a court&#x2F;judge, or get the government entities investigating it so they can be resolved&#x2F;dismissed formally&quot;.<p>Instead, we get information suppression&#x2F;dismissal on the part of Youtube and news outlets, and internet lawyers dismissing things because &quot;it hasn&#x27;t gone in front of a court yet&quot;. Come on man, let&#x27;s solve this and either dismiss them fully or get them investigated. Otherwise we&#x27;re just perpetuating &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and then turning around and complaining about how half the population believes in conspiracy theories.')
