The OCSP request still tells Apple the developer ID, which for some software is just as revealing.<p>For the Tor Browser, the developer ID used with OCSP is:<p><pre><code>    The Tor Project, Inc (MADPSAYN6T)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s certainly enough to tell Apple you are running Tor Browser, Tor itself, or something else from the Tor project!<p>Also that&#x27;s only OCSP which runs often.  Gatekeeper also runs, though only the first time each new executable is run.  Gatekeeper does tell Apple the hash of the application.  That will show up each time you run it after updating to a new version.<p>The stuff about street address etc is wrong, but not completely wrong.  Because the request is sent when you open the application, as a side effect it reveals your approximate location (to anyone third-party eavesdroppers not just Apple) and an accurate timestamp, of the moment when you opened Tor.<p>Of course anyone eavesdropping <i>nearby</i> can detect the Tor traffic itself.  However, only on the paths used to the Tor exit node.  Separate from the Tor traffic, Apple and any routers along the path to Apple (e.g. &quot;great firewall&quot;) can identify devices running Tor from far away, even if they don&#x27;t have direct evidence of Tor traffic from those devices.  I think it quite likely that CCP (among others) will be logging these OCSP requests at the great firewall already.<p>Here&#x27;s a &quot;cleared up&quot; version of the story from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;21569316&#x2F;apple-mac-ocsp-server-developer-id-authentication-privacy-concerns-encryption-promises-fix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;21569316&#x2F;apple-mac-ocsp-...</a> :<p>&gt; the data sent to Apple’s OCSP server contains information relating to an app’s developer but not the app itself. It adds that Apple’s Gatekeeper service can send the hash of an executable, but that this is separate to OCSP and happens over an encrypted connection. Apple’s own support page notes that Gatekeeper uses “an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures.”<p>&gt; In its updated support document, Apple makes clear that security checks it makes when authenticating software do not include a user’s Apple ID or device identity. The company also says it’s stopped logging IP addresses associated with the Developer ID certificate checks. “We have never combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices,” writes the iPhone-maker. “We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are launching or running on their devices.”')
