Because black objects in the real world appear to the viewer as a dark gray.<p>This is all true! <i>On a canvas</i>, painting a black car—which uses actual black paint in real life—using pure black paint, will not look right. The painting is supposed to &quot;have its own light&quot; included. So you must represent what the object would look like under the lighting conditions of the world you&#x27;re recreating. Highlights are not different colors in real life, but they are on a painting.<p>But anyway, so this web designer, fresh from his Art 101 course, decided to write some blog post about it, and it&#x27;s been accepted wisdom ever since.<p>1) We&#x27;re not painting cars here, we&#x27;re writing text. I don&#x27;t load up &quot;dark gray&quot; ink in my fountain pen, nor do I use a &quot;dark gray&quot; toner in my printer. I would much rather the text on my screen be the same.<p>2) Contrast is good for legibility. Make the contrast as sharp as possible. Or, if you don&#x27;t want that harsh look, then darken the background instead of lightening the text. Not too much, just enough to please your aesthetic sense while maintaining readability.')
