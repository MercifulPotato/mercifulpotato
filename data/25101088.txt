Note that `std::array` is still allowed in `std::variant` - just not C-style arrays.<p>As for references, you cannot re-bind references.

I thought it might be because of a destructible requirement on the type, but it turns out there really isn&#x27;t a good reason why they disallowed it, and that a future standard might allow it.<p>In any event, there are a multitude of variant implementations that allow all sorts of things depending on the behavior you want. Nothing is forcing you to use the standard library.')
