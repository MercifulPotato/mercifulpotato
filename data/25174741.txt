So many times, I&#x27;d come home from work, stoked on React, and look at iOS and wish it were declaratively already. I actually took a stab at an open source, declarative UI library that&#x27;s still on GitHub.<p>SwiftUI, IMO, brings the smarts of React, with many dashes of magic that only Apple HIG magic that only Apple could come up with. Definitely, there are plenty of holes today, but I never, ever, ever have to hook up a UITableViewDataSource and a UITableViewDelegate ever again, and for that I am infinitely thankful.<p>Looking purely ahead at SwiftUI and what it will do for Apple platform years from now. I recommend anybody who is thinking about it to try it out.<p>Soon enough, I&#x27;ll forget the signatures of the UITableView stuff, and other UIKit stuff, happily.')
