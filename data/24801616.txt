We are in the process of hiring a piano teacher to help with this as well as with making the program more absolute beginner friendly.<p>This project is a lot of work as it is today, it was made mostly to satisfy a need that I felt myself and my colleagues picked it up and ran with it so now it has some proper power behind it. We fully intend to &#x27;stay the course&#x27; and make this a best-in-class offer but there is a long way to go before we can claim that we have achieved that.<p>As for the satisfaction, I think you may be off the mark there, I&#x27;ve had enough piano education to know what that was like and Luca is having a lot more fun with this program than I ever did being taught the piano by teachers at roughly the same age.')
