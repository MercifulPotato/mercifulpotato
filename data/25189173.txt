Some show 50-60s and other 80s. It also doesn&#x27;t account for the momentum of human markets. If you make a change that&#x27;s bad, it can take decades for the consequences to really hit.<p>We know what happened, the problem is in social science. The biggest subject is whether or not there&#x27;s an actual problem here. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Civil_rights_movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Civil_rights_movement</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_force_in_the_United_States#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:US_Labor_Participation_Rate_by_gender.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_force_in_the_United_Stat...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Act_of_1972" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equal_Employment_Opportunity_A...</a><p>The overall participation rate is still more or less 60% and as women other other minority earned the right to join the workforce. This has been fantastic for our society. Every egalitarian society has benefitted greatly.<p>But now there&#x27;s 20% less men working. What are they doing? Worse yet, this is a competition. So as talented women joined the workforce, they displaced less talented men. That&#x27;s great for the economy. Worse yet, supply vs demand occurs. Supply of labour went up, demand more or less stayed the same. This means wages stagnate or lower. Minimum wage is increased but this only sets wages to stagnate while increasing unemployment.<p>In terms of society, this is fantastic. We have gained much more talent from minority groups. We don&#x27;t have discrimination any more relatively speaking. Overall this is great news.<p>However there&#x27;s a human cost. From the page, 72% of black women having kids outside marriage. Is it because the father is not there or involved or is it because marriage is not a consideration? Marriage is at historic lows. So is birth in general.<p>Now lets say there&#x27;s a problem as per OP&#x27;s assertion. What&#x27;s the fix? Remove civil rights? Hell no. That&#x27;s not the fix.<p>What if the problem is deeper than this? John Keynes said like 100 years ago that we will be down to a 10 hour work week about right now. Yet here we are working 40+ hours.<p>One of the last graphs on that page hits on this. Doctors barely increased whereas &quot;administrators&quot; has greatly increased. Moreso occurring in the 1990s but it&#x27;s telling of the problem. We have people working too much and we have left no room for everyone else. Civil rights increased supply but the same amount of jobs are needed because of productivity increased. So now we have &gt;50% of our society pretending to work. They have a job that does nothing.<p>We need to reduce the supply of labour. We need to go down to like 10-20 hour weeks.')
