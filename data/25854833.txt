If you build fish bowls for them they don’t have a first-order effect on rent prices.<p>This is an attempt to prove the principle of supply and demand (that NIMBYs often reject) from first principles.<p>Of course, the counter-argument from induced demand is “after those 1000 yuppies move in, then 2000 more hear about how good the fish tanks are in Portland and come along and bid up the rest of the housing stock even further”.<p>The degree of induced demand is an empirical question that the author provides some citations around.<p>“Affordable housing” can be a relative term, for example see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.housingwire.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;43818-san-franciscos-definition-of-low-income-is-shocking&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.housingwire.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;43818-san-franciscos-de...</a>.
