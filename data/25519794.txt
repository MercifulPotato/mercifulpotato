Since I didn&#x27;t want to use other apps to consume news, I initially tried to manually personalize my timelines. After several attempts, FB remains a black box, without easy ways to adjust&#x2F;influence the &quot;algorithmic&quot; timeline. I started using Lists on Twitter and manually explore new content. I have tried to hack a tool to diversify the content, and have better success with reddit&#x2F;twitter APIs, FB has strict API. To my surprise, I had better results using RSS feeds + script to cluster content -&gt; slack summaries periodically, (Old) RSS feeds helped to passively monitor good content.<p>It&#x27;s almost 2021, what social media platforms do you still use?. Is it just me, or do you notice such problems with algorithmic timelines.<p>As a user, I just want to have a better algorithmic timelines, with no harmful personalization that cage us in our filter bubble.<p>As a (ML) developer, I want to have a better API&#x2F;system that can enable me to customize or deploy my recommendation&#x2F;news trending models; why do we still need to use one &quot;recommendation model for every user on social platform&quot; that is unknown for end user, I believe user&#x2F;community should have flexibility to deploy their own recsys models.')
