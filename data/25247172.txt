Whether it is CNN or a peer-reviewed journal article, the most information you will get about the author is a name, a picture, and maybe a bit of their publicly available data.<p>With Web of Trust, the level of trust you should assign to an author, and by extension the information, can be instantaneously computed by adding up your own trust references.<p>If I assign my trust responsibly, and you assign your trust to me, then everyone I trust is by extension trustworthy, and the information metadata can reflect this.<p>If you don&#x27;t think I assign my trust responsibly, then you can remove me from your trust circle, and my assigned trust will become irrelevant.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect system, it&#x27;s vulnerable to attacks, it requires eternal vigilance, but it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve got going for us today, IMO.')
