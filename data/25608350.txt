Microtubules, as predicted by Orch OR. It will take a long time for the entrenched interests heavily invested in AI to admit artificial general intelligence is not possible with classical hardware.<p>&gt; Within intra-protein hydrophobic regions, anesthetic gas molecules bind by London force dipole couplings, and thereby (somehow) exert their effects on consciousness. Historically, views of anesthetic action have focused on neuronal membrane proteins, but actual evidence (e.g. from genomics and proteomics), points to anesthetic action in microtubules. In the most definitive anesthetic experiment yet performed, Emerson et al. used fluorescent anthracene as an anesthetic in tadpoles, and showed cessation of tadpole behavior occurs specifically via anthracene anesthetic binding in tadpole brain microtubules. Despite prevailing assumptions, actual evidence supports anesthetic action on microtubules.[1]<p>&gt; I talked about paramecium, single cell organisms which could swim nimbly, find food and mates, avoid obstacles and predators, learn, and have sex, all without synapses, using their microtubules. For information capacity we calculated a billion tubulins per neuron switching at, for example, 10 megahertz, giving 1016 operations per second per neuron, 1027 ‘ops&#x2F;sec’ in the brain. This pushed the AI target for brain equivalence in computers far into the future. ‘Simulate a paramecium before worrying about a brain!’, I insisted — I became unpopular among AI people, and remain so.[2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S1571064513001188" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S157106451...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantumconsciousness.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;SHameroffJCSConscMicroandOrchORASpacetimeOdyssey2014.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantumconsciousness.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;SHa...</a>')
