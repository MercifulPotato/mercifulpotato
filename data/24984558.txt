Planet Earth. Please work and build understanding towards ascending above all borders, both physical and mental.<p>I am a homo sapiens, a living being from this Universe. Born on the Planet Earth. My mother and father were also homo sapiens. Their mothers and fathers too. Several million generations before, their mothers and fathers were some types of primates, who knows.<p>I respect the languages my mother and father and their mothers and fathers spoke and taught me, but I do not want to be limited to those.<p>Therefore, I also tried to learn few other languages. To name some well-known: English. Deutsch. Italian. Basic. Pascal. C. C++. Forth. Modula II. Logo. Lisp. Fortran. Cobol. Java. Javascript. Probably few more that I don&#x27;t remember :)<p>Some of them I only studied on paper, without any direct opportunity to apply it in real life. I studied those, just for the sake of studying.<p>I love to listen to people speaking in many languages and I love when people use many dialects of the same language, that are so different to each other that they barely understand themselves.<p>Diversity should be considered a blessing.')
