So a well-behaved app using OS libraries for everything it can, and really only driving the business logic itself, would be running mostly-native with the business logic emulated&#x2F;translated.<p>(This is hopes&#x2F;dreams&#x2F;speculation with no insider knowledge.)<p>If Windows could do the same, then letting windows-arm do the translation of windows-x86&#x2F;64 binaries would allow it to leverage windows-arm libraries - so an app could be running in mostly-virt with some-emu.  If we let parallels&#x2F;qemu&#x2F;etc do the emu, it can only ever be 100% emu.')
