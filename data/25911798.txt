I read almost all his books in the past year.<p>I want to re-read Siddhartha soon, after only like 8 months. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really about Buddhism persay. Hesse uses it to get across some ideas. The main point was that Siddhartha realized the oneness of the world, in that each part is not a distinct entity - because that &quot;distinct entity&quot; is defined by it&#x27;s relations to everything else. The realization brings him joy to consider himself not second class, but simply part of it all. Right?')
