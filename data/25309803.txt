No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week...<p>And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored.</i><p>According to her account, she was not given the feedback when she was told that the paper had to be retracted.  After discussion, she was told her manager would read her the feedback without telling her who wrote it or what process was followed.<p>This is different than a normal peer review process that, anonymous or not, aims to provide feedback to the author so they can incorporate it.')
