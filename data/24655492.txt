Item(by='roywiggins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601582023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24654830, text='Ed: From the indictment, page 8: &quot;BitMEX personnel... conducted BitMEX operations from an office in Manhattan, New York, including but not limited to customer support, business development, and marketing, involving customers located in the United States and elsewhere .&quot;<p>If[0] they posted on American forums or solicited customers on American-hosted sites, they operated in the US for the purposes of the law. You don&#x27;t have to physically be somewhere to be subject to the law there. Ditto wire and mail fraud that originates overseas.<p>Mailing a pipebomb from Canada to the US is illegal in Canada, but it&#x27;s also illegal in the US, even if it was done by a Canadian citizen who didn&#x27;t step foot here.<p>Operating outside American AML&#x2F;KYC law is not quite the same as mailing a pipe bomb, but the jurisdictional issue is hard to distinguish.<p>[0] (this remains to be proven)')
