Really fun, except, coming from MtG, it became obvious to me to build an engine with +cards and +actions. My last 2 hands I cycled through my entire deck multiple times until I played basically every card. This seemed a bit tedious, overpowered, and easily achievable. Having only played 1 game though, I&#x27;m not sure: is this how almost all games are won?')
