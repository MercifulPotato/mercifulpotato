As a rule of thumb if you can&#x27;t imagine yourself being close friends with this person, it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to have them as a co-founder. It&#x27;s a much more important, long-term, and intimate relationship than a simple partnership or internship is. I&#x27;d suggest hanging out with prospective co-founders exhaustively, including plenty of idle, personal, and off-topic conversations before committing, and to remember that just like dating, there&#x27;s a decent chance it may not be the perfect fit, so you have to be willing to move on and try again if so.')
