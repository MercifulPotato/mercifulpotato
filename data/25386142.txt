Money can affect developer productivity, but it takes time to realize its value.  Money makes things easier.  That person whose being paid the smallest amount possible, is probably trying to just scrape by.  Paying people more money frees their personal life up to handle other things, less stress about family stuff etc.  I never believed the &quot;leave your personal life at the door,&quot; thing.  How you live affects your work, and making life easier makes people more productive (on average, not all cases).  Now this isn&#x27;t an immediate thing.  It&#x27;s an investment and it takes time.  The person has to realize that money is available (emotionally) and start to trust it will be there.')
