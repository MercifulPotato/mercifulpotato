It&#x27;s a larger company these days, so I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find different answers. I&#x27;ve been at the company for some time and I personally enjoy it a lot. High degree of autonomy to solve problems, good company culture, great teammates etc. If I were to find an area of improvement, it&#x27;s around finding the balance of alignment and getting stuff done across org boundaries.<p>Feel free to reach out if you have more specific areas you want to know more of.')
