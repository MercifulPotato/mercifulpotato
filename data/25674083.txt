Jeff is liquidating ~1 billion a year just to fund his space company. Zuckerberg sold $280 million in 1 month in 2020 for walking around money.<p>No they can’t liquidate their entire position. They do have effectively almost unlimited financial reserves through multiple different channels. Said another way, they have $10s of billions in buying power even if they can’t access that entire wealth instantly as cash.')
