Diverse work is good. Also good is going on working on a single project from idea to production to maintaining. Breadth and depth. Technical skills will happen as a consequence.<p>Experience will also teach you working with people. Verbal warfare is a reality. You need not be hostile, but you will learn how to hold your own. Most people are driven by persuasion and not technical reasoning.<p>You need to think multiple steps ahead, and act on it, without showing all your cards.<p>Finally, to yourself, you must be 100% honest. Don&#x27;t bullshit yourself. Work hard. &quot;Be the hardest working person in the room&quot;.<p>Find happiness in the work rather than the results. Results may or may not go your way.')
