Item(by='rhn_mk1', descendants=None, kids=[24953739], score=None, time=1604141244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945372, text='&gt; This is not really true, law is a means of resolving and preventing disputes by codifying acts and their consequences so as to allow social coordination.<p>But it is true: consequences must be related to what is good&#x2F;allowed and what isn&#x27;t. So law <i>is</i> a moral code, but not only that.<p>&gt; we seek the minimum viable ruleset that allows us to live in peace and leave questions of morality up to the individual<p>That&#x27;s where my confusion stems from: neither abolishing copyright is that, nor are the 4 rules of Free Software. Since the author finds both acceptable, why favor one over the other?<p>&gt; Moral because ideas are not scarce&#x2F;rivalrous and so not properly considered property<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but neither the four freedoms, nor abolishing copyright depend on treating software as property.<p>&gt; because law as an instrument is wielded by interested parties who have disproportionate power<p>I&#x27;m also not sure if I get the reference. The author opposes copyleft on the grounds that it&#x27;s based on copyright, which they oppose to, but copyleft as a legal trick would no longer be needed with the four freedoms being law.<p>Maybe to clarify my confusion, this fragment:<p>&gt; I would support the right of persons to publish binary programs while making its source code obfuscated or impossible to attain. This is a clear violation of the four essential freedoms as described by the Free Software Foundation. Yet, it would be legal---but perhaps not ethical---to do it in a world in which intellectual property does not exist.<p>The author is clearly in moral agreement in the four freedoms, but advocates allowing people to break them in the ideal world. Since the ideal world is just as impractical in terms of minimum viable rule set, why not simply use the four freedoms as the moral base?')
