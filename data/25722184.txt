Languages don’t work that way and seeing how C&#x2F;C++ have evolved (or really failed to do so at a meaningful pace), I’m under the impression (clearly unpopular due to the downvotes) that standardization and multiple competing tool chains are the cause of a lot of unnecessary complexity (not just within the language but also users of said language).')
