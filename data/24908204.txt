I take some precautions, and want to be considerate to those more worried about their odds, but I&#x27;d much rather not give up a large percentage of the precious time I have left in this world hiding from something that has less than a one in a thousand chance happening to me.<p>Rather than quibble over numbers I&#x27;m curious if you interpret the same numbers differently? Do you think 1 in 8000 is statistically significant?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2598-9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2598-9</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;coronavirus-age-sex-demographics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;coronavirus-age-se...</a>')
