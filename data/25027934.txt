Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the autobiography&#x2F;memoir he published in July this year (&quot;The Answer is... Reflections on My Life&quot;) that I thought was touching:<p>With the coronavirus, [our family] can&#x27;t go out to eat, we can&#x27;t go out to public places, even the park next door has limited its use. Here I am wanting to enjoy what might be the last of my days, and, what, I&#x27;m supposed to just stay at home and sit in a chair and stare into space? Actually, that doesn&#x27;t sound too bad.<p>Except instead of a chair, I&#x27;ll sit on the swing out in the yard. That&#x27;s my favorite spot on the whole property. I used to do it with Mom. Just sit there and rock. No need to talk.<p>It&#x27;s just very peaceful. I suppose the feeling I have sitting on that porch swing is similar to what people feel when they meditate, though I would never call it meditating. I just consider it goofing off, not doing anything.<p>Yep, I&#x27;ll be perfectly content if that&#x27;s how my story ends: sitting on the swing with the woman I love, my soul mate, and our two wonderful children nearby. I&#x27;ll sit there for a while and then maybe the four of us will go for a walk,  each day trying to walk a little farther than the last.  We&#x27;ll take things one step at a time, one day at a time.<p>In fact, I think I&#x27;ll go sit in the swing for a bit right now. The weather is beautiful â€” the sun is shining into a mild, mild looking sky, and there&#x27;s not a cloud in sight.<p>(copied from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextavenue.org&#x2F;alex-trebek-in-his-own-words" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextavenue.org&#x2F;alex-trebek-in-his-own-words</a> which has a couple more excerpts from the memoir)')
