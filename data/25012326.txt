Until I graduated a few years ago, I&#x27;d take the Vancouver to Seattle route about once a year to meet friends or interview and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever had anything I would describe as a good experience in my dozen or so trips.<p>First, there seemed to some major issue with every other ride. One time the vents started leaking, in another the shocks were absolutely horrid, sometimes the bus reeked, sometimes the seats were dirty or you could feel the seat springs. One time the driver just didn&#x27;t show up and our bus departed 4 hours after the scheduled time.<p>Second, more minor issues were always abundant. Things like broken or glacial wifi, power not working, stench, dirty terminals, dirty washrooms, annoying passengers, late departures&#x2F;arrivals or general confusion from poorly documented check-in&#x2F;pickup&#x2F;dropoff locations.')
