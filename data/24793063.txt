Pre-COVID, it was unusual to go a week without seeing someone going the wrong way. It was not unusual to see this multiple times in a day.<p>I also bike down a two-way separated bike lane to&#x2F;from work. It&#x27;s separated by concrete barriers, except at intersections. I&#x27;d come across drivers trying to drive down them, again, roughly weekly.<p>It&#x27;s <i>predictable</i> that I&#x27;ll see a car turn the wrong way onto a one-way street, and I&#x27;ve learned to anticipate it, but it&#x27;s not <i>accepted</i>.<p>Most drivers are okay, but there&#x27;s a small number who are really bad. If you come across a hundred drivers a day, you&#x27;re going to come across bad ones pretty often.<p>The author didn&#x27;t say every driver sucked -- just that he regularly comes across drivers who suck. I&#x27;m willing to bet that most road users will assert the same experience.<p>Most drivers pass safely, and several times a week, one won&#x27;t.
