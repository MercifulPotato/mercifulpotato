I&#x27;m arguing one should be extremely careful, however. Natural language doesn&#x27;t have deduction. It doesn&#x27;t have definitions. It doesnt&#x27;t have ways to restrict us from making vague statements. It is subject to non-unique interpretations.\nThis is particularly relevant when technicians and scientists speak to the general public. Let me quote one of your examples:<p>&gt; &quot;the classifier thinks this roadsign is a truck&quot; everyone knows you mean &quot;the classifier has labeled this roadsign as a probably a truck with a high confidence&quot;.<p>The fact that the classification is probabilistic is obvious to me and to you, but nothing in the natural wording suggests that, and it&#x27;s a pretty important caveat.<p>It&#x27;s not enough for us to understand the limitations of natural language, everyone in the conversation has to, for it to be a useful tool.')
