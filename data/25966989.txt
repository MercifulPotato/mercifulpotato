Black-and-white TV was the default for decades.  Almost nobody judged televisions by their lack of color because hardly anyone beyond those who subscribed to Popular Mechanics even knew that color was a possibility.<p>The 1948 date is meaningless.  Most American households didn&#x27;t have a color TV until the very late 1960&#x27;s, or even into the 1970&#x27;s.  TV stations didn&#x27;t broadcast in color until the late 1960&#x27;s, and even then most of the programs were in black and white.  I remember when color TV broadcasts first became possible and the TV networks crowing before each color show &quot;In color!&quot; the way they did &quot;In stereo (where available)!&quot; in the 1990&#x27;s.<p>When color TVs did become well-known and started becoming common, it was usually the parent&#x27;s bedroom or the living room that had the big color TV, and all the remaining televisions in the house were back-and-white.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t have a color TV until 1983, and that was only to use as a computer monitor.')
