This will push into asking the question &quot;what command can do X?&quot; and &quot;how do I connect command X to command Y?&quot; and &quot;how do loop commands over output?&quot;. Then just keep doing that over and over again.<p>Learn the shell chainsaw: `xargs`. `xargs -L` vs `xargs` and `xargs -I` (examples will say use `{}` but I&#x27;m partial to `xargs -I @` because that works with Fish and Bash, plus it&#x27;s a single character.')
