Easy opioid prescriptions created thousands of (mostly) functional addicts who were getting their fix in a high-quality control form via their doctor on a monthly basis.  That&#x27;s bad but that&#x27;s not an opioid &quot;crisis&quot;.  You don&#x27;t get a crisis because of a few evil billionaires.  More things have to go wrong.  What really turned the opioid problem into a crisis is when the feds cracked down.  The doctors had to cut the junkies off or lose their licenses.  The junkies predictably switched to the street for their supply with predictably tragic results.<p>The Sacklers may have done unethical, arguably evil, things to make a buck but there&#x27;s plenty of blame that should be cast in the direction of other parties here.')
