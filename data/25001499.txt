But this is mitigated a bit by the fact that EVs tend to require massively less maintenance and spare parts.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, Tesla does not do <i>service</i> really well and that&#x27;s something they will have to get down if they are going to get into commercial vehicles. Even if they require vastly less ongoing service, they need to have that service be good. I&#x27;ve heard of Tesla owners having to wait several weeks for parts, for a commercial vehicle that&#x27;s a no-go.')
