This seems like the sort of thing that should be using OpenStreetMap&#x27;s database as a backend. Most long distance walks will be in there already, so the site could just pipe that data and add some more photos.<p>This could be another &quot;special interest&quot; map backed by OSM, like OpenInfraMap [1], OpenRailwayMap [2], OpenTopoMap [3], etc.<p>(Edit to add, because otherwise this comment might come across as unintentionally negative: this is still cool and could become really useful with some more categories and sorting tools. Good work!)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openinframap.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openinframap.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openrailwaymap.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openrailwaymap.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentopomap.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentopomap.org&#x2F;</a>')
