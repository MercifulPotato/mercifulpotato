Here&#x27;s an alternative I used -  though for a product not as an &quot;indie hacker&quot;, so maybe not applicable.<p>- It took a bit more than a year.<p>- Meanwhile count users, not revenue. (need a free version)<p>- Marketing, not &quot;sales&quot;. Your product does a useful thing, for people with some need. Create a &quot;pitch&quot; - a short, memorable description of the problem and your solution. The idea is <i>word of mouth</i>: people repeat your pitch to someone who needs it, like a virus. (A meme, by Dawkins&#x27; original definition). Free sales and advertising.<p>- Focus on the product, not yourself. Like Feynmann saying his nerves disappear when focussed on the thing he&#x27;s talking about (not him). Avoids self-consciousness.<p>Less efficient than sales and advertising, but a way to make money without them.')
