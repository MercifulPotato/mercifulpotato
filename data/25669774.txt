It&#x27;s all an honor system, in a government without much honor. We, quite frankly, have no way to know if votes are being counted correctly or honestly.<p>As much as I disbelief Trump&#x27;s claims of this election being rigged by democrats, the claims that we have excellent election security are false too. We have a huge chunk of the country openly lying about election results, and another half lying about election security. Two lies don&#x27;t make a truth.<p>If our current elections aren&#x27;t being manipulated, you can bet future ones will be. It&#x27;s easy for an organized state agent to do, and if it wasn&#x27;t being done before, it will be now. And fixing this will be almost impossible post-Trump, because Democrats.')
