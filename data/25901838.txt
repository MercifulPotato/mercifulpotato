I wonder if it&#x27;s related to my aspie, literal brain wiring.<p>In my head, it read like, &quot;Symbol for monkey emoji. New symbol. Symbol for banana emoji with new symbol below it, and to the right.&quot;<p>I certainly didn&#x27;t get anywhere near &quot;eat.&quot;<p>I was comfortably conversant in English before I was 2, and I&#x27;ve learned Spanish, Greek, and Hebrew reasonably well, so it&#x27;s not my language ability, or even learning with non-Latin alphabets, though I suppose it could be trying to learn without an alphabet at all?
