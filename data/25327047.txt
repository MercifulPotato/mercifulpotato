And then second, profiling this kind of code is not easy; I don&#x27;t know what tooling there is nowadays but when I was playing with Linux in the 90s each iteration would involve a reboot, and staring at printk output.  So there is a tendency to write code the author thinks is faster - which may or may not be true but is probably likely for experienced developers.')
