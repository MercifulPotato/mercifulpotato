We normally played 80+20 time control (each player has 80 minutes for the game, with an additional 20 seconds added to their clock after each move), which gives <i>way</i> more time for in-depth analysis of the positions that you can get with the default time controls on lichess.<p>Chess becomes a negative experience if you put too much importance on winning, which I have done a couple of times. If you can make winning important enough that you try hard, but not so important that losing is crushing, then I think it&#x27;s a great hobby.')
