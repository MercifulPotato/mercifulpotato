On the other hand, areas with hands-off sales usually have very shoddy local services and shit maintenance.<p>My parents live in a relatively cheap area in a Middle Eastern city, where you can&#x27;t buy the property, but only lease it for 99 years, yet the services there are far better than those in the more &quot;glitzy&quot; uptown areas with more expensive flats. It was the same story when I was flat-hunting in Singapore - locals prefer living in the HDBs while renting out the freeholds.')
