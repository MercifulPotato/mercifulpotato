If you want to repeat earlier sections, you should, and you can, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the text book needs to repeat the content. The lesson plans can use the book non-linearly.<p>Depending on the specific math course, it can be the case that later topics contain earlier topics anyway, so a final with only problems from the end will also cover techniques from the beginning and middle. Certainly, that&#x27;s not always the case.')
