(Which, in the case of many cities may well not be in the city in the case of tech-related jobs.)<p>People tend to bias their activities to what they can do relatively easily. If you don&#x27;t own a car and don&#x27;t have a lot of space, you&#x27;re probably not going to take up some space-intensive hobby or head off on a lot of weekends to hike or canoe. Maybe you&#x27;ll lean a bit on friends with cars--though that tends to get harder as people get older and busy with their own activities. And maybe you&#x27;ll rent a car now and then. But mostly you&#x27;ll fall into activities that don&#x27;t have a lot of overhead associated with them.')
