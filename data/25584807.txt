In hindsight so much of this seems obvious - masks, effective targetted lockdowns, restrict travel, stockpiling medical equipment, etc. These are commonsense observations clear to observers in January 2020 - but they come with very considerable costs. The effectiveness of each of these measures is also nebulous, and how much we weigh them has also changed. How effective any of these measures will be against the next pandemic is also unclear. Next time it may not be a respiratory illness.')
