To discuss, prioritize and act on very serious (though, hopefully, unlikely to materialize) risks, we need a scale of &quot;horribleness&quot; that doesn&#x27;t just give every serious problem a 10 out of 10. We need to reasonably prioritize our actions among many potentially dystopian risks - if consider a single one of them an negative infinity, a <i>literal</i> &quot;AVOID AT ALL COSTS&quot;, then those &quot;all costs&quot; include increased vulnerability to other risks, and that&#x27;s not appropriate.')
