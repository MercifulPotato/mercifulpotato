Their ads are the supplies they use to make their product. It works out to 4 million a year, although I doubt they were spending anywhere near that much starting off (which is why I think they could be past the point of the public&#x27;s perception of a small business).<p>It would be like looking at how much a small business fabricator spent on metal and other supplies. That number is going to be larger than what they actually bring in as profit. If ads aren&#x27;t your supplies then it would absolutely be an indication of being a large business if you spent $57 million on marketing.')
