Item(by='pessimizer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609362307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585233, text='1) US foreign aid generally consists of money earmarked to buy goods from specific cronies in the US for specific elites in the target country. This lagniappe creates influence over those elites that greases other private import&#x2F;export political&#x2F;banking schemes between that country and large US firms.<p>2) That aid is generally also contingent on not taking aid from designated US state enemies like Russia and China, who are often eager to create the same relationship with the target country. Our eternal aid to Egypt, for example, would be happily replaced almost instantly if we withdrew it, along with any Egyptian weapons and infrastructure contracts with US firms.<p>Foreign aid is not charity.')
