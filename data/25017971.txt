A lot of people have been noting his authoritarian tendencies and expressing concern that he might refuse to acknowledge election results, and while that appears to be the case, there&#x27;s no indication that he will have his way (apart from legal proceedings, which are a perfectly democratic [albeit petulant] way to contest election results). In some countries, a president demanding a stop to vote counting might get their way, but that didn&#x27;t happen here, and it&#x27;s good to know that for the endless flack (some fair and some not) America and Americans get, we still have a robust political system.')
