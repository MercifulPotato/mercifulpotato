I definitely perceive an increasing lack of personal responsibility across the board honestly. A lot of the identity politics&#x2F;victim one-upmanship stems from this IMO, but I&#x27;m glad you presented the other side of it, that people don&#x27;t want to take any responsibility for when they are actually an asshole either. Not to &quot;both sides&quot; it, but I believe it&#x27;s deeply concerning how people seem to have fallen away from proper introspection. Which can manifest in bad ways on both sides indeed.')
