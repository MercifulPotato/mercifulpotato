WhatsApp scaled their software with over 10m users per engineer on their team.<p>I read an article a few years ago about how StackOverflow ran (still?) their entire site off just 6 physical computers or something. And before you claim its because they have hand written assembly everywhere - nope. Their code is just clean C#.<p>I adore Kafka - I think its a lovely way to build scalable software. But almost every website out there will never need to scale past what a simple postgres + rails&#x2F;nodejs&#x2F;whatever + nginx setup can provide, assuming each of those pieces is set up correctly. And you personally probably aren&#x27;t working on software at that scale.<p>I personally also suspect we can make the experience of building on top of event sourcing better than the experience of building on top of a traditional database, because decoupling reads from writes gives you more architecture options. But I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet.')
