You need to compare buying a house to renting a house or apartment or whatever. People do view houses as investments, sure, but I think that&#x27;s fundamentally misleading. Compare the basic cash flow of the different options available. Figure out how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for being close to work, close to friends, having more or less space, being in a walkable neighbourhood or whatever else matters. As much as I enjoy the illusory dollar value gains of home ownership, ultimately I had to work within the confines of my budget.<p>Also I think this line of thought is also misleading: &quot;For most people, their home investment represents a large part of their net worth.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s true but it&#x27;s because of inflated house prices and reflects the fact that Americans don&#x27;t save that much. Again, just treat a house as a liability and not an asset and suddenly this is meaningless and we can get back to managing cash flows and thinking about increasing savings. (Although as a side note, being very aggressive savers isn&#x27;t necessarily great for a country as a whole, Germany is very conflicted about it&#x27;s very high savings rates - for example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;why-cant-germans-stop-saving-money&#x2F;a-46017138" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;why-cant-germans-stop-saving-money&#x2F;a-4...</a>)')
