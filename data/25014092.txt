Nor would they advise a diabetic to abstain from carbs, and so take away the trigger for their condition.  (Ie - you don&#x27;t have diabetes if you don&#x27;t eat carbs.)  99.9% of doctors will only prescribe drugs.<p>The medical industry is not about well - its about maximising illness for profit.  And improving diet and eating behaviour is the last thing they will do - there&#x27;s no money in that!')
