Booleandilemma is actually busy on other work at the moment, and needs to be able to focus on that. Please send these requests to me, rather than to booleandilemma, and I will get take care of prioritising them. If we need to discuss this further I&#x27;d be happy to jump on a call with you.<p>&gt; Thanks, and have a nice day<p>&gt; Booleandilemma&#x27;s boss<p>I guess we can dream :)<p>(But seriously, as a manager, this is what I&#x27;d likely try to do. I&#x27;d check with you first, to see how you felt about the situation, of course. Being CC&#x27;d is an invitation to get involved on behalf of my team)')
