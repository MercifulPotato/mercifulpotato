I guess the easiest solution would be to make it a submodule so that it could evolve at its own pace, but then you still want to be able to reference specific versions of the code in the comments, so maybe it would make more sense to make the code a submodule of the issue repo.<p>Maybe with good tooling that would be workable with git as it is.')
