We should look to the field of modern psychology for answers about our emotions, not philosophy. We understand the brain a lot better now than we did in Aristotle&#x27;s time.<p>Anger&#x27;s neurological function is to motivate action. It originates in the unconscious parts of the brain, and like all emotions it can arise involuntarily. It sounds like your girlfriend was putting her anger to use in a way that it&#x27;s neurologically well adapted for (though absolutely in an immoral and unhealthy way).<p>Most individuals possess some degree of ability to consciously regulate their emotions (brain damage reduces this ability, many other factors like genetics or past trauma can too). So after you experience anger you can influence what you do next.<p>Modern psychology generally recognizes that like most emotions, anger has value but how you process it is key. Rationally examining the roots of your anger can defuse or redirect it and is the principle behind cognitive behavioral therapy and similar modern therapies.<p>Repression isn&#x27;t a healthy way of handling anger, it only builds up, becomes internalized, and resurfaces later in ways that are harder to understand. I think it&#x27;s better to express your anger (there are limitations of course, we don&#x27;t get a free pass to run around punching people, but venting to a friend is healthy).<p>In my opinion as someone who buried his anger for 20 years, the key to handling it is to understand where it <i>really</i> comes from, and then harness the energy it generates to act in a way which addresses the root cause. To use the article&#x27;s example of theft, if you get really angry because someone stole from you, maybe your emotion originates from a history of financial distress. If so then you may be able to change your actions, channel that energy into building financial security, and not experience this distress in the future. Anger in this situation becomes a force for clarity, good and purpose because you acknowledged, channelled and examined it. I think as a society we&#x27;re in a place where we allow ourselves to be angry all the time, but couch it in superficial righteousness instead doing the uncomfortable processing work and owning our own role in it.')
