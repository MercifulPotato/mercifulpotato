He was an incredible teacher, and the ladies who got to dance with him to demonstrate moves were absolutely blushing.  It’s such a shame that he spent so many years undeservedly in obscurity.  I like to think that he knew how much he meant to so many people, but it doesn’t replace what he should have had.  A wonderful dancer and a wonderful man.')
