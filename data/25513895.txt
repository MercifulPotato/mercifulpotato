I just upgraded my home network to have 10gig on my NAS and my primary desktop workstation, the possibilities it opens up are really amazing and the whole project was about $400 including switch (my existing main switch already had a 10gig uplink but I needed another), 2 NICs and cables. Still not within reach of everybody, but when I priced it out 10gigE ended up being <i>cheaper</i> than 2.5gigE.')
