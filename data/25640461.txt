You really can&#x27;t. You can easily prove you&#x27;ve been working on leetcode problems. If they don&#x27;t want to hire people with short stays, you can&#x27;t really fix that. If they don&#x27;t want to hire people who haven&#x27;t practiced leetcode, you can fix that. So to an employer, does it really matter if you are good at leetcode if they feel you won&#x27;t stay around long? So the tenure takes precedence.<p>Some companies won&#x27;t care, but finding those is just about as easy as finding a company that&#x27;s a good fit before you&#x27;ve worked there.')
