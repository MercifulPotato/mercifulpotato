I&#x27;ve seen a few companies with a prototype built on ROS and they universally struggle to get it from a basic demonstrator to a production system until they ditch ROS because it&#x27;s just so poorly engineered. Everything you gain in the short term from having a nicely integrated system with a bunch of existing libraries gets more than offset by how buggy, difficult to debug, slow, and incomplete each part of it is, relative to basically any other alternative. Especially because it defaults to a distributed system which basically takes your existing problem and makes many new and exciting ones to go along with it (and neither ROS nor most of its users&#x2F;developers are well equipped to solve distributed problems reliably).')
