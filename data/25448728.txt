The default theme on every platform (Metal) was really ugly. Everything was purple. The &quot;native&quot; look and feel was emulated (poorly). It was also very slow. That&#x27;s the reasons why SWT was started in the first place. Swing would just not cut it for any app that wanted a nice UI.<p>Nowadays the situation is completely different. Swing looks and performs great compared to SWT. IMO it would make much more sense to just use Swing.<p>JavaFX never happened. People just went web instead. No one uses it and it&#x27;s officially deprecated.')
