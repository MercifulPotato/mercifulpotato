They don&#x27;t need to be hot-swappable (which is what you appear to be referring to) but they absolutely do need to be removable.<p>Trucks can go for hundreds of miles between stops and breaks. Battery technology does not currently exist that allows for the necessary charging in the timeframes on which trucking works.')
