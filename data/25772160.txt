When my parents came to America as refugees, they wanted to come to CA specifically because there was already a community and an understanding that the social programs were better than the alternative of TX.<p>Of course they tried to take advantage of programs like food stamps. They took advantage of it because they met what the government considered as qualified. The alternative, which my parents did have to do at times, was skipping meals so their kids had enough to eat. It&#x27;s not taking advantage of a system if the people meet the requirements. No one says they&#x27;re taking advantage of a coupon at a grocery store, it&#x27;s there to be used.')
