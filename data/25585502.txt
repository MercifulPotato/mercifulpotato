I&#x27;m pretty sure at this point ARM CPUs outnumbers x86 by a significant margin. Android + iOS + embedded ARM... it&#x27;s big.<p>Aside from this, I would suggest that what&#x27;s far more important than general &quot;X is bigger than Y&quot; discussions, knowing what your target platform is more important. If you are doing Mac or iOS programming, switching to M1 is inevitable and the only question is whether it&#x27;s worth waiting for the next M series processor or not.<p>If you are writing Windows software... this isn&#x27;t even a consideration.<p>Right now the toolchains for building a lot of OSS are in a state of flux. Some work with the M1 but most are in progress or beta at best. So if you lean heavy on OSS, you are likely on Rosetta and not really benefitting from the M1 regardless.')
