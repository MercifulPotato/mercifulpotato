The US has failed to enforce incredible amounts of money laundering through traditional currencies.  Whether that failure is the result of incompetence or something more sinister is the question.<p>Outside of a cultural movement toward more anarchist, distributed power systems, I can&#x27;t see anything good coming from the state dipping its heels into more data streams like this.  It&#x27;s largely obvious that the US government, for the foreseeable future, is largely dissonant from what&#x27;s actually good for its public.  Drugs are a fairly powerful anecdote illustrating that end: opiate producers (like most capitalist businesses) aren&#x27;t punished for causing a nation-wide epidemic, while users of proportionally less harmful drugs like LSD, MDMA, or Marijuana are punished quite harshly.')
