Others have different ones.<p>When other folks share <i>their</i> opinions&#x2F;perspective, it gives me an opportunity to examine my own preconceptions -- which usually winds up giving me a better understanding of the topic at hand.<p>Granted, in a setting like HN, there will be those who will be uncharitable or dismissive, and those voices can be ignored.<p>However, those who criticize specific stuff and provide the assumptions&#x2F;reasoning&#x2F;thought processes behind those criticisms can provide valuable insight into how you and&#x2F;or your product&#x2F;service are perceived outside of your small circle of shared views and assumptions.<p>I hope the bulk of the comments here are of the latter kind rather than the former, and that you get new perspectives that can drive positive growth for your activities.')
