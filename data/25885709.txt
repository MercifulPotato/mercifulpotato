In modern systems when running a java created binary, I find it runs much slower on a mac, then on a PC especially.  Not sure, but I find the ui jitters and stalls (imagine running heavy app in a vm container) when there is a lot of data pulling from a remote site.<p>Is there a way to drive performance to the JVM, or shed light to what might be the cause? Thoughts to why a much older pc with less memory, worst memory card, seems to perform flawlessly.<p>Here to look for any other solutions I could try.  I love to be working on the mac, but like to have the performance I find when running the java app (with ui elements) on a pc.  Something that comes to mind at the moment is maybe trying here a remote desktop to a windows machine to see if performance is better than running natively on the mac.<p>Sorry in advanced for the slight vagueness on the specific app running and lack of specs provided.')
