Windows tries hard to assign unique and persistent internal &quot;name&quot; to every device it has even seen, the resulting device record then has bunch of named attributes which are used to match correct driver to it. In context of USB there are two problems with this otherwise pretty clever and universal design: there are pretty common edge cases when the &quot;unique and persistent&quot; name is neither and then there are drivers (including drivers supplied by MS as part of windows itself) that match on wrong attributes.')
