I ended up using a strategy where I would write the config in the language that I would eventually use it in (for my blog, my entries became typescript files).<p>I think perhaps protobufs (specifically text format protos) are a potentially really nice solution, since you get to leverage the protobuf type system. Unfortunately the support for them is a bit lacking.... (afaik, no formal spec - thereâ€™s a canonical implementation in C++; no editor support for things like linting and completions).')
