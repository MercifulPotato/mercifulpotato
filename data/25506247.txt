Still using the &quot;Auria&quot; monitor that I purchased at Microcenter back around 2012.  Cost maybe $300-350 for a 2560x1440 IPS monitor at a time when you were easily looking at $500-800+ for a similar panel from a name brand.<p>Now, if you were a professional, that quality control and warranty (not to mention better ergonomics, etc.) were easily worth the added cost, but for just &quot;some dude who liked playing video games and doing some photo&#x2F;video editing&quot;, it was a great bang for the buck.<p>I still use this as my main monitor and haven&#x27;t noticed any dead pixels (if there are any, they&#x27;re so hard to see that they may as well not be there).  It&#x27;s not the best monitor out there and you can probably get a better 2560x1440 display for less now, but at the time it was a big improvement over the cheap 1920x1080 display that quickly got demoted to secondary (and has now been loaned indefinitely to a teacher friend who needed a second monitor to plug into her laptop for online classes).')
