When launching Factorio I use 90% of my 8GB RAM and never once have I noticed data corruption, and I could tell you how many hours I&#x27;ve played but that would be embarrassing.<p>The test I did in school with heated-up RAM (the internet said that&#x27;s when flips should occur more often) also wrote many many gigabytes without a single failure.<p>Not sure what hardware or temperatures that source is running but it&#x27;s not DDR3&#x2F;DDR4 at heats below hairdryer melting temperature because that&#x27;s where I had to stop the experiment with zero failures.')
