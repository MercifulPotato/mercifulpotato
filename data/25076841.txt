Too often the answer to that questions boils down to &#x27;ammunition for the blame game&#x27;.<p>If your engineers can&#x27;t deliver value because of say product, who cares how productive they are? Measure business outcomes - you will get what you measure. If engineering is  being measured by the ability to deliver business outcomes but engineers can&#x27;t because of other people, the software engineers are going to let you know* and it&#x27;s an important thing to learn about and fix.<p>*this assumes you have competent managers and engineers who are willing to communicate with those managers, but if you don&#x27;t have that, this is sort of a moot point.')
