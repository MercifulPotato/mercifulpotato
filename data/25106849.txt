What makes it more unethical to let it live (at least in captivity) and then kill it off at some point, than removing it in fetus form?<p>You might argue, that keeping a being in captivity is unethical. Well, so is genetically experimenting with and then killing off a fetus. The only reason they feel it&#x27;s ethical in the first place is obviously some sort of &quot;the good that will come to the world from this knowledge is much more than the damage done to this fetus&quot;. But that same rationale an be said of letting it be born?<p>One might argue that if they would let it live to a certain point would at least give us some real-world knowledge of the ramifications of genetic editing.')
