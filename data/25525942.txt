We do not expect them to fail after an arbitrary time interval merely by <i>being used</i>.  Even terrible filesystems like FAT don&#x27;t do that.  They might get fragmented and slow, but they don&#x27;t just <i>stop</i>.  I find it incredible that this is often minimised by people; it&#x27;s a complete show-stopper irrespective of the other problems Btrfs has.<p>I made exactly the same migration you did.  ZFS has been solid, and it does exactly what it says on the tin.')
