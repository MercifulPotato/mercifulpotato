The TLA&#x27;s have been complaining about it for years and they are essentially hamstrung with defined public service salaries. It&#x27;s a shitty situation for natsec operators and institutionally hard to change.<p>All of which has essentially led to the proliferation of greymarkets for exploits like Zerodium et al.<p>The  situation is likely far worse for the States than the UK as the salary differential is greater and the agencies can only hire citizens.
