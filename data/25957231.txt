Easier upgradability means easier to repair.<p>And the rare failure of the soldered RAM makes what should have been an affordable repair a very expensive affair as they force you to buy a new motherboard!<p>Note that another major issue with soldered RAM &#x2F; SSD &#x2F; CPU &#x2F; unremovable batteries is that it makes you, the consumer, more vulnerable to price gauging. For e.g. If you don&#x27;t want a 4GB or 8GB RAM, you are still forced to buy the 16 GB RAM from the laptop maker and have to pay them what they want, even if it is available for far cheaper from other reputable vendors.')
