I didn&#x27;t mention SML# because most of the documentation is in Japanese and it&#x27;s hard to find recent info. There is an unofficial fork on Github but it explicitly states that it is unofficial so... not something I&#x27;d recommend to a general audience.<p>Edit: nevermind! I checked out their docs again and it seems to be decently translated. I&#x27;m still not sure where their code is actually hosted, just that you can download releases. So added it to the list of major implementations!')
