It&#x27;s just such a difference in user experience. I feel that Ubuntu is doing a big disservice with snaps (haven&#x27;t used flatpack that much) to the Linux Desktop community. If it&#x27;s impossible for me to understand how to use it efficiently, then there is no way in hell I will point my father towards Ubuntu.')
