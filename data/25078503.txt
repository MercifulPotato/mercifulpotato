You may as well just go directly to Clevo.<p>I use a Dell xps13 (several years old now) for work, and it&#x27;s fine. I have no complaints except that the aging battery is not what it used to be (I&#x27;d normally be due for a replacement system this year, but we&#x27;re limping along on old hardware due to the recession).<p>I can&#x27;t understand how picky people seem to be about things like the MacBook touchpad. Since my last Apple computer purchase was well over a decade ago, maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing, but the touchpad on the Dell seems to control my pointer well enough.')
