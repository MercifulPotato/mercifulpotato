The only practical difference is that one single vote has a different weight depending on what state you live in.<p>Rural areas are incredibly over-represented imo. This should be addressed more than the tiny details that don&#x27;t really change the outcome.<p>Just imagine how different the left and right parties would be if the will of the people would be equally represented.')
