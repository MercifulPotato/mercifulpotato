Hadn&#x27;t thought of the ransomware aspect at all, but it&#x27;s a good point. ;)<p>With NetBackup (and probably other &quot;Enterprise Backup&quot; software too) the NetBackup master servers have ~root level access to pretty much <i>every</i> server in an Enterprise.  Or at least, every server being backed up.  Which is likely to be <i>everything important</i>. ;)<p>NetBackup master servers also have the capability to run commands (as root) remotely on systems-they-back-up, and have those commands not be logged by the auditing on the systems (or anywhere really).<p>To my mind, that seems like a handy thing for hackers to target. ;)')
