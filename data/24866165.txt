Taxi drivers are exploited end-to-end. There&#x27;s a reason why the medallions eclipsed a million dollars in price. The drivers have to lease their cars on a daily basis, and start at around $160 leasing fee in the hole. They&#x27;re driving for many hours before they start making any money at all. That&#x27;s not &quot;power and control&quot;, that&#x27;s getting totally screwed. And every Uber or Lyft driver who has ever driven taxis before will tell you that.')
