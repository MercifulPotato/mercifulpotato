As you point out the moth species I quoted uses this &#x27;bad experience&#x27; signal as it&#x27;s sonic defense.<p>However, this study found:<p><i>The moths’ ultrasound production clearly confused the bats, according to researchers, who reported that bats faced with sonar-jamming moths often tried to catch moths from empty air, apparently because the moths’ ultrasound signals had left the bats confused about the actual location of their prey. This kept working over several repetitions of the experiment with the same bats. For the researchers, this confirmed that moths were actually jamming bats’ sonar in order to escape, not just trying to startle them or mimic another, less tasty, moth.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gizmodo.com.au&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;moths-rub-their-genitals-together-to-jam-bat-sonar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gizmodo.com.au&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;moths-rub-their-genitals-...</a><p>Which obviously goes to show there are many different types of weird an wonderful interactions going on between bats and moths.')
