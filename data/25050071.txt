Prisons are run by the states.  Jails are usually run by the counties.  Banning tobacco across the board for prisoners and staff is common because it becomes one less potential avenue of illicit trade between the guards and prisoners.  Just because there isn&#x27;t a law against doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not usually prohibited in practice.')
