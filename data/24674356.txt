Till then, it will just be used in the walled garden of Apple products, which is the very thing that makes it very unattractive for many users.</i><p>Well, there is another possible path: if Apple Silicon is seen as a PoC, someone else could decide to pursue the server market with an Apple Silicon inspired ARM-based offering. Perhaps aimed at FaaS deployments or something similar.')
