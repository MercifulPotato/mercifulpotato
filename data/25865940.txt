Unlike Elastic they never promised open source and never used it as marketing. So it completely fair for them to keep those things closed as they provide a big part of the competitive advantage to their cloud.<p>Those components underpin things like Aurora (which does tricks with storage and replication that MySQL can&#x27;t) and this warm&#x2F;hot storage. So there is probably no practical way to open source those elasticsearch changes without opening up their storage system as well and even then it wouldn&#x27;t run outside of AWS.')
