Which makes sense - dead people certainly aren&#x27;t going to cough on you.<p>In a Sci Fi movie maybe the virus has a long delay, you&#x27;re infectious for a month with no symptoms, then drop dead in seconds. But in the real world that&#x27;s less likely the more extreme it gets.<p>One thing that did make this virus more dangerous was that many humans became infectious significantly <i>before</i> they realised they had symptoms. With some viruses you get symptoms, then (sometimes as a result of the symptoms) you become infectious, making it easier for public health messages to be effective. &quot;Stay at home if you have symptoms&quot; is extremely effective if people aren&#x27;t vectors until 12-24 hours after the symptoms are obvious, but almost useless if they&#x27;re infectious a week earlier.<p>I&#x27;d argue that countries which think the lesson is &quot;We developed a vaccine quickly, good job&quot; are mistaken. The lesson was just, &quot;Elimination strategy works&quot; and the many countries that didn&#x27;t even attempt that got lucky they weren&#x27;t decimated for their incompetence.')
