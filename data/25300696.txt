In fact, the authors themselves apply the same analysis to other cities over the same time period (figure S15 in the supplementary material) and those plots show hardly any effect.<p>However... if a paper claims to support X and the paper is bad, then that does not mean that X is incorrect. And given government advice around the world, it seems pretty clear that masks are understood to do more good than harm.')
