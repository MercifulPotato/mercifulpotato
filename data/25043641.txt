It seems like Rust has a concept called destructive move, which is not what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>In any case, the &quot;foo&quot; vector, and &quot;foo&quot; unique_ptr are _mutilated_ as part of the std::move operation. (Since the word &quot;destroyed&quot; seems to have been taken by the Rust community, I can&#x27;t use that word anymore... hopefully no other community has taken the word &quot;mutilated&quot;)')
