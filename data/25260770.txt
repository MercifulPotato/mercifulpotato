They&#x27;re not planning anything new there.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think they would need much to make a Core series processor into a SoC; the chip does almost everything you&#x27;d need already; memory, some of the pci-e, (some) usb, (some) sata, legacy IO are already in the CPU for both Intel and AMD, and both offer chips with GPUs on board too. AMD has a &#x27;chipless&#x27; chipset available for ryzen, the A300, it even has a new performance version, the X300. There&#x27;s still plenty of other chips on the board, but there&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s really a chipset.')
