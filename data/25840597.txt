We&#x27;ll never know until someone gets to a judge, though, but my armchair speculation bet is that the &quot;can&#x27;t combine this license&quot; clause won&#x27;t hold up when the combination increases the total amount of Copyleft in play without decreasing it in any regard. I hope someone takes this to court and doesn&#x27;t settle, or else we&#x27;ll never find out :)<p>(I&#x27;m not your lawyer, this isn&#x27;t legal advice, etc.)')
