Item(by='fallingknife', descendants=None, kids=[25958887], score=None, time=1611935845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958276, text='&gt; “lol idk sorry Dick but we’re just gonna let you go and let the Fed bail the rest of us out sorry bro lol.” Like really. That’s how it went behind those closed doors in the lairs of the lizards that control the universe.<p>Says Dick Fuld.  I doubt that&#x27;s true, though, because at the time Lehman was going under, they didn&#x27;t know that all the other banks were going with them.  Remember, the bailouts didn&#x27;t come until a few weeks later when the money market funds broke the buck triggering $trillions of withdrawals in what would essentially be a financial system wide run on the bank.  The regulators didn&#x27;t like the idea that a failing bank should be bailed out (as they shouldn&#x27;t), and they couldn&#x27;t find a merger partner like they did with Bear Stearns, so they let it fail.  The bailouts didn&#x27;t come until they realized that the fallout from Lehman&#x27;s failure would bring down the whole system.  Yeah, Dick Fuld wasn&#x27;t really any different than any of the CEO&#x27;s that got a bailout, but to cast him as the good guy among the group is ridiculous.')
