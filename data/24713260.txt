For example, Google &quot;abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites which prevented Google&#x27;s rivals from placing their search adverts on these websites&quot; [0]. Facebook &quot;has maintained its position by acquiring, copying or killing its competitors&quot; [1].<p>The quoted statement seems to miss the point, which is that anti-competitive behaviour reduces the choice of the consumer. Of course they choose to use those services: they don&#x27;t have much recourse to alternatives.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;IP_19_1770" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;IP_19_...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;06&#x2F;house-antitrust-committee-facebook-monopoly-buys-kills-competitors.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;06&#x2F;house-antitrust-committee-fa...</a>')
