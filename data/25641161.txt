Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[25641442], score=None, time=1609812384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640217, text='Good, Cheap and Fast (let&#x27;s call it GCF) appears to be a search engine. When you visit this domain, you get a search box.<p>It looks pretty cool, and all but ...<p>Why would&#x2F;should Google&#x27;s search engine send users to another search engine?<p>What GCF needs to do is become well-known, &quot;like DuckDuckGo, but for shopping&quot;. Then people will save a bookmark (like I&#x27;m doing now).<p>EDIT:<p>Unfortunately, bookmark removed. This site doesn&#x27;t appear very useful. I typed in numerous search queries, starting with generic categories like &quot;bluetooth speakers&quot; and &quot;baby bib&quot; and whatnot, and it came up with &quot;Your search did not match any documents.&quot;.   I tried some very specific products found in various online sites. Again, &quot;Your search did not match any documents.&quot;<p>Finally, I got some results by just using &quot;bluetooth&quot;. Hooray! Some other single-words are working.<p>The results appear to just be some product advice, followed by some links to selected products and price information on sites like Amazon.<p>I see now that there are links to categories below the search UI, but I don&#x27;t see anything there I would be interested in looking for, and if any other categories exist, I have to guess what they are through the search box.<p>I tried doing some &quot;site:www.goodcheapandfast.com ...&quot; tagged searches in Google to confirm that the GCF pages are being indexed. They are in the index; just when you remove the site: syntax, they disappear; maybe they show up in the long tail of the search if you dig far enough, who knows.')
