If you can&#x27;t manage to have some bare minimum consideration for somebody who is their own person just as much as you are, <i>you</i> are the asshole. I see both of the above happening pretty regularly these days.<p>This stuff is a real gimme, so really the most charitable interpretation of your comment is that you are being disingenuous for edginess&#x27; sake.')
