There&#x27;s packages, with excellent software engineering structure, that are designed to include documentation and tests.<p>For me, the problem with R is that the language is inconsistent.\nMany packages arose to address many problems, but they all feel like a hack on top of the core language.\nTake the whole Tidyverse; it just does dataframes from R core but then from the ground up.\nNow, users can choose between the core language dataframes and the Tidyverse dataframes.\nSame holds for plotting.\nThe core issue, I think, is that the core language misses some essential features which other languages do have nowadays.\nFor example, a type system.\nIn R, since types are missing, everything is a table (dataframe) which I find just weird.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not cobbled together like JavaScript or bash.<p>But also not as good as my favorite: Julia. \nComparing it to Bash is like saying that its better than COBOL.\nWe all know Bash is quite old, but for certain situations it just works.')
