To prevent tracking online, you want your device to look just like everybody else&#x27;s devices.  To prevent fraud, you want devices to look different so you can tell when a device does not represent a real user.<p>At the extreme, imagine if every person has a unique identifier that was automatically sent whenever they used any device: preventing ad fraud would be really easy, and you would have essentially zero privacy.  At the other extreme, imagine if every device looked exactly the same, with no user agent, no IP, no cookies, no way to tell my traffic from yours.  In that situation, people would have pretty strong privacy, but if you had headless browsers loading the ads on your site no one would be able to tell that those views were not from real users.<p>As the GGP says, removing IDFA shifts the balance toward both privacy and fraud.
