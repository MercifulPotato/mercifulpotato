The market might be worth 20T but that does not mean 20T of value actually was exchanged.<p>At risk of sounding a bit tinfoil, this is the same system of a weird pyramid scheme rich people are doing with art, wine, relics, real estate, etc. As long as everyone does not sell at the same time, and supply is (artificially) constrained, there is a huge amount of wealth locked up, no longer participating.<p>If you want to compare BTC to hold, you need to compare how much of the gold market is actually being traded, vs how much of the crypto market.<p>I bet there&#x27;s actually a factor 10 difference there, if not more.')
