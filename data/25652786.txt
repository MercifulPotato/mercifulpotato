The point is that an effort should be made to make available the data to the fullest extent possible. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect anonymised data to be made available. If the data connot meaningfully be anonymised that might be a special case, but I find it hard to imagine a scenario like that, unless the study only involved a very small number of participants (which would also make it less valuable). Maybe there are such scenarios though, I&#x27;m not stating categorically that there aren&#x27;t, just that it seems unlikely, and if there is I&#x27;d expect them to be a small minority.')
