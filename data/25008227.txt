Several of the largest tech companies on the planet have data showing that roughly 70% of security vulnerabilities are caused by memory unsafety. Both Rust and Go are significantly more memory safe than C and C++.<p>Nobody would claim that either language completely eliminates security issues, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they can&#x27;t help mitigate many of them.')
