We were using Mithril 0.x. We did get the product to a point where it was very stable, but there were patterns that we had to avoid (for example, at the time IIRC we had spooky bugs with children cycling between an element, a list of elements, or an empty array []).<p>In the end, the reason that we moved away from Mithril.js was that as a 300-person company, we just didn&#x27;t have the resources to give it the attention that we felt we needed to give it (i.e. contribute) vs. the timeline that we needed for isolation and resolution.<p>Before we built our app in Mithril, I built a MVP prototype in Angular and the performance was so bad that the product was marked as &quot;not plausible&quot;. Discovering Mithril.js was the only reason we decided to go through with the project. In some respects, the company owes its market-leading position to Mithril.js whilst its competitors are still crawling out of the dark ages of TTY and desktop thin clients')
