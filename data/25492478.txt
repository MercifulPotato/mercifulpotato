As long as it only needs to work on vectors, strings, or other stuff with a `.at()` method.<p>But if the function works on iterators instead it can work on ANY data structure that also fulfills the requirements of RandomAccessIterator API. String Views, raw pointers, a 3rd party Cord library, etc.<p>There&#x27;s no inherent meaning to the iterator API requiring `operator+=` instead of something closer to `get()`, except that it means that the iterator itself doesn&#x27;t need to know anything about container bounds (like I said above, raw pointers work as RandomAccessIterators).')
