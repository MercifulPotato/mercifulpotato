Instead, I have a set of folders sorted by priority descending and post frequency ascending (EU projects I am involved in, for example are in the TOP folder at the top and HBR and MIT Tech Review are in the SPAM folder in the bottom). I use BazQux as my reader and it allows me to select a folder, read all articles in it using j&#x2F;k and when I hit j once the folder is empty, it jumps to the next folder. With Feedka, I&#x27;d lose this ability to browse things by topic. An off-topic: I tried to do the same on Twitter with lists and used ManageFlitter to do a reverse sort on people I follow and drop those who post most but failed miserably.<p>2) I do not read RSS daily. With Twitter or HN (unless you go on hckrnews.com instead of the main website) you are always afraid to miss somethin or feel overwhelmed to catch up. I read most important &#x2F; least frequent folders first and all posts in all folders are sorted chronologically. A few weeks ago I was catching up with some things posted in October in my feed. But folder-wise chronological grouping and sort means I will first catch up on all ~30 posts since October in the TOP folder (again, not on a feed-by-feed basis) and only then I will get to those 400 posts from HBR and MIT Tech Review. I spent some time there, sign off and I know it will be there when I am back. With Feedka, I feel that I would go back to this anxiety of missing things if I don&#x27;t read the newsletter every day. HN is an exception because I want not only to read the artile, but also participate in the discussion.<p>3) I don&#x27;t want any algorithmic filtering of articles except perhaps a metric comparing ratio of number of entries posted to the number I starred, opened in a new tab or read for more that 10-15s before jumping to the next post.<p>I guess this sounds more off-putting than I intended. Go ahead boldly! I will try Feedka if it has OPML import and I wish you great success! Also, now that I am reading my points above, I can totally see why my friends use Twitter and not RSS.')
