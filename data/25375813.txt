There seems to be a certain mindset in some company bosses, and it&#x27;s usually middle management types who have made it to a moderately senior level and never not been &quot;company men&quot; (or women etc. obviously) in my experience. It&#x27;s like they think becoming an employee at their firm means giving over your life to them, and that by graciously allowing you to work for them they&#x27;re doing you some big favour that justifies that stance. This is supported by the corporate lawyers routinely trying to insert heavily one-sided terms into employment contracts. But that simply isn&#x27;t what an employment relationship is, certainly not in the West in 2020, and enough good people saying &quot;no&quot; and being willing to walk away is the only way the &quot;we own you&quot; people will learn.')
