It should just be law that an appliance like a fridge or TV are expected to last 10 years (and adjust this value for all expected product lifetimes)<p>And if samsung pushes out a software update that breaks the original experience (adding adverts for example) you are entitled for at least a partial refund. So if you owned it for 9 years and on the 9th they added adverts, you get a 1&#x2F;10th refund.<p>That way it becomes unprofitable to pump out IoT junk and then discontinue support a year later.')
