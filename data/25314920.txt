You are not entitled to comfort or nourishment. You are not worthy of compassion or empathy or courtesy. If you can’t live without it, you will die without it. But you don’t need it. You can endure far more than you ever would have believed. Nothing in this world is worth the sanctity of your mind. You will not succumb to pain or drugs or temptation or dishonesty or self-pity. Everybody around you is failing this test. You are different. Your soul is getting stronger. This is a test. This is only a test.”')
