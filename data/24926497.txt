Even if the NVidia issue is fixed, the different implementations are far enough along they will never be merged. We will have at least four duplicate not entire compatible implementations for the near future.<p>I&#x27;m sure dealing with different extensions and subtle bugs makes everyone who needs to deal with it very happy, and will help Linux desktop adoption (not). Perhaps eventually the cost of keeping up will reduce desktop fragmentation and everyone will be stuck with only a single option for an OSS desktop environment.<p>Wayland replaced a bad technical situation with X11 with a bad social situation with Wayland. Technical problems can be solved with enough work (e.g. Wayland itself to replace X), social problems however can persist for a long time and aren&#x27;t so easy to fix. It didn&#x27;t have to be that way. Perhaps it still doesn&#x27;t if the community could actually standardize while prioritizing the main use cases.')
