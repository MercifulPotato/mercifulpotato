How?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='It occurs to me that you have to have a lot of online accounts for various things and purposes.\nI am sure you have at least a couple of these accounts:<p>Gmail, Outlook, Protonmail, Tutanota, GitHub, Dropbox, Standard Notes, FC2, Amazon, iTunes, GOG.com, Steam, itch.io, Twitter, YouTube, FC2, HN, Stack Overflow, Discord, Linkedin, Netflix, Spotify, Mubi, Grammarly, eBay, Bitwarden, SimpleLogin.io, Firefox Relay, Firefox Lockwise, ...<p>Furthermore, the incentive to have even more accounts is growing as more and more services are entering the online market.<p>Here&#x27;s a data point serving as a primer:<p>&quot;In the U.S. the average email address is associated with 130 accounts.&quot;[1]<p>Having this many accounts is practically not maintainable. Why? If you are serious about security, you need to make sure that the provided data is up to date. Things like passwords, your registration email etc. are all things that need to be updated.\nBut why keep this large amount of accounts when you end up not using most of them at all?\nIt might be better for you to regularly delete accounts that you are not using. Doing this also helps you avoid potential data breaches.<p>So in my opinion, you should also practice the habit of getting rid of stuff in the online world. Minimalism apparently reduces stress after all[2]. And evidently, people are drawn to simplicity and minimalism. A popular example might be Apple and its products.<p>What is your approach? How do you go about this issue? Do you maintain 100+ accounts? Don&#x27;t you think having 100+ accounts (even with a password manager) takes a mental toll on you?<p>The purpose of this &quot;Ask HN&quot; is to solicit interesting approaches from people with good heuristics.<p>Reference:\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalguardian.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;uncovering-password-habits-are-users-password-security-habits-improving-infographic\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;anxiety-zen&#x2F;201612&#x2F;minimalism-when-living-less-means-more-mental-health')
