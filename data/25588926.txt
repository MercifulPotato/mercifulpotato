I&#x27;m currently reading &quot;physics from symmetry&quot; which uses group theory intensively. It has a lot of math, but i&#x27;m ready to dive in this time. Excited for the special relativity sections.<p>I&#x27;ve also been watching Institute of Advanced Study videos lately which are way over my head, but from what I gather, the black hole information paradox has a solution using a method called entanglement wedge reconstruction. The model is holographic, and the goal is understanding the mapping of the physics of a quantum holographic surface onto the &quot;bulk&quot;(spacetime), and that mapping turns out to be very similar to a quantum error correcting code.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;how-space-and-time-could-be-a-quantum-error-correcting-code-20190103&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;how-space-and-time-could-be-a...</a>')
