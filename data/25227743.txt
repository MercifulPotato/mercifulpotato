I&#x27;m familiar with yellow taxis from American films. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> familiar with &#x27;crosswalks&#x27; (full stop) or American &#x27;fire hydrants&#x27;.<p>Your buses also look somehow different often, and those can be hard. Traffic lights even more so, some are familiar, but some styles I would just never see in the UK, so I actually have to look at each square to check, I can&#x27;t rely on recognising them.<p>Then, even once you get past all that, it&#x27;ll frequently complain you haven&#x27;t selected them all, and you have to guess which square that doesn&#x27;t have a bicycle it thinks has a bicycle.')
