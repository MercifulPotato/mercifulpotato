From last gen, the PS Vita was ARM based and considered high end for mobile graphics at the time. Apple has already crushed Intel in on chip graphics and Nvidia is heavily invested in ARM.<p>I donâ€™t think ARM and graphics will long be known for poor performance.<p>As a fan of AMD, I hope they see the writing on the wall and are planning accordingly. It would not be surprising to see the successors to the PS5 and Xbox Series running on ARM.')
