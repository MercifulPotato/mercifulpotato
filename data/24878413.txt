These utilities earn based on their capital investment, so the larger the capital investment they can get the regulators to swallow, the better.   And this is best done by systems with large up front costs, costs that can be underestimated then escalated after the initial fixed investment.<p>What really killed the first wave of nuclear in the US was not TMI or over-regulation, but the passage of PURPA that began to open the markets to competition from non-utility suppliers.')
