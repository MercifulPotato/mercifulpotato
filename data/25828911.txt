Many where figures of authority were targeted. Where the people burning thing in the hallway of the Portland Mayors house, just being nice or was their goal to burn it down? Were the individuals inciting riots with ACAB and other slogans, followed by aggressive assaults of police and small businesses just innocent aggrevators or was their intention to &quot;burn it all down&quot; as they proclaimed over and over.<p>This issue isn&#x27;t that this is a dispicable situation, it&#x27;s that the media is treating it as if it&#x27;s a bunch of fringe right wing people (and lumping all trump voters in the list) when the same far left extremists were and are still using teh same tactics. Lives have been threatened for the past nine months plus.. and yet that was ok because it fell in line with what one group wanted?<p>It&#x27;s all insanity on both sides and until people own up to it on the left as well, the country will keep being pushed further. The demonization of anyone not toeing the line of the extreme left these days is CREATING the thing they fear.<p>How many lives were lost last year, innocent lives? How many injuries? All due to the same actions and tactics.')
