I experimented with using neural nets to categorize brain activity, in a way that statistical methods had already shown some success.  The professor I worked for felt that neural networks would not perform better than statistical methods.  Neural nets could be trained on the data and predict on the untrained set, but not better than the statistical method.  So I didn&#x27;t pursue it.<p>The funny thing to think about for people on this forum was what weak computing power was available to me at that time.  As I recall I did this whole experiment in C (using the TLearn libraries) on a Masscomp workstation.  The cool thing about the Masscomp was that it had a vector processing board that could do some parallel computations.  Well I didn&#x27;t use that but the lab had the hardware.  So I was doing all these things on Motorola 68000 with less RAM and way less CPU than your watch.')
