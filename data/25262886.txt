Being 20 and living through the age of cambridge analytica and Q-anon, I noticed that there’s so much distrust in government and a surge of political engagement. Our ideal app would connect interested voters with canvassers and give the users a veil of encrypted privacy when asking their questions. Canvassing is a $6.4 billion industry that’s largely ineffective, and there’s no way for people to engage with local politics without giving up their personal information. The national swing-voter turn around is only 7%, which we believe we can beat. We have successfully beta tested our encrypted chat (website) and spoken with a handful of interested field directors. My team consists of myself (CEO), my COS Sina (‘20), and our programming intern Tim. A little bit about me, I major in philosophy and political theory at UCLA, set to graduate at 20. I took time off of school to pursue a start-up, Glamnetic, as the sole employee in the companies first six months. The start-up ended up becoming a multi-million dollar start-up in its first year. I am proficient in marketing, brand-strategy, and accounting. I’m also incredibly dedicated to the company and am set to pursue it full time after this upcoming quarter. My dream is to join YC, however I want to find a co-founder who is as passionate about this as I am and can develop the app. Thank you for reading')
