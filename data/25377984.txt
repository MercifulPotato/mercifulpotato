Only Brave themselves know who&#x27;s seeing what (and even then, only client-side, unless they push a malicious update one day.) Advertisers only get to know how many impressions they got.<p>By contrast, every credit card with &quot;rewards&quot;, retail loyalty card, or coupon app (e.g. Honey) you&#x27;ve ever signed up for <i>is</i> — very explicitly — selling your consumer profile to advertisers&#x2F;market research companies. Then, to make you interested in being on the other side of that deal, they take some of the money they make from those data-buyers and pass it back to you as rewards&#x2F;points&#x2F;offers.<p>If neither of these business models already existed, and both were pitched at the same time, I think it&#x27;d be the second one that would put people in mind of dystopian speculative fiction.')
