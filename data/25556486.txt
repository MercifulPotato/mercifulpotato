Ofc I&#x27;m careful about volume level, and I take frequent breaks from both screen and headphones (albeit for the sake of my eyes). \nI&#x27;m a healthy 47yo software architect by trade, also a lifelong musician and music afficionado. I care about -- and for! -- my ears and hearing, and would be grateful for any good links to credible sources (ie peer-reviewed scientific studies) which highlight hidden dangers or damage.')
