I had that service for almost three years I think.<p>Support was terrible. I called a few times letting them know there were dead spots all over SF and Berlin. In my hometown, I struggled to get coverage every once in a while, too. Nobody else, even on the cheap platforms, had any issues.<p>I called twice. One time I was disconnect and could never reach back through again. The other time I was told that they were &quot;sorry I was disappointed&quot; and that they&#x27;d help me cancel my account if I wanted. I wasn&#x27;t rude or anything - quite the contrary. I had never had such a weird or degrading phone call like that before.<p>Oh and the spam calls. I had tons of them, some days I&#x27;d have five or six throughout the day. It was insane. I posted on the subreddit for support and they told me &quot;well they use the back-door numbers (or whatever, I don&#x27;t know how phone technologies work) so there&#x27;s nothing Google Fi can do.&quot;<p>It was insane. Avoid.')
