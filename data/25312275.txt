There are ~330m people in the USA. There are around 160m people in Bangladesh, 90% of whom are legally prohibited from purchasing or consuming alcohol without a prescription. The scale difference for this country alone is around 2x, not 10x like you&#x27;re claiming. I&#x27;d argue 2x doesn&#x27;t make much difference to enforcement.')
