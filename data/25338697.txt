Literally every company in this space (ISP&#x27;s, and more so ISP&#x27;s that utilize satellites) have used it as a platform to grift public funds. Examples include Lightsquared, Iridium, Globalstar, and the worst of all, DISH) SpaceX has significantly reduced the cost of building a satellite ISP but you need to consider the history here and the other players that have already cost American citizens a shitload of wasted money and resource.<p>If the FCC believed they should give assistance to SpaceX, it should have been in the form of access to the spectrum Charlie Ergen has been squatting over at DISH making the same promises SpaceX is doing right now. For those unaware of Ergan&#x27;s history, the FCC for the first time decided to give a light wrist slap over setting up a constellation of fake shell corporations to bid on spectrum that included rural and small carrier subsidies. DISH has blown every build-out deadline and it&#x27;s set back terrestrial carriers for years now. There were two they completely blew off that came due this year, and the only purpose they served was as an excuse to let the Sprint&#x2F;TMUS merger happen, where previously TMUS had been calling out their business practices. I&#x27;m aware every Elon fanboy is going to wax poetic about how it won&#x27;t be the same, but I&#x27;d caution you to consider SolarCity and what a public funds debacle that has been. There&#x27;s a history of making big promises in areas and leaving a mess.<p>Running an ISP is an easy to understand business model, either be the only option in an area or provide better service (and&#x2F;or price) then incumbents. As others in this thread have said, there&#x27;s already a shitload of capital flowing around, so why should this capital come from the public. Why didn&#x27;t Elon just run another &#x27;Deposit $100 to get in line for Starlink!&#x27;  As it stands most of the US is stuck with shit ISP&#x27;s because of a lack of competition, and giving subsidies to incumbents (like Charter) are only going to enrich them and further entrench their monopolies.<p>SpaceX didn&#x27;t launch this service as a practical or sensible business model for them, they already get paid to launch other telecommunications equipment into space, they are doing this to keep on the government, the public&#x27;s tit.')
