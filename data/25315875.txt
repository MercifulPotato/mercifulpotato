That request contains an authorization code which is coupled to the client secret (it&#x27;s only usable if you have the client secret). In server-side application this isn&#x27;t a problem as the client secret is on the server-side. However, for mobile apps you&#x27;ll have to embed the client secret into the application and it&#x27;s relatively easy to find it.<p>This can be combined with registering a custom scheme handler and thus hijack the redirect URL. If you&#x27;re able to register your app as a handler for &quot;airbnb:&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;, then your app will be opened once the service redirects back. And if you&#x27;ve figured out the client secret then you can finalize the authorization step and get an access token.<p>The difference in PKCE is that the client generates a unique random secret (code verifier) before it starts everything. The authorization is then coupled to the <i>hash</i> of the secret (code challenge), and for the authorization code to be converted into an access token the client needs to reveal the original code verifier.')
