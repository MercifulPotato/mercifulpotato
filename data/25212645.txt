They are running an influence campaign to get users to opt out of security protections.”<p>There is no evidence for this theory.<p>But “for all you know” certain people posting here have been paid to spread disinformation as part of this conspiracy.<p>(Just to be clear - there is no evidence for this, and I don’t think it is likely)<p>In the absence of evidence, it is not rational to <i>completely dismiss</i> either or both possibilities (that Apple has a hidden agenda or that there is a conspiracy to weaken Apple’s security).<p>What is irrational is <i>to use the absence of evidence to the contrary to convince yourself that something is obviously true</i>.<p>However on the broader point - I agree that <i>we should not be reliant on trusting Apple</i> for our privacy and security, and cannot afford to be as we move into the future.<p>We need a public domain infrastructure that produces similar or better security and privacy outcomes to the ones Apple is claiming to provide.')
