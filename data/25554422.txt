Just hold cash. Spread it across multiple banks and accounts.<p>Next easiest option is to change your stock&#x2F;bond ratio. Make sure the bond ETF you use is diversified.<p>Next easiest option is to keep a static portfolio but put more than a stock ETF and a bond ETF in it. There&#x27;s a nice set of &quot;lazy&quot; portfolios here [0].<p>Next easiest option is to build a static portfolio for a particular level of risk. There&#x27;s a handy tool here [1] that can spit out the optimal balance given a goal and a set of assets to choose from (I&#x27;d choose a selection of ETFs). If you&#x27;re risk-averse, your goal is probably to minimize variance.<p>Next easiest option is to switch to a dynamically-weighted portfolio that changes the balance of assets in your portfolio based on market conditions. This can be the same as the previous option but you&#x27;d recalculate the portfolio month-to-month.<p>And finally, there&#x27;s playing with derivatives.

If that&#x27;s not the case, I&#x27;d focus less on finance and more on doomsday prepping.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bogleheads.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lazy_portfolios" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bogleheads.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lazy_portfolios</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portfoliovisualizer.com&#x2F;optimize-portfolio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portfoliovisualizer.com&#x2F;optimize-portfolio</a>')
