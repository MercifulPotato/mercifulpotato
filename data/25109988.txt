What is going to be far more realistic is AMD&#x2F;Intel making a new chip where they expose a better ISA and Microsoft releasing a Windows that support that ISA. All while keeping the tried and tested x86&#x2F;x64 running in parallel and slowly allow software to migrate to the new ISA, or perhaps invest in a recompilation of executables targeting x86-64 to take advantage of the new ISA. But getting Amd, Intel, and Microsoft to agree on a new ISA is a tall order.')
