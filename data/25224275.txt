Usually someone lacking a thick skin or easy to take offense, goes to HR to complain (anonymously if need be) about offensive, awkward, sexist, racist, far-right, ... speech. The neurodiverse person will (rightly) get a warning, an internal investigation finds no systemic harm done, and that&#x27;s that, you won&#x27;t even hear about it, as it juridically not smart to be transparent about such cases.<p>Then the offended person changes jobs, complains on Twitter about sexist humor driving her out of her previous job, a journalist searches for leads on their next story, and suddenly you are in the news with &quot;multiple people complained about sexist and racist humor on the work floor, but nothing was done about it, and no complaint or investigation resulted in any action. We asked the company for a response and they replied that these internal investigations turned up nothing and that they don&#x27;t accept discrimination of any kind&quot;.<p>Nearly every company has incidents of sex between co-workers, or people taking illegal drugs on a company get together. Depending on who you get to talk to that&#x27;s &quot;it seemed like every other week I saw a used condom in the stair ways&quot; or &quot;management regurarily used cocaine during company parties&quot;. You won&#x27;t talk to anyone relativating it, and company PR is shy to even admit that stuff.')
