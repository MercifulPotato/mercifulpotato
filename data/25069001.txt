There are legitimate reasons you might want to be more specific, but IME it seems to happen just at random, based on where the developer got a &#x27;countries list&#x27;, I suppose.)<p>Not to mention when UK sites, or sites that already know I&#x27;m in the UK, give me an otherwise alphabetised list with &#x27;United States&#x27; at the top, and then even when I start typing &#x27;Uni&#x27; make me go through UAE first...')
