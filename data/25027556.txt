After taping was over, all of us contestants were all hanging out in the hotel lobby waiting for our flights.<p>Alex and the crew were doing some kind of local press thing in a nearby conference room.<p>Out of nowhere, into the hotel lobby walks .. Jerry Springer. He kind of just meandered into the lobby where we sitting and sat down, by himself, with no apparent agenda?<p>We being a bunch of not-too-shy college kids struck up a conversation and learned he was campaigning on behalf of some state Senator and they were going to use the same TV crew and setup that the Jeopardy! team was using to film some interviews.<p>He was very nice, and then Alex and the crew came out during a break and we all got a couple of pictures of us, Alex, and Jerry Springer.<p>A surreal meeting of two very different TV personalities!<p>RIP Alex, the coolest of the nerds!')
