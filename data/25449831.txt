I think Rocky Linux needs to put out a plan how they will make themselves financially viable as we&#x27;ve had 3 high profile RHEL respins go down in the last 10 years.<p>CentOS failed twice, it ran out of money in 2014 and was rescued back then by Redhat sponsership.  Again in 2020.  Another widely used RHEL respin was Scientific Linux which mothballed when RHEL 7 was released.<p>There seems to be lots of potential users but not lots of potential money for a RHEL respin.')
