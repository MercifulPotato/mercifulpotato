The bloodletting of the Russian revolution was in large part motivated by just how badly the working class was abused, industrialization for them was a hell. Genocides in the baltic states middle of 20th century. Holodomor. All the recent Russian neighbour wars like Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine. List of examples is long and it&#x27;s slowly getting lost in the popular history. If you&#x27;re from Russia or a neighbouring country, it&#x27;s very likely that you have experienced serious ramifications of its policy or politics.')
