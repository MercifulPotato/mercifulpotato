It was no fun to write simple for loops, before getting into actual problem logic. Having to write a minInt function is like a distraction when you want to be focusing on the programming challenge. It is much simpler to use a programming language like Python that comes batteries included.<p>In this regard, I suppose functional programming can be quite expressive. If you can break the problem into functional units, it can be a pleasure to solve programming challenges using FP.')
