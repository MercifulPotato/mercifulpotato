Contacted you guys separately.<p>Most people forget the cost of human involvement, my time, and moreover, Ghost.org charge $29 &#x2F;mo for a limited visit. The only time I&#x27;d consider doing something to save $25 &#x2F;mo would be that I&#x27;m publishing all the static HTMLs to, say, an S3 and the worst cast of a downtime is S3 goes down (rare).<p>Personally, I&#x27;d still want to take over if needed but would love your $25 &#x2F;mo DevOps subscription to the installation. I hope you don&#x27;t start limiting to constraints such as - 1 domain per subscription! :-)<p>And best of luck and wishes to your initiative.')
