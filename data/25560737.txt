It&#x27;s because the market for children&#x27;s books is parents.  And parents want a sentimental cognitive effect when reading to their kids (the article mentions &#x27;romanticization&#x27; which in cognitive terms is sentimental feelings).  I don&#x27;t know many parents who have sentimental feelings for their upbringings in the suburbs, mainly because by the time they learned what the concept of the &#x27;suburb&#x27; is, they were probably entering high school, which is to say, they were entering miniature delayed adulthood, while having to navigate a completely artificial political sphere (high school).  That being said I&#x27;m sure its a fine story world and captain underpants has certainly done a great job with it.')
