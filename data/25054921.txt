The most trivial thing of some people being overrepresented in a poll by the mere fact that they agree to take one, apparently, was somehow TOO MUCH FOR THE POLLSTERS TO HANDLE. Are you kidding me?<p>The methodology should involve getting truly REPRESENTATIVE and RANDOM samples. While each one is going to be biased in some way, the bias should be independent of political affiliation.<p>For example, stopping people on a street. Yes it excludes people who don&#x27;t go out on the street, or people who won&#x27;t stop.<p>Then you are supposed to note how many people refused to take the poll. And then you are supposed to measure the correlation between that and their beliefs.<p>If you really can&#x27;t do this, then have a sign outside the voting areas, as people exit, with Donald Trump or Biden or JoJo etc. and have them sign up for polling in the next four years. This way at least you can make sure going in that your population is balanced as of four years ago.')
