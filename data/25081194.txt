I don&#x27;t care <i>enough</i> about it for it to affect my choices. And the reason for this is: the alternatives. There are none that are genuinely better. There are trade-offs. Can I use my Adobe suite on Linux? Not really. I&#x27;m enamored by the relative purity of Linux but I know it would use up a lot more of time in my short life to do certain things compared to a commercial OS, and my time is my greatest commodity.<p>Is Windows overall a better choice than mac? No, it&#x27;s just different. Every Apple product I&#x27;ve owned has outlived products from other companies by an average of 2x, so I&#x27;m also saving a bundle in costs over the long term. (I used an iPhone for seven years before I upgraded to the iPhone 10, and my old iPhone still works perfectly but just doesn&#x27;t support the latest OS).<p>I think the problem is that motivations widely vary and there is nothing wrong with choosing something that &quot;just works&quot; the vast majority of the time.')
