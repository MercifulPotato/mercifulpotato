My main problem with these alternatives is that they rarely mention what tradeoffs they&#x27;re making to achieve the their performance gains. Electron is terribly inefficient but it does come with almost everything I need out of the box. The last thing I want is investing weeks into a project with a GUI framework only to encounter a dead end because it&#x27;s missing a feature that I didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;ll need when I started.')
