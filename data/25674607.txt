It was a farce back in the day: people talking about cats is my clearest memory. Ev posted on the Odeo blog and I checked it out. I remember the fail whale days.<p>At that point, it was a struggling start up with a start up tech stack.<p>At what point specifically did Twitter jump the shark and should have reinvented itself? It&#x27;s an honest question and not rhetorical. It&#x27;s easy to Monday morning quarterback its entire existence and call for self governance for a corporate product. It&#x27;s harder to point to where and when and how that should have happened.<p>If we can have _that_ discussion, we can inform future twitters, which I agree is a very worthwhile cause. Otherwise, your comments sound eloquent, but ultimately are devoid of any utility.<p>Edit: Also, just now noticed your username... the analogy was not intentional in that regard. :-P')
