The conflict is between the agrarian vision of America and the industrial&#x2F;cosmopolitan vision of America.<p>Agrarian: traditional, religious, rigid social roles, rigid hierarchies determined by gender&#x2F;race&#x2F;etc., suspicion of change, and fiscally conservative with a suspicion of debt or loose monetary policy.<p>Industrial&#x2F;cosmopolitan: fluid, either non-religious or liberal religion, fluid social roles, hierarchies only as-needed (e.g. corporate hierarchies that are opt-out), welcoming to rapid change, and fiscally liberal with a pragmatic attitude toward things like monetary policy and debt.<p>The wrinkle in this model is that the top of the hierarchy of &quot;red America&quot; seems to be <i>located in urban centers</i>. Trump is from New York. Most 4chan &#x2F;pol users are in cities. The people operating Fox News and other further-right news sources almost all live in cities. So it&#x27;s sort of like you have this minority of urban America either sympathizing with or puppeteering a rural revolt against modernity.<p>Of course I wonder if the civil war was different. Banks, governments, and major property owners in urban areas profited a lot more from slavery than poor and middle class farmers and skilled laborers in the South. Quite a lot of the profit from slavery ended up in New York, Boston, DC, and even London.<p>Maybe part of the answer to this is for rural Americans to turn off Fox News and OAN and the &#x2F;pol orbit and all the rest of that &quot;ruralist propaganda from urbanites&quot; and figure out what they really think and articulate it themselves. What emerges may well be something toward which urban &quot;elites&quot; could be more sympathetic.')
