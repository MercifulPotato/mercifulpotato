However, we <i>want</i> people to stop using gasoline, and it makes no sense to punish people for doing a net good thing for society by abandoning ICE vehicles. To truly make a fair system, the payments for road maintenance should be proportional to the damage done to the road by the vehicle. Thus, fees should scale exponentially with vehicle weight.<p>This of course would make road freight very expensive, and that&#x27;s a good thing, because freight should be shipped on roads as little as possible. Freight should be shipped by rail until the last possible mile.')
