This can take two forms.<p>One way is that the government makes decisions.  Some of those decisions affect businesses.  If the businesses don&#x27;t give any input, the government still decides - they just decide in a vacuum.  That could be sub-optimal for businesses.  (I&#x27;m not talking about lobbying for special treatment - just sane policy as it affects your business.)<p>The second way politics can be done to you is that someone outside decides that you aren&#x27;t active enough in supporting their political side, and therefore that you deserve to be destroyed.  (<i>At the moment, in the US,</i> this seems to come mostly from the left, but that&#x27;s not universal.)  The only thing you can do to avoid that is try to move in lockstep with the most strident voices telling you what you should do... but I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of appeasement.  My preferred approach is to ignore them - but then, I don&#x27;t have to make a payroll, so it&#x27;s really easy for me to say that.')
