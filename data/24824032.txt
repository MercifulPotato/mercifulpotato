A loan is still a loan, no matter whether interest is charged or not. It creates a liability which can have dire consequences if the conditions are not met. I only ever took out one loan, a partial mortgage for a house I bought in the Netherlands. I sold that house 6 years later for close to double the price, paid off the loan, bought a farm in Sweden cash in hand for the proceedings and never looked back. I never took out a study loan - living cheaply on a farm (I studied at an agricultural university) so I skipped that burden as well. No loan means no liability, clear and simple. I will not take out personal loans, instead I&#x27;ll postpone the purchase until I can afford it out of hand.')
