As absurd as it sounds, I think you are basically correct.<p>The people with money do what they can to keep propping things up because they are the ones that massively gain on it.  They can afford to keep risking and risking, cashing out when it&#x27;s convenient and if they take a hit?  Oh well, I lost 50%.. or 500m.  But you know what? I still have 500 million fucking dollars!  As opposed to the normal people in which a 50% loss is devastating.<p>It is such insanity how much money the people pulling the strings have.
