People are pretty fake via msg and you can figure it out quickly in person. After awhile I decided I&#x27;d just go back to the normal way of meeting people and it would be more sincere. I figured I&#x27;d meet someone when out with my friends or co workers, at a wedding, whatever.<p>I was about to delete my OK Cupid account and she msg&#x27;d first, sending me something kind of clever and we met up for a beer. Before the date I decided it would be my last dating app date. Friday is our 2nd anniversary.')
