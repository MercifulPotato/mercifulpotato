And my intuition says it&#x27;s a small metal box with recirculating air, filled densely with people for 8+ hours, almost all of whom have not met before and won&#x27;t meet again.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mix with people like that on the ground at the moment even with the windows open, so I&#x27;m not enthused about doing it in the air.')
