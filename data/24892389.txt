The publicly available debian&#x2F;fedora pandoc packages are statically linked, and, until two years ago, so was the Arch Linux pandoc package. The change to dynamic linking (and therefore 700+ MB of Haskell-related dependencies) was a deliberate decision made at the time to reduce maintainer burden. A statically linked pandoc is still available on the AUR under the name pandoc-bin.')
