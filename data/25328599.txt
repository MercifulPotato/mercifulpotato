Could someone explain exactly what&#x27;s so bad about developing for Android using only words someone who doesn&#x27;t know Java would know?  Apologies if I should know who Eskil Steenberg is ahead of time.<p>Naively, I would guess there&#x27;s a bunch of free libraries you have to import provided by Google or whoever owns Android, and those expose things like `AppWindow()` and `Input()` and `Camera()`.  Am I even close?  Is this nothing like what one actually does to make an Android app?  Is iOS somehow better?<p>I have no reason to make an app, but I&#x27;m considering just looking for a &quot;Hello world!&quot; tutorial and following through just to understand what makes it so notoriously challenging.')
