Since the last post VkFFT has experienced a number of huge improvements and optimizations. Namely:<p>-It now supports sequences up to 2^32 in all dimensions (algorithmically, in reality limited to allocatable memory size, switch to 64-bit addressing scheme is planned for future release)<p>-configurations optimized for bigger range of systems and vendors<p>-benchmarked Radeon VII and RTX 3080, shows that FFT is extremely bandwidth limited on modern GPUs<p>-VkFFT is able to match and outperform cuFFT on the whole tested range from 2^7 to 2^28 in single precision<p>-added double and half precision support and precision tests against FFTW on CPU<p>-improved native zeropadding - up to 3x performance boost<p>-switched license to MPL 2.0<p>Thanks for your attention! I am happy to answer any questions.')
