Turns out it&#x27;s useful for a lot of situations (birds and other wildlife). My vacation setup is normally iPhone + D7100 with the 70-300 attached. That can easily cover most situations w&#x2F;o changing lenses around too often.<p>I&#x27;m planning on picking up one of the Nikon mirrorless FFs soon.')
