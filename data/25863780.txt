Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=[25865245], score=None, time=1611260884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863014, text='Their labour can absolutely be that valuable due to how many customers you are effecting with a single hour of work - it&#x27;s sort of the same principle as athletic stars - paying outrageous salaries to athletes is probably the least bad way to do things (it&#x27;s certainly better than the companies just pocketing lots of cash).<p>That said, I think this is only achievable because of how relatively young and greenfield software is - the industry hasn&#x27;t existed for more than a eighty years in any real sense  (and arguably didn&#x27;t really begin until things moved from academic to commercial in the seventies or so) and thus a lot of software can add massive value to society while doing relatively simple things.  I think in a few hundred years all the low hanging fruit will be gone and software development will be extremely different from these wild-west days but right now yea - the value you can produce for a business can absolutely justify pretty ridiculous salaries.<p>I think the important counter point for humility here is that those folks aren&#x27;t particularly special, maybe a 700k architect is a literal genius at the peak of their career, but there are other folks out there that are just as creative and making 80k.  Maybe we just need to think of the strange wage imbalance in development as being as fickle and arbitrary as celebrity - could that actor at the local playhouse have been the next Jennifer Lawrence if only they&#x27;d gotten cast for the role?  Quite possibly, but luck wasn&#x27;t on their side and passed them over.<p>I&#x27;d say that people that command such high salaries are certainly worth it (in the cases I&#x27;ve seen at least) but they have also benefited from some fantastic luck in their career progression - they could&#x27;ve been someone else and be earning far less for the same set of skills.')
