I know for sure my company is not, and its one of the ones thats already publicly stated WFH is a permanent option. There are a ton of people like you who would rather work in an office. There&#x27;s also a ton who would rather work from home.  It seems like the expectation is more work wherever you work best, home or office or hybrid. That does mean you will probably have more remote teammates, however I expect there will be density in offices for a long time still.')
