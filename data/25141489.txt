Item(by='munificent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605728710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25140146, text='<i>&gt; Yes these businesses may be closed &quot;permanently&quot;, but others will eventually rise in their places.</i><p>Economically and in the aggregate yes. A few years from now, if you want to get a burrito or a bagel, you&#x27;ll be able to. If the goal of society is to ensure reliable access to relatively interchangeable goods, the current policies support that.<p>Personally, though, I believe our societal aspirations should be a little higher. Each of these independent restaurants are owned by and employ real people and going out of business is an irrevocable chapter in the narrative of their life. That&#x27;s a chapter that didn&#x27;t have to happen for many if the federal government had made different choices.<p>Likewise, these restaurants are real, tangible parts of the history and fabric of a place. Seattle without Pike Place Market is not the same Seattle. New Orleans without Cafe du Monde is not quite New Orleans. When that history is destroyed, it is gone forever. And when a culture destroys their connection to their past, I think they lose some of their ability to invest in the future.')
