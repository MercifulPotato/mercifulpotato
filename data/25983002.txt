Item(by='vetinari', descendants=None, kids=[25984009], score=None, time=1612130680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982515, text='&gt; I enabled large fonts.<p>In Windows, large fonts is basically 125% (120 dpi, vs the base 96 dpi, double for @2X HiDPI), except it enlarges only fonts and pushes dialog controls around, but doesn&#x27;t touch raster assets. It is something that was part of Windows since &#x27;90s, but in many applications, it newer worked right, because the developers never knew about the option and newer tested it (looking at most Delphi developers here).<p>Changing scaling to 125% (since Windows 8 and 10) changes both font sizes, grid calculations in windows controls and bitmaps; the subtle brokenness of some apps disappears, just to be replaced by another set of subtle brokeness. However, the good news is, that the chance of developers testing in this mode is higher than them testing Large fonts.<p>I also have 1080p 14&quot; laptop somewhere; at 100%&#x2F;dpi the display is too tiny, at 125% it is great. I also used to have 1600x900 14&quot; laptop (T430s) - that one, at 100% was perfect (except it was an TN display, which was different downside). Prior to that, 1440x900 (T400) - that one was a bit too large.')
