The only meaningful change would be to go with fixed length instructions and maybe get rid of the memory ordering guarantees. If you do that you might as well switch to any other ISA that has these properties. But since Intel has an inferior manufacturing process the new ISA would still suffer from inferior CPUs. However, AMD has shown that x86_64 is still viable so the benefits of switching are miniscule anyway.')
