I thought that time is like a film, where nothing moves except the observer. I&#x27;m not sure which way it is. If we travel back in time, the universe is still there, and not moved to the future.<p>Also, I never understood the grandfather paradox. If I travel in the past and change something, wouldn&#x27;t the change propagate in time at the speed of light? And it would take a long time before it overwrites the original time.')
