But on the other hand, there&#x27;s also a few things that I believed were Presto-specific (HTML renderer-related, e.g. text-selection of link text) that they have somehow managed to re-implement on top of Chromium, so never say never.<p>&gt; <i>Unfortunately, Vivaldi wasn&#x27;t recreating that when I tried it.</i><p>Yeah, Vivaldi is not snappy. But... given the state of browser UI performance today (massively regressed from 8 years ago), it compares favourably to competitors. Which isn&#x27;t to be sniffed at considering they&#x27;ve added so many things on top of the beast that is Chromium.')
