Or there is, and it is zero. Because even a single virus instance can potentially infect someone else. It is extremely unlikely to happen, but not impossible.<p>Because of this, for practical purposes, you either have to arbitrarily set a threshold at which someone is considered non-infectious, ignoring that it is not impossible for that person to infect someone. Or you have to stop talking in absolutes entirely and just talk about probabilities.')
