Never found that with Reddit.<p>This was exactly what reddit was like, 10 years ago. Great little communities of passionate people (passionate about seeing faces in teacups or dragons fucking cars, but passionate all the same), a feeling of a community with a common culture. Nowadays even cutting out larger subreddits and following only smaller ones doesn&#x27;t help, the energy and creativity has largely gone missing (IMO, YMMV, etc).')
