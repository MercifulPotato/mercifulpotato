Item(by='porker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602324124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736489, text='&gt; I&#x27;m working on a project where indexing naturally runs from -n to n. I kludged the usual index hackery and was so plagued with off-by-one errors that I gave up on it. Then I remembered Tim Holy had a blog post about OffsetArrays.jl and started using that.<p>Ah, thank you. I&#x27;ve been tinkering around with Julia, and was trying out 2D random walks. Not being able to use a 2 dimensional array and store the position [0, 0] confused me. I ended up starting at X,X (where X &gt; total number of moves) and then got stuck with plotting it nicely, because I wanted the plot axes to show how far it had moved, not X +- how far it had moved.')
