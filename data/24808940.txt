P not being NP doesn&#x27;t mean any individual problem is hard.<p>A good, related problem is graph isomorphism (check if two graphs are the same, just with the vertices in a different order). The complexity of this isn&#x27;t known, it&#x27;s between P and NO at the moment.<p>However, it&#x27;s VERY hard to make hard instances. Basically all real world, or randomly generated, graphs can be solved in about O(n^3) time. There is significant research into just finding the hard cases.')
