Item(by='loganfrederick', descendants=None, kids=[25557356], score=None, time=1609138673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25556726, text='First, the blog post does cite &quot;The End of Accounting&quot; by Lev and Gu, which provides a pretty good academic dive into this topic and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who likes this post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Accounting-Forward-Investors-Managers-Finance&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1119191092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Accounting-Forward-Investors-Managers...</a><p>Second, in conversations with professional investors (firm with AUM &gt;$1B), their analysts and portfolio managers have been making these kind of intangible asset adjustments for years, if not decades, now. That&#x27;s the whole point of having professional investment analysts, especially at &quot;value&quot; firms; they wouldn&#x27;t be able to generate alpha if they weren&#x27;t trying different methods to identify opportunities. So all this &quot;intangibles&quot; chatter that&#x27;s become popular in tech media isn&#x27;t news to the investment community.<p>Third, the big question inspired by the book but not covered as much in this blog post is: If investors are already making valuation adjustments for intangible assets, and company&#x27;s are having to estimate a lot of the accounting inputs anyway, then is it better to try and fix&#x2F;update GAAP, or can we just reduce the regulatory paperwork burden for public companies and have investors demand the metrics for each company that they feel are relevant?<p>Fourth, this post is a good overview of the topic and something anyone in a business role at a tech company (and ideally eng&#x2F;prod&#x2F;design as well) should understand.')
