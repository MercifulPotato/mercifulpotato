As a Brazilian, it&#x27;s shocking to see the lack of dental care in virtually any other country (I&#x27;ve been to many and lived in a few).<p>In Australia they were charging me 7k AUD for wisdom teeth extraction, and they wanted to take me to a hospital to do general anaesthesia... nuts!<p>In Germany the cleaning procedures were super basic and the doctors were not very careful.<p>Beyond being very expensive, the dentists are scared of doing certain procedures. I wonder if it&#x27;s due to liability, improper education, or something else.<p>Unfortunately many countries still don&#x27;t treat dentistry as a vital part of your healthcare.')
