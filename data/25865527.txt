Our center has a AI &quot;stroke&#x2F;clot&quot; detector algorithm software, that&#x27;s based on a training set of 50 CTs.  It&#x27;s ok, say at a 2nd year medical student level at reading images, i.e. not to the point anyone would trust them.  But if the clinical writes in their documentation that the software was utilized to analyze the images, the hospital gets an extra couple grand of reimbursement from the insurance company, apparently.  Exactly what rules apply here, I don&#x27;t know.')
