So to stretch your analogy. Imagine I&#x27;m a door manufacturer, or maybe a manufacturer of tools for construction so that professionals can make their own doors. I create some kind of stencil that has the doorknob placement cut-out. And maybe a few variants with places for windows and such.\n The general idea of such a stencil might be patentable, even if the general standard dimensions are not. The tool is a unique idea (maybe).\n But we are talking about copywritten material. The specific stencil design, that you could photocopy is the thing in question.<p>And that is one of several arguments Oracle made, that api interface is a stencil.<p>I think I would agree the law supports that argument from what I know about it, copyright is pretty broad. But at the same time, I think that is perverse and we should change the law.')
