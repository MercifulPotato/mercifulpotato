Of course, this is big money, and the vast majority of individual ads are of the type you mention.<p>But it&#x27;s quite likely that the majority, or at least plurality, of ad spending goes to the changing minds kind of campaign. This is especially visible in the massive popularity of lifestyle marketing campaigns, that seek to create a particular image making a product (or even type of product) more desirable. Think of the Coca Cola Christmas, &quot;green&quot; cars, hyper-technologized &quot;smart&quot; fridges&#x2F;washing machines, fashion brands, Apple&#x27;s success a few years ago in convincing people to change their phone each year etc.<p>You also shouldn&#x27;t forget the disgusting world of children&#x27;s advertising, where often the goal is to convince children to nag their parents or friends about an item - often by explicitly showing this type of behavior, which works wonders with small children especially.')
