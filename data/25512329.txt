There are typically a few types, more like a board, so I ask for the flimsy ones used for cheap showers, and they take me to a stack of them in the lumber area. They are very thin, like an eighth of an inch. You&#x27;ll need a vehicle larger than a sedan, BTW, this are BIG. But you can also have them cut for you, often no charge.')
