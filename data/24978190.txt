Item(by='dalke', descendants=None, kids=[24978716], score=None, time=1604398526, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24978117, text='Oops, I didn&#x27;t explain that part.<p>One of the joys of the iPod was that I didn&#x27;t really have to worry about charging it on a regular schedule. It would hold its charge for a long time. Eg, I took it bike camping and listened to Hardcore History&#x27;s multi-part episode on Genghis Khan over a couple of days, with no need to charge up.<p>That&#x27;s no longer the case. The battery life has gotten worse over the last couple of years, likely from age. It now doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple of days. I suspect that if I buy another old iPod then its battery will also be 10 years old and not in good shape.<p>If I don&#x27;t find a good option for new hardware, then used is definitely a backup alternative!')
