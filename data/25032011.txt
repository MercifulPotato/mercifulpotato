Item(by='barry-cotter', descendants=None, kids=[25032403], score=None, time=1604904232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031892, text='&gt; the main physical benefit from weightlifting (strength training in particular) is that you can lift heavier things.<p>Personally I got religion on weight lifting after reading a book on aging. Losing bone and muscle mass is inevitable with age but if you have a good base you’ve got more to lose. If you keep on weight lifting you lose it much slower. I never got serious about it. I’ve never broken 100kg for a squat and I’m perfectly ok with staying there forever. But I’m going to get weak slower than those who only do cardio and I aim to able to sit up unassisted for as long as possible, and to avoid breaking a hip too.')
