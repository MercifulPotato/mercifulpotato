Its weird but you get used to it...)<p>------<p>The job of error correction is usually to convert sensewords back into data. Sensewords represent &quot;what the receiver sensed&quot;. If no errors occurred, its usually very easy to convert sensewords back into data... but if an error occurred, then you must calculate the syndromes and then figure out a methodology to correct the errors.<p>Coding schemes set up the matrix in different ways. It seems like Vertibi Algorithm has a graphical representation of the matrix, or something... I still don&#x27;t understand it but hopefully this post of mine can give you a leg up in understanding what&#x27;s going on.')
