It was quite a capable system to fit in less than 64K. Great memories.<p>At the time Borland intended to develop their own version of Modula-2 for IBM PC, so they bought ours as a complement for the CP&#x2F;M versions they were still covering. But the in-house version got delayed a lot. It was eventually released as Topspeed Modula-2 several years later, from a spinoff. If Borland had let us also do the IBM-PC version in around 1984, maybe history would have changed and Modula-2 would have become more popular.')
