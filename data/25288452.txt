Find some way to break up CO2 from the atmosphere and bond hydrogen to the carbons. It creates a relatively safe, easy-to-use hydrogen storage medium and it reduces greenhouse gases at the same time. The cars would just need to break the carbon-hydrogen bonds to release the energy once again, and the process is GHG-neutral.')
