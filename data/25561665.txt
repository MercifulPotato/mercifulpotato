Both times the laptop was out of warranty but was in the service window.  Dell said that the battery was not a &quot;user serviceable part&quot; and would require me to ship the laptop to them with a estimated 2 week repair turnaround.<p>I ended up buying a battery on eBay both times along with a screwdriver kit with a T5 star bit (I think that was the size) the first time.  It takes about 5 minutes to swap the battery.<p>I just looked in my email and the seller I used was &quot;good-batteries&quot; but it looks like they don&#x27;t sell on eBay anymore.')
