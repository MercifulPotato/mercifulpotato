Python made a specific choice not to do that (and there are cases where you don&#x27;t want to use &quot;self&quot;, such as metaclasses, classmethods, and (rarely) nested classes that close over their parent class.<p>Like I said: most of the time, a missing `self` is an error by the user, and so python requires explicit notification both to the language, and to other people, that you&#x27;re doing what you mean to do, and not just making a mistake.')
