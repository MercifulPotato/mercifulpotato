I even used the terminal commands to change the granularity of the blocks and extend the length.<p>And the same things happens to me. A lot of times I don&#x27;t even want or think of going to HN, Reddit, Twitter. I&#x27;m just bored or frustrated and, almost unconsciously, I hit the shortcuts for Browser &gt; New Tab &gt; Focus Address Bar &gt; Start typing n, r or m (for mobile.twitter.com).<p>Some things that helped a lot with this, together with SelfControl, is to change all new tabs to a blank page and disable autocomplete in the Firefox navbar.<p>That last one is not very good for everything, so it would be better to just delete those automatic sites from the suggestion list. I never really took the time to see how it&#x27;s done of FF, though.<p>To change the timings in SelfControl, use (sorry, it is a very very old note in Evernote so I don&#x27;t have the original source anymore):<p>defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl MaxBlockLength -int [maximum block length in minutes]<p>defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl BlockLengthInterval -int [block length interval in minutes]')
