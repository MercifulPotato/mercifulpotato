When Facebook says they are going to hire 3000 engineers, they are adding 3000 people to the Facebook organization. Even if they don&#x27;t know what division &#x2F; project &#x2F; team &#x2F; etc those people will end up in.<p>Edit: Probably a better thing to say is - even if I was using org chart wrong, I don&#x27;t see how it would make a difference.
