And don&#x27;t expect apps to talk to the apps on your phone - you mostly have to enter all details into the Garmin apps again (using the Connect software on your phone).<p>However, I recently switched to an iPhone and bought an Apple Watch and it&#x27;s <i>so</i> much better if you are more into smart watches instead of a fitness tracker with smart features. Yes, the battery has to be recharged as often as I do. And yes, it&#x27;s a touchscreen that&#x27;s utterly useless in a downpour or when swimming. But apart from that, and I don&#x27;t say this easily, I get more from the Apple Watch than from my Garmin then-top-of-the-line model.')
