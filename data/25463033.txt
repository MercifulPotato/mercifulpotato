She wasn&#x27;t always like this, prior to my meeting her, she spent a few years working at her family&#x27;s restaurant where her daily schedule would be something like:\n- Wake up at 10:00AM\n- Go to work by 11:00AM.\n- Get off work at 10:30PM.\n- Eat &quot;dinner&quot; at around midnight-1AM.\n- 1AM-2&#x2F;3AM is free time.\n- Go to sleep at 3AM, rinse repeat.<p>She was not like this when she worked an office job (fashion designer), but now she can&#x27;t get back to a &quot;normal&quot; schedule.')
