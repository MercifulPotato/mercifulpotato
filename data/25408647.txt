A robust solution requires a proper CSV parser.<p>I haven&#x27;t tested corner cases, but marcel relies on the python csv module, which is probably better than any initial attempt at a parser that I could write in an hour.<p>This is what I meant about sublanguages. Many people, (myself included), would need to go to the man pages to find the necessary arguments to awk, sort, and cut. I find it much easier to just write a little Python, even if the end result involves more typing.')
