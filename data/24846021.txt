I mostly see method syntax in my codebase. I also see terribly performing linq queries all over the place.<p>I think it&#x27;s neither good nor bad, it&#x27;s just a tool. Tools are useful for making things, but if wielded improperly they will hurt you.<p>I&#x27;m sure same arguments can be made against raw SQL. It&#x27;s possible to have good codebases in any paradigm, and bad codebases in any paradigm. It&#x27;s really all down to the quality of implementation.<p>As a side note if you want a creative way to backup a database just use try logging an EntityFramework tracked object in Serilog with the destructuring operator. Watch as the logging framework inadvertently causes an entire object graph traversing navigation properties endlessly make infinite SQL queries while your web server slowly runs out of ram. Fun times!<p>Powerful tools are usually sharp.')
