Society made obvious shifts with the invention of the car. With the invention of the printing press, we adapted by teaching people to read the things it produced.<p>Adapting to our tools seems like the reason we live anything like we currently do. Otherwise we&#x27;d still live in communities in the woods, with technology that has adapted to us (which is an interesting thing to think about).')
