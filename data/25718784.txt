Homebrew, Go, and Parallels use on Apple Silicon have all been brought up before.<p>I do agree that there&#x27;s enough articles covering the same review feedback. The M1 machines seem to be universally lauded, there&#x27;s plenty of buzz out there, I&#x27;m not sure what the downside is there besides certain software not being able to run on them yet. Personally I&#x27;m willing to wait a year to see what the second gen machines will look like, but that&#x27;s based on my own preferences and curiosity.')
