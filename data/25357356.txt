Our iOS version does not require &quot;full access&quot; for either version, online or offline. This way Apple makes sure no one (not even us) has access to what you type. Other keyboards (such as Google) require &quot;Full access&quot; or allow it be enabled at the explicit permission of the user (e.g. Swiftkey). Typewise does not even have this option. There is no other guarantee. Even a certification of a provider would not help, because they would have to check every update.\n&gt; Also, is the layout and key shape patented or is it an open standard?\nYes, the layout and key shape are patented internationally.')
