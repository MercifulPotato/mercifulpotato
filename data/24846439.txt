That is a fundamental fallacy in this whole way of looking at things. We seem to have this belief that, if only our government experts could find the right aggregate measure and micromanage the economy based on it, everything would work just fine. That belief is false.<p>Well, right now they are &quot;macromanaging&quot; it away from a system that could possibly work. Central bank policy heavily skews toward capital and thereby into deflation (or at least lack of inflation). Inflation is the treadmill that keeps the economy going and it  has been broken for a long time.<p>The more I get into economics the more I understand that the real world is not meaningfully different from a game in terms of policing. The details are different but general concepts like deflation or inflation are still the same. The fact that economies can only function if money is in the hands of those who are doing the work is still the same. In the most realistic economy games it is even possible to liquidate your company and start fresh after messing it up. So there is now the obvious problem that if you want a growing player base you can&#x27;t just let the biggest players take over 90% of the market and force newcomers to compete with them and let almost all of them fail like in the real world. Unemployment can&#x27;t exist in such a game, &quot;unemployed&quot; players aren&#x27;t playing the game!<p>Well, the obvious answer to solving unemployment is a job guarantee funded through &quot;printing&quot; money. If people are unemployed they will take the job guarantee which in turn creates new money. Suddenly there are lots of paying consumers but since the guaranteed job doesn&#x27;t actually increase the supply of goods we get to see inflation among consumer goods. Now you may be thinking that this will cause runaway inflation except it can&#x27;t. When demand for products increases, so does the demand for labor. New jobs are created which pay more than the job guarantee but they don&#x27;t cause inflation. It&#x27;s a self balancing system.')
