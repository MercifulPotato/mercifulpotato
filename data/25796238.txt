It&#x27;s like trying to buy a house in the bay area.  there&#x27;s very few people who can afford to buy a bay area house but there&#x27;s even fewer houses for sale and so the prices keep going up and up and up.<p>What matters is the ratio of buyers to sellers.  and once you run out of sellers, the price starts going up again.')
