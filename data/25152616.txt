Item(by='nicpottier', descendants=None, kids=[25152693], score=None, time=1605810456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151954, text='&gt; Its like paying a restaurant not to harass you and then going to it when you could just go to the restaurant next door without the protection fee.<p>No, it&#x27;s like paying the restaurant for the damn food. YouTube hosting all the world&#x27;s videos forever is not a god given right, nor is being able to watch content people create for free.<p>I despise ads, absolutely despise them, but gladly pay YouTube the $15&#x2F;mo to remove them because I know good content needs to be paid for one way or another. There&#x27;s still a few channels that I like that put in ads during the videos and that&#x27;s still annoying, but otherwise I never see an ad.<p>And this is fucking fantastic! Imagine if the web as a whole adopted this. (I know there are efforts including Google&#x27;s) If I could pay $10&#x2F;mo to get rid of all ads (explicit and implicit) and have that go towards the creators that I consume content for, then we&#x27;d be in a much better place. (imagine if FB just got a cut of that for example, how that would change the dynamics)')
