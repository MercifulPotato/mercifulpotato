Go is an excellent language for quick prototyping and easy distribution.<p>The investment to become fluent in Go might literally be an order of magnitude less than becoming fluent in rust.<p>Rust might be the perfect language in terms of capabilities and safety, but it is far from a simple language.<p>The function signatures from even some simple methods have become ridiculous. I’ve seen enough examples where it was needed to unpack a value two or three times to get the value you want.<p>The perfect language probably doesn’t exist, but go is one of the easiest compiled and strongly typed languages to learn. And that in itself is quite an achievement.')
