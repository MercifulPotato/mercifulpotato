Love the new ADTs and braceless syntax: really gives the language a cleaner and more ML inspired feel.<p>No other conventional language (including OCaml, F#, etc) seem to have the effortless kind of power Scala does.<p>The combination of the extremely powerful type system with the &quot;OOFP&quot; paradigm is a great combination. OOFP is such a great paradigm and it&#x27;s unfortunate that no other language has embraced it.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that I love Scala so much because I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy dealing with the JVM and all its complexities and problem. But Scala is so good that it mostly makes up for it.<p>Scala does get a lot of hate (especially around here), but I&#x27;ve never really understood why. There&#x27;s only one language I like more (kdb+&#x2F;q), but that&#x27;s a hard sell, especially because of the cost.<p>Too bad there&#x27;s not really a ML&#x2F;AI ecosystem around (besides Spark, which seems to be losing favor partially because of its embarrassing performance), because using Python is such a drag.  However, I do understand why non-CS&#x2F;type theory people might find the language intimidating.<p>But to that I&#x27;d say, I&#x27;ve seen new junior (though very smart)  developers with no Scala or FP experience get onboarded and write idiomatic Scala code within a couple weeks to a month. The short term cost is more than worth it considering the absurd productivity compared to Java&#x2F;Kotlin&#x2F;Python&#x2F;blublang.<p>Compared to OCaml&#x2F;F#&#x2F;Haskell, the improvement is a little less stark, though still clear imo (especially when considering editor tooling and available packages).')
