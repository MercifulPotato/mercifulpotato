I&#x27;ve grown up helping with various renovations around our home (floor tiling, wallpapers, building kitchen furniture etc), and they are fond memories and it makes a difference to how you feel living in a place. I know today mobility and renting is everything, but there is quite a distinct feel of living in actually your own place that you&#x27;ve worked on over the years with family or friends helping out. Now, we were poorer than most people around here for sure. Still, it&#x27;s not the same when you just pay others to do it.<p>What&#x27;s life about? What do you buy that time for? To have more time to &quot;consume content&quot;? Or to go on a vacation and sit at the beach being served cocktails? For many people, these quests for finding good deals, fixing stuff, etc. is like a &quot;side project&quot; or a side quest that contributes to their self-image and life satisfaction long-term.<p>If you eliminate all hassle, you could just as much pay people to live instead of you.<p>Now if you really loath some ways of spending time, sure try to make others do those. But not every &quot;hassle&quot; is wasted time. You can even learn new interesting things, interact with different types of people, while getting advice for laying your floor tiles or whatever.<p>I don&#x27;t think this super productivity focused view is healthy long term, that all time must be spent either on brushing up on new job-related skills to chase more money, or on actual work time to fight for higher job positions, to make your hourly time even more expensive, so you do even less worldly stuff...<p>I wonder if there will come a new celebrity-backed fad (following mindfulness, minimalism, normcore etc.) where people do these mundane tasks themselves and give it some cute snappy buzzwordy name and there will be scientific studies that it increases one&#x27;s well being.')
