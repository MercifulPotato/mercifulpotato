Item(by='oblio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607296642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326351, text='&gt; One of the stunning things for me about &quot;blockchain&quot; revolutionary hype is how long it has gone on without significant accomplishment.<p>I think that there is a lot more money in the world right now than 20 years ago and definitely than 400 years ago.<p>A lot of it is just dumb (people inheriting money or getting it for other reasons than intelligence or financial acumen: singers, athletes, etc.) and some it is exploratory&#x2F;inherently risky (VC) or both. So a bubble can last much, much longer and be much, much bigger.<p>We&#x27;re probably going to see more of these.<p>I guess at this point I should probably just say that I regret not being smart&#x2F;connected enough to be at the collecting end of one of these hype trains :-)))')
