Basic idea is to keep heating and folding the steel, then hammer it flat, then heat and fold again and again. Then, once you fashion the knife blade you etch it in acid and it shows up all the striations from the folding.<p>Interesting patterns can also be made starting with lots of pieces of steel like a handful of bolts and you heat and twist them together.')
