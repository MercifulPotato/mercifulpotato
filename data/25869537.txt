It&#x27;s unbelievable that in a world where we promote privacy and freedom of individuals such cross-country trackers exist. It seems more an Orwellian story rather than reality.<p>2. I&#x27;m a bit ignorant on this theme on a technical level (I have a business background, even if working at a tech startup focused on security). There is a growing concern globally over an increasing sensitisation over privacy and over the importance of security. Even Google has promised to remove third party cookies within 2 years, and there is going to be a migration from Whatsapp to Signal (even if Whatsapp clarified a bit on that). Do you think that such fresh tools like these &quot;favicons&quot; or simple tracking will remain long term?')
