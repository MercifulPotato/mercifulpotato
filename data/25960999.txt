My wife and I left London 3 years ago when we found we were expecting, and have been working away at a pair of projects since then. The first is now a two year old toddler, and the second is this.<p>The short version is, I spent 14 years running marketing and design teams&#x2F;companies, and have been involved in thousands of conversations around product and marketing strategy. In that role, I&#x27;ve spent years playing with the hundreds of tools which give you data on what people are doing, but grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of any tools to help you think about what to do next based on it. My wife, albeit from a different industry kept running into the same issues.<p>So we set created this. Think of it as the scientific method meets strategy for creative teams.<p>If you&#x27;ve got any feedback or want a demo, feel free to email me at pete@hirund.in')
