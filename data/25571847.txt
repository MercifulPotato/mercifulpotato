Most people I know with RSIs opt for the Microsoft ergonomic keyboards (The new ones are actually kind of cool looking!)<p>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s working out for you, and I&#x27;ll certainly sneer a little bit less at them in the future, but just using my anecdotal experience, a lot of RSIs make chording keys difficult, and most people who use small form factor keyboards say they do so because it makes their desk less cluttered. Maybe it&#x27;s not <i>just</i> a fashion item... But for a certain segment, it certainly is.')
