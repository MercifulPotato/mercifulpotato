The fact of the matter, golang is also extremely annoying when writing &quot;high quality production code&quot;. golang errors are error-prone, and on more than one occasion we&#x27;ve had instances where errors are mistakingly ignored. This is much worse than exceptions where they have to be explicitly swallowed, otherwise they&#x27;d automatically bubble up.')
