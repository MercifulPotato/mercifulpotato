Let me quote them directly:<p>&quot;Oh, you&#x27;re one of THOSE people.&quot; (<i>What people?</i>)<p>&quot;Trump is not being impeached.&quot; (Simple to verify, not up for debate.)<p>&quot;Biden is not Trump&#x27;s opponent.&quot; (Didn&#x27;t need to be questioned, but apparently it&#x27;s also up for debate?)<p>&quot;There is no truth.&quot; (Then what are we talking about?)<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t trust CNN.&quot; (But anyone with a YouTube account and a webcam is trustworthy.)<p>&quot;Vindman is from Ukraine, so we don&#x27;t know what his loyalties are.&quot; (You can&#x27;t tell how trustworthy a person is based on where they were born. Textbook racism.)<p>&quot;Watch the DOJ.&quot; (My spy van is in the shop and I lack a desire to confirm your biases.)<p>&quot;I love you.&quot; (You can&#x27;t cross a bridge after you&#x27;ve just burned it to the ground.)<p>The fact is, a person can only form correct beliefs if they test those beliefs in the crucible of reality. Sitting on the couch in some shit-smelling hoarder&#x27;s hovel living off of your retirement is not a recipe for finding the truth.<p>Beliefs must have consequences, and as a consequence of their beliefs, they won&#x27;t be seeing me alive again. It&#x27;s really the least I can do. I&#x27;m not interested in playing a stooge for them to gleefully fling their ignorance at.')
