It stayed #1 for the whole day and brought me a lot of useful feedback: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23896856" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23896856</a><p>From that day, I kept in my mind to create an application to enable people to create a 3D Cover and embed it without caring about the HTML and CSS, just by copying and pasting a small code snippet wherever they want.<p>I developed it using tools I already knew, using cloud services when possible, because my goal was to release as soon as possible.<p>A small overview of the tech stack:<p>- Node.js&#x2F;Express for the webserver<p>- Heroku to host the webserver<p>- MongoDB Atlas for the database<p>- React, only for the 3D cover editor<p>- Auth0 for the authentication<p>- Cloudinary to host images<p>- Stripe to handle premium account purchase<p>What do you think?')
