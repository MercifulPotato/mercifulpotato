Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607049972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25295823, text='&gt; My first inclination on that speculative bubble is that it was silly, but I didn&#x27;t comment on it because I don&#x27;t know if there were supply and demand conditions to support it<p>So I researched the Beanie Babies bubble and it also does not seem irrational. Ty Warner encountered a temporary supply chain problem and announced that was permanent, and this was not priced in as in, nobody expected that. Beanie Babies did have high sales before this, and people wanted ones they couldn&#x27;t get.<p>The Beanie Babies bubble burst when Ty Warner flooded the market with too many variants at once. He didn&#x27;t know it at the time and was also more interested in his own revenue.<p>It is not irrational if the traders factored in the possibility of the market being flooded. Does that include the infamous tale of a divorced couple splitting their Beanie Babies investments on a family courtroom floor? I don&#x27;t think that matters. This is a hallmark of all markets, a spot commodity that there is more of.<p>Beanie Babies traded at their retail value after Christmas 1999. It is possible to have sustained above market value, such as with diamonds. Maintain the scarcity properly at the expense of near term revenues.<p>In relation to crypto, the market doesn&#x27;t become diluted just because there is &quot;more cryptos&quot;, the digital commodities that have known immutable supply and market share occasionally have supply shocks and are expected to have them at greater amplitude.<p>At this point, I can only draw the line of irrational exuberance at equities and credit market bubbles. And even then, only sometimes. So that gives us South China Sea bubble, and the 90s Tech bubble in the Nasdaq.')
