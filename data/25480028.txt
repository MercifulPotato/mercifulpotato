Hell, I actually forgot the Announcement Trailer released in 2013, a full two years before The Witcher III.<p>That said, they probably needed either another 30-50 people working on the game from the start, or they needed another 2-3 years to totally flesh the game out, which in reality is what happened with The Witcher III. The last patch for that game was released in 2018.<p>To build a huge city from the ground up is a monumental task. Rockstar already has a lot of assets from earlier GTA games available. CDPR had to do this all from scratch. I think a Cyberpunk 2077 II will be a fantastic game in 5 or 6 years.')
