It&#x27;s not like protectionist policies directly led to the economic problems the US - and a lot of the world - are experiencing thus requiring the stimulus package.<p>The trade war didn&#x27;t improve the US economy. COVID actually squeezed the Stockmarket up (as interest rates hit 0 or negative) from stimulus (around the world).<p>I think you are probably right that it wasn&#x27;t protectionist policies directly. But the US governments &quot;Me, and Mine&quot; (America First) approach has wilfully ignored good advice, policy and approach that has lead to its current situation.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a bungled response to early days... it&#x27;s consistent bungling from the first day until right this minute. (A pandemic with no generally available vaccine, wide spread infection, and no nationally coordinated mitigation = bungling, whatever excuses you make about US gov structure etc...).<p>China and US have always had a tumultuous relationship exactly because they don&#x27;t try to resolve it, they see each other as rivals, and a threat.')
