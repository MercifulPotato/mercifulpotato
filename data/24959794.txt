When reading the copy, the line where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to the character by mistake. The original character (𡚴) was not added to JIS or Unicode until much later and doesn&#x27;t display on most sites for me.</i><p>Meanwhile, in a parallel universe where ASCII was invented in asia and latin characters were not available until unicode was established:<p>&gt; <i>For example, Ä was an error introduced while trying to record A below a dotted line. When reading the copy, the dotted line was added to the character by mistake. The original character (A) was not added to Unicode until much later and doesn&#x27;t display on most sites for me.</i>')
