We must provide the necessary tools for our law enforcement to investigate, prevent, and prosecute these heinous, violent crimes,” said Rep. Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “This bill would also direct resources for investigations into hate crimes incidents with a nexus to domestic terrorism. As a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent, I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation that would codify offices within our federal law enforcement agencies to combat and prevent domestic terrorist activities and threats.”<p>&gt; “White supremacy and domestic terrorist organizations have no place in America. Rhetoric from the outgoing President and right-wing political leaders have emboldened white nationalist groups to pursue violence as a means to an end. On January 6, we experienced the terror of white nationalism in full display as domestic terrorists attacked our Nation’s Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. This bill would provide federal agencies with the resources they need to keep Americans safe from the threat of home-grown terrorism and strengthen partnerships with state and local law enforcement to combat hateful violence. The Domestic Terror Prevention Act is more important than ever as we work to root out and rid America of this cancer,” said Rep. Vincente González (TX-15).<p>Could someone help me understand why people thought the Capitol protestors were white nationalists? I&#x27;m not saying there were no white nationalists among the thousands there (obviously), but it seems rather divisive (and a huge stretch) to label the entire thing as a white nationalist terror attack?<p>Am I the only one who also thinks the threat of white nationalism is being way over exaggerated to push new surveillance and censorship policies? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m being ignorant here, but I genuinely can&#x27;t think of a single white nationalist terror attack that&#x27;s happened in the US in recent history. Perhaps the worst thing that comes to mind was the Charlottesville rally, but that wasn&#x27;t exactly a terror attack.<p>What&#x27;s more, there have been actual domestic terror threats which have resulted in deaths and millions of dollars of property damage. Groups like Antifa literally pride themselves on their violent and destructive methods to bring about political change, yet this seem to be of little concern.<p>Am I being unreasonable to think the threat of white nationalism is being exaggerated to push policies which restrict our civil liberties? Obviously we need to ensure we have the right tools to prevent terrorism, but I often get the feeling this is less about preventing terrorism.')
