Starting to use types, even nominal ones, to express your requirements is a real game changer, a step change in your defect rate: it turns making a correct program from an intractable global problem into a compositional problem that you can reason about locally. Using constructive types is a technique that eliminates a couple of rare classes of errors. It&#x27;s fine, and if you can do it cheaply (which is pretty rare in practice IME) then it&#x27;s worth doing, but it&#x27;s really not a major difference-maker. And I think a post like this could easily give the impression that newtypes aren&#x27;t all that, so to speak, when nothing could be further from the truth.')
