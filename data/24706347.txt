As an example, Fastmail uses DOMPurify (and sponsors its bug bounty—I presume the latest mXSS listed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;bugbounty&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;bugbounty&#x2F;</a> corresponds to this thing—and as noted, it didn’t affect Fastmail, because Fastmail uses the DOM that DOMPurify returns, rather than problematic and less efficient serialising and deserialising approach), and you absolutely want to allow &lt;style&gt; in your HTML emails.
