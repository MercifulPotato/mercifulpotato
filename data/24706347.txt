As an example, HTML emails may contain &lt;style&gt;, and any webmail client will want to render that, and they’ll <i>definitely</i> want to sanitise the HTML.<p>Fastmail uses DOMPurify for this purpose, augmenting it with rewriting the selectors in style blocks in order to scope them safely.<p>(Fastmail also sponsors the DOMPurify bug bounty—I presume the latest mXSS listed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;bugbounty&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;bugbounty&#x2F;</a> corresponds to this thing, and as noted, this issue didn’t affect Fastmail; the reason for that is that Fastmail uses the DOM that DOMPurify returns, rather than problematic and less efficient serialising and deserialising approach.)')
