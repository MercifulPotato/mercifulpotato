The zoomable interface of Archy addresses something fundamental that always felt off about current desktop GUIs - the inability to get a meaningful overview, that include both folder structure and file contents , and to be the inability to switch from higher to lower levels of perspective in a continuous way. It seems like Archy made the directory structure appear like a topographical landscape. Current desktop GUIs instead feel like navigating an endless Russian doll of drawers.')
