You can do 80% of the things you will need - which is great for some newbie stuff or for sales presentations. Once you need something complicated, you&#x27;re on your own, while being stuck in a proprietary environment that you cannot extend.<p>You will have to develop some kind of data lake to store unstructured data anyway. You will end up with a  Snowflake data warehouse and a data lake. Why not just go with data lake first then.<p>Databricks&#x2F;Spark are just good platforms to help you do something with structured data in your lake. With the recent additions to its execution engine and Delta (strange naming tbh) it will be pretty much the same as Snowflake for you.')
