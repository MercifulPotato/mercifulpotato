I left a stable job because I have a plethora of health issues and wanted to put the little energy and productivity I have into studying, so I went to Uni. I&#x27;ve burned through my savings (6k or so) in 11 months now and I&#x27;m almost going broke as my sick leave wasn&#x27;t approved any longer.<p>My body literally don&#x27;t cope with stress as my pituitary doesn&#x27;t produce enough cortisol, testosterone or thyroxine. Now that I got the reject letter from our government, I&#x27;ve been panicking and feeling borderline suicidal because everything seems so hard and I feel like I can&#x27;t do it. Fuck being sick.')
