If you can&#x27;t understand why people have a problem with this, here&#x27;s the explanation: <i>there are almost certainly smarter people than you who happened to be more unlucky than you</i>.<p>You were lucky-but-stupid before, so you stopped being so stupid, and now your messages carry the undertone that anyone else is some variation of the person you were back in the stage before you wised up.  It&#x27;s a view that doesn&#x27;t provide any space for people who were wise from the beginning.  When you say things like what you said above, you&#x27;re not highlighting how smart you are or getting down to how dumb other people are; you&#x27;re just highlighting how lucky you were to even have the circumstances where you were <i>allowed</i> to be that stupid in the beginning.')
