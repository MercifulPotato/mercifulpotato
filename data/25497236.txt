In a similar vein, my wife&#x27;s insurance was supposed to cover &quot;out-of-network&quot; ER visits. So one night that we had to go the ER we went to an out-of-network hospital ER because there wasn&#x27;t an in-network one close by. Turns out that the coverage of the out-of-network ER visit basically just covers the cost of the bed in the ER, every treatment that you get (IV, vitals check, medication) is considered out-of-network treatment. This resulted in an absolutely insane bill with charges like $250 for administering oxygen monitor (you know the things you can buy at Wallgreens for $30) or $300 for ibuprofen.')
