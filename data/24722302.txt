If I&#x27;m sitting in my car and looking at an ambulance in the rear-view mirror, it&#x27;s not the mirror itself that reverses the lettering, and that&#x27;s the key thing to understand.<p>The only thing the mirror is doing is reversing the Z-axis. So the question becomes, why does a Z-axis reversal cause me to perceive that the X-axis is getting reversed?<p>If I turn around to look at the ambulance, I just took my head through a 180 degree rotation around the Y-axis. Then (and only then) does the image get reversed on the X-axis.<p>If you could imagine being behind the ambulance, and it were made of some imaginary transparent material, you would still see the lettering as not reversed.<p>The key is to be precise when you use words to describe an optical phenomenon. A mirror reflects, and that&#x27;s all it does.')
