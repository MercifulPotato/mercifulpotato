Item(by='jakobnissen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611039674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823764, text='No, from my own (relatively limited) experience with Numba, if you enable &quot;@nopython&quot;, it&#x27;s about the same speed as Julia, which is the same speed as C.<p>The thing is that Numba is only applicable for simple numeric code. Last I checked it didn&#x27;t even support custom classes. In fact, last I checked it didn&#x27;t even support Numpy - to support &quot;Numpy&quot; it had to internally re-implement much of Numpy, which really says something bad about its use cases. In contrast, the Julia JIT speeds up the <i>entire</i> language from string processing to set operations.<p>Edit: To not be misleading: Julia and C (and Numba) have the same speed only in the simple cases you can apply Numba to. In more diverse workloads, C pulls ahead of Julia for various small reasons.')
