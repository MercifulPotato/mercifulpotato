It&#x27;s pretty clear that Nietzsche is either ignorant (less likely) or trolling (more likely).<p>Nietzsche is happy to take the Stoic phrase of &quot;according to nature,&quot; but isn&#x27;t happy to use the Stoic view of nature. Instead, Nietzsche substitutes his own view, pretending as if the perspectives are one and the same.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that Nietzsche didn&#x27;t know enough about Stoicism to understand that he was arguing in bad faith. Despite presumably knowing better, he falls into the same misunderstanding that most novices do about Stoicism - that it somehow glorifies indifference at the cost of purpose, mercy, justice, regard, and so on.<p>&quot;Indifferent&quot; is a dangerous word to use in this context. Here I use it in the contemporary sense of &quot;apathy.&quot; But it&#x27;s important to note that &quot;indifference&quot; to a Stoic is more subtle - meaning neither good nor evil (or - dare I say - beyond good and evil), but not implying actual apathy.<p>Stoics did not view nature in this way. Most notable Stoics believed in Zeus - and consequentially in intelligent design. They held reverence not for an empty, random, and nihilistic nature, but for one of purpose, order, and beauty.<p>It&#x27;s clear by observing the life of any notable Stoic that they valued the same qualities Nietzsche accuses them of disavowing. Pairing Nietzsche&#x27;s criticisms alongside the very first book in Marcus Aurelius&#x27; Meditations:<p><i>Are Stoics really &quot;profligate&quot; (wildly extravagant&#x2F;shamelessly immoral)?</i><p>&gt; From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals...  From my mother... simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.<p><i>Are Stoics really &quot;without purpose and regard&quot;?</i><p>&gt; From Apollonius I learned... undeviating steadiness of purpose<p><i>Are Stoics really &quot;indifferent without measure&quot; or &quot;without mercy and justice&quot;?</i><p>&gt;  From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice... a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed<p>Indeed, Nietzsche is so far off the mark that he would have benefited from observing the same virtues that Marcus enumerates:<p>&gt; From Rusticus I received the impression... to abstain from rhetoric... and to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book<p>Nietzsche was content to have a superficial understanding of Stoicism - or at least was content to mischaracterize it. The Stoics have much to say of their view of nature - and much of it I discard without the intelligent design component. But that doesn&#x27;t change that Nietzsche cannot honestly substitute his view of nature for the Stoics and fairly criticize them for the contradictions that arise.<p>Part of the beauty of the Stoic philosophy is that it&#x27;s far more forgiving than Nietzsche. Marcus also learned from Rusticus:<p>&gt; with respect to those who have offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled<p>Marcus wouldn&#x27;t mind Nietzsche&#x27;s criticisms very much.<p>Edited for formatting')
