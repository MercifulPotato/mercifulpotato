ISIS represents something &quot;beyond the pale&quot;, so obviously bad that it&#x27;s okay if we censor it because it&#x27;s dangerous and seditious.<p>You object to the comparison because it&#x27;s an <i>attack</i>. We all know ISIS is <i>bad</i>, so the only reason to comparing these people to them is to make it seem like they&#x27;re <i>bad</i> too, even though they&#x27;re trying to say a lot of reasonable things if someone would just listen with an open mind!<p>Obviously, not everyone on r&#x2F;DonaldTrump is down to invade the capitol. I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of people who support ISIS that don&#x27;t support the violence either. No group is homogenously made up of cartoon villains. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we need to be fine with the recruiting grounds for their most violent sects.<p>To be clear, your rhetorical position is the exact same as mine. You&#x27;re perfectly fine with the exact same censorship you&#x27;re ostensibly criticizing. You just want the line to be drawn somewhere else.')
