I hope it turns out to be something that&#x27;s great and worth the money, but if I were a betting person, based on my past experience with a lot of on-line courses, I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that in order to tell if a course is actually any good, you&#x27;ll have to invest a considerable amount of time an effort before you realize it&#x27;s not any good.  I&#x27;ve wasted so many hours into bad courses that I have to wait until one is recommended over and over again before I&#x27;ll give it a chance.')
