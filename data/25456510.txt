Performance is excellent, but in my experience its killer feature is the user definable dictionary. My search engine software stores its documents in an archive to which I need random access. Lots of small documents, random access: bad for compression. Use of zstd with a tuned dictionary improved compression fivefold(!) when compared to the older zlib solution.')
