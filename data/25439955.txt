Where as Keras seem to force you to use a different constructor for different dimensions. That explains why it&#x27;s called convo, since it creates convolutions of any dimension.<p>Also, most options are provided as a map to convo as well it looks like, so you&#x27;d have similar named arguments for convo once you get to defining optional things like padding and strides.')
