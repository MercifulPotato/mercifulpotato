You also end up exploring more of the game world in detail and noticing interesting details that you might miss otherwise. Daily quests are repetitive but they have a bit of variety because you have a different set of players every time.<p>I wonder whether MMO players might be good at real-life grinds that seem tedious but are actually worthwhile, such as exercise.<p>As a data point, I&#x27;m still grinding away at Ring Fit Adventure, which is fun and seems to be beneficial to fitness in terms of increased strength, balance, and energy after several months.<p>I haven&#x27;t managed to enjoy grinding housecleaning yet but I might if I can figure out how to gamify it....')
