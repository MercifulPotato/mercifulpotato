Hence they learn. If you don&#x27;t call this &quot;intelligence&quot; they you can&#x27;t consider the &quot;AI&quot; we do today &quot;intelligent&quot;. I mean, every model a computer executes was invented by a human, the computer only optimized the parameters.<p>I mean, insects can learn to recognize arbitrary objects without anyone giving them training data or a reward function, they just do it on their own. That is a part of general intelligence. The way we do AI can never achieve that, since it always relies on human intelligence to decide all of those things meaning we just get out some optimized function that can fuzzy match input data.')
