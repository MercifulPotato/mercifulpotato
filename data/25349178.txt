I agree about their indestructibility (they&#x27;re the only headphones I&#x27;ve owned in years that haven&#x27;t broken within a year or so!), but mine have developed an annoying hissing sound in one ear when noise cancelling is on. They also have that &quot;plasticky&quot; feel and annoyingly &quot;creak&quot; in the headband when they move around.<p>The comfort is unmatched, however, and battery life is still fantastic on them despite very heavy use. Not sure I can imagine that battery ever dying!<p>I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of buying XM4s but I&#x27;m tempted by Apple&#x27;s. I guess I&#x27;ll give them a try and can always return them if the comfort etc isn&#x27;t as good as Sony&#x27;s.')
