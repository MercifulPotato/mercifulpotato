We were mired in the Cold War (Vietnam, no less). Nixon was in the White House. There was tons of social unrest (Nixon wrote in his memoirs about the thousands of bomb threats and attempted bombings). Civil rights &#x2F; racial tensions were extremely high (MLK was assassinated in &#x27;68). The 70&#x27;s were an absolutely terrible economic decade - oil shock and stagflation, anyone?<p>&gt; huge increase in labor supply: outsourcing, women entering workforce in large numbers<p>I recall watching a presentation a few years back on this, but sadly I can&#x27;t find the link. This appears to be a follow-up on the research, though. (From the Brookings Institute -<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;where_does_all_the_money_go.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk3PGYv7juAhWnJzQIHRWKDYUQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw12lervq-5L32-T0nfCWgRU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https:&#x2F;...</a><p>In 1970, women entered the workforce, so you would have expected productivity to double, so GDP would have doubled, and thusly everyone&#x27;s standard of living, right?<p>Instead what happened is all that extra capital drove up costs in housing and healthcare. Credit cards were introduced and the savings rate plummetted. Instead of having tons of extra money, everyone actually wound up in debt instead. (Please note: I&#x27;m not blaming women entering the workforce for this phenomenon; it was totally our surrounding economic system)<p>My high level point is that I think young people back then had a lot of reason to feel precarious and not trust in their institutions to act in their interests. We probably suffered a lot for it then, but we did eventually build our way out of it, for at least a short while, even if it feels like we&#x27;re essentially further down the economic path now.<p>Edit: cleaned up typo and link, sorry')
