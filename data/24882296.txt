The commenter above you is saying that, if the &quot;checklist item&quot; for a doctor who is told by a patient &quot;I didn&#x27;t get pain medication yet&quot; is not &quot;verify that information&quot;, then the checklist _itself_ is wrong and needs to be changed. There&#x27;s minimal negative impact (a delay to treatment if the patient was lying) and huge positive impact (avoiding doing a procedure without appropriate pain medication)')
