VW will have to deal with the cannibalization of their own business by  BEVs. Same with Hyundai &#x2F; Kia.<p>- Tesla is taking business not only from auto manufacturers, but also from dealerships, gas stations, and insurance (this is a very small part, but it will increase).<p>- Most of the Tesla killers failed to make a significant dent. I don&#x27;t expect 2021 to be the year of the Tesla killer, although there is a slight possibility that ID.3 and ID.4 will sell enough to endanger Tesla.')
