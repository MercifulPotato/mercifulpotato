I also use a Windows traybar app that I wrote with Delphi about 15 years ago, which gives me a dropper I can use anywhere in the screen to see RGB values.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it&#x27;s much more difficult to differentiate tones and colours of small objects.<p>Cues were mentioned in the article, and I think I subconsciously rely on these a lot. For example, with traffic lights I know what the colours should be from top to bottom, and so I &quot;see&quot; them as the right colours - yet if you took photos showing only the colours in the abstract, I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between red and amber, and indeed I wouldn&#x27;t be able to accurately tell you what colour any of them was.<p>Something people find interesting is that I often don&#x27;t know what colour something is, but I&#x27;m often able to narrow it down to 2 or 3 choices - usually based on context and other cues, and also based on how I know I can misperceive colours. For example, I know I often see pink as grey, so if you showed me something pink, I might think it was &quot;pink, or grey or green&quot;.<p>Another random anecdote that demonstrates the use of cues: years ago we had an old CRT TV, and every now and then it would suddenly display only in black and white. It really annoyed my wife, but I never even noticed - I guess in my head I &quot;saw&quot; someone&#x27;s coat as red, for example. My mind just kind of filled in the blanks, like I suppose it must always do.')
