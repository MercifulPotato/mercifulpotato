Single threaded performance is on par with the Intel and less than 5950 (not significantly though) : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>. And because desktop can have many more cores multi-threaded performance is just simply way below. Of course when&#x2F;if Apple increases core count in newer chips they may catch up in this department. Also desktop can have way better cooling. For example on my current desktop 16  AMD with 128GB RAM it goes sustained 4.2GHz without any throttle with the temperature at 60C.')
