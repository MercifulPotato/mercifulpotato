The fast dinosaurs like PayPal have already started seeing the mass extinction ahead.<p>My experience in the past 9 months is that shopify is winning online payments for small vendors with websites, venmo is winning for individuals selling peer-to-peer (e.g. facebook marketplace), and anyone bigger has their own credit card management front-end. I&#x27;ve purchased from many small operations for my hobby (houseplants), and in the past 9 months only 1 of them has advertised accepting bitcoin. YMMV')
