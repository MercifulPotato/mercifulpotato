You likely won&#x27;t learn any of that from your algorithms book.<p>If you tried to implement those algorithms on my team without a <i>very</i> good reason, there would definitely be some serious conversations that followed.<p>In any case, vomiting algorithms on command doesn&#x27;t seem to correlate strongly to programming ability. Almost all programming problems have a lot more to do with handling much higher-level complexity issues. The knowledge and art of knowing how to poke some undocumented third-party API to implement our system is much more practical. Knowing how to think at a high level is much more practical. Leave algorithm questions for research positions in that area.')
