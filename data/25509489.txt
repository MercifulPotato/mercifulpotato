So what?<p>&gt;  If conglomerate bills are outlawed then maybe we can vote on issues instead of on whether everyone&#x27;s back is sufficiently scratched.<p>You are voting on issues either way, and, cynically, voting on whether everyone&#x27;s back is sufficiently scratched, either way. A single subject rule, such as is in place in the California legislature and several other state legislatures, simply reduces scope within which compromise can occur (or, alternatively, just makes the legislative compromises more complex and opaque as mechanisms are found to obey the technical requirements of the rule while evading its substantive intent, such as building in contingencies in one bill that are triggered by the passage or not of another bill.)<p>Quid-pro-quo isn&#x27;t the problem, being able to trade-off across issues is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>The problem is legislators serving powerful narrow interests rather than the broad public interest, but narrowing the permitted scope of individual enactments doesn&#x27;t do anything to help that.')
