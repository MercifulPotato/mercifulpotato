I eat at 4 or 5 pm. This is extreme, but <i>earlier</i> will probably help if possible. No snacks after dinner<p>* Get light exposure as early as possible after waking. A morning walk is good<p>* Exercise close to waking. In practice I do a 7 min workout, eat and walk<p>* blue light blocking glasses help<p>* A sleep mask can help. I use a manta mask + their glasses. I don’t actually sleep with the mask as I side sleep, but I wear it for 10 min or so while laying in bed and I fall asleep, then shift to my side to continue. (For whatever reason I can’t sleep on my back)<p>* Fewer household lights in evening. Lamps are good.<p>* Decide to get ready for bed even if you’re not sleepy. If you start a wind down routine by dimming lights, brushing teeth, reading, whatever you do before bed, you’ll start to get sleepier. It sounds dumb, but if you are, say, staring at your phone for three hours waiting to get tired you won’t get tired.<p>* Keep a log. You may identify changes or factors specific to you that help improve things')
