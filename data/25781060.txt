You can&#x27;t opt out of competition any more than you can opt out of gravity.<p>If you aren&#x27;t &quot;strong&quot; enough to do the hard work, someone else in your town will do it and reap the rewards while you become irrelevant. If your whole town opts out, some other part of the country will do it while your town drifts away into irrelevance and poverty.<p>If the whole country opts out, some other young and hungry country will take advantage of the opportunities your country passes up, until that country makes your country irrelevant.<p>Everything we have is because we or our ancestors (whether literal ancestors or the people that built the countries we live in) did the hard work. A few people can opt out and free-ride on others. But if the whole culture opts out, the whole culture will become irrelevant.')
