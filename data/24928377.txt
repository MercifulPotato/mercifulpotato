Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603960169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927683, text='&gt; The CoCs are completely unnecessary and...<p>If there are multiple organisers of a conference then it makes sense for them to talk amongst themselves, decide what they disagree on, and document it.<p>Say I believe no swearing and no pink shirts and my co-organiser thinks no swearing and no blue shirts. It makes sense for us to sit down before the conference and document our official stance on those issues. Then when I see someone wearing a pink (or blue) shirt I know how to respond without starting a fight on the day with my co-organiser. That sort of CoC makes sense - one that the organisers use to settle their own disputes.<p>CoC implemented as part of some sort of rules-lawyering process are a waste of time. The as-written CoC is meaningless compared to what people organising the conference agree on.')
