Since these changes, I&#x27;ve seen many classmates continue onto the next unit that I _know_ should have flexed.<p>Students have an incentive to complete the program as quick as possible, because our end goal is a high-paying job. Since any grading was thrown out the window for months, students have gotten no objective feedback, and they are in control of flexing now, Lambda is going to graduate many underqualified  students.<p>I believe there is going to be another surge of extremely unhappy and vocal system when this group graduates and begins to search for jobs, because there are many reasons to blame Lambda.<p>The changes Lambda implemented are broken. Attendance is no longer taken, resulting in fewer people going to lecture&#x2F;participating in projects. Track teams are a waste of time and many students don&#x27;t even participate because nobody is taking attendance. The mentor&#x2F;mentee program is broken, because there continues to be many cases of unhelpful&#x2F;unresponsive&#x2F;underqualified mentors and mentees.')
