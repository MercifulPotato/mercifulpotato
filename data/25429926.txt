But realistically, it is not something which will make you a happy person. Most people who are living today could not afford that luxury and are still living a happy life. Maybe even happier than the average American if their culture is a bit less materialistic.<p>In the light that it is going to devastate our planet, travel for leisure is not necessary at all.')
