Their only nod to ABI stability is &quot;use FFI to C&quot; which means your APIs remain unsafe, and doesn&#x27;t work for non-C languages without all your system APIs having other languages layered on top.<p>Swift at least lets you replace individual objc classes one at a time, and is ABI stable, but has no C++ interaction.')
