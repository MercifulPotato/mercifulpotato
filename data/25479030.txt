It&#x27;s hard to me to say from the outside if the hype caused the lack of focus or vice versa, or was just an aggregating factor, but after beating it (and having a blast), I think it would have been better to release only some of the ideas with more polish.<p>The game was extremely well written in my opinion, the gunplay was good, sneaking worked and combat reasonably executed. As a result, the linear parts worked well, but it has a smattering of rough open world mechanics tacked on, just enough to draw comparisons to gta (which are all very unfavorable), and many rough edges around core gameplay things like vehicle driving, enemy ai, and scripted events triggering out of order &#x2F; not triggering at all. And that&#x27;s assuming you are playing on pc, and not a console brought to it&#x27;s knees every hour.<p>My diagnosis is that it feels designed by committee with no one willing to make deep cuts, and as a result suffered from trying to be everything ever marketed to everyone, and ended shipping all the ideas both late and unfinished. They seemingly had no time to polish the core of the game because it was too big.')
