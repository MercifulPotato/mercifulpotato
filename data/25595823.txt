It&#x27;s a low level language. But, in some specific ways, it&#x27;s more expressive than a lot of popular high level languages: traits are sometimes nicer than interfaces, strong concurrency guarantees are great compared to the nightmare of parallel processing in e.g., Java, discriminated unions with pretty good pattern matching is missing from many popular high level languages.<p>You still have languages that can&#x27;t (really) even do async&#x2F;threaded computation (Python, PHP, JavaScript&#x2F;Node can&#x27;t do threads AFAIK).<p>I&#x27;ve said this before: &quot;Rust is the highest level low level language I&#x27;ve ever used. Java is the lowest level high level language I&#x27;ve ever used.&quot;')
