If I could get a few downloads and some feedback, I would really appreciate it.<p>This product is intended for people who rely on long blocks of time to be productive, like writers, software engineers, designers and students.<p>What inspired me to create this was Paul Graham’s essay “Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule”. I read it years ago but only got around to doing it now.

It’s running Firebase on the back-end. All tracks are licensed via Creative Commons and hosted on Firebase Storage.<p>[Vision]<p>As an engineer, I’ve always done my best work in 25 minute intervals while listening to instrumental music.<p>If people find this useful, my vision is to gamify productivity. Like Strava, but for those of us who sit at a computer all day. My hypothesis is that there is value in creating a universal productivity index&#x2F;score that rewards consistency and regular breaks.<p>I feel like this could really help people live a healthier lifestyle while supporting artists and DJs that make instrumental mixes which are perfect for concentration and focus.<p>If you made it to this point and have any questions, feel free to post below. I’ll be around to discuss.')
