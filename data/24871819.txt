I once worked on a project which was a microservices based system for managing various types of infrastructure. Progress was painfully slow.<p>There was a separate testing client that was used for a lot of the demos. The demos on the &#x27;real system&#x27; would fail so often that somebody came up with the idea to just take a lot of the code from the microservices and drop it straight alongside the testing client, as a monolith.<p>It was so much more stable that after becoming the default way to demo, it became the default way to use the tool.<p>5 years on and I believe it&#x27;s still running that way. In this case microservices were massive over engineering.')
