There, you can filter to select reviews that are <i>only</i> for the single color&#x2F;model.<p>It&#x27;s annoying, and it&#x27;s even dumber that the filter dropdown only lets you toggle between all reviews and reviews for the single color&#x2F;model (when I&#x27;d like to compare reviews easily for different colors&#x2F;models), but at least it is there if you hunt for it.')
