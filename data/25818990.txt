It&#x27;s centrally-planned, and even with central-planning taking advantage of pre-existing distribution networks and patient record digitization, the planners still make mistakes with dose distribution. There are four HMOs in this country, one of them has too many doses for the current age tranche and hands them out to younger walk-ins in peripheral areas, two of the HMOs don&#x27;t have enough and are slowing down the progress of the age tranche for everyone else.<p>As bad as the Israeli system is, honestly, it&#x27;s about the best that can be done considering that vaccine distribution in Israel is supply-constrained. They had to stop giving out first doses for about a week until they could negotiate with Pfizer to move up the shipments. What shipments do come in are quickly distributed. As of yesterday, 45+ can make appointments.<p>The US healthcare system is a nightmare. But for all of the US healthcare system&#x27;s many, many, many weaknesses, vaccine distribution is supposed to be a <i>strength</i>. Doses are mass-manufactured and cheap, about $15&#x2F;dose. Private providers are supposed to be able to make their own dosage orders through their own pre-existing suppliers and be distributed through ordinary private logistics networks. Intense competition insures a minimum of dose wastage. The state can minimally regulate to ensure that supply chain participants have adequate refrigeration etc. If the state wants to prioritize frontline workers, the elderly, fine. The state is more than welcome to buy as many (cheap) doses as it wants on the open market, and distribute for free to whoever the state deems to be a priority. But if the state cannot adequately take advantage of the relative supply glut, and efficiently manage the total supply that is available, then the state shouldn&#x27;t freeze out the private market on the excess!<p>What&#x27;s the goal here? The goal is not to immunize the elderly, or frontline workers. The goal is to <i>end the pandemic</i>. That means getting R under 1.0, and that means <i>mass</i> immunizations. That frontline workers or the elderly represent theoretical optimizations in pursuit of that goal is clearly demonstrating to not work out in reality. Let the free market work!')
