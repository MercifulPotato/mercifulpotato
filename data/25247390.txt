(The other mostly just arrogant.) On the one hand, they didn&#x27;t come to any conclusion markedly different from what we (the product people) had already concluded.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure they gave upper management some validation that we weren&#x27;t just drinking our own Koolaid. And they gave business planning staff a fancy spreadsheet model to play with--which helped keep said staff out of our hair.<p>Ultimately, the product was fairly successful although the company couldn&#x27;t really overcome a bad strategic position.')
