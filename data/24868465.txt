I wonder if, &quot;so, we will email SongShift directly&quot; etc., would do.<p>I guess the law doesn&#x27;t say &quot;for free&quot; ? So perhaps they could charge a fee for each API use...<p>It otherwise seems unreasonable to require data-holders (&#x2F;&quot;controllers&quot;) to pay the costs of this &quot;direct transfer&quot;,  esp. re building and maintaining an API.<p>They have in their possession an object which the user owns -- their data -- would we, in analogous cases, require stores to do anything other than &quot;hand it back&quot; ?<p>This seems quite an odd law.<p>EDIT: given downvotes, let me clarify: I like the law. It is useful. I just want to understand the moral&#x2F;legal&#x2F;economic logic.<p>This law imposes costs <i>somewhere</i>, and prevents some services being offered.')
