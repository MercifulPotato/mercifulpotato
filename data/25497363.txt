Because apple brings the local area &quot;high tech&quot; jobs, electronics manufacturing. Apple controls the tech, has the management experience, has the worldwide market and brand name. As the local people in the developing world, it would almost feel as a blessing from these companies if they decide to build a factory in their town. So local people and government would bend forward and backwards to win their business. And you never want to piss these companies off, because they might just bring their business elsewhere. There is no shortage of places to do these manufacturing in India or Asia. A pattern I learned from apple and the likes of Foxconn&#x27;s during the early days of their manufacturing in China.<p>Recently india government created tax reductions favorable land prices for electronics manufacturers. Wondering if this plant used any of these incentives. That would be a shame, billion dollar companies used developing world tax payer&#x27;s money and then failed to pay them stated wages.')
