If it seems to work they tell their buddies, tweak the mixtures, share anecdotes. If it becomes widespread, some industry club records this for the purpose of arguing with insurance companies. I am told this off-label use now constitutes the majority of drug prescriptions. All based on (as far as I can tell) no statistically driven testing at all, just stories.<p>(To be clear, I&#x27;m not at all surprised that drugs have &quot;off-target&quot; effects, and may be very useful for things their inventor never imagines. I&#x27;m just a bit shocked how pre-modern our system for collecting this knowledge appears to be. But not an expert, and would love to know more.)')
