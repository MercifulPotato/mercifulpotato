I have however struggled to find practical applications of Thinking Fast and Slow (TFAS). I find a lot of the research descriptive and not prescriptive i.e. works likes this rather than do this or don&#x27;t do this. This is the same struggle with mental models (e.g. Farnam Street&#x27;s writings), they are fun to read but almost impossible to apply. The only mental models that work are the ones that I have extracted from lived experience often at great cost.<p>How have people taken TFAS and put it into action in their work or daily lives?')
