I would say that there is more and more evidence of the involvement of the immune system even with therapies that were considered exclusively chemotherapies. I would suggest looking up the work of Guido Kroemer on immunogenic cell death.<p>On the CAPAC approach fitting that model\nWell, our inclination is that our current knowledge is limited by what can be achieved with our current dosing technologies.<p>For instance, in the specific case of Doxorubicin, you cannot give more than 75 mg&#x2F;m2 without significantly endangering a personâ€™s health.  Assume that only 1-2% of that dose actually reaches the tumor. \nHow would you know what 10x that dose at the tumor would do? Also how could you separate the effect on the tumor and the side effects that it causes?\nAbout 20-30 years ago, investigators were experimenting with increasing the dose by 20-30% by providing highly risky interventions such as bone marrow transplant. Not surprisingly those studies showed that the toxicity from the drugs was leading to deaths more quickly than the actual disease, so the efforts were abandoned.\nWe believe that the CAPAC technology allows one to explore biological effects, including a potential activation of the immune system that we have not been able to explore yet.  And that is only talking about a single chemotherapy.  Imagine if you could have at your disposal many cancer drugs with different mechanisms of action all working at the tumor site at the same time.  The effects could be revolutionary.<p>With regards to the tumor model\nWe have used different syngeneic lines (fast growing, slow growing) and they all point in the same direction. \nWe have not tried yet spontaneous tumor models.<p>By the way, the efficacy is not matched with that of conventional doxorubicin. The efficacy is surpassed with fewer side effects.')
