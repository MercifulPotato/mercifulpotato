Here’s to hoping it will be released next year to balance out the higher end 16” pro and whatever others come out next yet.<p>I had the 12” MacBook for a couple years and the form factor was amazing. I backpacked around the world with it. But it was so underpowered, it was barely useful. I found myself using my phone more and more because it was less frustrating. I would love to see what an M1-powered 12” MacBook could be like!')
