Inverted classrooms are better for some students that had trouble with the normal approach, but are worse for students who thrived under the normal approach.  It&#x27;s not a clear net win in terms of &quot;helping more people&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s my experience from talking to a very small sample.  Do you have an opinion?')
