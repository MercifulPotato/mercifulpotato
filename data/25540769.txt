I do not know what this means. I was not part of any local assemblies as I am not German, nor do I speak German, and many of the assemblies at 35c3 seemed to be treating me very coldly as they are just local clubs from all over Germany. (Understandable, I do not fault them).<p>You don&#x27;t need to be german. International hackerspaces also get vouchers for CCC and travel in groups. Check with your local hackerspace.<p>Think of assemblies as &quot;interest groups&quot; and several are quite approachable over IRC&#x2F;Matrix.<p>A list from previous years: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;events.ccc.de&#x2F;congress&#x2F;2018&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Static:Assemblies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;events.ccc.de&#x2F;congress&#x2F;2018&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Static:As...</a><p>Feel free to also poke me next time you travel if you need people to chat with or hang around.<p>&gt;yes. I was looking into this, Do you have a recommendation for a good website to explore train timetables and routes? What I have to be careful about is timing because if I need to stay overnight in Berlin then it may increase the cost such that if it wastes a lot of time, then it may not be worth saving the additional plane money(as many flights have stops in some other city on the way to Leipzig anyway).<p>Google maps covers most of the train transits in Europe. But the leipzig train went almost every hour except for in the middle of the night if i recall correctly. This isn&#x27;t a transit that goes twice a day and should be easy to jump onto if you don&#x27;t arrive in veryvery odd hours.')
