We are dealing with computers here: virtual idealized worlds ripe for systematic formalism.<p>The &quot;industry&quot; is not about computers, it is about the use of computers to solve people&#x27;s needs. You&#x27;re confusing the engineering with the need.<p>Sure, people wrap up stupid or simple ideas in layers of abstraction, usually because they want to sell consulting.<p>But this article was more about looking beyond the boundaries of simple software development, needing to understand the context of where these systems operate.<p>Essentially, your argument is proving the early part of the article, where the author is comparing how some juniors are excellent &quot;engineers&quot; but can&#x27;t move up to higher levels of abstraction, vs others that might not deal well with individual details, but have a better understanding of how the systems they develop need to interact with the rest of the world.')
