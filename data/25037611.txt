Item(by='untog', descendants=None, kids=[25037635], score=None, time=1604945129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037289, text='&gt; Many people have an aversion to something if it&#x27;s called plant, healthy or natural.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, particularly &quot;natural&quot;. People have been labeling everything they can &quot;natural&quot; for years in order to boost sales.<p>But it&#x27;s interesting that McDonalds is being so explicit. Perhaps Impossible and Beyond Meat have already done the hard work of exposing people to these products and now McDonalds hopes to swoop in without dealing with any of the product confusion?<p>Either way I&#x27;m interested to try them. I&#x27;ve had a few of the Dunkin Donuts Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches and they&#x27;re fantastic.')
