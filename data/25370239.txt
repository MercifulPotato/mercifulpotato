This isn&#x27;t someone you give another two weeks of email access to.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that it&#x27;s not 100% clear it&#x27;s a &quot;resignation,&quot; but in a way, it doesn&#x27;t matter; neither she nor Google wanted to continue their relationship. Complain about Google all you want when you leave, but don&#x27;t send an email threatening to resign and act surprised when you don&#x27;t have a job any more.')
