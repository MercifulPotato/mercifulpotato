But having worked with Perl, Common Lisp, Ruby, NodeJS, and Scheme, I really have to say that I&#x27;d take Perl over all of those. The worst aspect of C would be pointers and unsafe memory access, which Perl doesn&#x27;t have. And the worst parts of Common Lisp would be the massive, inconsistent, designed-by-committee language, CLOS, and macros. Oh, and LOOP (I shouldn&#x27;t need to dig out a reference book to remember how to do looping each time I need to. Seriously.) S-expressions have also worn their welcome on me. I&#x27;m just tired of brace matching (yes, even with your silly fancy IDE).<p>Perl is by no means perfect, but I&#x27;ve found it does more things right than wrong. Blaming Perl for regexes being useful is like blaming a hammer for nails being ubiquitous. What? You&#x27;re going to hand code a lexer each time you need to parse a phone number or a zip code? If there was a better alternative we would be using it.')
