Big businesses are inherently more efficient in many industries because of this. A good example as it relates to farming is the ability to use larger pieces of heavy equipment across more land- rather than the alternative, many smaller tractors, that independent farmers would each own.<p>Also- the ability to specialize. There are lots of different jobs on a farm- on smaller farms you see fewer laborers doing more jobs. On a larger farm- you can specialize labor and increase productivity in that manner.')
