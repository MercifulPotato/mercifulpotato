I have no empirical proof of this, but I would be willing to wager the deed to my house that the vast majority of users, having been explained what a cli is, the benefits of it, and how to use it, would chose to never use a CLI again.<p>As stated, I agree.<p>But &quot;ugliness&quot; and unfamiliarity are big confounds here.<p>The fairer experiment would be something like: For tasks where a CLI app is a better fit than a GUI, would a person trained in the CLI and forced to use it for, say, a day (however long it took to become comfortable and see  productivity benefits) <i>then</i> decide to keep using it, or go back to a GUI?<p>Imagine an office worker and some cumbersome workflow with excel, microsoft word, and GUI folders.')
