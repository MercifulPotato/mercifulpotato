They talked about their perception and experience of where the field of speech recognition products is right now and where we could be headed. They had some brilliant insights and I remember saving the story for later. But I&#x27;m unable to find it in my saves and multiple searches on HN and Google didn&#x27;t lead me to that article. If someone remembers the article, I&#x27;d be grateful if you could share it here.')
