It kept falling apart as the regime kept conducting further chemical weapons attacks. Everything could be dismissed as some grand imperialist plot against Assad. The goal posts moved dozens of times always in reaction to further news that detailed different aspects  of the chemical weapons campaign.<p>Greenwald kept finding ways to dismiss the citizens on the \nground. Because surely RT.com knows better.<p>He then kept dismissing the joint international investigation team while it was in the field. Because surely Assad&#x27;s own press releases know better.<p>After awhile he deleted his Twitter timeline[1]. Greenwald is not a journalist when he carries forward narratives like this, he is an activist. Just like when he carried forward narratives from &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; aka Kremlin during the 2016 election. What he is doing here seems really similar to his conduct from that era. He thought he found -the thing- that exempts something he want to defend from ire. Now an entire narrative is build around it. His little personal fort.<p>I&#x27;ll never be able to forgive Glenn for using his name on Twitter to beat down Syrians who were giving first hand testimony and video evidence. He engaged against them like they were his enemy, likely because they were the enemy of his favored narrative and biases. Disgusting.<p>Here is an archived version of his tweet[2]. You&#x27;ll need it in time after he commits another purge when he moves onto the next indefensible right wing trope he feels like picking up.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;im_pulse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1022690869139464192" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;im_pulse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1022690869139464192</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.vn&#x2F;cmxFp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.vn&#x2F;cmxFp</a>')
