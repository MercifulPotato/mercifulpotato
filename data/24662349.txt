Item(by='vannevar', descendants=None, kids=[24662474], score=None, time=1601645327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24661161, text='<i>The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.</i><p>This seems like a restatement of the explore and exploit cycle in evolution. You start off with very little, so you have nothing to lose by exploring every opportunity. Eventually, one or more of those opportunities pays off, and you become successful. Now the odds favor exploitation, since new opportunities are unlikely to be better than the profitable ones you&#x27;ve already discovered. You&#x27;re better off leaning into those than you are to go off exploring again. Of course, this also means you could get stuck in a local maximum. But life is finite, and the chances of achieving a higher max are low.')
