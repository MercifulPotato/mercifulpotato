For example about embedded dev, I had in mind things less individual tinkerer oriented and more productized. I don&#x27;t know: set-top-boxes, base stations, software for trains, software for washing machines, smartcards, etc; or even big equipment controlled by an OTS desktop&#x2F;laptop-like computer, or a PLC. I&#x27;m sure in a few exotic cases Mac will be involve here and there, but lets be honest, Windows as an host dev station is far more probable. Maybe a few Linux too, but probably far from the majority. And Mac OS would be probably: very far.<p>Now about running Intel code, I know about the excellent x86 emulation layer Mac OS+M1 have, and it&#x27;s great, but I actually don&#x27;t care at all for what I was thinking about, I think that broadly apply for x86 Mac as well. I&#x27;m more thinking about the software ecosystem, the precise HW CPU for devs is only interesting maybe for people developing SIMD code or, well, running VMs.<p>About running VSCode &amp; co, that&#x27;s great to but where are the toolchains for Mac OS host for the targets I talked about? That&#x27;s why I qualified Mac OS in this case as merely used as a &quot;terminal&quot;, I was speaking in the broad meaning of the term, a graphical terminal, not just a VT100 like terminal. The actual toolchains are elsewhere.<p>About web-dev, I admit that&#x27;s probably where you can do most of the non-Apple-only dev while staying really native, although probably not if you need a complex server-side setup. Arguably I went way too far when I wrote &quot;no web&quot;.<p>Well, nothing is absolute, and I know Mac OS remains a general purpose OS even able to host some serious dev. Just I think it is not really the most used one outside of let&#x27;s say client related consumer tech and <i>some</i> pro-desktop tasks, mainly on Apple techs. Claiming embedded in the general case would really be stretching the narrative.')
