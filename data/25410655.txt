I would not be surprised if the hackers gained access to the Treasury the same way.<p>A link sent from an existing trusted sender was sent to one of our employees from a vendor’s procurement director, inviting us to an RFP. The link took the user to a “notion.io” page. I do not recall the contents of the page (may have been a login spoof, but it didnt matter).<p>The hackers then appeared to hijack the “remember me” login session from our employees Chrome.app. Within a few hours, online webmail logins (edit <i>sessions</i> not logins) were occurring all over the world for this user’s mailbox. The hackers then spread the “virus” by emailing this employee’s known contacts the same spoof.<p>I don’t think Microsoft ever fixed the bug, as far as I know. Our method to protect ourselves was to upgrade to IP restricted logins on a higher level of Microsoft 365, and disable the “remember me for 30 days” feature. We’re debating turning off access to web-mail entirely because it does scare me that I think its still possible to do.<p>Anyone else experience this?')
