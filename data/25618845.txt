You’re replying to a summary of the article but it seems that you aren’t really commenting on the summary (expanding something missing or disputing it) so much as commenting on the article itself. Maybe this should be a toplevel comment instead.<p>FWIW, while the article does note, correctly, that China were largely unhelpful with providing information or access, it seems the focus is more on how and why the US government and agencies mostly failed to act appropriately to not being able to get the data they wanted.')
