If the value of Bitcoin was $1, you would not be able to store or transfer large amounts of wealth with it. Based on current circulating supply (not accounting for lost coins) the market cap at $1 per Bitcoin would be $18,590,606. At that market cap, there&#x27;s simply no way to store&#x2F;move a billion dollars, because there just isn&#x27;t enough value in the network.<p>Price going up makes the network more valuable, which allows you to store and transfer more money. Since money storage and transfer is the whole point of bitcoin, price is actually a very important feature, and a proxy for the usefulness of the network. Currently you can store and move billions using the Bitcoin network, and I believe within the next 5-10 years you&#x27;ll be able to store and move trillions.')
