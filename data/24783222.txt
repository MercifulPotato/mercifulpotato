I know ftp is not secure. Not even by a small margin.  It is just like http, back when you could still trust network engineers like you could telephone companies. But it is MAD useful.<p>Before file sharing went mainstream, before corporate networks allowed users to upload files to random websites, before file limits went away, before storage space became infinite, ftp was open and available to all people.<p>I actually had a client tell me that our corporate ftp server was blocked by their firewall. It turned out that they were just too lazy to type in the password. So I crafted a link with the password built in!  That was how flexible ftp was!!!<p>And if I ever wanted someone to share files with me, I would send them the same ftp link with username and password built in, and tell them to paste it into windows explorer. And they could share files with me.<p>If the client wanted to send link to someone else for download, $he could!!!<p>That was how amazing ftp was. Everyone supported (except iOS). It was tried and proven.<p>I just donâ€™t understand this idea behind letting it go.')
