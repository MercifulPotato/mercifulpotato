In fact, their OS is in such shambles and is a disoriented mess with respect to UI consistency. They introduced Vista, Metro, and now Fluent. Yet there&#x27;s almost no coherence and the UI is now a mish-mash of XP, Metro, and Fluent era elements. By the time they announce their next UI, you can bet you&#x27;ll now see yet another ingredient added to the jumbled soup.<p>It really is beyond belief that an organization with so many employees can fail to adhere to a uniform vision and standard and focus on correcting details.<p>I&#x27;m a life long Windows and Android user. But honestly, seeing articles like this and how smooth the UI on macOS and uniformly they apply new updates and UI changes makes me extremely jealous and resentful that Microsoft is so bad at something so basic.<p>Features are great, but users at their start point interact with UI first. They need to fix that before anything else.<p>Now they want to give you the option to run Android apps on Windows through emulation. This just going to create a bigger jumbled mess.')
