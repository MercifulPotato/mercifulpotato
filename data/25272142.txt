Item(by='woah', descendants=None, kids=[25273418], score=None, time=1606871078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270949, text='If a validator signs two blocks at the same height, they will be slashed, lose their tokens, and not be able to participate in consensus. They get slashed when anyone submits evidence of them doing this. This trivially solves the &quot;nothing at stake&quot; problem from 2014 that you wrote your long original comment about.<p>If I understand it correctly, you are now saying that someone would DDOS the entire gossip network, completely halting any more production of blocks so that their slashing doesn&#x27;t go through?<p>We&#x27;re not even talking about &quot;nothing at stake&quot;, or anything having to do with PoS anymore. We&#x27;re just talking about a massive DDOS of an entire network. Node operators in PoS networks, as well as Bitcoin, have ways of dealing with DDOS which are the same as how anyone deals with it, and I don&#x27;t need to get into them here.<p>If someone was able to overcome these DDOS mitigations and completely prevent a PoS network from receiving any legitimate transactions, they could do this to Bitcoin as well.')
