Item(by='shirakawasuna', descendants=None, kids=[25090009], score=None, time=1605322107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25087224, text='An important consideration is that USSR-style communism did not fail because of a fundamentally broken economy, but due to expending vast resources and organization against outside attacks &#x2F; foreign policy.<p>Not that there weren&#x27;t serious economic problems, just that they were not dramatic and certainly not so compared to those of capitalist countries. For example, the Soviet system did a poor job at incentivizing production. Factories that performed worse would often receive greater benefits, as policymakers frequently followed a &quot;squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; approach. This also happened internal to factories or other productive activities, where there was no real incentive to work more efficiently and sometimes a disincentive. These are, of course, easily soluble problems with greater information and adding some incentives for workers&#x27; performance, but I don&#x27;t bring them up because of that - I bring them up because it&#x27;s what workers complained about.')
