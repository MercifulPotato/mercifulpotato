Compared to Matlab implementation or compared to better Julia implementations? To me, numpy operates the same way Matlab&#x2F;Octave&#x2F;IDL does (slow bulky interpreter that basically orchestrates feeding&#x2F;retrieving memory to fast&#x2F;optimized primitives&#x2F;BLAS etc). Coding in Matlab is about &quot;vectorizing&quot;, which is also how I understand numpy to work. So to me numpy has a lot in common with Matlab conceptually in terms of how I approach implementing an algorithm.<p>My assumption was that Julia could at least match that as worst-case but offered better optimizations to get even more performance.<p>I guess it depends on what&#x27;s considered bad habits. Octave&#x2F;Matlab do tend to be not terribly memory efficient so I tend to just buy RAM and larger cache CPUs. But my domain is memory-limited anyway.<p>Matlab&#x27;s JIT does enable some things that are dog slow in octave for example. I assumed that sort of thing would actually be faster in Julia.')
