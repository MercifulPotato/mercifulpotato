I don&#x27;t think that we have built a geopolitical system that will survive its absence.<p>Spending our money on a giant military behemoth makes sense in a mutually assured destruction &#x2F; deterrence sense, but I think that approach only gets you so far. It also creates a gigantic war machine that exists only to find conflicts. The nuclear arsenal strongly deters conflicts from rising above a certain level (as long as rational people are on both sides...), but the rest of the machine gets put to use distressingly often.<p>You can&#x27;t just stop funding it tomorrow, and you can&#x27;t even really reduce its funding without considerable pain and risk, but we must find a way to transition more and more of our military power to economic and cultural diplomacy (which we also have always done, but which has been diminished in recent years).')
