Item(by='willis936', descendants=None, kids=[25456411], score=None, time=1608181594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451772, text='That’s why I said “close to”.<p>I work in a group that has about 30-50 students, 2-3 professors, 3 scientists, 2 postdocs, and 5 techs&#x2F;engineers (depending on how you draw the lines).  Professors make $200k.  Scientists make $80k.  Techs make $60k.  Every single person is highly competent and could easily fetch a higher wage for their skillset.  Nobody’s here because they think it’s a path to a cushy life.  Working among exclusively smart people, having good conversations, not being in a nasty corporate framework, and doing work with purpose are all top reasons to stay in academia.  The list of reasons not to is long (and easy to come by).')
