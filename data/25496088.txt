Item(by='SAI_Peregrinus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608566551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492927, text='No, this is about &quot;How AES <i>encryption</i> works&quot;. Emphasis mine. AES internals are interesting, but they&#x27;re not specific to how AES encryption works. EG AES-CTR-DRBG is a CSPRNG using AES, not an encryption system. AES-CMAC is a MAC using AES, not an encryption system. AES can be used for lots of non-encryption tasks, so the author should have either dropped &quot;encryption&quot; from the title or included information on what&#x27;s needed to turn AES from a block cipher into an encryption algorithm.')
