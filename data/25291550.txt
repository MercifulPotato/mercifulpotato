I don&#x27;t see that that argument holds.<p>From a legal perspective, she was quite clearly terminated.  There was no point at which she &quot;worked on a last date&quot; (her exact words) with her management, they just sent her home.<p>Now, that said, except for her unemployment eligibility, there&#x27;s not a lot of legal meaning to &quot;terminated&quot;.  A later law suit isn&#x27;t going to be bound by definitions like this.')
