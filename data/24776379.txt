We have weakened federal regulations due to the denier in chief and his former-coal-lobbyist EPA director. We also have a lot of states with great renewable potential, either solar or wind, that because of their fossil industry and corruption in politics, leads to denialism and slowing of renewable progress.<p>Contrast that to the EU, where most member states are energy importers and don&#x27;t have their own fossil fuels to use. If they do, then like Germany or Poland, they still use a LOT of coal. It&#x27;s easier for UK to be done with coal: they mined up all of theirs and used it already. Add these factors onto a much more literate and well-educated populace who reads about and cares about climate, and we have an EU that is leading but still not perfect.<p>So, in general, the US has great potential, but there is definitely the most progress happening in Europe.')
