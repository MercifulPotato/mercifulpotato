Item(by='chandra381', descendants=None, kids=[25235940], score=None, time=1606547444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234263, text='&gt; The comments section on HN do not leave me feeling like racism is being given enough consideration within the community.<p>Like it or not, there&#x27;s an instinctive urge to deny that there are problems, and make it look like the victim is at fault for complaining. Nobody sits down and actually listens to what they have to say. Really disappointed by the HN community on this - and a bunch of big VCs - Jason Calacanis, Paul Graham, Balaji Srinivasan - who flocked to the defence of Coinbase after the memo pre-empting the story, but then were conveniently silent once the report actually came out.<p>I think this is a broader silicon valley problem - that oh, our companies are perfect! We can do no wrong. This applies to sexism, racism, any kind of -isms. It might also be illuminating reading to take a look at what HN commenters were saying about for example Susan Fowler&#x27;s blog post (questioning her credentials, speculating that she was making false allegations) or even the Google protests about Andy Rubin&#x27;s payout.')
