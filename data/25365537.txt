Item(by='mamon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607549933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359216, text='30k sounds like entry&#x2F;mid-level salary in Central Europe. With over 10 years of experience I currently make over $90k<p>Also, if you take median salary in software industry, which is probably closer to $65k, in my country it buys you much better lifestyle than 200k in the Bay Area does. Me, for example, I was able to buy 2 bedroom, 900 sq ft apartment in the capital city with cash, no mortgage required. Other expenses don&#x27;t really register on my radar. I&#x27;m piling up cash for early retirement.<p>EDIT: fixed some of my numbers.<p>EDIT2: After my country joined EU I never emigrated to Western Europe, because it didn&#x27;t make financial sense to me. If I ever find myself emigrating to California, that would be because of the weather, not money.')
