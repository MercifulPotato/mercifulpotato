Item(by='jotux', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605413437, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097932, text='&gt;&gt;there&#x27;s no screen on a microcontroller so printf(&quot;hello world&quot;) does nothing.<p>The article is specifically about ARM Cortex-M4s, which support semihosting. So most of the tools listed in the article will just automatically spit printf out to the semihosting console without any effort.<p>Even if there isn&#x27;t semihosting on a platform, the first thing I almost always do with board bring-up is pipe printf to some debug port (uart, ethernet, usb, etc).')
