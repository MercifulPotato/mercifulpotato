US itself is one of the most politically correct and tolerant countries in the world. If you think NH is &quot;incredibly unsafe place&quot; for people who are different (in any respect), try to imagine what would happen to such people in some other cultures (e.g. some Muslim countries, rural Africa&#x2F;India, etc). I bet an American white male community wouldn&#x27;t seem so bad.<p>There was zero reason to get offended by the parent comment. If someone did, it&#x27;s strictly their own personal issue. They should learn how to deal with it and adjust their expectations.')
