Scaling tx&#x2F;s is easy, scaling it without increasing block verification time and cost is what&#x27;s impossible.<p>Nonsense, he absolutely thought about scaling and in his head it was quite simple...because it was. You just need blocks big enough to allow the transaction throughput the world requires, but they need to be a finite size. That&#x27;s all.<p>Not sure what you mean about &quot;block verification time&quot; having a scaling problem. It really doesn&#x27;t.')
