For a variety of reasons. But for one, it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to do business online if you&#x27;re not in the good graces of major payment providers (assuming you want to get paid). It might be <i>hard(er)</i> to advertise your business if Twitter bans you, but that&#x27;s in no way comparable to how essential Visa&#x2F;MC are to any business.<p>Providers of critical infrastructure (payments, search, appstores, probably a few other things), when they&#x27;re big enough to be a monopoly&#x2F;duopoly, could really use more oversight. If you piss off Google&#x2F;Apple, your business can be ruined, and you&#x27;ll have virtually no recourse -- as evidenced by the frequent &quot;google&#x2F;apple killed my app&quot; threads on HN.')
