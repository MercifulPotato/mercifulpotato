If we&#x27;re referring to an improved ability to articulate thoughts and produce more text, then sure, writing more will help with that. Maybe quality will improve marginally over time.<p>But if we&#x27;re talking about actually producing writing of a higher quality, I&#x27;m afraid simply writing more can only help so much. Improving the quality of the craft requires readers to provide feedback on the writing itself and&#x2F;or writers to actively learn how to actually write better. The former is rare, and I&#x27;m not sure many writers actively take part in the latter.')
