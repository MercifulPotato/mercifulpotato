The system was trained on resumes of past applicants and the hired&#x2F;not-hired outcome. Unfortunately, instead of providing a neutral guide, it just learned the biases of the humans who had made past hiring decisions. Of course, the designers of the system had excluded demographic information, but the system found proxies like extra-curricular activities that correlated with race, gender or social class.')
