Things tend to get bogged down or go off the rails because the (good) idea is to fix what turns out to be a deceptively complex problem that exists for &quot;reasons (tm)&quot; which stack in wickedly circular ways and are thus not easily solved completely enough for enough use cases.<p>I wish them the best but the first likely issue I see here is that evaluating &quot;trustworthy&quot; is both subjective and relative to the context of the customer and use case. For example, any topic subject to a lot of Wikipedia edit warring is likely to be difficult to address &quot;good, fast and cheap&quot; enough for meaningfully sustainable competitive differentiation.')
