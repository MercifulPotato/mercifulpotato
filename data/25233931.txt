You first have to accept that groups, as opposed to individuals, are responsible for action. This doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up. Any delineation of people into any sort of groups is arbitrary.

Actions are perpetrated by individuals.<p>I would like to live in a society that optimizes for enthusiastic consent in, and at-will termination of all interactions and relationships for any reason whatsoever. This seems to be the only reasonable way to live in a society of people who disagree about fundamental things.

It is quite possible to support this standard of liberty without being racist oneself. I may disagree with what you say and all.')
