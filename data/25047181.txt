Often, it refers to stuff that some software <i>tries</i> to automate wildly, with the result that in easy cases it works nicely, without you having a description of what really happens, and in more complex cases it fails and turns into a mess, without you having any actual clue what happens. I think &quot;magic&quot; works actually only if you do have an interface which takes responsibility of actually everything, like an SSD firmware driver doing write layout for wear leveling.<p>And no, getting 2,000 lines of automated boilerplate for some mundane programming task isn&#x27;t &quot;magic&quot;.....')
