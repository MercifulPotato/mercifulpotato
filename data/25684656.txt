They have no real profit motive to hoard a bunch of data since they aren&#x27;t selling it, which is where most data plays come from, and on top of that hoarding data without any reason is super costly even if you are one of the largest companies in the world.<p>They sell hardware, software, and &quot;cloud&quot;. They SELL it so you are paying with your money not your data.')
