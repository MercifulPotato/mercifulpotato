It allows every level to externalize some annoying part of their job in exchange for a little more money. Even Finance is happy because capital expenditures (that require more complex planning and tax handling) turn into operating expenses.<p>Eventually the board will wonder what happened to earnings per share, but by that time the project to migrate off amazon will be impossibly large and most people with the skills to run their own infrastructure will have retired.')
