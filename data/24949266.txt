I doubted if I had arrived at the wrong Bombay -- where is the Bombay that I expected. Later that day, I felt happy when I saw the ocean for the first time and spent my whole evening at Juhu Beach.<p>The next day, I spent the day-long along Marine Drive, Chowpatty, Gateway of India, and I saw these buildings mentioned in the articles. Now, they do look -- &quot;Bombay.&quot; That was when I knew I had indeed landed in Bombay. In those days, Bombay was there, and that&#x27;s it. Beyond Bandra (after Juhu, etc.), the flats were matchboxes with little-to-no windows, and no balconies at all -- packed as much as possible in the smallest available spaces.')
