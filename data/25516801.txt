It&#x27;s like a natural extension of a thought process: I draw quick diagrams and take notes to see how ideas are connected, and only then I can start implementing these ideas in code.<p>I tried taking similar notes in a text file&#x2F;org-mode, but it didn&#x27;t work for me because it&#x27;s not free-flowing and not expressive enough. Probably, an iPad or a tablet with a stylus pen would work just as well, but paper is still easier and cheaper. :)')
