The average power consumption of an e-ink display that refreshes once daily and needs a single annual recharge is effectively 0 W.  Using a rough price of electricity in San Francisco of just over $0.22&#x2F;kWh, The Frame costs ~$230&#x2F;yr to run.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I could, in good conscience, countenance wasting <i>that much</i> electricity on running a TV 24&#x2F;7 to show a static image that updates once daily.  Yes, you&#x27;d have to be running the e-ink display for awhile to break even on the power costs, and you could save some money on The Frame by putting it on a schedule where it turns off at night, but it still seems overly wasteful.')
