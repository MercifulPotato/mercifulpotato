Vitamin D supplementation, at about $10 every 3 months per person, would reduce that by 96%<p>Meanwhile, the best vaccine being developed is claiming a 90% efficacy rate. Which means that if 100 people get exposed to covid, but they are all vaccinated, only 90 of them wouldn&#x27;t get sick.<p>Vitamin D turns 100 cases into 4 cases. Vaccine turns 100 cases into 10 cases. Vitamin D is ridiculously cheap. Vaccine development is not. But when the time comes, I&#x27;m going to use both.')
