Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603434168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866417, text='&gt;California has the curve ball of the proposition system.<p>That is where special interest is most heavily felt. This court ruling is mostly meaningless. There is a proposition on the ballot that directly addresses this employment&#x2F;independent contractor issue.  It would supersede the legislature and make it nearly impossible for the legislature to repeal or amend the law.  The prop also happens to have the most expensive campaign in history behind it.  Something like 90-95% of the money came in on the Yes side and it is almost exclusively coming from Uber, Lyft, and similar companies.<p>Basically these companies didn&#x27;t get what they wanted in the legislature.  They didn&#x27;t get what they wanted in court.  So they are trying to buy it from the public.  They are hoping we aren&#x27;t motivated enough to educate ourselves on the issue and will instead just vote Yes because all the campaigning is telling us to do so.')
