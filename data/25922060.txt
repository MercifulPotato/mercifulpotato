Nothing in this particular CVE touches on anything that seems particularly obscure to me.<p>The last major sudo bug was in the PAM code (which lead to the creation of doas), which is something many people don&#x27;t need, but also something that many others <i>do</i> need.<p>And writing separate tools would be the equal (or more!) lines of code and an equal amount of bugs in total (or probably more, since people will be reinventing stuff and there will be fewer reviewers per line of code). This isn&#x27;t reducing complexity, it&#x27;s just spreading it out.')
