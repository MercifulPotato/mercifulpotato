My impression was that most of the backend stuff you do is on the webserver, and part of the work is to survey github open-source projects and install the ones you like (and the ones that are popular) on your webserver.<p>Wasn&#x27;t the community shift from php to node.js&#x2F;npm (or ruby, or python, take your pick) touted as some kind of a mini-revolution, something that&#x27;ll make your life easier as a backend-dev? Turns out you guys still prefer someone else (in this case, 4-eyes big-tech) does the serious work for you?<p>I&#x27;m really not sure I understand the landscape.')
