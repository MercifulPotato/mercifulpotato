Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[24789809], score=None, time=1602772010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782944, text='@dang can I make a suggestion? On threads with high comment counts, put numerical pagination links at the very top of the comments. Otherwise to see the next pages of comments I have to scroll to the bottom, click &quot;more&quot;, scroll to the bottom again, click &quot;more&quot; again... If I could just click a little &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, etc. to jump straight to second and third page top level comments, I think it would help improve visibility of those other top level comments.')
