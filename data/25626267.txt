Imagine those conversations, and imagine any of them being released.<p>The whole conversation is a combination of mob talk and confabulation. He simultaneously believes he really won the election, but is demanding manufactured evidence to show that he&#x27;s won it. But this is completely consistent with 140 members of the House of Reps, and 11 Senators, who have publicly stated they will challenge the Electoral College result.<p>Because of Trump&#x27;s unfitness for office, his extreme malignant narcissism it would be difficult to prove (in court) his state of mind, and that he knows that he&#x27;s asking for fraud to be committed.<p>The only immediate remedy for this is impeachment, removal from office, and ban him from holding public office again. By not holding him accountable he will try again, he&#x27;ll only keep getting worse.')
