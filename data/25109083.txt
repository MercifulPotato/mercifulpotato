Like—why is the &#x2F;ʧ&#x2F; sound romanized as “ch”? It’s absurd—the only justification for it is that English does it the same way. The only reason to use Hepburn is if you have no interest in learning Japanese and just want to be able to read a couple words out of a phrasebook, or read the name of a person or place.<p>The JSL romanization, which is mentioned only offhand, is actually pretty interesting if you are interested in learning pronunciation. For example, nihôn means “Japan” and nîhon means “two long cylindrical things”. They are pronounced differently, so why not write them differently? Other romanizations write them both as “nihon” which is ambiguous.')
