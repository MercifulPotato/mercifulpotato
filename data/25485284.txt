Item(by='Gollapalli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608460560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483557, text='&gt;My biggest regret was not getting into enough trouble.<p>Too many movies, not enough life.<p>Not wanting to be sheltered is fine, and if the author can genuinely make it as a full-time writer, more power to him, but the reason his family has status is because his parents (and their parents probably) worked for it. Being a writer is a high status position if successful, but &quot;wanting to get into more trouble&quot; is silly. What the author is really saying is &quot;I watched [insert x movie about honors student who works super hard and never has any fun deciding to cut loose] and want to live that in real life.&quot; And the thing that the author missed is: those are just movies. In real life, when you go crazy, that has consequences. Skipping out on financial security for the sake of art is a difficult choice, with actual sacrifices involved. Though it&#x27;s probably easier if you come from a family that can pay full tuition at Princeton.')
