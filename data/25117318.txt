It is a duopoly though with Android.<p>This Duopoly is largely supported because of FCC Regulations and carrier restrictions it is very hard to get access to Wireless frequencies and ever harder to do that nation wide,  given this it is hard to deploy a mobile device in the US.<p>Apple then relies upon Copyright and Contract law both of which are favorable to large companies not consumers to ensure their market dominance by making it impossible to create interoperability between their ecosystem and others.<p>Then you have the various Tax and general business regulations that favor all Large companies,  some of which in general prohibit smaller companies from growing.')
