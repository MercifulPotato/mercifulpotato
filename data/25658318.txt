It means that 90% of the vaccine recipients are ~100% immune, while 10% are ~0% immune. This has a biological basis: did they seroconvert or not.<p>It simply isn&#x27;t workable to reason from lighter symptoms to &quot;partial immunity.&quot; Let&#x27;s pretend the vaccine didn&#x27;t exist. Take someone with a mild case of covid. Would you say this person is partially immune? Or consider someone with no symptoms at all--are they <i>completely</i> immune? Since the vast majority of cases are mild or asymptomatic, are you prepared to argue that &quot;immunity&quot; is actually very widespread?<p>Again, your &quot;some people win the race, some lose&quot; analogy is on the mark. It&#x27;s pointless to talk about &quot;partial victory&quot;')
