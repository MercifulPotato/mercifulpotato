They are a content <i>hosting</i> service, not a content <i>backup</i> service.<p><i>&gt; so long as they&#x27;re not clearly illegal</i><p>That makes things even more complicated. How do they decide, given some things are grey areas almost everywhere and some things are very much illegal in some places but not others?')
