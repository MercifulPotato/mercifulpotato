Some companies route all traffic through their VPNs, Firewalls, they might install certificate for deep package inspection etc.<p>There is a reason for such measures, but they can compromise privacy.<p>Aside from very few exceptions, I would also advice companies not to add private phones to MDM. Phones are too cheap to take the risk.')
