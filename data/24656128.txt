As far as I&#x27;m aware, the design is not legally protected, but any manufacturer who made a &#x27;5-15R&#x27; receptacle that couldn&#x27;t carry 15A--or any device manufacturer who decided to re-purpose the pins such that the ground conductor carried 240V--would have legal problems if they brought their product to market.<p>This is where USB-PD should be: in a situation where physical connector compatibility brings with it enough design assurances that any pairing of legally-available devices won&#x27;t blow up, catch fire, or burn out. Ideally, any USB-PD device pairing should <i>work,</i> but at the moment the bare minimum needs to be that any device pairing is <i>safe.</i>')
