I suggest keeping an eye on those mentions and reply to any questions someone might have, or clear up any misconceptions.<p>You might think it&#x27;s silly to interact directly like this for a product priced at $1, but keep in mind Reddit and Hacker News have very good SEO, so these questions (with your answers) will pop up when people search for your, or similar, tools online.<p>Moreover, for the same reason, you can monitor your competitors and recommend your tool when you have the advantage.<p>I don&#x27;t think that at your price point ads will work for you.<p>I recommend that approach because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been helping people do for the past year.
