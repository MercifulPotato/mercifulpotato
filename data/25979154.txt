Personally I think Typescript hits a sweet spot of static typing by default with an escape hatch (via the `any` type) when you need it. I think more self-documenting code makes the tradeoff well worth it (with the added guarantee that the documentation is correct). And most importantly, I like getting feedback from the editor <i>as I&#x27;m typing</i> rather than having to write code then run tests, then write some more and perhaps modify the tests, etc.')
