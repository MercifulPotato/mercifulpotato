Item(by='PoignardAzur', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606682658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25247703, text='Yeah, every time I look at Roblox I get a bad taste in my mouth.<p>The game&#x27;s business model is basically &quot;like these Korean whale-milking RPGs, except we&#x27;re outsourcing the development to 12-yo kids&quot;.<p>The games themselves are usually ports of popular games (Counter Strike, Day Z, Minecraft, etc) where the quality is... well, frequently amateurish, for obvious reasons. I suspect the reason these ports are so popular is that a huge portion of the audience is made of kids who can&#x27;t convince their parents to buy them eg Call of Duty, so they play the Roblox version instead.<p>Which is all fine and good when we&#x27;re talking about Little Big Planet levels or Minecraft maps, but becomes kind of exploitative when you see that their creators systematically use classic free-to-play tactics to get other players to fork over money. Money which, of course, is wrapped in an in-game currency designed to make players not realize the true value of what they&#x27;re spending.<p>And since there&#x27;s very little curation, almost no dev involvment whatsoever, and the creators are 12-yo kids who are amateur game designers at best, the idea that players get their money&#x27;s worth is really dubious.<p>Honestly the whole thing feels like a pyramid scheme of sorts, where kids will be lured by the promise of making money by selling in-game items to other kids, and therefore will try to spread the game to as many people as possible in the hope of making more sales.<p>(The Unity Asset Store feels similar)')
