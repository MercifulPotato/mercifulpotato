Item(by='makomk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607736125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391202, text='The Palmer Report is probably an even better example of just how cynical and partisan this push by social media sites to purge claims of election fraud is than the article makes clear. Back when their anti-Trump articles started to spread across social media, I did some quick searching (y&#x27;know, just basic old-school internet literacy stuff when seeing sensational articles from a publication you haven&#x27;t heard of spreading virally online) and concluded their main claim to fame seemed to be having their own Snopes tag due to the bullshit they&#x27;d published. No detectable presence on respected or independent sites beyond that, not even a Wikipedia entry. All the normal hallmarks of your classic fake news site, in the pre-2016 sense of the term.<p>In no time at all after they started saying what Trump&#x27;s opponents wanted to hear, though, Twitter had given them a verified account, their Wikipedia entry was glowing and featured prominently when searching for them, and they&#x27;d been granted a veneer of respectability by big tech companies and were being spread by the personal but work-associated social media accounts of those who worked for big tech. There was no fearmongering about social media sites spreading disnformation that undermined democracy, even though the articles were strikingly like what Trump and his supporters are pushing now, down to the specific arguments even, and every bit as dubious.')
