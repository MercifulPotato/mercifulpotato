Java falls in the middle with a fairly simple language and type system. Any code which you do not know how to structure within Java&#x27;s type system can be written with some Objects&#x2F;Maps&#x2F;Collections and a bit of runtime logic - basically giving you what you&#x27;d do in JavaScript, though Java&#x27;s type system is sufficiently powerful for 99% of real-world use cases.<p>The main issue I see Python and JS programmers face when coming to a statically typed language like Java is the additional complexity of a type system. Saying that a more complex type system would somehow be more familiar is just backwards.')
