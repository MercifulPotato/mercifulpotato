Something that worked before Big Sur is not working in Big Sur. It&#x27;s broken. That&#x27;s all there is to it for me as an end user. Of course there is a difference in reasons for things breaking, and I&#x27;m not denying that Apple might have &quot;improved&quot; Preview.app when you judge it by how well it adheres to a PDF spec. But it still &quot;broke&quot; a very common and normal workflow by doing so, and I would at least expect them to acknowledge that. If they decide breaking this is worth it, that&#x27;s absolutely fine with me. But I don&#x27;t think they are even aware of it, and <i>that</i> is not something I&#x27;m willing accept from a company with the reach and resources of Apple.')
