I don&#x27;t understand which kind of involvement. I occassionally read C++ proposals, and also read blogs from some very good C++ programmers.<p>The &quot;everything implemented as library&quot; pattern so pervasive in new C++ releases is not doing any good to the language. All those are half-baked implementation of what exists as a simple orthogonal language feature in languages like OCaml. The &quot;implement as library&quot; sentiment has gone too far that it hurts, among other things:\n    * Debug build performance\n    * Compilation times (a big thing)\n    * Quality of error messages\n    * Reliance on not-so-reliable optimizations, often causing performance regressions (there are many instances of this happening).<p>Even if clang &#x2F; gcc developers are involved, probably they don&#x27;t bother about 1000::template shittery because their compilers have already got comparable quality inliners, and it is hard for a competition to surface here. Or they might bother but can&#x27;t be sufficiently involved into the C++ standard committee crowd.<p>&gt; Furthermore, C++ coding experience improves markedly with each new Standard, released on a 3-year cadence.<p>And don&#x27;t tell me my knowledge of last standard is obsolete and I have to read the new shiny c++ book to learn Modern C++. Another consequence is the scarcity of freely available resources accessible to students, due to rapid change.')
