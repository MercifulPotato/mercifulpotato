Applying to online internships and new grad roles is stressful. Having to balance a full school work load and applying to hundreds of internships while going to career fairs is incredibly stressful and time consuming. Additionally, interacting with so many different websites and mediums just to apply to one internship is annoying. We remember vividly having to go to Linkedin, Glassdoor or Indeed, search for jobs, then when we found a job to apply to, it took us to third party website like Workday and asked us to make an account just to apply to the job.<p>Finding specific jobs and filling out the same form hundreds of times is a waste of time. Repeatedly having to fill out fields like name, date, resume, school etc. just doesn&#x27;t make sense. This led us to build our side project: quickapply.io for college students studying CS')
