I can see why they&#x27;re reframing things to call all their plans &#x27;unlimited&#x27; in a 5G world, since most people will not sign up to pay more for 5G service. They will ask what the real-world difference will be, and then probably decline to pay even $10&#x2F;mo more for it.<p>But if everything is &#x27;unlimited&#x27; and they&#x27;re differentiating based on amount of hotspot or throttling after a certain point, they&#x27;re effectively charging you for high speed without making it seem like a surcharge.<p>After 20 seconds on the phone I knew it wasn&#x27;t for me. I rarely leave the house during COVID, so I hardly use any data. I&#x27;m saving 50% going with a different company.')
