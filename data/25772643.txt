The Capitol events only prove that. Seventy five million people have no place to express their opinions about the person they chose to elect. What was everyone expecting?<p>Go to Gab or 4chan then? I don&#x27;t see any issues here, there are always spaces for these &quot;people&quot;.<p>&gt; &quot;nothing happened, he most likely forgot about it&quot;. Are you serious? It was the Ayatollah who posted that. What&#x27;s the difference then between that and Trump&#x27;s tweets?<p>So? We all know that &quot;Iran are bad guys&quot;, but I expect much better from a president of the most powerful nation polarising their own people. All other countries that we are supposed to keep in check, North Korea, China, etc, are laughing at the US.<p>In the grand scheme of things that Ayatollah tweet is just a small part of the wider conversation. He just did that and carried on with his day.<p>&gt; Go ahead and make this discussion over too. We&#x27;re living in such strange and sad times for freedom of expression.<p>It wasn&#x27;t even relevant in the first place to this thread.')
