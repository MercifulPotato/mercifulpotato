It&#x27;s more of a contract than copyright. If you want to use these in your code, you must GPL, or reimplement at your leisure!<p>That&#x27;s less Copyright in the sense that it&#x27;s mandating the relinquishing of monopolistic control of the work product in question to the public. Oracle wants the opposite. They want Java used everywhere, and the right to sue anyone who does anything too similar to it too.<p>This is absolutely an act of monopolistic market shaping. No smaller firm would ever have utilized this nuclear option of a lawsuit given the widespread damage this could potentially cause to the entire software ecosystem.<p>This would honestly be enough to get me moving completely out of Software if the Court screws the pooch on this badly enough.<p>I&#x27;m not spending the rest of my life debugging code that as a matter of fact must be run through obfuscate steps to avoid copyright liability.')
