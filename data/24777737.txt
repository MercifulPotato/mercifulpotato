All the details are not clear yet but:<p>- droplet sizes are smaller in low humidity. Smaller droplets fly better.<p>- more viruses in the form of free-drifting aerosols are formed evaporating droplets in dry air. They drift longer in dry air.<p>- mucous membranes in a dry air may be more exposed.')
