I think it&#x27;s worth the ~$20 currently. Definitely a few QOL rough edges and some balance issues still, but certainly playable and haven&#x27;t seen any critical bugs or crashes.<p>I think building systems in DSP feels a lot more like Satisfactory, but it&#x27;s much easier to get a good view of whats going on.  Loved Satisfactory but found FPS perspective frustrating frequently.')
