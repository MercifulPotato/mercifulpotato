If memory serves my first machine was a rating, then a 120mhz, then p3 800mhz, then amd my dad built, then my first laptop in 2007. Growing up in a developing country, I feel myself lucky. Picked up programming at a very early age, had my first websites (can&#x27;t remember the order) on virtualave.net&#x2F;tripod and some regional isp, in addition to serving stuff from my own machine. Learned vb6 and asp, then .net and so on.<p>Crazy ride, loving every minute')
