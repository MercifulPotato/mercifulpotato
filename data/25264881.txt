Item(by='bshimmin', descendants=None, kids=[25265249], score=None, time=1606829042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264638, text='My brother moved from the UK to New Zealand a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve managed to visit him all of once - it&#x27;s much more than a day of travel from here, with the added disadvantage that neither he nor I live near any of the convenient airports.  Travelling to, say, New York from the UK is <i>a lot</i> more doable: I can get from semi-rural countryside in the UK to Manhattan in maybe 12 hours.  There&#x27;s also a considerable difference in cost.<p>(To the poster upthread asking how it compares to the UK: I only spent ten days in New Zealand, but I thought it was great.  Sort of like the Lake District here, but on a vast scale.  I also recommend the beef and cheese pies - a lovely healthy snack.)')
