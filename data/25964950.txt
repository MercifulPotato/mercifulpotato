Perhaps the steps to sideload an app on Android would create too much friction for a Facebook app store to gain traction?<p>However, Facebook&#x27;s &quot;internet.org Free Basics&quot; initiative [1], which is available in countries where internet access is generally more costly, has some similarities to an app store. Facebook approves or denies the inclusion of various websites, sets technical and content requirements, and operates the proxy through which these websites are accessed.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;internet-org&#x2F;gettingstarted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;internet-org&#x2F;gettingsta...</a>')
