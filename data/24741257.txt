I looked at all the other options and this one seemed the most reasonable for my needs (conventional layout, excellent tilt&#x2F;split).<p>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it. I was skeptical about mechanical keyboards (even though I&#x27;m old enough to remember the original ones), but this thing has been a game changer. I will never go back to membrane keyboards, and the ergonomics of the Kinesis are perfect for me.<p>Microsoft still sells the 4000 for $50 though, and you can get it for as cheap as $35 if you hit an Office Depot with stock (pre-pandemic anyway, have no idea about the current retail situation).')
