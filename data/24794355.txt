Item(by='stevenicr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602797861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791959, text='I have seen this in the past year with two videos in particular.\n The most recent one I watched beginning to the end - it stayed on a video hosting site for weeks.. then one day I found the page saying &#x27;taken down for hate speech&#x27; - I don&#x27;t recall any kind of calls to hate - if there were, I would think they could of edited part of the vid and still left up the main gist of info.. like they do with song copyright complaints in techno mixes...<p>Anyhow - some people likely believe that some videos &#x2F; news stories &#x2F; files are important enough for people to have access to that they would likely chip in some coins to keep them accessible I&#x27;m sure - I would even say there is and will continue to be more of need for further distributed &#x2F; multiple backups (some available in some countries and not others for example) and people will certainly be willing to pay and others will to host - to get around bans in certain countries for example.<p>I hope there will be a filecoin option or other options for the world to push multiple copies to multiple countries so when access is denied in one place and file removal is demanded in another - that there would be the possibility that people could access from a third place via a 4th place that kept access available.<p>No idea how all that would come to fruition, perhaps it&#x27;s already been figured out with torrents or peertubes or similar things, I have not researched that aspect.<p>But I have been seeing more and more censorship in more and more places the past few years - and it appears gov&#x27;s and other interested groups are ramping up for more, not less - so the need will be increasing more and more in most parts of the world I am guessing.<p>I also imagine there is a desire in some neighborhoods to be able to share videos and other files with the community that would be censored by news portals and national hosts - if a secure scuttlebut meets filecoin crosses with some sort of non-accessible via internet - and only shared via bluetooth &#x2F; wifi &#x2F; and limits on bandwidth taken kind of thing is out there I think we&#x27;ll see more use and need of such a thing as well.')
