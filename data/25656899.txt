However that does open up all the moral and legal cans of worms around this. I could imagine some of the voice actresses not being very happy about somebody else commercializing their voice without their consent.<p>The obvious way to get around this is to keep this as the showcase and to pay some people to add their voices to the paid version. I imagine this would sell just based on being decent TTS with a wide range of voices, even when people don&#x27;t know the voices offered.')
