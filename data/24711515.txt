It also has some serious downsides for foreigners&#x2F;tourists&#x2F;immigrants who:<p>(1) may not speak English (analogous scenario: imagine going to a Starbucks in Japan and having the cashier repeatedly ask for your name in Japanese, and you don&#x27;t speak Japanese);<p>(2) have names that aren&#x27;t easily pronounced&#x2F;spelled in English (&quot;Name?&quot; &quot;Zbigniew&quot; &quot;How do you spell that?&quot; &quot;Zed bee eye gee....&quot; &quot;Wait, what&#x27;s zed?&quot; &quot;Last letter of alphabet&quot; &quot;Oh you mean zee&quot; &quot;No, zed&quot;);<p>(3) feel embarrassed about the whole interaction, which leads to them inventing a fake name, which in turn makes them feel dirty. (Zbigniew gives his name as &quot;Zach&quot; to the Starbucks employee although he has never used this name in his life -- it&#x27;s not the name his parents gave him)<p>(4) then has said name confused with 3 other Zachs also waiting for their tall lattes.<p>It&#x27;s almost like someone forgot to think through the UI&#x2F;UX of this system with respect to internationalization.')
