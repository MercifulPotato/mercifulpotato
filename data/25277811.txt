When I get into a series of fiction books, I tend to get so obsessed that I stay up all night reading, often multiple nights in a week.<p>That rarely happens to me with TV or video games. I haven&#x27;t read a fiction book in about 10 years because I swore them off entirely. I typically watch about an hour of TV as I wind down for the night, and I often play hours of video games if I can (often child care obligations interfere). But at least I can do those things without losing sleep.')
