Just read the manual, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;5.4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;5.4&#x2F;</a>, and maybe the canonical Programming in Lua book, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;pil&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;pil&#x2F;</a><p>Lua is an incredibly simple and elegant language. All the myths and bike-shedding on Stack Overflow and elsewhere can only lead you astray. For exceptional situations, use the mailing-list. The authors and almost all experts are on the mailing-list and will be quick to correct errors. (Everybody is wrong sometimes, even the authors! But you need enough experts in one place to be paying attention, and the only such place is the mailing-list.)<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Lua maintains strict feature symmetry between what&#x27;s possible in Lua code, and what&#x27;s possible from the Lua C API. This is important to understand if you want to have a good mental model of the language and why it&#x27;s designed the way it is. If you&#x27;re not a C programmer or haven&#x27;t heavily used the Lua C API, many of Lua&#x27;s choices may seem arbitrary, especially coming from other languages where their C ABI and FFI interfaces are mostly an afterthought or don&#x27;t otherwise constrain the in-language semantics. Most &quot;better than Lua&quot; projects are written by people without a sufficient appreciation for this aspect of Lua&#x27;s design.')
