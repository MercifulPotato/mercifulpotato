Emmett Shear, CEO of Twitch will be joining us to share his insights on how the business and technology of gaming is rapidly changing.<p>Aside from Emmett (if you haven&#x27;t seen it, check out his excellent TED Talk on what streaming means for the future of entertainment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;emmett_shear_what_streaming_means_for_the_future_of_entertainment?language=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;emmett_shear_what_streaming_means_...</a>), we&#x27;ve got three pretty cool 10-minute lightning talks lined up:<p>- Designing Characters with Deep Learning, Cory Li, Founder at Spellbrush (W18)<p>- Synthetic Media: Virtual Influencers and Live Animation, Jay Rosenkrantz, Founder at Figments (S19)<p>- MMOs in the Instagram Era, Jimmy Xu, Founder at Highrise (S18)<p>After the talks, we&#x27;ll open up a virtual expo hall to meet with the founders and teams.<p>Many of the gaming startups fly under the radar at YC, but in my (biased!) opinion, if you love games they&#x27;re some of the most exciting. And the gaming industry often tackles some of the most exciting and challenging frontier technology problems before anyone else.<p>Working at a startup is not for everyone - and gaming startups are some of the craziest for sure. But if you&#x27;re in a position to go for it, based on my experiences I can say there might be no greater adventure. So if this piques your interest, check out the event link and apply to attend&#x2F;come learn about open roles in engineering, game design, art, marketing&#x2F;media and more.<p>Hope to see you there! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;gaming-tech-talks-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;gaming-tech-talks-2020</a>')
