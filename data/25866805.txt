My guess is that it&#x27;s both, but that even if masks&#x2F;distancing were 100% effective on their own, it&#x27;s not practical to expect enough people to take them seriously enough. This isn&#x27;t an engineering problem, but a human one. This is why I take issue with those here who just blame everyone not participating for why the virus has spread. By the law of averages, you will never get everyone to comply. You need virtually everyone to comply for the virus to be stopped, and all it takes is a small number of people to allow a virus to spread, which keeps happening when you keep enough healthy people from even beginning to build an immunity. These social measures are stop gaps, and anyone suggesting &quot;or we can just social distance&quot; as if that&#x27;s an alternative to vaccines needs to get a clue. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to look at the numbers before and after lockdowns and other restrictions are put in place to realize that they aren&#x27;t impactful enough to be considered a solution.')
