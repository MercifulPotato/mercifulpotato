Yes, a lot of work like a hypervisor type layer must have been put in so that existing 3rd party apps can run.  But the M1 is optimized to Apple&#x27;s common denominator, not anyone else&#x27;s.<p>Ultimately, the real question is whether the M1 will be opened for Windows or Linux to build on.  I doubt it.<p>Intel and AMD will just have to build their own heterogeneous processor and Windows and Linux will have to build a hypervisor layer or just go native.')
