The idea of a &quot;social contract&quot; to justify taxation is absurd, to say the least (did you ever sign it voluntarily?).<p>If the government can print its own money (which you&#x27;re forced to use), why does it need to make you work and pay taxes to get that money back?<p>The money the government &quot;prints&quot; has no value on itself, it needs your work to &quot;value&quot; its money. Taxation is nothing but the imposition the government puts on you to work &quot;for free&quot; so that it can print as much money as it wants and increase its own size.<p>Never &quot;defend&quot; taxes of any sort, they are unethical and essentially constitute slavery.')
