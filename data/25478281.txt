Item(by='ryan_j_naughton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608394259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478201, text='Your social security benefits are derived, in part, from how much you paid in on your top earning years. Thus, if you didn&#x27;t pay in you would have very very very little social security (which is already too small of a benefit to live off of). Thus, I don&#x27;t think there is a moral hazard of social security that would cause people to return to the US for those benefits. They could amend the law (not sure if it&#x27;s specifics) that you have to pay in a minimum amount if you want to be paid out while living in another country. Simple fix to remove any poorly aligned incentive.<p>Medicare is much trickier as every American over 65 is entitled to it, but I&#x27;m not sure how that coverage works if you live outside the US.')
