Used to be you could just say “off” to stop a misinterpreted command, which worked fine because the assistant didn’t used to babble.  Now though, its own rambling follow-ups interfere with its ability to even <i>hear you</i> desperately saying “no! off! stop! shut up! cancel!”.  And my new favorite, every command response ending with an unsolicited “BY THE WAY: $thing_i_did_not_ask_for”.')
