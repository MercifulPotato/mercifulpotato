In fact, even CPI itself is not the same as it was before... According to 1980 CPI metrics, today&#x27;s consumer price inflation is closer to 10% per year.\nIf you consider stocks and other assets, real inflation is even higher. Banks just manipulate the numbers and statistics to make things seem better than they are.<p>Hiding the inflation numbers is lucrative because it gives banks a free pass to print more money.<p>The elite love tech stocks, cryptocurrencies and other assets which are in limited supply because they provide a mechanism to absorb and delay CPI inflation. Those limited supply assets just soak up most of the newly printed currency so that it doesn&#x27;t leak into the economy and cause CPI increase... That&#x27;s why P&#x2F;E ratios of tech stocks are ridiculously low. But it&#x27;s just delaying the inevitable CPI inflation.<p>Eventually the value of stocks become completely detached from earnings to the point that it&#x27;s no longer possible to justify the valuations based on earnings (or even the most optimistic future earnings).<p>This is why Bitcoin and other pure scarcity assets like Gold and Silver are great because investors have absolutely no expectation of deriving earnings from these and they can never go bankrupt... There is no price point beyond which the value of these scarce assets cannot be justified.<p>Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and other scarce non-productive assets can always be justified at any price point because their entire premise is that the monetary system is a pyramid scheme.\nThe higher the price of Bitcoin, the more justified it becomes in its assertion that the system is a pyramid scheme and the higher its valuation.')
