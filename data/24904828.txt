What Onenote falls short on is ease in retrieving notes. It lacks previews, thumbnails, indexes, table of contents, nested tags, or customizable sidepanels. You cant &quot;flip&quot; though your existing notes while keeping the current note or side panel in view.<p>This is where Dendron shines. Dendron&#x27;s navigator side panel is clean of clutter and easy to navigate, even when you have hundreds of notes. You can also navigate your notebook by open TODOs, nested tags, saved (regex or non rgex) search filters, or by graph view.')
