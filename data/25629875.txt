In which case please say, because I want to code python like this.<p>Specifically I write code in my editor, hit a keystroke and all the code at the cursor gets sent to my running python and evaluated. The editor needs to be aware of python&#x27;s indenting rules so it can do this, but once again if you&#x27;ve worked out a nice way to do this please say. Minimal keystrokes required would be great =)...<p>I&#x27;m not really requiring that the evaluated output gets sent to the editor, though of course that would be ideal, because in the worst case I can side-by-side the editor and the terminal.<p>From my perspective jupyter notebooks get kind of close, but I&#x27;m not coding in a file, so it&#x27;s not quite ideal.')
