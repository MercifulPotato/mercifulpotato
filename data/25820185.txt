I don&#x27;t actually trust the US government or its appointees to reasonably handle that particular theory because, like I said, it basically ate half the US political system and most of Washington culture to a far wilder extent than QAnon has done.<p>If there is really hard, compelling evidence, then what is it? I ask because for years (until I tuned it out) I would research and fact check claims about Russian interference of various types, and they <i>always</i> fell apart on close inspection. It was cry wolf, over and over. For instance the original claims were quite specific that Putin tried to rig the 2016 election for Trump via social media manipulation. Then Facebook produced a pile of supposedly &quot;Russian ads&quot; that were just random shitposting  and didn&#x27;t clearly support either party. As is usually seen in conspiracy theories, when a central pillar collapses the theory just instantly mutates, so very quickly the narrative changed to be &quot;they&#x27;re sowing division to make us hate each other&quot;. Why would Putin do this? Aren&#x27;t Americans doing a good enough job of that themselves? What about other countries that might have similar motives? None of these questions were ever explored. It&#x27;s just obviously motivated reasoning on a massive scale.')
