(It&#x27;s a little after 22:00 here, but I want to wrap up some loose ends from today on my computer, now that my kids are asleep, before I got to bed.)<p>I am sure YMMV, but this works surprisingly well for me, and I will sign up. I am one of those people who struggles to decide what to put on when working â€” usually some kind of electronic music like Juno Reactor, or instrumental metal like Russian Circles or Rings of Saturn instrumental albums.<p>Unlike those, while this brain.fm stuff is musical, it is not music I would even listen to intentionally for the sake of listening. It <i>is</i> different, in that it really seems like perfect <i>background</i> music.<p>I&#x27;m hearing it, but somehow I am not actively listening to it at all (which is the problem with putting on music I like). At the same time, the rhythm carries me along and I don&#x27;t <i>dislike</i> it at all... Interesting.')
