Not to say that POTS and EDS aren&#x27;t a thing though. Very much is.<p>I was initially thought to just be suffering from POTS by some pretty well respected docs at Cleveland Clinic, but there were some outlying symptoms that just didn&#x27;t add up. Ended up getting to see Dr. Carroll at Stanford and Dr. Wouter Schievink at Cedars-Sinai and they were able to visualize a leak, still in the process of trying to get blood&#x2F;glue injections to work until I get through TOS surgery. After that it may end up coming to surgery for CSF as well.<p>Also, I hate to sound pessimistic but just want to try to give advice - from what I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally, TOS will slowly progress, especially in those with EDS. The younger you have surgery, the better the outcome as well. I tried to stick it out with some pretty seriously targeted physical therapy and bracing until I was 20 but shit just kinda hit the fan and I&#x27;ve had to opt for surgery.<p>There are 5-10 surgeons in the U.S. that are at the point of having really great outcomes, most notably Dr. Dean Donahue at MGH. I waited like 9 months to initially consult with him. As much as I loathe Facebook, here are some great groups with regards to knowledge of good surgeons if you ever decide to pursue that route. A bad surgeon for TOS is  definitely a bit of a death sentence.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;15231937182" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;15231937182</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;205345126171314" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;205345126171314</a><p>P.S., apparently there&#x27;s been a good amount of POTS cases induced by COVID-19 and not responding well to treatment. Doctor at Cleveland Clinic mentioned it to me, said they were a bit dumbfounded. Will definitely be interesting to see how things play out long-term, will hopefully end up giving POTS some more awareness it deserves. Also, I have great hope in Neuralink for EDS pain in the future. Hopefully.')
