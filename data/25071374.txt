However, it seems to me that Google doesn&#x27;t really run their products like a startup generally does. It seems like adapting your product to your existing client base is usually better than launching a similar but different product while your current one is live. Once you&#x27;ve fragmented your user base then shuttering one of your products and (hoping?) that the users who didn&#x27;t migrate will finally migrate to your new product... that seems like a lot of unnecessary risk? Or maybe that&#x27;s just the startup game?<p>I feel like if startups ran their business like google runs their products, they&#x27;d fail pretty quickly. Am I off base here?')
