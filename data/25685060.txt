Echo chambers in society, like their physical counterparts, require selective feedback to re-inforce whatever meme has a person&#x2F;group gripped in their resonance. A healthy skeptical&#x2F;analytical POV can reduce the &#x27;feedback&#x27;, in much the same way as foam coned walls attenuate the feedback in an echo chamber = an anechoic chamber. This means that search engines must have a source SEO that is counter to the particular meme being put forth as an echoed belief&#x27;s web site(which has its own SEO to present it&#x27;s filtered meme to it&#x27;s adepts at all levels)\nWe see this war every day, so encourage skepticism, learn how to detect the false skeptics who try to add volume to the &#x27;echo&#x27;.\nMost, if not all, religions want closed echo chambers for their beliefs, sadly they are able to gather huge numbers of people - often by killing skeptics in some religions, so be wary, cover your tracks, guard your privacy.')
