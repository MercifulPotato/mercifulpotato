Some people want to deny that it exists, or that it&#x27;s problem, even if it does. But it&#x27;s precisely the reason that you felt the need to virtue-signal that you didn&#x27;t like Taibbi (whoever he&#x2F;she is; I don&#x27;t know). Everyone feels the need to &quot;take sides&quot; in whatever is being discussed. All of this tribalism is part and parcel to the problem you&#x27;re decrying. It&#x27;s the thing that&#x27;s blurring the line. The twenty-somethings have been raised in this culture, and it is a normal function of society to them. Only people in middle age or better can readily remember what the world looked like before the Fairness Doctrine was repealed, and opened the gates for pure advocacy. We&#x27;re all living in Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s media world now, and Twitter just gives everyone a platform, and takes it to the extreme.')
