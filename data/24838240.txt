True, that&#x27;s an advantage, but you don&#x27;t get to just pick the advantages -- they come in a package. That package is better overall only if the advantage comes at no additional cost and has no associated downsides. I, for one, think Rust&#x27;s advantages comes with a hefty price tag, and can have negative effects even on correctness compared to Zig. However, it&#x27;s hard to intuit which of the approaches is better for correctness; only time and empirical observation will tell.')
