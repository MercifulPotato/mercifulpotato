First, 2FA. FFS, I don&#x27;t know who on Hacker News needs to hear this, but _I REALLY DONT want my identity or money secured by my cell number_. I&#x27;m incredibly tired of required SMS &quot;2FA&quot;, and one of the major reasons I left Simple was their refusal to implement U2F or even TOTP. I&#x27;m really hoping there&#x27;s regulation on this at the federal level soon because it&#x27;s getting out of hand.<p>Second, their App never really caught up with the budgeting offerings of Mint. And finally, the Billpay integration never caught up with Ally Bank, which is what I ended up switching to. Ebills should be able to be delivered and paid straight from your bank account in 2020. Simple never unfortunately managed to get this integration.')
