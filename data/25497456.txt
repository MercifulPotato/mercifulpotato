When I had my motorcycle accident I was definitely not given a choice of which ER I was being hauled to - they stuck me on a back board and away we went.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t just transparency it&#x27;s also coverage.  We can get the menu of prices from the hospital but the specialists do their own billing so won&#x27;t be covered on that - you&#x27;re back to an &quot;MP&quot; on the menu.')
