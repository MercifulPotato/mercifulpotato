Neither are good signs for your argument.<p>I said &quot;less value&quot; not &quot;no value&quot;. In general there&#x27;s <i>less value</i> in providing fragmented help in small chunks to individual people than there is in providing help via a large coordinated effort to entire populations. Even if the total is the same, the fact that it just trickled in and it lacked coordination can only hurt. I even gave an example, perhaps a better one would have been that you can&#x27;t cross a canyon in 2 steps. And you won&#x27;t effectively put out a big fire no matter how many cups of water you <i>individually</i> dump on it.<p>Fittingly even the example you chose is bad simply because &quot;malaria relief&quot; still involves quite the coordinated effort, not the least financial, not individual people independently sending small help to a single other person.')
