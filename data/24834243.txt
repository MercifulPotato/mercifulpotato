That, eg, it would be perfectly constitutional had the Republicans passed a law making criticism of Trump by newspapers or television channels illegal?<p>I assume you would NOT be okay with that, but keep in mind that in the US, the first amendment applies to us as individuals. If those rights are forfeit when exercised collectively, then the result is a world where only the very, very rich can speak without the permission of the government. That&#x27;s a <i>horrifying</i> outcome!<p>The rich, I would argue, have too much power already, and stripping the ability of the non-rich to band together to act as a counterbalance does nothing more than cement that power.')
