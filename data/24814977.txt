But the problem is the censors are <i>also</i> human. If crafty lies can deceive the average person, why do we believe that the authorities are any less immune?<p>I feel like so many times anti-libertarian arguments follow this formula. &quot;Regular people keep making this mistake. So let&#x27;s just have the government, helpfully stop them from making the mistake. Except of wait... the government is also made up of people who make mistakes.&quot; In other words, who watches the watchmen?<p>Even in a world filled with crafty lies, open speech is the obvious solution. It&#x27;s much harder to deceive 300 million people than it is to deceive a small agency responsible for &quot;arbitrating truth&quot;. Yeah, a lot of people will still screw up and get the wrong answer.<p>But when millions have access to open information, it&#x27;s virtually guaranteed that at least some non-neglible subset will figure out the truth. A world with centrally managed opinion is not very robust, and likely to see truths die out completely.')
