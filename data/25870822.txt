I decided to stop using it after Nextcloud already\ngot confused by a few of my Git repos, overwriting my local\nupdates with the older version from the server. Not to mention\nthe &quot;don&#x27;t sync hidden files&quot; default setting that&#x27;s simply not\na good idea, to put it mildly. This new ownCloud product\npromises to handle that better(&quot;with millions of small files or\nthousands with hundreds of GB each, ownCloud Infinite Scale runs\nsmoothly&quot;), but I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it.<p>So far I haven&#x27;t found a sync tool that I feel like I can trust.\nI don&#x27;t care about user group management or online office\nsuites, but I absolutely want ~100% reliable file sync that\ndoesn&#x27;t randomly do nothing for 15 minutes without me knowing\nwhy(I care about my files and if I don&#x27;t know what your software\ndoes with them I won&#x27;t use it), or like NextCloud, falsely\ndetect merge conflicts when 100% of changes came from the same\nclient machine.')
