Facebook is a corporation, it owns the platform, it decides what gets contained on its property (subject to applicable laws, of course, but not confined to <i>only</i> those laws). By signing up, you agree to their control over the platform. Control could be the bare minimum required by law, could be mercilessly removing any and all controversial speech - that&#x27;s their discretion, just like it&#x27;s completely your discretion whether to log on or to buzz off. They&#x27;ll censor at whatever level works best for their core business of selling your attention to advertisers.<p>Outside of applicable laws, you have no &quot;rights&quot; on this private platform you&#x27;re provisionally allowed access to, and any attempt to sugar-coat that fact is just corporate PR-speak to avoid needless user attrition.')
