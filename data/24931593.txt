Item(by='golergka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603985581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929699, text='It makes much more sense when you imagine money launderer&#x27;s money and your money having the same value in those dealers, but having different value for their holders.<p>You, a law-abiding, legitimate buyer, have paid all your taxes and committed no crimes on that money. You can do with it whatever you want to, so for you, it&#x27;s one to one, a dollar for a dollar.<p>For a money launderer, however, the money is a hot potato. There&#x27;s still a probability that it left a trail going back, so, he&#x27;s not so free to use it as he pleases. It&#x27;s basically very similar to counterfeit money in that regard: it&#x27;s value to it&#x27;s holder (who knows about the risks) is much less than a &quot;real&quot; dollar for dirty money dollar.')
