AOE2 DE is patched monthly, and most patches include balance changes. I think one of the complex parts is the way balance changes interact with each other. Ie you make one change to address a specific unit being too useful. You unwittingly affect something unintentional, like making it useless against one civ&#x27;s unique unit.<p>Some variables for each unit:\n- Speed\n- Range\n- Attack speed\n- Attack damage\n- Health\n- Melee armor\n- Ranged armor\n- Pause between stopping and attacking\n- Attack bonuses against specific units &#x2F; classes\n- Training time\n- Cost\n- Cost balance among resources<p>Balance patches may tweak any one of these aspects. Interactions then occur with all other units in the game, econ stats that are also subject to balance etc.<p>People are very good at exploiting strengths and ignoring weaknesses. A slight advantage will be exploited quickly by experienced players; then others will catch on.')
