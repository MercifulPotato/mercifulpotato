A JS to-do app for a front-end engineer, for instance. Just a short thing you and the candidate can attack together in a couple hours. The candidate can write &quot;normal&quot; code, google things, clarify requirements, use their own architecture&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;style to reach the solution, etc. You could even add&#x2F;change a requirement midway through the session, too. That would be realistic, and test for brittleness (and maybe be mean).<p>I don&#x27;t interview people, so this might be hopelessly naive, or maybe untenable for some types of positions. But that interview process strikes me as a far more representative microcosm of an actual job than regurgitating LeetCode solutions or hardcore algo arcana.')
