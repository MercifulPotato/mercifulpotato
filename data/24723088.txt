I&#x27;m sure someone on HN lives in Phoenix, and has never used Waymo before.  Tell us if you can get a driverless ride.<p>It&#x27;s got a long way to go before it&#x27;s something like Uber in Phoenix.  It&#x27;s got even longer to go before it&#x27;s something like Uber in NYC (10-20 years still sounds right).<p>----<p>The funny thing is that the pandemic should have been HUGE for self-driving cars... Most people I know haven&#x27;t taken rideshare in 6+ months because they don&#x27;t want to ride with somebody, and I only did so in the last few weeeks.<p>But it was a non-event.  I didn&#x27;t hear anyone talking about self-driving in the last 6 months.  If it really worked, and was really available, then there would be certainly some people who would pay 2-5x the price of Lyft&#x2F;Uber for no driver.  (Not most people, but some people.)')
