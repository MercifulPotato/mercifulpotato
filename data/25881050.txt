About a ~hundred or so chargers in the parking lots.<p>The choices were to either arrive very, very early (&lt;8am) or you missed it. Then had to wait until around 4+pm when the early risers started to leave and move the car to a charging spot.<p>I mostly left after 7pm so it was ok but on days when I had to go at 5pm it was a big problem, didn&#x27;t have time to get enough charge to get back home.<p>Also, there&#x27;s not enough power available to feed all the chargers simultaneously. So when all chargers are used and charging, the power delivery dropped to ~1.5kW. As cars started to get full and stopped drawing power only then power delivery would rise later in the day. So there&#x27;s no way to install a thousand+ more chargers, there&#x27;s not enough power delivery available.')
