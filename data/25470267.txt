Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608316347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465511, text='&gt; Thereâ€™s plenty of exceptions like the DMCA forcing a host to restore access to something if a counterclaim is filed.<p>The DMCA doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>The DMCA <i>allows</i> a host to do that without liability for infringement, and continues to provide the host immunity to liability for any claims the user would otherwise have for the original takedown so long as they do that (the second half is the closest thing to force, but it usually is immaterial because hosts usually structure their contracts with users so that they would have no liability to them to immunize against, which is also why hosts are much more likely to provide reliable notice-takedown than counternotice-restorartion.)')
