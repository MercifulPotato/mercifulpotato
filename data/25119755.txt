Item(by='neckardt', descendants=None, kids=[25119817], score=None, time=1605581040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25116636, text='&gt; I have to politely refute this. &quot;Rushing&quot; is the word inexperienced players use for &quot;playing in a more optimal way that prepares you to attack sooner.&quot; If you call it &quot;rushing,&quot; what you&#x27;re really saying is that you need other players to deliberately play worse to give you extra time to prepare. All of these strategies have counterplay and usually lead into long games. Using a vil rush or tower rush is not a way to end the game, it&#x27;s a way to begin it.<p>For less experienced players, rushes like these tend to end the game early rather than begin it in an interesting way. Either the defender knows how to hold the strategy and shuts it down, or hasn&#x27;t seen it before and gets destroyed. While these strategies are certainly part of the game and make high level competitive games far more interesting, it is often a frustrating experience for low&#x2F;mid level players. Many of those players are looking for an experience where they build their army for a while and attack once they&#x27;re satisfied with what they&#x27;ve built. Certainly not strategically optimal, but that&#x27;s often what they find fun.')
