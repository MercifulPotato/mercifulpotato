Some languages and libraries take more liberties with the length of identifiers, the amount of abstraction layers, and maybe more. Java is the classic example where using a plain text editor is really a liability; I can use C++ without any editor support and be fast. But I&#x27;m not sure what this really depends on. (Disclaimer: my argument is flawed because I know C++ well and not Java.)')
