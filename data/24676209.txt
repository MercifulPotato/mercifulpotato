The web API in the browser is substantial, from USB communication to XML parsing.<p>None of that is shipped with Node.js directly for instance.<p>The problem is not the Javascript spec, the problem is that one has to download a package to parse XML with Node.js. Node.js standard library is too barebone.<p>You don&#x27;t have to do that in the client. You have loads of web API, perhaps more than Python&#x27;s standard library.')
