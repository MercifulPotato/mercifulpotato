Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24814653], score=None, time=1602979787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24814459, text='<i>&gt; Looking only at people as individuals limits you to seeing first-order effects.</i><p>Where did I say &quot;looking only at people as individuals&quot;? My point was precisely the opposite: that people are <i>not</i> just individuals, that an individual person&#x27;s failure to exercise common sense and critical thinking skills, making them susceptible to manipulation, when aggregated over a large enough segment of society, has higher order effects that go way beyond the consequences of the manipulation of that individual person, because it creates an environment where nefarious people can thrive, which is bad for everyone.<p>Social media technology certainly makes that problem worse by giving the nefarious people more leverage. But you can&#x27;t fix the problem by banning or restricting the technology; the nefarious people will always have the means to control how those rules get written so that they can continue doing what they want to do, just with different labels pasted over it to satisfy the letter of the rules. Just as has happened with past attempts to do the same thing.<p><i>&gt; People seem to be fundamentally incompatible with social media</i><p>You are assuming that there is no way for anyone to use the tool of social media without being an addict. That is as false and pernicious an assumption as the corresponding assumptions in the case of guns and drugs, which you are also making.<p>With that false assumption taken away, your argument boils down to: since <i>some</i> people are incapable of using tools like social media, guns, and drugs responsibly, we have to ban, or at least impose draconian restrictions on, those technologies for <i>all</i> people. That kind of thinking is incompatible with a free society. In a free society, you penalize the people who <i>can&#x27;t</i> act like responsible adults, not the people who <i>can</i>.')
