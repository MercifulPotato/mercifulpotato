Or do you want the older macbooks that the keyboard would break from dust exposure requiring the entire laptop to be replaced?<p>Or the airpods with non-replaceable batteries so you have to get new airpods for $49+ a piece every couple years?<p>They aren&#x27;t perfect and IMO haven&#x27;t been in a long time. That said, the build quality is good, and I chose to get a macbook as my work computer as a software developer and don&#x27;t regret it, but I wish people would stop putting apple on a pedestal as the example of perfection.')
