This is enough evidence for anyone in the industry.<p>Presumably the commenter doesn&#x27;t have access to this evidence. Instead he has to rely on other heuristics, like the weaker argument that companies spend trillions on data and analytics.<p>Companies sometimes waste money, and maybe microservices are an example of this. But companies collectively spend 3-4 orders of magnitude more money on &quot;all data that does not have USD units&quot; than on microservices, so the commenter should take that as strong evidence that data can be used to create value.')
