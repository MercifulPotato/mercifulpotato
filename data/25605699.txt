Item(by='filoeleven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609527740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598656, text='If you like the sound of the Juno and don’t want to pay vintage synth prices for one, I highly recommend the Behringer DeepMind.<p>It is clearly modeled after the Juno, and adds a lot of nice features (2 DCOs per voice, 2 more-capable LFOs, an arpeggiator, full FX suite...) and you can get the 12-voice keyboard model for about half of what you’d pay for a Juno 106.<p>It’s got a big screen in the middle, but the front panel is designed so that you almost never have to use it, even when building patches.  They have a great shortcut system for assigning modulation that’s easy to pick up and very fast to use.  It’s just a great synth all around.')
