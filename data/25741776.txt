Item(by='alsetmusic', descendants=None, kids=[25742076], score=None, time=1610421123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736527, text='Ben Thompson, of Stratechery, had an interesting way of talking about Facebook that might help with a future definition of &quot;social media services.&quot;<p>He (and podcast co-host John Gruber[0]) talked about the idea that Facebook isn&#x27;t the same site for any two people. Due to the algo, everyone has their own personal version of the site. Therefore, there&#x27;s no individual snapshot of Facebook at any given time.<p>I found this an interesting concept to point out. If one needed to distinguish between a website and &quot;social media services,&quot; perhaps a law could be drafted such that such a condition was true.<p>HN, for example, would be a website because commenting and voting is user-based. I suppose that might mean Spotify and Netflix would be swallowed by the definition. The definition would then need additional language about user-submitted content.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dithering.fm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dithering.fm</a>')
