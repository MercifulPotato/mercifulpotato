I have it in my head that I need to get to a state where I have the boilerplate &quot;done&quot; - able to handle accounts, users (for areas where the two need to be 1:M or vv), admin, and basic subscription billing. I&#x27;m trying to get to the point where I have this thing, and each MVP is just an incremental build on top, but instead I have this half-baked thing and a lot of undelivered ideas. I suppose there are no shortcuts and I need to hammer at it, but as you said, not go nuts with handling edge cases.')
