I&#x27;ve used these weaknesses to break crypto algorithms in the past.<p>A typical example is the crapto-1 Mifare Classic algorithm used to encrypt NFC cards. The way they read from the shift register and combine the bits was dumb and it&#x27;s complexity weakened the algorithm.<p>Another I&#x27;ve seen is using two sequential keys XORd against one another to produce and &quot;encryption&quot; key. Turns out reading from low entropic systems very quickly yields a similar enough key that when XORd, partially removes the first one.')
