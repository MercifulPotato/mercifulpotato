Wiki like collaboration would be interesting to tackle with low bandwidth and something like a once a week syncing.<p>A stationary orbit would be much more interesting as in that case you can have more fun with closer to real time communications. Mesh networks over a couple of groundstations and satellites. It would be even more interesting if the satellites could talk to each other and create mesh networks.<p>——<p>Some more practical information would be great for people such as my self who don’t really speak space jargon.<p>What are the technical capabilities of these satellites? Ie. Area of coverage, bandwidth, what kind of hardware does it require to communicate with it, what are the hardware limitations of the cpu&#x2F;mem&#x2F;disk, what protocols does it speak, can we add off the shelf hardware to it (pi, fpgas, etc). That kind of stuff.')
