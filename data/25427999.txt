They can set those prices however they like, but can&#x27;t customize the pricing for certain customers or refuse new customers.<p>Everybody (including Google) pays the same price per query&#x2F;byte&#x2F;whatever.  CrawlCo gets ownership of the crawling IP range and is prohibited from entering any other market.  GoogleCo is prohibited from doing its own crawling, but can ask (perhaps require) CrawlCo to add new crawl products which are then available to everybody.<p>Basically force Google to do with their crawler what Amazon voluntarily did with their datacenters.')
