Item(by='frereubu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610571171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765399, text='&gt; For the average consumer, battery life has just been another stat on the spec sheet for years now.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with this. I think if you asked someone whether battery life was a priority, they might say no. And if you asked them to rank tech specs I&#x27;m not sure it would necessarily be that high either. But the experience of using a laptop with a noticeably better battery is, for me, quite likely to be one of those things that you didn&#x27;t know you were missing, even if you just charge it every now and then.')
