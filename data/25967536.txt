Maybe your children or grandchildren could if you really have enough money.  Becoming an MP would probably help you turn money into a title.<p>“Public” schools, like Eton, are the fee paying alternative to a “private” tutor.  They’re not be confused with schools “for the plebs”.<p>You’ll certainly need land if want to join the Gentry.<p>Traditionally, the difference between a Forest and a Wood is that the Forest was once land populated by Commoners (that’s the middle and working class) that someone in the Aristocracy put a fence around and claimed exclusive right to hunt deer on.<p>To this day councils have to pay people to walk the ancient Footpaths and Bridleways every year to stop would be aristocrats claiming the as part of their land.<p>And if you wear brown shoes and a white shirt to the wrong interview in the City you’re not getting the job.<p>As I said, it’s complicated. Complicated and silly.')
