He relies entirely on his ability to learn music by ear. But he can usually play something after listening to it a few times, and he mostly plays solo folk music. So because he&#x27;s talented and happy in his niche, he can get by without many typical professional skills.<p>Similarly, I know a CS researcher who hates to use anything but MatLab, and his MatLab code is not exactly an example of good software engineering. But he&#x27;s published a stack of really great papers. He&#x27;s brilliant and he works in a niche.<p>But the average novice would not be well served by imitating either of these people. They can do what they do because they&#x27;re above average in specific skills, and because they&#x27;ve found a niche where they can thrive.')
