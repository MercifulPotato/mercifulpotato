People and companies have the freedom to put what they want on their websites or not.<p>Trump just stood up and asked for his people to go to the capitol - one of his former campaign managers called for beheading members of government.<p>Calling out his lies - a la politifact and many others - hasn’t worked to deradicalize. Fact check verifications next to the content haven’t. So - just shutting off the calls for violence and lies are the next step.<p>“Opposition to Trump looks inept”(?) The opposition just swept congress and the presidency, crushed the popular vote, and even members of his party are strongly against his actions. Ineptitude is the Trump’s legal challenges against the election and the “4 Seasons Total Landscaping” fiasco.<p>Trump can raise funds in many ways. He can get checks. No one is required to allow someone to raise funds on their site - let freedom ring!')
