As for the other three:<p>&quot;One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths,&quot; Contee said. &quot;Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss.&quot;<p>At least one one those medical emergencies was simply a heart attack.
