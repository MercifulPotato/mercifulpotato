These models are not that good and not that accurate. We can&#x27;t even predict weather very well beyond 2 weeks.<p>The climate is subject to chaos theory.<p>Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.<p>Uncertainty is an exponential function of time in chaotic, non-linear dynamic systems like the climate. The year 2500 could just as easily be a deep glacial period.')
