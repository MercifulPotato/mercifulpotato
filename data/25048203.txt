I was banned from their github repo, my AdSense sites were removed from Google&#x27;s index, my AdSense CPC dropped by 2&#x2F;3. My github account was &quot;flagged&quot; aka disabled from being seen in public. I was on github for 7 years. I received nonsensical &quot;not in accordance to policies&quot; messages from AdSense all of a sudden when that happened aka the whole sites were being flagged as not following policies.<p>And all that because I wanted a font that you can easier read than the stupid roboto font.<p>Go may be open source, but you&#x27;re not part of it.\nIt belongs to Google and anyone disagreeing with them they will actively attack you.<p>I still use Go and every time I use it I&#x27;m reminded of their bullying and power tripping.<p>My sites are still off Google&#x27;s index btw and any new sites receive the &quot;no content&quot; response and are rejected, despite there being content.<p>You made an enemy that day. You always meet twice in life. I&#x27;ll pay that back to you.')
