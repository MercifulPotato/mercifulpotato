It&#x27;s a mistake to believe otherwise.<p>You also state:<p>&gt; But I do believe those formal proofs are only really applicable to the mathematical and the abstract.<p>Do you not see the contradiction in these two terms? The creation of formal proofs implies rationality. The comprehension of formal proofs implies rationality.
