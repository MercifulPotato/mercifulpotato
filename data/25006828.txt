If you&#x27;re running something as simple and low profile as OP suggested, all you need to backup from the system are the packages you installed and a handful of configurations you changed in &#x2F;etc. That could be in ansible, but it could be just a .sh file, really. You&#x27;ll also need a backup of the actual data, not the entire &#x2F;. Although, even if all you did was backup the entire &#x2F; there&#x27;s a good chance it would work even if you try to recover it in new hardware.<p>The services metioned by OP don&#x27;t need to talk to each other, they are all things that work out of the box by just running apt-get install or equivalent. You don&#x27;t need anything really fancy and you can set up a new box with part of the services if they are ever taking too much resources (which, for a small setup, will likely never really happen. At least in my experience)')
