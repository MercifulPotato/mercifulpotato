Why can&#x27;t both proprietary software and open source software co-exist? For startups and small companies, open source software is great. For large enterprises, the cost of the software is a vanishingly small % of the cost, and in fact they don&#x27;t care as much - a lot of large enterprises are continuing to open source their own internal tools.<p>MATLAB has over 2 dozen toolboxes, with insanely detailed documentation. We are actually very happy to have MATLAB and our engineers are trained to use it for decades. We <i>gladly</i> pay for it. It would be a massive undertaking to go GNU Octave even if it did everything MATLAB did. I think we are getting stuck in the weeds, the point is:<p>We are engineers. Software is a tool to get the job done.<p>There are many other packages that cannot compete with anything open source - ANSYS Mechanical for example.')
