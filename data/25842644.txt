Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611117603, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840238, text='In addition to wutbrodo, I find that Wikipedia is actually a great starting point to find out more information for yourself.<p>For example, take the comment that you originally replied to, which asserted &quot;Susan Rosenberg literally bombed the Capitol in 1983 and now serves as vice chair of the board of directors of Thousand Currents, a &quot;non-profit foundation that sponsors the fundraising and does administrative work for the Black Lives Matter global network, among other clients.&quot;&quot;<p>That is obviously a great soundbite that seems tailor made for the &quot;the left ignores the terrorism on their side&quot; argument. But on the Wikipedia page for Susan Rosenberg, you can see what her level of involvement was, see how she was punished (she served 16 years), see what she&#x27;s been doing since she was released from prison, and follow lots of links to original sources, like the tax return for Thousand Currents.<p>Snopes is also a great source for stuff like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;blm-terrorist-rosenberg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;blm-terrorist-rosenberg&#x2F;</a>. Again, you don&#x27;t have to agree with the simple &quot;true&#x2F;false&#x2F;mixture&quot; checkbox Snopes puts on their stories. Just read the article, which always has tons of well-researched factual info, and make up your mind for yourself.<p>My main point is that whenever you see some soundbite or statistic on Twitter, Facebook or HN, it was often taken out of context in order to make an argument. It&#x27;s usually pretty easy to use Wikipedia as a starting point to find out more about that context.<p>And to be clear, while I obviously have a point of view, my main point is that you shouldn&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s opinions at face value - the Internet actually makes it pretty easy to find original sources.')
