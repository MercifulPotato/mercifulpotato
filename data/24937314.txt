It might seem like I picked a particularly pathological example there, but if you imagine latitude on a globe or elevation on a mountain, you&#x27;ll find somewhere (like the Laptev sea) hovering at that boundary and ready to cross it.<p>But that&#x27;s only one boundary; there are many others, where the dominant plant or insect species changes from one to another, where methane gas starts to get released faster than stored, etc. So it&#x27;s rather like a staircase, and when the average shifts, there&#x27;s always somewhere on the planet that goes through a confusing and dramatic transition.')
