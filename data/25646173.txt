That sounds way more productive.<p>Well, at least that&#x27;s honest.<p>&gt; Other examples of bad unions would be things like the pilots union. It might be fine for the piloting industry, but the problem with the pilot&#x27;s union model is that it is literally entirely based on senority. If you leave Fedex, for example, and join Delta, then you start at the bottom, and lose all of your pay raises and benefits that are strictly determined by the union.<p>&gt; (And please don&#x27;t even try to argue with me about this, regarding piloting unions. Both my parents work for fedex, and are in the pilot&#x27;s union. I know how they work.)<p>While I&#x27;m sure you disagree, that&#x27;s some pretty fallacious reasoning. It&#x27;s like arguing against the concept of for-profit corporations because you don&#x27;t like some practice of, say, Accenture, because you falsely assume that practice must be replicated without any any reform to all other companies.<p>Most instances of things have flaws, often serious flaws, but a lot of people seem to hold unions to a weird standard where they should be rejected unless all instances are flawless.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d also have a problem with a union that &quot;is literally entirely based on senority,&quot; but I think it makes more sense to reform the institution than reject it (and throw the baby out with the bathwater).<p>&gt;&gt; they currently consist of about 100% of software engineering workplaces in the US.<p>&gt; Yep! Anti union efforts are winning. And as long as union advocates are attempting to creation union shops, which use labor laws in this way, I hope that anti-union efforts continue to win.<p>And anti-democracy efforts are also winning in China.  I mean, CCTV has pretty clearly shown that they&#x27;re so unstable, with weak incompetent leadership.  Don&#x27;t you hope those anti-democratic efforts continue?  I know I prefer to live under a strong, competent leader like Xi.<p>Anti-union efforts are winning, but mainly because business has long been in a more powerful position than labor and has been more effective at propagandizing its position.  IIRC, that propaganda mainly consists of creating a distorted picture based on selectively chosen truths.')
