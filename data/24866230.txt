After that the city sold them for $250,000 each while providing low interest loans (via a local credit union) so drivers could pay for them. When Uber and Lyft arrived, their drivers didn&#x27;t need medallions and there were no limits on how many drivers either company could have on the street. The medallion system collapsed and those who took out loans for them did indeed end up getting screwed.')
