Money is always limited, and any promotion (or even non-promotion) is a statement about relative (financial) value. People sometimes confuse that with actual human value and feel mistreated. Even talking about money is hard for many folks - how do we balance wages, how do we distribute profits, invest, save for bad times, ... People are not trained for this, money is often something people don’t talk about.<p>So some of the promotion dance may be more complicated in larger orgs, but it’s still hard in other orgs since it’s a value judgement on merits earned and as with all value judgements, there’s no absolutely correct and mathematically defensible formula.')
