It&#x27;s stronger in some scenarios than others. For example, it&#x27;s pretty much the only indicator you need to dismiss more outragerous claims like flat-earthers.<p>The simple question of &quot;what would be the point&quot; is enough to dismiss nearly all of that spectrum of conspiracy theory - wherein no reason that makes a modicum of sense can be given. &quot;Hur dur, because control the populous&quot; or something is generally the best that can be mustered, and asking how or why leads only to more dead ends.<p>Likewise, trying to come up with a story about why both his own party and the opposing party and a large number of his own base and the entirety of the opposition&#x27;s base will lead to no plausible story.')
