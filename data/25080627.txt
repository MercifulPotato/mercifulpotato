I see you posting comments about there being multiple comment pages. Is there anything that could be done to avoid that, like allowing more comments per page (e.g. up to 10 of the current pages?), infinite scrolling, having a more visible &quot;more pages&quot; button, having the button not only at the bottom but also at the top, etc. ?')
