Now every developer can get their own server and push their code, test it, do whatever, think of the agility. But, realistically, all that&#x27;s happened is the creation of hundreds of silos, each configured differently, possibly being abused, possibly containing restricted data, mis-configurations leading to breach, denial of service, running up the company card, all sorts of bad things.<p>In other words, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether those raw compute resources are available in the cloud or in a company data center. The cloud enables developers broader access to provisioning, but there&#x27;s substantial evidence that may not be a good thing. A company data center is a 1780s-era musket; the cloud is a M249 machine gun.<p>That&#x27;s why we need to talk in abstract functional primitives. Developers shouldn&#x27;t worry about which TLS algorithms are accepted, or that the storage bucket they want has proper read&#x2F;write access; not just because a ton of this stuff is very arcane and domain specific, but also because humans will ALWAYS get it wrong unless its managed at a higher, centralized, and totally automated level.<p>And at that point, raw access to AWS doesn&#x27;t make sense. Developers don&#x27;t actually want an EC2 instance; they want their app running on a server. Let Operations (or Heroku, or whoever) handle that for you.')
