I&#x27;ve met lots of people who are self-deluding or don&#x27;t conciously recognize their own patterns. We all have a story we tell about ourselves, but it often isn&#x27;t the true story.<p>That said, i don&#x27;t think any of that conflicts with learning to empathisize with others. Understanding yourself is just as important as understanding other people. Personally i suspect they are related skills.')
