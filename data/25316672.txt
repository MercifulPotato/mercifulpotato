Even at human safety level, more than a million people die every year in car crashes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure. Why is this so? To save time? Sure, but I think the self-driving proponents that I have seen have not addressed the new problems that will be brought by self-driving cars. I don&#x27;t think reducing crashes is anything but a marketing ploy because the real goal of self-driving is to make companies a lot of money. I think accidents will simply be transposed and not reduced.<p>One problem is the initial rollout period where there is a non-homogeneous mix of human and automated drivers. This impedance mismatch will be problematic and likely lead to more accidents and congestion.<p>In general, it&#x27;s my belief (I don&#x27;t have facts or research, just a hunch) that automated driving will actually increase congestion and traffic. We saw this with Uber and Lyft, where these things plus accidents were increased where these services were deployed. I&#x27;ve seen it first hand that the cars causing issues are likely to be Uber or Lyft. I will be very surprised if this is not the case with automated drivers. For example, consider the case of an automated car dropping someone off in a busy area, probably one of the most wanted use cases for automated car. This is because it could notionally drop the person off and then drive off and find parking. But that seems like an insanely hard problem because such a maneuver is actually difficult for humans and very tricky in busy areas.<p>I truly don&#x27;t understand the actual <i>need</i> for self-driving cars. There is a lot of hype, for sure, but I personally see that it will generate more problems. Basically the only problem that it will solve is reduction in human time driving because I doubt it will be actually safer such that it&#x27;s a major difference from now. I feel our society would gain much more benefit in concentrating on better transportation and urban design: planes, trains, automobiles, bicycles, and walking.')
