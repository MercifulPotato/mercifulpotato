LTO-9 should be hitting the market very soon and supports up to 45TB per tape (compressed capacity, 18TB raw).<p>Not quite sure where IBM&#x27;s numbers here come from, their previous numbers don&#x27;t match up to the progression of the LTO tape series&#x27; capacity.  Maybe they are citing &quot;research numbers&quot; that they can do in a lab but aren&#x27;t production-ready yet.  I would certainly assume they are citing &quot;compressed&quot; data figured there.<p>But certainly tape has continued to progress much faster than most people would have imagined.  Big tape libraries are still a thing in certain environments and they work very well, there is no better solution for bulk cold storage.')
