He&#x27;s a manufacturing guy (not circuits&#x2F;CPU, but still HW). He lives in Portland. They wanted him to move to Cupertino, and offered him 15% more than what he currently makes. Taking COL into account that&#x27;s a demotion.<p>So I can believe Apple doesn&#x27;t pay non-SW folks that much.')
