You&#x27;re talking about optimizing the UI to exploit the users for your maximum profit. Those two motivations are obviously not well-aligned</i><p>I could not disagree more strongly. I have built a career built, in no small part, on a simple business model of creating software that users like because it&#x27;s easy and works well, and consequently attracting and retaining happy (and paying) customers. This has absolutely nothing to do with ad-tech, which I generally regard as a toxic business model for exactly the reasons you&#x27;re arguing.')
