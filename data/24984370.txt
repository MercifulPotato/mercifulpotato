Nowadays I have a freaking ps script to run after each upgrade, to set things back how I configured them.<p>&gt; Personally, since a major Windows update or two ago I only have one settings panel I actively use that is still a Win32 dialog and not directly in the modern Settings app.<p>So you never had to use the Network Adapters window? I need that one pretty often, the new one in Settings is not adequate. How do you add or remove features from Windows, like HyperV or WSL? That one is also inside the old Add&#x2F;Remove Programs applet (the features on demand in Settings app is a different mechanism, with different content and applications. Yay for consistency).')
