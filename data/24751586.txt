The main cost of infrastructure is actually the rent, of any land &#x2F; property cost required for the Cell. In Countries where Mobile Network already owns the land for these Cell Site &#x2F; Tower that were paid and amortised during the 2G &#x2F; 3G &#x2F; 4G era. They are now essentially free. In Cities, that depends on rent and property pricing, unless you have government mandate or directly involved like in China. It is also dependent on the <i>fear</i> level of radiation in the culture &#x2F; nation.

Which also drives up the cost of finding and setting up Cell Sites. ( Or they are willing to put up with the risk of radiation if you pay them more ).')
