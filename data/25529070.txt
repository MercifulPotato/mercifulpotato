Eventually, I found pianote.com and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy - it&#x27;s worth checking out as another option for online piano learning (they also have drum and guitar programs).<p>I agree not to buy an expensive piano (or keyboard). While a fully weighted 88-key instrument is definitely ideal, you can get by just fine on a semi, or even el-cheapo, 61-key keyboard.')
