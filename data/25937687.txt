I did have an intention, the mod killed that intention.<p>I had enjoyed the other WSB discord very much, and was looking forward to a new server I&#x27;d enjoy and because of a jackass mod who say nig*er a lot I couldn&#x27;t enjoy that.<p>So a very proportional response is to report the server they moderate!<p>I didn&#x27;t lie, I didn&#x27;t misconstrue anything, I said &quot;this server has a moderator that spams nig*er very casually&quot;<p>Are you defending that? Or blaming me for their behavior? Or faulting me for not liking that? Which is it?<p>-<p>Because make no mistake, if this wasn&#x27;t an admin level mod saying this I wouldn&#x27;t report them. I even get the WSB &quot;everyone is a mod&quot; meme. And I get moderation is tough, things slip, that&#x27;s life.<p>But when your admin says nig*er hundreds of times for fun... you&#x27;re crossing a line.')
