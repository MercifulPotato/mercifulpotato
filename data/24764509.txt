I&#x27;m not passing it. This is what you allow.&quot;<p>If you randomly bring the hammer down on a fraction of the people who just touch the fence, the fence will be pretty clear of people leaning over. But you&#x27;ll sure gain a reputation for opaque capricious moderation.<p>NB: I am not against this system, and I recognize it&#x27;s widely applied in the world.')
