Somehow different than any other company.<p>Stir the pot a little, make some noise, be loud enough to let others in the world know you exist, and then simply ignore all the real problems of big tech.<p>Literally “Mob” money. But the contract was broken here. Too much noise in wrong direction.<p>The crazy thing is these employees sell out by taking jobs at Google and Facebook in first place (who wouldn’t) but then act surprised their role is simply a social tax strategy to keep heads turned.<p>I hope she brings the whole thing down. It’s pure evil')
