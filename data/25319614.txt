They are meant as a guide to the subject from a modern, Analytic perspective. Each volume contains extended, self-contained, essays on philosophic subtopics and history.<p>Why AC Grayling&#x27;s Philosophy I &amp; II instead of the Stanford Encyclopedia: It is 2 volumes, so much, much shorter. I have no idea how long the SEP is in print, but I imagine somewhere near an order of magnitude longer, maybe two orders of magnitude. It is meant to be useful for philosophy grad students and professors. You asked for an introduction.<p>Why AC Grayling&#x27;s Philosophy I &amp; II instead of his History of Philosophy. Actually, they are pretty similar. The History is a single volume, so it has the advantage of brevity. But it is more idiosyncratic and Grayling is more out of his depth. Russell&#x27;s History of Philosophy is worse still in this regard. Scott Soames has a history entitled The World Philosophy Made, which is even more Analytic in outlook.<p>Why not primary sources: Why not? It is how I went along in the subject. Just start with Plato. Apology (who is this Socrates character anyway?) -&gt; Meno (What is knowledge anyway?) -&gt; Republic (is it better to do injustice or be injusticed?). That will be enough to start. There are plenty of other good suggestions here.<p>Why not an introduction to Continental philosophy: Actually, I can recommend one. Robert Pippin&#x27;s Modernism as a Philosophical Problem.<p>(My credentials. I was a philosophy major at the University of Chicago, which is an Analytic program, where I tried to pursue Continental philosophy, and I have a master&#x27;s from The New School, which is a Continental program, where I tried to pursue Analytic philosophy.)')
