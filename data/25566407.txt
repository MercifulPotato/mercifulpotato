That’s possible although I’m not actually sure you want to use a third party email service with no analytics since that means it will be hard for them to understand bugs and things of that nature.<p>To me the requirement to not allow Tor or VPN with Captcha is just completely insane. So you’re expecting a free email service to have no monetization but also allow you to infinitely abuse its free services? Just host your own email rather than calling providers shit because they don’t allow unlimited abuse of their free email accounts (which can get them blacklisted).<p>I do think it’s somewhat reasonable to expect Protonmail to be able to support a pro-privacy payment method like Monero to allow a “truly anonymous” sign up that at least costs money to prevent rampant spamming but at that point things are getting into “who cares” territory, as in, the company behind protonmail doesn’t give enough of a shit about the 48 users who would love to use the service if only they supported accounting creation via Tor and Monero to justify spending engineering or even legal time on making that work.')
