Whilst working I just keep bouncing between using one of them for a while, then rewriting or doing some other project with the other. What makes matters worse is that I constantly have this debated in my head on which one to choose. This really feels like Buridan&#x27;s ass paradox :D Just instead of being frozen in indecision, I keep re-doing stuff in some other language or framework barely progressing forward.<p>I know flipping a coin won&#x27;t work here. The only two options that sound reasonable are:\n1. Choose the &quot;worst&quot; one, since they are all clearly pretty equal anyways. This way you just trick your brain to stop &quot;optimizing&quot;.\n2. Choose the most &quot;popular&quot; -- use external referee to break my deadlock. Basically, I assume that this is a case of game with correlated equilibrium and I need an external tiebreaker.<p>Anybody else had any experience with this and found some tricks that work?')
