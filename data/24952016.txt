I&#x27;m disagreeing with the absurd claim that &quot;uncomputable numbers â€¦ in the guise of string theory obtained a death grip on fundamental physics&quot;. The real numbers are used in <i>every single part</i> of physics, and physicists <i>do not care</i> to distinguish between computable and non-computable reals, because that makes the theory much more complex with no known practical benefit.<p>I also wish that the person I initially replied to would expand on their vague claim that<p>&gt; Fortunately a new generation of smart people, with intuitions honed on computers, is well placed to capitalize on this arbitrage opportunity.')
