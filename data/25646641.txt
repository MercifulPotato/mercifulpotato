It&#x27;s more like your standard wordpress stories site (there is even a section labelled &quot;stories&quot;).<p>edit:<p>&gt; The www.gov.sg Portal is the official online communication platform and repository of the Singapore Government, providing you with the latest policy announcements, information and news on Singapore.
