I think you have to be friendly to live cheek by jowl with so many.  However New Yorkers are brisk.<p>The tech industry has definitely become more aggressive over the last 20 years.  I credit it to the people who decided they should join it because there is a lot of money to be made, when before it was mostly people who liked technology.<p>And for that latter point: I consider an aggressive attitude a sign of fear (perhaps a consequence of a kind of imposter syndrome?).  Generally I pity the mean people.')
