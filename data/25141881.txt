Thankfully, this space is far more open now than it used to be; HL7 for example used to require payment just to see the standards. Pretty much everything you would need access to (HL7, CCDA, SNOMED, LOINC, ICD-10, etc) is freely available now!<p>Generally just having an EMR system is not enough; you also need practice management, scheduling, billing, insurance claims, etc. Interoperability between separate software for these things is... tenuous at best, though some practices do manage to handle it, it can be very fragile. Hence integrated solutions are pretty much the best way to go, and also prevent disruption from competitors which may be better in one space but not another, since it&#x27;s so hard to get them to talk to each other well.')
