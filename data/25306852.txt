Item(by='samat', descendants=None, kids=[25310750], score=None, time=1607111343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306306, text='Thank you for writing this.<p>Some years ago I served as a CTO for a major news media org.<p>Google approached us and asked to implement some &#x27;structured web&#x27; stuff on our pages, so I dug in and realised there is a mandatory field for a link to a book or movie reviewers personal page in wikipedia.<p>So I&#x27;ve found out that one of the most notable Russian book reviewers does not have an wikipedia page. No big deal, I&#x27;ve created one with some very basic info and some links to prove she&#x27;s &#x27;notable enough&#x27;.<p>What ensued shortly after is kafkaesque story of some entitled shitheads who have power because they know some local lingo and have unlimited time resources to waste.<p>Luckily, someone poured too much time and effort and made that page &#x27;standard wikipedia article about a person&#x27; with all those &#x27;templates and boxes&#x27; and used the right lingo to defend it&#x27;s notability.<p>I swear I tried to do it myself and failed. I am not stupid, the wikipedia editing is just too complicated.<p>Thanks for reading, a few years passed and apparently I still have not got it fully out of my system. That feeling of complete helplessness, when those bureaucrats are clearly toying with you and enjoying it. It sucks big time.')
