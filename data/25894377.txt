In the UK, the Open Rights Group is raising money to sue our data protection agency for its incompetence&#x2F;unwillingness to enforce the regulation, so maybe it&#x27;s worth checking out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;action.openrightsgroup.org&#x2F;help-us-protect-your-data-illegal-ads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;action.openrightsgroup.org&#x2F;help-us-protect-your-data...</a> (no affiliation)')
