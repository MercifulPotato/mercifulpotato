Almost no one is available &quot;immediately&quot; all the time. But if you regularly show yourself as online and cannot respond within a reasonable amount of time (a couple of hours?) to questions&#x2F;concerns that coworkers send to you, then why are you &quot;Online&quot;?<p>I think you&#x27;re actually somewhat agreeing with the above poster.<p>To me, being online means I will respond to your concern as soon as I can context switch to your problem cheaply - usually within 30 minutes, or maybe even instantly if you caught me coming off of a lunch&#x2F;bathroom break.<p>&gt; Is it difficult to close the app, change your status, or simply respond with &quot;Hey, super busy today. I&#x27;ll get back to you on this tomorrow&quot;, simply for the sake of building good team interactions?<p>I think it&#x27;s a good habit to build. For example if it&#x27;s nearing the end of the work day, and you have enough work to do, setting yourself to busy should indicate people not to expect your response until the next day.')
