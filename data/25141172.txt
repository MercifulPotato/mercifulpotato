I think my reaction&#x27;s still similar though - why <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> I be allowed to do that?<p>The alternative of course is to charge more per tile, or have a base &#x27;access fee&#x27; + small incremental charge. Pay per usage doesn&#x27;t work best for everything, IMO.<p>(And I&#x27;d likely still want to come back occasionally to check it hasn&#x27;t changed, even if I cached every tile forever. (Which I probably wouldn&#x27;t, if the hit rate was really low, like it was a one-off, and I&#x27;m being cheap about my API usage why wouldn&#x27;t I also be cheap about my disk usage.))')
