It&#x27;s a huge performance hit. Mobile doesn&#x27;t do it. And RAM is so cheap.)<p>The “RAM is cheap” argument is one of the reasons why we have lazy developers creating apps like MS Teams (on Windows 10) that takes a huge amount of memory (in my case, it’s about 1GB on startup without checking any chats, and I don’t even have many chats and teams in it). It somehow eventually runs out of memory, crashes and restarts. I have 8GB of RAM and allocated swap of the same amount. I’m not running many other RAM intensive applications (except for Brave browser with less than a handful of tabs).')
