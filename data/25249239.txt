In that case, this particular trick is rather neat, since assignment of IP addresses is fully static&#x2F;local (without having to agree upfront what range of IPs each node can use for bringing pods online), while retaining the benefit of everything being directly routable. You can now also run a ridiculous amount of pods on a single node.')
