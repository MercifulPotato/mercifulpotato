JLC delivers a custom board for 7Eur within a MONTH! For 7eur I can get a perfboard, ATTiny2313 and a bunch of components and make a thing... in about 4 hours.<p>I used to make CAN interface boards without SMD and with tools that cost me roughly 20Eur in total. Never needed a hot air station - so your claim that it&#x27;s nothing special is complete delusion of reality. I couldn&#x27;t even afford a breadboard... not to mention specialist MCU programmer.')
