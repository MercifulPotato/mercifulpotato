We want our business people to be just as effective as our quants; we want nothing to require real intellectual labor.<p>The idea that you traditionally have these programmers who spout mumbo-jumo all day, cost a lot of money, and seem to always be planning stuff behind your back is threatening, and all the more so because you are utterly dependent on them. ML breaks their control over the means of production.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say I am against labor saving devices. I most certainly am for them, but an an economy in which everyone is in a deep learning arms race is an irrational shit show that could only result in less productivity.<p>(It&#x27;s possible a single central planner AI could do better, because at least the training data would be &quot;real world&quot; and not output of other deep learning black box actors. But of course single-planner economies have a huge amount of other downsides.)')
