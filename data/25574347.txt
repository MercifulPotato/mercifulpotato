After months of urging, I finally did. ...I received so little in donations that I refunded the money.<p>Last year, my users urged me to put up a Patreon and, expecting the worst, I finally did it. The service isn&#x27;t nearly as popular as it was 10 years ago, yet they&#x27;ve committed $300+&#x2F;month which is enough to at least pay for some of my time to improve the service, a service I considered taking down.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate what&#x27;s going on here. There are avenues opening up just when I thought, yesterday, that they closed off for good.<p>Just like Adsense created a content renaissance that let small creators (on a couple mediums) make a living, it might not be overstating it to say that we&#x27;re seeing the next one, this time with direct, recurring (important!) funding.<p>Aside, I wonder what the historian&#x27;s analysis of the cultural shift would look like mapped out. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Twitch was the lynchpin in normalizing direct contribution.')
