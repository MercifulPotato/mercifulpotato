Item(by='pubby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605088214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055659, text='My observation is that in the adult business world, masculine traits can be advantageous. But before that, in schooling and such, masculine traits have few benefits outside of sports, and are frequently discouraged and suppressed. This causes dissonance, where men are being raised to be gentle, only to reach adulthood and realize that male privilege as advertised does not benefit them.<p>Women, especially attractive women, seem to receive more support, attention, and sympathy than men. In general, they have less pressure to succeed, and more options to fall back on. I suspect this leads to an easier transition from teenager to adult, though this advantage fades as they age, and they deal with unfair disadvantages otherwise.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ll mention that in recent years the internet has greatly magnified the amount of attention young women receive. Few talk about it, but they should, for it&#x27;s the biggest change to gender differences in years.')
