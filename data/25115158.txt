It&#x27;s hard to explain, but if you work in that area, you&#x27;ll very quickly see it.</i><p>I think many people have learned one language, or 3 languages that are similar, and they think all languages do roughly the same thing.<p>That&#x27;s incorrect on all counts: in terms of  the core data model, the operators, and the libraries.<p>If you do a lot of work in a specific domain, you&#x27;ll start to see all the differences.  Shell is the best tool for bringing up machines, which happens a lot in both the cloud&#x2F;web and embedded spaces.<p>----<p>Ditto for R.  R makes a lot of tasks really easy, and a lot of other ones really hard (like being 10x slower than Python, or 1000x slower than C, for many tasks).  That sounds horrifying, but it really helps you get a lot of work done.<p>Another thing people have trouble appreciating is the difference between R and Matlab, and Matlab and Mathematica.  Those 3 languages are drastically different because of both their core data model and who uses them.')
