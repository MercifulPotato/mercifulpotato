That&#x27;s it.</i><p>I am reminded of the apocryphal tale:<p>&gt; <i>Shortly before World War I, the German Kaiser was the guest of the Swiss government to observe military maneuvers. The Kaiser asked a Swiss militiaman: &#x27;You are 500,000 and you shoot well, but if we attack with 1,000,000 men what will you do?&#x27; The soldier replied: &#x27;We will shoot twice and go home.&#x27;</i><p>Having a stock of ammo is sometimes more about making it through droughts of ammo availability and still being about to out and train&#x2F;practice regularly. Supposedly over the last few months  there&#x27;s been limited ammo availability?')
