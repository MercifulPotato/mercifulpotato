Using that word, it makes perfect sense to me why I can&#x27;t stand the industry and see no place for myself in it.<p>Additionally it seems that that technology is getting much more difficult for hackers (mind you im not using the hacker in the colloquial malicious sense, but insuppose the definitions overlap at time) and so I find myself drawn towards &quot;hacking&quot; in other fields where it traditionally has been a lot more difficult to do so, but is becoming less so.<p>I occasionally get around to hacking with neat things nowadays, but most of the time I&#x27;m too mentally exhausted.')
