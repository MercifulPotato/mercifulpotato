It started with the magic &quot;next song&quot; algorithm from the original Beats. [1] ( Which I am still pissed off about ). Basically the whole Apple Music, still as it is today is designed around Discovery. ( Edit: You can tell by its UI design evolution over the years, how it subtly changes. No Bookmark artist button, no back button.. etc ) Whether it was the original &quot;Next Song&quot;, or curated playlist, or Beats Radio. Apple wants people to discover <i>new</i> music. ( Which is actually a noble Goal ) The problem is large percentage of people dont discover Music on Apple Music, it was mostly though other media, offline playing ( where Shazam comes in ) or people just want to listen to <i>old</i> music. In that what people want is a Distribution Point.<p>For English Speaking Countries Apple Music seems to be doing OK for that curation and Discovery. Especially in US. Elsewhere the same formula hasn&#x27;t worked at all. [2]<p>Consider Apple has 1 Billion iPhone users, compared to 2.5B Android ( Excluding China ),  with App Spending power <i>4 times</i> the average of Android users. And Apple Music, after 5 years, with it being default on iOS ecosystem, still does not have half the paying users as Spotify is saying something.<p>That is not to say Spotify is perfect ( Far from it ).<p>Note: But it didn&#x27;t matter much because Music Streaming Services is a Net Zero Profit Margin Business.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;beats-curated-music-service-heading-for-summer-launch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;beats-curated-music-service-headin...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atadistance.net&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;04&#x2F;homepod-and-the-apple-music-japanese-metadata-mess&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atadistance.net&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;04&#x2F;homepod-and-the-apple-mus...</a>')
