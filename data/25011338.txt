Perhaps not in the clinical sense, but hear me out. When people become anxious, they start to have difficulty breaking complex&#x2F;large tasks into simple&#x2F;small tasks. Even when they try to, they&#x27;re still taking on too much work (or it still <i>feels</i> like too much work) to be able to complete in a reasonable (again, in their perception) time. This happens to me often, and this year has definitely been worse than most.<p>Here&#x27;s what I do: Take a step back, write down what needs to be done. Break those things down into achievable chunks. Repeat. Then focus on one part at a time, don&#x27;t scattershot it. Don&#x27;t take a small bit of work from here and there. Take the small pieces that <i>sum up to</i> a completed larger piece, and get it done. Repeat.<p>One of the benefits of this is an emotional one. You&#x27;ll start to see small wins, which feels good. Then you get bigger wins.<p>By way of analogy, trying to get fit is similar. I wanted to run a 5k, I just couldn&#x27;t (I was 40 pounds overweight and had barely exercised in years). I went out and walked it, that worked but took me way too long (50 minutes the first time). I increased my walking pace, I started jogging short segments, eventually I could do a full 5k run. If I had just gone out initially and tried to run it, I&#x27;d have failed. And gone out two days later, and failed. Eventually I&#x27;d have given up (I know, I did that before). By making small achievable goals that also built up towards my ultimate goal, I gave myself both the emotional framework to maintain motivation and the structural framework to actually achieve it.')
