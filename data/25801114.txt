Do you mean like in a court of law?<p>The whole point of the First Amendment is to prevent the state from hauling you to court just for making some utterance. Moreover, you shouldn&#x27;t be asked to defend your views at the mercy of judges who threaten you with a loss of  your freedom if you are deemed to have the &quot;wrong&quot; ideas. That doesn&#x27;t only threaten your own freedom, but democracy itself.<p>Priority, undue or not, does not matter, and it assumes that someone is the arbiter of that priority, whereas the idea of free speech claims that the final arbiter is truth itself, as it will conquer all if we just give people the freedom to find it. The maxim that comes out of this, is that the only way we can possibly find the truth, is by allowing ideas to compete freely, by giving people as much freedom of speech as possible, because if we don&#x27;t, then lies will prevail.')
