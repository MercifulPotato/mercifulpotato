Post is saying about &quot;a bit of aviation safety culture&quot; then it highlights a specific part that would be useful.<p>Safety culture element highlighted is: not blaming a single person but finding out how to prevent accident that happened from happening again. Which is reasonable because you don&#x27;t want to impose some strict rules that are expensive up front.
