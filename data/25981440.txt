I was wondering if it was going to be Lack before I clicked on the main link (regarding server racks), and it was. :) I’ve found them super useful at home because of their flexibility. I’m planning on buying a bunch more and replacing some other furniture I have with them because I believe I can make them work better than the specific-purpose ones I have now.')
