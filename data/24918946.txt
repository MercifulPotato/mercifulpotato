Thought it would be another overhyped WP caching solution but it truly feels magical. I believe it&#x27;s powered by CF Workers and stores the pure HTML in KV on the backend, but all of that is handled for you and automagically updated&#x2F;purged by the plugin on any site change.<p>Highly recommend trying it. I&#x27;m seeing the vast majority of visits now are not hitting the origin server at <i>all</i> â€” for assets or the page itself. At least it&#x27;s a good stopgap until we can convince everyone to move 100% static...one can dream, right?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;automatic-platform-optimizations-starting-with-wordpress&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;automatic-platform-optimizations...</a>')
