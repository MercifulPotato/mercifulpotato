There is bias in everything.<p>There is bias in Googles original search - it crawled content. That content will be biased.<p><i>Google search has been biased since the start</i>. It has nothing to do with AI.<p>Biased is also contextual: what does it mean for all of us non-Americans to see tons of American content in <i>everything</i> - the &#x27;American bias&#x27; is overwhelmingly the strongest bias, where are the concerns about that?<p>And how does bias imply a &#x27;lack of ethics&#x27;?<p>The entire consideration is ridiculous:<p>1) AI is not special and odes not deserve it&#x27;s own ethical oversight. Every social tech has issues and it all needs to be thought about.<p>2) Someone with no real training in the issue may very well merely be injecting their own politics into the situation, and possibly overstating issuses.<p>3) There&#x27;s nothing objective about morality or ethnics, so it&#x27;s really hard to even find such at thing as &#x27;objective&#x27;.<p>What the company needs is a clean, comprehensive framework for the issue, and probably some independent oversight that can given them private assessments of where there are red flags.<p>Not individuals who want to make a name for themselves on the issue publicly, and who might be part of some kind of ideological movement.')
