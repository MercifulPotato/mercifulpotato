I don’t disagree with what you’re saying, maybe you can clarify please.<p>For a maintainer to say, or suggest, “don’t bother even opening an issue or PR in my project, because I will take it as an entitled offensive against me,” is just fostering an environment where nobody will open issues or push PRs. Why would they? There is no longer any presumption of good faith discourse there.<p>&gt; “ The argument presented here smacks of the type of entitlement that led many other open source developers to leave”<p>Are you trying to say that I am presenting an entitled opinion, because I am saying that there is a give and take to healthy social interaction?<p>Ignorance over malice. If someone opens a shitty or entitled ticket, teach them why it is such and educate them on how to open a better ticket or steps to take to solve the problem themselves. If they do it again, ok, now you know they are not interacting in good faith. You as a maintainer have that responsibility, just like the user taking advantage of your work has a responsibility to not act entitled to it.')
