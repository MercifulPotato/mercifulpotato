When I was an undergrad about 25 years ago most intro to programming classes were taught in C. There were a lot of concepts I struggled with at the time that now I find trivial. In retrospect, what I was <i>really</i> struggling with was some of the lower level gnarly bits C exposes to the programmer.<p>While it&#x27;s good that I know how those things work, I did <i>not</i> need to understand them to just get a basic understanding of strings, data structures, etc. For instance it wasn&#x27;t that I couldn&#x27;t grok linked lists, I couldn&#x27;t grok pointer manipulation at the time. But that still meant my code didn&#x27;t work.')
