I set up forwarding from second one to first one, then I forgot the password.<p>I tried to login probably a decade later last year. Couldn&#x27;t remember the password. Asked internally if someone could help. They said they can&#x27;t(they can easily verify who I am if they wanted). I asked them to send a password reset to the same email (name+lastname@gmail.com gets password reset email for name+lastname@gmail.com), they said they can&#x27;t do. This would have worked for me due to forwarding, but no...<p>Something&#x27;s at google are great. Support is not one of them.')
