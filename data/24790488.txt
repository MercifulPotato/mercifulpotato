A bankruptcy tribunal took over the case and some legal proceedings are going on.<p>Users are complaining on twitter that despite paying for domain renewal, the domains are expiring.<p>Net4 also has always had a dodgy reputation about releasing domains.<p>I have a domain expiring on 18-oct-2020. I have started the transfer process on 13-oct-2020 - but it is still stuck in the &quot;pending transfer&quot; stage 48 hours later.  I am worried that the domain will expire before the transfer actually goes through.<p>Do you have any experience or thoughts about this predicament.')
