I would never hold it against Robinhood to liquidate positions or have restrictions on buying&#x2F;selling stocks where the broker could be at risk.<p>The problem is that Robinhood is selling positions that are fully covered by their clients as well as prohibiting the buying of shares even when the purchase is 100% covered by the user.<p>I&#x27;ve been in this industry for 15 years now, including obviously the great recession, the flash crash, brexit, and a host of highly volatile events resulting in massive market swings and this is absolutely unheard of. I&#x27;ve never seen a broker prevent its clients from buying shares or liquidating shares that are fully accounted for and pose no risk to the broker.')
