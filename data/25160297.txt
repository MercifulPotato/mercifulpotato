It&#x27;s a bit more on topic though as it talks about swift on the server, which this library can belong to (but doesn&#x27;t have to, the library also has a ssh client part). Still, way offtopic if you are strict.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25158932" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25158932</a> alright so this comment is actually about the SSH library. Only barely has any replies though. Apparently hn&#x27;ers don&#x27;t like to talk about the ssh library.<p>* And there is my comment <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25158334" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25158334</a> which as of now has the most discussion, but it&#x27;s downvoted at a -4 score ATM.<p>I actually came to this thread where these responses were the top replies (except for the single one which is actually on-topic, it wasn&#x27;t present yet). So I thought I&#x27;d add my own.<p>Also it&#x27;s sad how nobody replied to the second part of my post. I think that employability is a clear benefit of Swift and Go over Rust. If I check indeed Germany for &quot;Swift Software&quot;, I get 596 results. If I check &quot;Go Software&quot; I get 2463 jobs. Checking &quot;Rust Software&quot; gives me 131 results. A big difference.')
