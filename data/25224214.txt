There are other licenses with stronger copylefts specifically to cover that last case -- notably, the AGPL.<p>I suspect trying to make the case that GPL&#x27;s viral copyleft isn&#x27;t limited to strictly linking but potentially any interaction with it would probably have a chilling effect on the use of GPL code, and this reinterpretation would only reinforce some people&#x27;s prejudice against the GPL, a la Ballmer&#x27;s &quot;Linux is cancer&quot; line.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the pragmatism in me, but I think it would have a net negative effect long term, unless it managed to flip all of the tables and convince everyone to use all GPL code, instead of making people reject copyleft wholesale.')
