Music, on the other hand, is an inherently social experience.<p>NO.<p>For me, music is an intensely private experience. I <i>do not</i> want people around me when I&#x27;m listening to music. I don&#x27;t share my music tastes with others. Music is part of my me-time.<p>I get where the author is coming from, but music is not social all the time. I agree with another comment here, this article just clashes with me in such a way that I want to throw my laptop in anger after reading it.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing with games right now, they just pester me to keep connecting. I&#x27;d rather prefer playing with random people and then not see them again. The &quot;social+ money&quot; part is so scary that I hope that I am actively going to stay as far from it as I can.<p>Now I&#x27;ve essentially realized the value of subscriptions over free things powered by ads and &quot;social&quot; wizardry. I&#x27;ll pay for the good stuff on subscription&#x2F;donations if the good stuff keeps on being what it is and not some ad-infestation&#x2F;&quot;social+&quot; injection which keeps ruining the experience.')
