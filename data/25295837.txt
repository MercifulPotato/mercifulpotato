One of them I have almost <i>never</i> used, and in its eight-year lifespan it&#x27;s received...(checks)...7 emails. All of which were from Microsoft.<p>That account is still up, though, and I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve checked it from the website itself in years, although it is one of the accounts I&#x27;ve linked to my Outlook app. So the mere act of polling an account for email might be enough to be considered &quot;active&quot;.<p>I haven&#x27;t checked what would happen if I did the same polling but only used Thunderbird instead.')
