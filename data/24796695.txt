Success?<p>That is a logically inconsistent outcome so I would expect nasal demons. But yes, it&#x27;s probably a success because it means the social networks have less of an interest to and a legal reason not to influence content (maximizing engagement, removing content that harms their brand, conforming to the advertisers overton window, etc.).<p>&gt; This exists today — shared block lists, etc — and it’s insufficient.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s insufficient, because it&#x27;s not first-party tooling that&#x27;s designed to scale as well as the rest of the network. You can&#x27;t propagate them in realtime, delegate moderation to trusted peers and so on.<p>&gt; The problem with carving out exceptions to your ban on moderation is that it moves your complaint from “all censorship is bad” to “censorship of speech I don’t like is bad”.<p>That smells like a bogus argument to me, akin to complaining that net neutrality will make DoS prevention impossible. Aspects of spam are things being unsolicited and in bulk. But how much you need to do about it in the first place also depends on communication platform is structured in the first place. Do you see any unsolicited content without prompting for it or do there have to be some network edges between you and the spammer? If the latter, sever them, if enough people do that then the tree will fall in the forest and make no sound.')
