I&#x27;ve detracted Trump since I learned of his existence in the mid-80s. I would never vote for him for any office. I would not change the channel to hear him say something. He is a worse human than he is a President, and that&#x27;s a very low bar indeed.<p>Still, the idea that he and any Russians worked together on his election has been extensively investigated, and no evidence to that effect has ever been made public. Confused people will cite the &quot;Mueller&quot; report, but those documents also contain no evidence to that effect. If there were something there, we would have seen it by now.')
