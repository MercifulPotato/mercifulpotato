Moralizing everything beyond protocol and rules and law has serious consequences. It does nothing but driving people cynical. Didn&#x27;t the elites learn the stories of USSR political jokes, the stories of how East Germans (and ancient Chinese people) talked to each other via eye contacts only? It&#x27;s not hard to guess what will happen when enough number of people stop trusting the system. For that matter, I&#x27;m so glad that AOC and Td Cruz can agree with each other to probe Robinhood&#x27;s practice.')
