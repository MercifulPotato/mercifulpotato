That happens all of the time. Philosophy is a big, weird fuzzy field because when the ideas get precise enough, they start to get regarded as math or science, and no longer the domain of philosophy. Likewise, sufficiently precise language would simply get reclassified as math, always leaving language &quot;fuzzy&quot; right by fuzzy philosophy.<p>Probably suffering from the blub paradox, but English seems pretty good for conveying ideas. It has a lot of unfortunate spelling and some weird conjugations, but the basic sentence has a subject, object, and verb, and then, it rather promiscuously imports words, which means we have a word for everything, and if we don&#x27;t, we&#x27;ll just take it from any language that does, no problem. This ideal language must have a large, precise vocabulary, like English (though you can argue the &quot;precise&quot; bit). English can really cut through to a point, in my opinion.')
