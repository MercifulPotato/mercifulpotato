It&#x27;s how some of the first American astronauts were made.  It&#x27;s proven tech but just hasn&#x27;t had a practical application in the last half-century.  Some kind of air-dropped passenger ferry could be imagined that gets people to something like a Starship in orbit, or maybe a space hotel.<p>There are a couple of projects along these lines right now, both involving Burt Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites [2,3].<p>Stratolaunch went through several iterations of spacecraft, at one point I believe it was even going to drop a SpaceX rocket!  With Paul Allen&#x27;s passing not sure what the plans are currently.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_American_X-15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_American_X-15</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scaled_Composites_White_Knight...</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scaled_Composites_Stratolaunch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scaled_Composites_Stratolaunch</a>')
