Not the cheapest one yet it ended up giving my macbook problems and lasted about 45 mins. The seller sent a replacement and that didn&#x27;t work. Later I read High Sierra can cause problems for 3rd party replacements?<p>The cheapest batteries on Amazon start at around $30. Is there not a market for $50-60 replacement that you know for sure work?')
