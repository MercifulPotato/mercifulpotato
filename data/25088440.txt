The consensus seems to be shifting from &quot;wear-and-tear model&quot; to a series pre-programmed epigenetic alterations, which, to me at least as a layman, feels more plausible. There&#x27;s a good chance we&#x27;ll see some anti-aging treatments released within our lifetimes. We might end up being the first generation to have reached the longevity escape velocity.<p>The reason it&#x27;s only starting to emerge now is as far as I understand that molecular biology is a relatively new field, and the related technologies simply didn&#x27;t exist not so long ago.')
