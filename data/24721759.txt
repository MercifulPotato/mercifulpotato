At least at the lower end, simply because you can buy more cores&#x2F;threads for roughly the same money - although with a lower clock speed and single core performance.<p>However, I guess we will know more when meaningful benchmarks are released and this ends anyways when the remaining supply of 3900X is sold out.')
