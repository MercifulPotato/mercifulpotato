Instead is uses a rolling hash to cut the input file into variable length chunks and those chunks are added to the chunk storage, and then actual files are constructed from those chunks.<p>Obviously such copies should be done when the files are stable, so either not running or using a snapshot. (If using LVM, this can be arranged easily with any filesystem, except ones that don&#x27;t like getting mounted multiple times..)<p>So while I guess size-related bugs could be there, there&#x27;s no any fundamental property of making the task bigger as the files themselves grow bigger.')
