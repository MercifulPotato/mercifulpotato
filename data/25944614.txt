Bronze tools were better than iron for over a century after iron was commonplace. Toyota has a very conservative engineering culture. And the idea is that it makes for more reliability.<p>The overvaluation of tesla is just an extreme example of the overvaluation of the whole market. Every stock has a decade or two of growth baked into the current price instead of people paying what it is worth today. Tesla probably will be worth its stock price in less than 20 years, but why are we paying for future gains?  What happened to the time value of money?')
