How did that work out for us? Anything improve at all?<p>Facebook is not going to provide any meaningful competition to improve things. An additional player when that player is facebook is utterly meaningless to enhancing customer power at best. More likely speeds the race to the bottom of &quot;we can get away with that&quot; because &quot;this is already being done by facebook and we&#x27;re not doing it as much so it&#x27;s fine.&quot;<p>The odds of looking at it and rationally thinking &quot;I&#x27;ll buy a facebook phone for its enhanced privacy compared to apple and google&quot; are so vanishingly small they are indistinguishable from zero.<p>It&#x27;s like choosing which crime syndicate you want to to pay protection to and thinking it&#x27;s a positive thing there&#x27;s a new crime syndicate with a different dress code now.<p>Anyway these are the companies who are right this minute, spending up big in washington to put your interests well behind theirs because you pay tax and they don&#x27;t, they pay lobbying and political donations and you can&#x27;t compete with that even if you were that dishonest which you probably aren&#x27;t.')
