It&#x27;s definitely modern, but it has little hints of postmodernism in it.<p>I&#x27;ve never taken an art history class, but I do know of Duchamp, and I do think his name is known by anyone with even a passing curiosity with the world of art.<p>The fact that he&#x27;s relatively unknown here says a lot about the users of this site: highly knowledgeable folks, whose knowledge is probably much more specialized that they realize.')
