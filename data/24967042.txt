Our company works in Japanese and English and we typically have a second meeting running in parallel for interpretation. This setup almost works, I say almost because I&#x27;ve yet to find a way of muting the audio in one meeting so I can properly listen to the other. I can&#x27;t leave the first meeting either because often I&#x27;ll also want to see the presentation slides. Currently I&#x27;m working around this by muting my MacBook and joining the second meeting on my phone.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something obvious (or a Chrome plugin that will allow me to mute based on the page URL rather than site). In the unlikely event that a Googler is reading this I&#x27;m not asking for yet another product or complicated new piece of functionality aimed at this specific use case. Just a mute button for audio. Thanks!')
