The affair is over, if for no other reason then their own physical safety, then at least for their financial safety.<p>If income inequality continues and there&#x27;s less and less available jobs for working age men, those men <i>will</i> find something to occupy their time, and I promise you, it won&#x27;t be selling wood carvings on Etsy. I cannot remember where I heard this, and I&#x27;m going to butcher the quote, but it went a little something like, &quot;When you take away a man&#x27;s ability to earn his way, you turn him into a revolutionary.&quot; I&#x27;m almost certain I got that wrong, but that&#x27;s the gist of it. We need a huge jobs program and we need one now. An enormous infrastructure bill would be a good start to calming down a lot of this nonsense. Employed people with disposable income rarely want to upend the system.<p>If we continue down this path, then the cold civil war that we&#x27;re seeing waged mostly on the Internet, but occasionally out in the open, is going to turn into a hot one. And I guarantee you, if things escalate, you&#x27;ll find Russia taking advantage of this by sending groups of their special operators to train these people, because <i>no one in the world</i> has more experience with urban warfare than Russia. And if you think that the American military is entirely unsympathetic to these people, you are starkly and dangerously wrong.<p>EDIT: And yes, I&#x27;ve been hearing &#x2F; reading &#x2F; seeing references to the &quot;boogaloo&quot; for years now. It seems we might be facing it sooner, rather than later.')
