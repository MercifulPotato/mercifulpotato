Looking at Elastic Co&#x27;s financials, they also appear to be competing just fine.<p>If they tell you they&#x27;re not, what they&#x27;re actually saying is that they&#x27;ve chosen a poor business model.<p>In this case, it looks like they&#x27;ve got a perfectly reasonable business, but they&#x27;re upset it&#x27;s not even bigger, and therefore they&#x27;d like a monopoly over ES hosting.<p>&gt; It is monopolistic behavior and that is harmful.<p>The irony is strong here.')
