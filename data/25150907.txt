If I choose one pen, it&#x27;s the Uniball Signo DX 0.38.  That seems enough for cheap paper and precise enough that everything is legible without extreme care.<p>If I were doing math I would prefer to use the 0.28 version and make sure my paper is good.  Anything smaller and it feels like I&#x27;m drawing and not writing.  I think the 0.2&#x27;s are mostly used for art.')
