You have a physiological process that manages economic use of glucose. When it registers a deposit, it permits a withdrawal&#x2F;release into your blood, where it can be delivered to your muscles and mind for energy.<p>The problem with sugar, is when you have excessive sugar in the blood. Excessive sugar is potentially lethal, because glucose can cross the blood-brain barrier. the brain has a protein like substance, chemically similar to egg white, and when you mix too much sugar with egg white, you get meringue. meringue brain is bad. so in healthy individuals, we get insulin spikes, to flush the glucose from our blood when we have too much. sure it robs you of energy but it saves your brain. in type 2 diabetics their insulin safety mechanism can’t be relied on.<p>If you’re healthy you don’t need to worry about extra glucose released by your body from its stores. instead be reassured that you understand why you feel more perky when your drink is sweetened. But if you have sweetener in your tea, and then you have a sugary snack, that’s worse than the sugary snack alone. You’re more likely to generate harmful levels of blood glucose because your body will preemptively elevate blood glucose before you even get to the snack.<p>moral of the story, don’t eat food high in real sugar or flour. as always.')
