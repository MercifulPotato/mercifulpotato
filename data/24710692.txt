So I think it is disingenuous to talk about <i>people in power</i> and then apply that to <i>people in general</i> when these two have different behaviors. The point of democracies are to increase the robustness of governments to help discourage abuse of those in power while providing mechanisms to remove those that do abuse that power. Obviously this can be improved, but that&#x27;s a different conversation all together.')
