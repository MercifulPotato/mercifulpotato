Just like any other guy looking to land his first software developer job, I went through the grind of practicing leetcode and taking notes to be interview ready.<p>In that process, I ended up creating flashcards for myself that covers essential concepts asked in an interview. I penned down stuff like Time complexity to several algorithms, and a summary of how some underlying structure of data structures like hash tables, linked lists, trees, etc functions.<p>I found them valuable during my coding interview prep.<p>Paul Grahm mentioned in one of his essays that the best validation of the product is people paying for it. So, Iâ€™ve set up a website where users can preorder to get these flashcards.<p>My goal is to touch 75 pre-orders! Right now, I&#x27;m at 27. If I could reach my goal then I could very well be on my way to print and sell it as a real product.<p>This is something I built to scratch my itch and I feel there could be many like me who would find this helpful.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know what you think about this')
