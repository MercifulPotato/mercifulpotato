I bought a usb-c audio interface and it came with cubase, and my midi controller came with ableton.  They are light versions but they get the job done.  It&#x27;s enough that you can at least compare DAWs.<p>It&#x27;s not free but I like to plug renoise whenever I can.  It&#x27;s more of a tracker than a traditional DAW, scriptable in lua.  If you are a programmer you might like trackers.')
