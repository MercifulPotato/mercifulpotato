Item(by='philosopher1234', descendants=None, kids=[24845223, 24845253, 24845501], score=None, time=1603260702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845177, text='This is a misinterpretation of what is meant by the efficient market hypothesis. &quot;a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible&quot;. What they&#x27;re saying is that the market correctly sets share prices based on available information. To say that the market is considering available information is tautological and not interesting. The EMH as its popularly understood is not just &quot;the market considers information&quot; (again, not an interesting claim) but &quot;the market considers all information and synthesizes it correctly&quot; which is deflating to hopeful investors and trivially false. My examples are contradictions to this hypothesis.')
