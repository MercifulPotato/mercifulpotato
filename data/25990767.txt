They typically don&#x27;t output logs and metrics, so you have no choice to pray that someone looks at your support ticket and clicks their internal system&#x27;s &quot;fix it for this customer&quot; button.<p>I&#x27;ll also say that I&#x27;m interested in ubiquitous mTLS so that you don&#x27;t have to isolate teams with VPCs and opaque proxies.  I don&#x27;t think we have widely-available technology around yet that eliminates the need for what Slack seems to have here, but trusting the network has always seemed like a bad idea to me, and this shows how a workaround can go wrong.  (Of course, to avoid issues like the confused deputy problem, which Slack suffered from, you need some service to issue certs to applications as they scale up that will be accepted by services that it is allowed to talk to and rejected by all other services.  In that case, this postmortem would have said &quot;we scaled up our web frontends, but the service that issues them certificates to talk to the backend exploded in a big ball of fire, so we were down.&quot;  Ya just can&#x27;t win ;)')
