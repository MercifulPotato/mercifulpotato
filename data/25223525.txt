My oldest son has the same thing. It is a Dread Disease.<p>When I was getting divorced, I did not want to date men who were likely to be carriers because it&#x27;s homozygous recessive, so if the father is a carrier there is a 50 percent chance the child will be a carrier and a 50 percent chance they will have CF. I am incapable of producing a &quot;normal&quot; child (and didn&#x27;t know that when I was having kids).<p>My quick and dirty genetics test to drastically reduce the odds that I was dating a carrier boiled down to &quot;No White Men Allowed.&quot; Other ethnicities are dramatically less likely to be carriers.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t sound silly to me at all that you could take one look at someone and infer some stats about the odds of their genetic risks for a specific category.')
