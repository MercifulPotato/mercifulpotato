You&#x27;d hardly see any load for the real culprit itself but those other connected components may run hot.<p>This user says their WindowServer runs hot. Some Chrome-related software may have entered a state where it accidentally DoS&#x27;es the WindowServer either due to a bug in google software or a bug in WindowServer that google software triggers, at least in the system configurations particular to this user.')
