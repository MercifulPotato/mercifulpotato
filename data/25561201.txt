People want to live near London&#x2F;SF&#x2F;NYC for work and maybe because they like cities but the minimum for a place there is like 5-10x salary (or worse...)<p>How would that apply to the stock market? I suppose BRK.A has never split and now AMZN is getting a little large if you can&#x27;t buy fractional shares a la RobinHood so then I guess the only parallel would be if we saw some huge stepwise increase followed by a market wide plateau (but no drop). This would cement people&#x27;s positions of the invested before&#x2F;after pandemic I suppose')
