And advertising has been driven by AI for the last two decades. You can&#x27;t do proper ctr, conversion, bid, etc. predictions otherwise.<p>edit: Even search uses state of the art language models right now but I assume the gains are incremental. Advertising on the other hand is based on predicting the CTR and the gains from doing that versus naive bid approaches are 40%+.')
