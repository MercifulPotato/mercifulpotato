Dr Michal Kosinski and Dr David Stillwell of Cambridge University pioneered the use of Facebook data for psychometric research with a Facebook quiz application called the MyPersonality Quiz.<p>Aleksandar Kogan was a lecturer at Cambridge who then built his own app based on Stilwell&#x27;s and Kosinki&#x27;s app and work. Aleksandar then turned around and sold his version to SCL - the parent of Cambridge Analytica. And the reason that Cambridge Analytica wanted his app was because it worked under the social networkâ€™s pre-2014 term of service which allowed app developers to harvest data not only from the people who installed the app as well those people&#x27;s friends.<p>Stillwell also denied Kogan&#x27;s request for access to to his and Kosinskis myPersonality dataset. So No the Cambridge Analytica data did not come from Cabridge University or the Psychometrics Center.<p>The NYU Ad Observatory&#x27;s data is completely public and the intended audience of that data is journalists and researchers doing analysis of online political advertising. This is the polar opposite of clandestinely harvesting user data in order to manipulate people.<p>So no it&#x27;s not &quot;exactly&quot; the same situation but rather the exact opposite.')
