Maybe just say &quot;Happy Hannukah&quot; on one particular day? That serves the purpose of inclusion well enough. If someone objects to saying &quot;Happy Hannukah&quot; at all, then just ignore them I guess? That seems to be the status quo already.<p>I don&#x27;t really care about placing blame. My objections are often because I don&#x27;t feel that liberal ideas actually achieve what they claim to be for. I&#x27;m often for the stated ideal, but against the implementation. In this case I feel that the implementation is not very inclusive but does seem exclusive, and it could be done a lot better.')
