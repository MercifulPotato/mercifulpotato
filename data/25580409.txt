(coming from the left side of the European political spectrum for what it&#x27;s worth) for a few reasons. The first one is that I think work is a fundamental aspect of personal life and people feel deeply rewarded for being compensated for it. UBI is underpinned by a sort of Wall-E philosophy of human nature. It in a weird way presents itself as humanistic but is deeply apolitical and anti-social.<p>Secondly it creates dependency between receivers and givers. I&#x27;d rather empower workers collectively than make people dependent on welfare. This, in contrast to UBI is I think viable across the spectrum and actually what people want.<p>I think UBI rests on a sort of naive utilitarianism that overrates material equality and underestimates what&#x27;s wrong with the system as it is and what really makes people angry and pessimistic. For that reason I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to get a political majority.')
