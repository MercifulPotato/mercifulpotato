Only after bankrupting him with legal fees, which even forced him to sell his home, did they relent.<p>Just to clarify here... Michael Flynn was retained by a Turkish firm to try and run PR against a cleric that had fled to the US - he was not &quot;reaching out&quot; or &quot;establishing open lines&quot; - he was employed as a hatchet man against an American resident while employed as a National Security Advisor.  When you take a cabinet level position in the US government it&#x27;s generally accepted that you sever all foreign financial ties.')
