Item(by='drblah', descendants=None, kids=[25979453], score=None, time=1612096432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978114, text='A few weeks ago, I tried doing this with the LADSPA version of RNNoise and ALSA, but couldn&#x27;t get it to work reliably.<p>I have also experimented with NoiseTorch which routes the microphone through LADSPA using Pulseaudio but it didn&#x27;t work reliably either. The biggest problem with this is that Pulseaudio will load one CPU thread 100% even when no audio input. This makes it a deal breaker for laptops.<p>I will definitely check this out. RNNoise is truly amazing tech, but it is not as accessible as I would like. The best use if it is in the Mumble client where it is an optional setting.<p>It is a shame Nvidia has taken over this space completely with RTX voice. RNNoise does a comparable job without the need for an Nvidia GPU. But I guess it is because RNNoise is just not as easy to setup.')
