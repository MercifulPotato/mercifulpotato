Cyberpunk was the extrapolation of this into a world defined by the trends of the 1980s: accelerating technology that dehumanizes, unchecked globalization, runaway capitalism that leaves a permanent underclass to make do with the castoffs of the elite. Its enduring popularity is no doubt due to the fact that these trends are very much with us today.<p>Offshoots adapted this to the fears of other eras: Steampunk replaced accelerating solid-state technology with industrial-revolution mechanical technology. Dieselpunk traded it for the terrifying innovations in mechanized warfare of the early 20th Century.<p>Egalitarian societies living in clean cities powered by sustainable energy are not punk; they are worlds that would lack the need for a punk subculture. They <i>are</i> hopeful, utopian visions â€“ and just as dystopias warn, the value of utopias is to inspire.<p>Maybe &quot;solar utopianism&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound as cool as &quot;solarpunk.&quot; But calling it what it is will let us appreciate it for what it is.')
