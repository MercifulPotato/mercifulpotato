Item(by='dschuetz', descendants=None, kids=[24932798, 24933411], score=None, time=1603991550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932130, text='&quot;Multi-Screen&quot; is too broad a term. I have caught myself sometimes drifting in thoughts because there was something else going on other than work. Having two different agendas and juggling them using two or three different <i>work environments</i> is the attention killer for me.<p>As consequence I have bought a KVM switch and hooked it up to my main screen. Anything else not related to the current agenda gets shut off, or muted, or plainly ignored no matter what happens there. Works so far for me.')
