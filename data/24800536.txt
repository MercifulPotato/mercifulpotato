What if instead of an assassination, the next hard-right-wing President gets hit by a dart laced with psilocybin? What if someone finds a pill that makes you more approving of authoritarianism, and an authoritarian government makes taking that pill mandatory?<p>This is science fiction fodder, and yet it&#x27;s all real.
