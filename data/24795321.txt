Notionally, it&#x27;s similar to having multiple &quot;views&quot; in a MVC architecture, and allowing each of those views to adapt to the capabilities of the device displaying the view.<p>The article linked here talks at length about concurrent edits and the data structures necessary to handle work by multiple application instances.  I feel this is (potentially) unnecessary effort.  Rather than build applications to support concurrent edits by fat clients, use thin clients that all speak to the same instance of the application with its singular state.  Concurrent work would therefore be resolved in real-time by a single application instance in a first-come-first-served basis, without any complex data structures or clever coding.<p>The root of so much complexity in modern computing is that all of us have multiple application instances when virtually nobody actually wants this.  I don&#x27;t want a separate email client on every device.  I want a single email client that I can attach views to and interact with from anywhere.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiamat.tsotech.com&#x2F;pao" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiamat.tsotech.com&#x2F;pao</a>')
