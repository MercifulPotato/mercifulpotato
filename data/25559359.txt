Keep taking the pills, Mark.<p>Onto more positive points, whilst I have no doubt that ageism exists in our industry, there are also companies with a more enlightened view of age and experience.<p>I tend to prefer hiring people with more experience, in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, when I can. I particularly like those who&#x27;ve worked for a variety of different companies during their careers (avoids institutionalisation).<p>Some of the benefits of more experienced staff:<p>- Tend to take a more rounded view of what they&#x27;re working on, and find it easier to see different perspectives<p>- Related to this they seem better able to focus on delivering business and customer value<p>- Again, related: less interested in tech for tech&#x27;s sake, and less prone to chasing fads<p>- Further, related: less idealistic, more pragmatic<p>- Better social skills; easier to get along with<p>- Less emotional: more mature and settled<p>- Better able to manage stress and work&#x2F;life balance<p>- Lower sense of entitlement<p>- Have often picked up mentoring and coaching skills that can help develop others<p>Of course, there are always exceptions for both experienced and inexperienced staff (and we&#x27;re very fortunate&#x2F;have been very careful about our less experienced hires), but these are benefits I&#x27;ve often observed.<p>As I&#x27;ve already implied, we hire people at all levels of experience (with the exception, so far, of fresh grads), but having a good number of experienced staff is I think one of the great strengths of our team, and I view our senior staff as our greatest asset. They&#x27;re very good, for example, at helping to develop less experienced team members, or wrangling difficult and sensitive issues.<p>(Note that I haven&#x27;t talked much about technical skills here. Partly this is because we work with a deliberately boring stack - I want us to build great, cutting edge products with solid, reliable, boring tech, not be constantly hindered from building by the problems of the bleeding edge. Mostly it&#x27;s because, having had to pick up different languages and technologies over the years, and having worked with plenty of developers who&#x27;ve done the same, I don&#x27;t generally regard specific tech skills as <i>that</i> important. We use SQL Server, for example. But if you&#x27;ve worked with <i>any</i> relational database for any decent length of time during your career you&#x27;ll get on fine with it, regardless of whether that&#x27;s Postgres, Oracle, or even MySQL or SQLite. Likewise it&#x27;s not that hard to learn to query MongoDB or ElasticSearch, although the latter <i>is</i> a bit nuts, even though the syntax is different to SQL. It&#x27;s not different enough to get in a tizzy about, and I really wish recruiters would wise up to this. Some have, most haven&#x27;t, in my experience.)')
