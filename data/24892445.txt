For all we know, the Chinese may have given it to the NYT, as the NYT never bothered to tell us how they got their hands onto them. But Twitter did nothing about them.<p>If Twitter was honest, every time the figure $750 appeared in a Tweet it should be blocked.<p>If you feel my statement above is absurd, that just shows how normalized the double standard has become.<p>ps I think there should be a law that all Presidents disclose tax returns and financial information. If you run for President you deserve a lesser right for privacy. It&#x27;s not about that though. Twitter shouldn&#x27;t censor based on its opinions.')
