This is simply because there seems to be way too much background in this book. It basically spans 4 topics:<p>- Cognitive (neuro)psychology<p>- Economics &#x2F; finance<p>- chapter 4 to 7 seem to be about software engineering<p>- Statistics<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll take a read, but not because I want to read about evidence-based software engineering. It&#x27;s much more because it seems that you&#x27;re connecting a lot of different areas together and I want to see how you do it. The second reason is because I happen to know a lot about these specific areas as well :)')
