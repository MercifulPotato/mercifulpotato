(The birth of modern advertising occurs around the same time.)<p>2 - Simply having substantial control of mass communication is not enough if establishment views, and version of news, are countered by alternative views and news, in context of a political class that no longer enjoys public confidence.<p>Madison avenue pretty much is built on #1. Collapse of USSR, itself a master of #1 technologies, could not be prevented by mere state propaganda (#2).<p>During the entirety of Cold War, no one jammed Soviet and setellite propaganda (such as Radio Moscow). At the same time, Soviets would jam the signal of Western mass communication organs (such as BBC).<p>In the 90s, the political class in this country caved to capital class and previously illegal consolidations of media, finance, and banking were made permissible again. The degredation in the quality of journalism (and even cultural products) visibly began at that point (if you were paying attention).<p>Now, having bet on #1 effects during 20 years of entirely questionable (and in times illegal) behavior by the entire political class of US -- 9&#x2F;11, Iraq wars, and the collapse of the financial sector in &#x27;08, and role of the &quot;journalism&quot; in covering these events -- in a political environment that gradually brought us to American &#x27;Pravda&#x27; moments, #2 phenomena raised its ugly head. Alt-news was a reaction to bullshit-news of American &quot;journalism&quot;. (Hi &quot;Judtih&quot;! ...). It is also quite necessary to point out that <i>many</i> of these mushrooms of American night spewing strange theories smell like intelligence service cointelpro.<p><i>We need to reimpose the pre-90s restrictions on consolidations in Banking, Finance, and Media and reinstate the regulatory &#x27;firewalls&#x27;</i> that protected the integrity of American political system prior to 90s. A regulatory regime that saw the West face world-class propaganda by Soviets with aplumb and broadcasted the demise of that source of &quot;misinformation&quot; to a world wide audiance, without ever having to resort to ham fisted censorship (with possible exception of the &#x27;red scare&#x27; period and it&#x27;s version of &#x27;cancel culture&#x27;).')
