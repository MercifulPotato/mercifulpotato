Do you know what would have happened if the majority of the population lived in those states? You’d have a racist executive branch for decades. Popular vote working exactly as you want, but you wouldn’t be singing the popular vote tune when what’s popular is not stuff you believe in.<p>Just some quick googling, not a vetted source:\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inside.sfuhs.org&#x2F;dept&#x2F;history&#x2F;US_History_reader&#x2F;Chapter5&#x2F;slavestatedemog.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inside.sfuhs.org&#x2F;dept&#x2F;history&#x2F;US_History_reader&#x2F;Chapt...</a><p>Those populations looked similar and could have gone either way earlier (hindsight being 20&#x2F;20, major industrial centers could have emerged in the south). The popular vote in that case may have never led to a Lincoln.<p>In other words, just because there’s a giant population in South with certain regional values, doesn’t mean you get to win every election. The same is true for coastal cities in America now. I do think certain states need more electoral votes added at this point like New York and California.<p>The same way you can fuck them with the popular vote today is the same way they can fuck you with it in the future.')
