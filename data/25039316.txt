I’m relatively rusty on FE, have only worked on one website in the last 4-5 years. Now I’m building out a personal site and I decided to just skip the design app and go straight to the browser. It’s a breath of fresh air. I could always make my way with Photoshop or Illustrator or Sketch, but it never quite translated the way I’d hope. I’d end up making disappointing concessions that were in the original design but just couldn’t work in the browser. No more! I start and end with what the browser is capable of, and I know instantly how the end result is going to square up to my expectations. I don’t know what the current design app state of the art can offer, but I don’t really feel the need to find out.<p>Of course, if I find myself working with designers again I won’t necessarily have that luxury. But it’s a much nicer environment for my personal work than anything I’ve tried.')
