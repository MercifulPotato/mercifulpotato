I&#x27;ve also spoken with other non-coders looking to get involved who felt just as stymied as I did.<p>Yesterday, I submitted a pull request to correct a typo in the documentation of a open source project. I first spent a lot of time digging through stuff to figure out what I should do (pull request? submit an issue? something else?). A pull request seemed to be the right answer, but I was hesitant to do that for various reasons -- partly because in my mind that&#x27;s for updating <i>code</i> -- and when I have asked around, no one has ever told me &quot;Oh, you can get involved as a non-coder by submitting a pull request to correct a typo.&quot;<p>When non-coders say things like &quot;Who do I talk with?&quot; or talk about cultural barriers, people try to be nice and assure us &quot;We aren&#x27;t all hateful to non-coders. Come join our email list for this thing!&quot; And it&#x27;s the wrong answer.<p>The correct answer is &quot;None of that matters. You can submit a pull request if you find a typo or other small issue and that&#x27;s the best way for a non-coder to get involved. It&#x27;s small. There&#x27;s no one to talk to. There&#x27;s no email list to join. Just submit the pull request. They will either approve it and merge it with the master or they won&#x27;t and no one will bite your head off about it. And now you are contributing to open source. Voila!&quot;<p>If you want non-coders to get involved in updating your documentation and so forth, you need to find some way to let them know that &quot;All you have to do is submit a pull request.&quot; The current approach misdirects people like me into trying to &quot;make connections&quot; to people and all this garbage that is completely irrelevant, counterproductive and a waste of time. It actively interferes with answering the question of &quot;Where do I start?&quot;<p>You start with a pull request for something small, like a typo. Done. Now you are &quot;a contributor.&quot;')
