The alternatives are Ford, Chevy, Honda and Toyota. While I fully understand that Tesla is no titan of the little man and Musk is a <i>very</i> flawed man, compared to the titans of industry and the sins of the past that these companies are responsible for, it&#x27;s a little odd that so much vitriol gets thrown toward Tesla and not these companies who are, ever so slowly, switching from diesel and gas powered automobiles.<p>I haven&#x27;t even mentioned how Tesla is the only company that doesn&#x27;t sponsor at least one (I think they all sponsor multiple) traditionally powered racing teams, whose development goes into premium powered, traditional gas powered automobiles. Plus the advertisement of said vehicles.')
