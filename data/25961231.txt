The claim is that you don&#x27;t know whether a idea is good until it&#x27;s been executed on (which seems plausible, and at any rate you haven&#x27;t contradicted that), and that good ideas are rare, so most ideas are crap (which you yourself just asserted). Thus, the expected value of a given idea (absent execution) is very low, aka cheap.')
