We <i>do</i> need the industry to shift towards leveraging code, APIs, working with other teams, building alongside developers, etc.<p>And that&#x27;s all DevSecOps is really saying.<p>Again, wish we could all just ditch the term, but I honestly think it&#x27;s here to stay and we need to look past the marketing bullshit to see what&#x27;s in front of us.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devsecops.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devsecops.org&#x2F;</a>')
