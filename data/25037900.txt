To me, as an admitted <i>Free</i> software person, the <i>Open</i> software movement looks like it was designed to undermine the Free movement.  I don&#x27;t think it actually was deliberately designed that way, just that it looks that way in hindsight.<p>I also don&#x27;t really get the point of <i>Open</i> licenses because you could always already just give away your code, so to me it makes it seem like the only folks really benefiting from OSS are the people using the code but not sharing their improvements and the people (often the same people) who want to lock you out of [editing the software in] their products.<p>&gt;  idea of causing social change by coding free software<p>FWIW, that also seems to me to be a later gloss.  If anything, computers and software are new enough that it&#x27;s not so much a matter of social <i>change</i> as it is of founding new social norms around these (physical&#x2F;virtual) machines.  RMS just wanted to edit the software in his printer.  Look at the restrictive B.S. that tractor makers are foisting on farmers to see the relevance.  Is the idea of being able to fix your own tractor a &quot;social change&quot;?  :)')
