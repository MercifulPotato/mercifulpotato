Item(by='martamorena918', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608271120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459916, text='This is akin to legalizing all drugs and selling them in every grocery store with huge ads of George Clooney puffing the magic dragon... And then complaining that everyone is an addict.<p>American food is a drug. And by any comparison much more harmful than alcohol, smoking and weed combined. However try to tell a normal person to eat a healthy diet (aka, don&#x27;t be an addict) and they will hate you for it. Or actually, let&#x27;s start with &quot;healthy diet&quot;. What does that even mean? The only proven healthy diet I know of is AIP and related diets. However, it takes substantial mental strengths and abstinence from social gatherings to get going. I know, because I am on it. It completely changed my life, why is the only reason I can sell my brain to hate all the &quot;normal&quot; (addictive) food.<p>The only way to eat healthy is to realize other food is making you sick and let your brain stop yourself from eating it. The other way around it doesn&#x27;t work. You can&#x27;t force yourself to eat healthy; you need to fully buy into it and live it and want to eat healthy from the inside out.<p>To me, this problem is much worse than drug addiction. Drug addiction is frowned upon. Drugs are largely inaccessible, they are expensive and mostly prohibited. You know it&#x27;s bad to be an addict. You know stronger drugs literally destroy your body.<p>Bad food on the other hand... All ads want to make you eat it. Your family eats it, your friends eat it, everyone eats it and wants you to eat it. And it destroys your body over decades, making it hard to connect the &quot;old age&quot; at 40 with your eating habits... I guess I am getting old, huh? Let&#x27;s order some pizza. It is frowned upon to eat healthy. Healthy food is hard to get (you need to cook it yourself). Healthy food is expensive... See some similarities here? There is an inversion. When it comes to food, the drug is the easily accessible, socially accepted product, while the healthy ones are moved to the margins, just like real drugs are. Crazy stuff.')
