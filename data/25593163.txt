Wind and solar are fast, reliably deployed, and cheaper than any fuel based energy source. In the US alone, the pipeline has 174GW planned for deployment through 2024, however we will deploy far more than that because planning and deployment takes far less than 5 years for renewables:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spglobal.com&#x2F;marketintelligence&#x2F;en&#x2F;news-insights&#x2F;latest-news-headlines&#x2F;us-renewable-pipeline-poised-to-add-172-5-gw-through-2024-61902543" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spglobal.com&#x2F;marketintelligence&#x2F;en&#x2F;news-insights...</a><p>In contrast we have only 2 reactors, 2.2GW of nuclear under construction, they are more than 2x behind schedule, 3x over budget. There were an additional 2 reactors started at the same time with the same design, but they were abandoned due to construction difficulties and budget overruns.<p>We <i>cant</i> build nuclear in any sort of effective way. Wind and solar get deployed all the time, are always on time and always on budget. They are our only hope for decarbonizing our grid, nuclear offers us zero help.')
