I don&#x27;t think there would be enough overlap that adding touch to the mac would reduce tablet sales... totally different experiences in a lot of ways.<p>I&#x27;ve had touch on my last 2 Thinkpads and find that I utilize it quite a bit. I haven&#x27;t noticed a ton of fingerprints, but I also take care of my equipment (probably a little more fastidiously than most...). Having the ability to do a little pen work in certain apps has been clutch, and if I wanted to utilize the pen or touch more... I would get a more dedicated device(e.g. Thinkpad Yoga or Surface Pro). Feel like this would be similar workflow in the Apple world... Macbook with some helpful touch... iPad when you need to focus on touch...')
