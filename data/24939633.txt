Item(by='Larrikin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604038245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24938734, text='Its a shame what happened to PF Changs. They had perfected American Chinese food, which really seems to be under appreciated as its own type of food. The typical place might have good Mongolian beef but then just buy the cheapest worst chicken so General Tso&#x27;s is garbage. Another place might actually care about properly frying their chicken and have incredible Orange chicken but just not care at all about their lo mein. PF Changs used to have one of the best versions of everything you could find at a typical American Chinese restaurant.<p>But at some point they were bought out by a company that was intent on squeezing every penny out of the place and didn&#x27;t care about quality. The sauces changed for the lettuce wraps to obviously cheaper ingredients, then the waiters stopped even making the sauces. Prices of the all the dishes went up as the serving sizes shrunk. Then the quality just went to shit.<p>When I lived in Asia, I could obviously get amazing authentic Chinese food. But, whenever I visited home I would always get a turkey sub first (turkey is harder to find than a good sub sandwich in general) and then American Chinese food. PF Changs used to easily fill that niche and was ruined by a bunch of terrible people who I&#x27;m sure got promotions and now are ruining some other restaurant while increasing profits for the owners.')
