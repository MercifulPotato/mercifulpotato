When you have small farms local is you, and remote your neighbors who you walk to. When you have large enough farms you can generate enough surplus that the world cares - and they are generating enough that they can afford to play nice. Small farmers in general don&#x27;t generate enough surplus that they can feed each other across the distance of a continent.<p>Support from a galactic cluster is nice in SciFi, but in reality space is too big. It is questionable if Earth&#x2F;Venus could support each other, as our orbits are often too misaligned to do anything in time. (the fast trip to mars involves Venus so things are even worse).  Going between stars - forget it, by the time we find out about a problem they are dead or have survived.')
