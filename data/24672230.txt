But if I want to respond to a text, the watch is useless unless I just want one of the canned responses like “Ok”.<p>It is handy for working out.<p>As an actual watch, I have one of the older ones without an always-on screen. So when I worked in an office, I actually went back to an old-fashioned watch because it’s hard to discreetly turn on the Apple Watch screen. So I would just wear the Apple Watch when working out.  Now that I work from home I wear the Apple Watch all day but I don’t get a ton of utility out of it. I do check the outside temperature occasionally but for that I could just open my front door.<p>Overall, if I knew this thing would be only as marginally useful as it is I’m not sure I’d buy one. The always-on face would make it more useful but I’m not eager to go spend even more money on this category.')
