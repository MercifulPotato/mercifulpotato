I mean they might want to experiment on a new product idea. Instead of hiring or allocating a team for it. I can help them build their MVP in the quickest way possible for a reasonable amount of money.<p>- If so will they be willing to pay like $50k-$75k for 2-3 months of work?<p>- Have anyone doing this already? How we name these roles? Contract MVP Builders?<p>How can we approach this?<p>If anyone interested please reach out to me I can share my works and talk more about it.')
