The thing about &quot;normal science&quot; is that begins with more or less verified theories and extends their theory and practice - until they fail, reach the edge of the theories, and the science community must search for alternative hypotheses. Machine learning is more working with a bunch of practices, rules of thumb and suggestions for doing practices. These can&#x27;t really fail since they&#x27;re roughly repeating themselves in different domains. The problem is that can be done forever and you never need new theories or approaches.<p>So I&#x27;d claim we&#x27;re really at the situation right now, at the exploring new ideas, the &quot;crisis of science&quot; phase where essentially people have to start brainstorming (and not all ideas are good here either but they need to be somewhat original).<p>All this is using Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s Structure Of Scientific Revolutions model very roughly.')
