Let&#x27;s take a simple example and say your cloud account is doing 2 things - compute &amp; storage.<p>Compute is an active resource, when you exceed your budget it can be automatically shutdown.<p>Storage is a passive resource, when you exceed your budget it can be automatically....deleted? That&#x27;s almost always the wrong action.<p>Providing fine-grained cost limits help some, as passive resources usually don&#x27;t have massive cost spikes while active resources do, so you can better &quot;protect&quot; your passive resources by setting more aggressive cost limits on the active resources.<p>This quickly gets more complicated. Another example is most monitoring services are a combination of active (actual metric monitoring) and passive (metric history) resources. A cost limit on that monitoring service likely won&#x27;t provide sub-service granularity, mostly depending on whether the service even has different charges for monitoring vs history.<p>Oh, also, even for a passive resource like storage, you <i>also</i> have active resource charges whenever you upload&#x2F;download your data.<p>Ugh, what a mess. The best thing to do is pay attention to your spending, just like you do with your personal &amp; corporate budget.')
