Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603406061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24862816, text='I was looking for an Aeron B with Posturefit ($120 aftermarket) and swivel armrests (with tab adjusters rather than the gears; gears mean the chair is pre-2005). That combination isn&#x27;t that easy to find in the used market. I was also looking for something closer to the $400 end rather than the $600 end.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the Leap V2 is actually better than the Aeron but for what I paid for it ($300), it had the armrests and the lumbar support that I was looking for, so I went with it. Aesthetically, the Aeron looks way cooler -- the Leap V2 looks like any other office chair.')
