I know that it is a commonplace assumption, but feels to me as though one is assuming one has more information than is justified. Coming back to the article&#x27;s &quot;economist&#x27;s wager&quot;, is it rational to bet with even odds on something you know nothing about? If the assumption is interpreted as a testable hypothesis about outcomes, why would complete ignorance imply any particular result? On the other hand, if it is interpreted strictly as a statement about one&#x27;s knowledge, why present it exactly as if one had sufficient knowledge of the situation to know that the probability is 0.5? Maybe the author will have an answer in part 2.')
