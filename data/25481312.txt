It&#x27;s an attempt to paint me as a hypocrite and therefore not acting rationally. It&#x27;s flawed reasoning.<p>I invite you to consider:<p>If my stated goal is to increase the tax on wealthiest folks with the intent of distributing more to the lower class and reducing wealth inequality.<p>Should I:<p>a) Spend 100% of my surplus income on gifts to the tax authority<p>or<p>b) Spend 100% of my surplus income on organizations that will organize community efforts to achieve my goal.<p>It&#x27;s a concept called the &#x27;opportunity cost&#x27; -- option A is acting in the spirit of my goal, but does nothing to achieve my goal. If I am a rational player (and I&#x27;d like to believe I am), to achieve my goals it&#x27;s considerably more effective for me to spend my money giving to charities that align with my objective.<p>Therefore, I spend my surplus income on community organizing, land trusts, and other efforts that will build support for my goals.<p><i>Edit:</i><p>This is the same reason why I don&#x27;t ask people who care about the national debt to just open their pocketbooks. If that&#x27;s a cause you care about, I&#x27;d expect you to advocate for it and give your time&#x2F;money towards groups that make it happen. I happen to think it&#x27;s a ludicrous thing to care about.<p>We can aggressively disagree about policies and still agree that we are acting in a rational way respective to our worldviews. There is room for both of our opinions here, but we should be able to discuss them without relying on these sorts of goofy strawmen.')
