Had there been no mainstream coverage of qanon it would have died there, but sites started talking about it which drew the crazies over to 4 and then 8chan until the Christchurch massacre caused 8chan&#x27;s shutdown and rebirth. Qanon is nothing more than a story of loonies that should be pitied and irresponsible journalism.')
