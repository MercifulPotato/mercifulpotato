The more you learn, the more productive you are (and sometimes more informed, thanks to data visualizations).<p>OneNote (desktop) and Excel are the only two pieces of Microsoft Office that I regularly continue to use. They&#x27;re the only reason I license it.<p>Microsoft Word after I graduated rarely gets used (typesetting? I don&#x27;t even print!), and while I understand the value of Microsoft Access, I feel like using it is investing effort into a dead-end (i.e. people want online&#x2F;real-time reports, not locked into a desktop software). PowerPoint, at least where I work, is almost a meme (as in &quot;Power Point meeting&quot; is a pejorative implies waste of time meeting).<p>As to Excel: Hopefully it won&#x27;t take another 35 years for them to fix CSV opening so it doesn&#x27;t auto-format long numbers into scientific notion or dates, then cause unrecoverable data loss when you save. If you don&#x27;t know what the data format is DON&#x27;T GUESS!')
