Once in a while you see a car with like 5 different badges for trim, performance and whatnot on the back, and you think, &quot;that looks tacky&quot;.<p>The only thing that&#x27;s getting in the way of an even cleaner look is that the manufacturer badges are getting massive. I don&#x27;t need to know at 50 meters that the car in front of me is a VW.')
