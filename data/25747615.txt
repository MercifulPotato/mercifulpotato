Item(by='legacynl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610463108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747316, text='&gt;The success of iMessage and the entire Apple ecosystem in the US proves that a walled garden is exactly what people trust and want and are willing to pay handsomely for the privilege of being part of one.<p>People don&#x27;t care about open, closed or whatever. They care about being able to send a message to others. If only 10 % of your friends are on signal, but 100% are on iMessage, most will just use iMessage.<p>So the success of iMessage (and the apple stonewall) is arguably just the success of the iPhone.<p>&gt; Seriously, get out of the tech bubble for a while and see that most people have no idea what computer brand they have or what their OS is called and they don&#x27;t even care. They just want to click the internet icon and start browsing memes, play candy crush or watch youtube.<p>You&#x27;re basically making exactly my point. They don&#x27;t care, they want to be able to browse, message, play, watch stuff, etc. They also wouldn&#x27;t care if their messaging app would support different protocols, as long as they&#x27;re just able to easily message their friends.<p>&gt; Interoperability&#x2F;Federation is something the average user doesn&#x27;t understand and won&#x27;t even bother too as long as their basic needs are already comfortably fulfilled.<p>This is why it would be incredibly helpful for a big app to start supporting different protocols. If signal becomes THE app for connecting with friends (no matter if they use icq, irc, email, jabber, etc), it might come to a point where people rather use Signal, because that&#x27;s the app that can reach ALL your friends.<p>At this point, iMessage would either die, or also start to support open protocols. (Or more likely: Apple will ban messaging apps from the app-store)')
