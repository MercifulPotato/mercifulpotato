The &quot;societal&quot; purpose of patents is to promote innovation. That&#x27;s really the yardstick by which most of the conversation around patents needs to be measured - does this help or hinder overall innovation.<p>There are also moral&#x2F;philosophical arguments for or against patents, but I think the majority consider the societal impact to be the most important.<p>The <i>mechanism</i> by which patents achieve this is by giving a temporary monopoly to the inventor. It <i>also</i> requires the inventor to disclose, in detail, how their innovation works ; that&#x27;s part of the tradeoff - the innovator gets a temporary monopoly, but society benefits by the innovator not hoarding it as a secret. This should actually encourage progress by others, in the long run.')
