If so, I disagree. HTML and CSS are all you need, with some vanilla JS. For example, HN users love the fact that it’s fast and responsive. It doesn’t use huge toolchains of React or whatever<p>Using huge tool chains is making the internet slower and more painful for devs &amp; users.<p>But if you’re talking about dev tool chains for templating, I follow the “less is more” here too. Some templating tools can speed a dev up, but learning a dozen tools is really a waste of time')
