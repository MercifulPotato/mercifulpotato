Moreover, they&#x27;ve even made it worse by &#x27;exaggerating&#x27; the temperature by quoting it in degrees Fahrenheit in stead of Celsius (using Fahrenheit is a no-no in science).<p>That superconductivity was achieved at room temperature but at that huge pressure is hardly worth reporting as it&#x27;s of no practical value whatsoever thus only interest to fundamental research.')
