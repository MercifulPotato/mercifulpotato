I&#x27;m <i>paraphrasing</i> here, but you can look up the exact question on one of the youtube videos or read the transcription:<p>&quot;Suppose someone was infected with a retrovirus, could reverse transcriptase embed that rna into the dna? This could be especially worrisome if we&#x27;re talking about a pregnant woman and fetus undergoes rapid cell division... etc..&quot;<p>I would be surprised if I did <i>not</i> mangle up some terms &amp; concepts in the paraphrasing above. Someone who knows more can correct me or just watch&#x2F;read the fda hearing.<p>Another thing that was mentioned in the FDA hearing was that pfizer also tested it on HIV positive people. HIV is a retrovirus which also carries the reverse transcriptase enzyme. I don&#x27;t want to draw any conclusions from this because I don&#x27;t have any medical knowledge. Maybe someone here with more insight could comment.')
