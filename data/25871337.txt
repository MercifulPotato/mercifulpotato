If there’s a property of your data that you want to be able to order it by then you just need to make a column of the appropriate data type and store it. If I had a nickel for every time someone has look at a schema and said something like “Do we really need this date for ordering? The table is already sorted by insert order...” I’d have a lot more nickels than I want.')
