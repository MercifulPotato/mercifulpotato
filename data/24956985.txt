STUN, TURN, ICE, ALG all exist because of NAT. More complexity == harder to secure.\n2) The actual goal of the attack is to allow sending packets to hosts on your network. The only reason this is even considered an attack is because treating NAT as a security layer leads to the neglect of other security aspects. It shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for your smart doormat to get random packets, but we&#x27;ve been allowing vendors to get away with shipping devices&#x2F;software that&#x27;s only safe on a &#x27;local&#x27; network for decades.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wildly optimistic but if ipv6 had been the default for years and every random IoT device was expected to be exposed to the public internet by default, maybe we&#x27;d actually have something approaching decent host-level firewalling&#x2F;etc by default too?')
