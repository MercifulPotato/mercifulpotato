That would mean that instead of the 1% death rate we see now, anyone who needed ICU or oxygen to survive would then die, which I think is about 5X more, and it would include many younger people who just needed a little help but got none.<p>Also anyone who needed the hospital for anything else is out of luck. Got hit by a car? Heart attack? Sorry, itâ€™s full.<p>With that number of dead and infected a lot of basic services would probably fail too just from lack of people.<p>In short, it might be over quicker, but it would be A LOT more terrible.')
