Green new deal doesn&#x27;t ban reactors or anything.<p>Second, I&#x27;m on the fence over whether I support more reactors and not because nuclear==bad.  I trust the technology, but my concern is whether we can maintain a stable political environment for the decades&#x2F;hundred years required to responsibly take care of nuclear.<p>Buying into a fission reactor means you pay billions up front, but you also promise to pay billions in upkeep, and then pay billions for decomissioning.  If you aren&#x27;t willing to do that upkeep or clean up after yourself then you can cause a radiological disaster.<p>What happens if we have a majority government that refuses to believe in the long term effects of radiation damage even as scientists explain to them over and over again what will happen?  They just don&#x27;t see why we should be spending that amount of money on reactor decomissioning or on upkeep and don&#x27;t want to be seen as the one spending taxpayer money on something so costly.  What if they decide to cut nuclear safety programs in a political stunt?  I wish I could say that I know that won&#x27;t happen, but on the hundred years in the future scale I&#x27;m just not sure.<p>Nuclear is amazing and could solve all of our short term energy needs, but it&#x27;s ultimately people and our political structures that I don&#x27;t trust, not the science.')
