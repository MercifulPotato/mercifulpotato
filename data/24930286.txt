Racism against the majority group is relatively benign compared to that against a minority. It is unlikely that racism can phase them to a relevant degree. But that stops to be the case when you have companies and media personalities starting to discriminate on the basis of skin color. Furthermore I think the most racist people are those that have no problem with being racist at all and those that believe there needs to be some compensatory justice. And this is far more pronounced racism than bias in any form.<p>first question:<p>Yes&#x2F;No. I think there is an initial bias that is quickly overcome on contact because the other one is not you. Same prejudices can exist against unknown people in general. I doubt it is too relevant in exchanges. It can however be the reason for prejudices against people against other that they not ever been in contact with.<p>I also believe that you need different types of people in a functioning society. For disabled people it might be advantageous to have people ignoring their condition and just pretending that they belong just as everybody else. But you need also people that know that isn&#x27;t always the case. Everyone wants to make things accessible but if you ask yourself if you always keep that promise the answer is probably &#x27;no&#x27;. That is why the latter group is also needed, but there can be conflicts if a differing context isn&#x27;t cleared up. The first group might have a problem with &#x27;political correctness&#x27; in this context.')
