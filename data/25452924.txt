And kudos on your personal mission.<p>Not that you don&#x27;t have enough on your plate, but I wonder if you&#x27;ve been interested in doing a kind of &quot;on writing&quot; post where you can articulate your approach? I think your writing is unusual in that it has both specificity and approach-ability in equal measure. Like, it&#x27;s precise but also friendly if that makes any sense. Definitely uncommon in any circles but more so in tech circles. (Also the layout&#x2F;presentation of your blog is so nice.)<p>Edit: To be clear, and to quote a previous blog post of yours, &quot;As a reader of my blog, you likely have above average ability to discern truthful information from lies, and you also probably can communicate reasonably effectively to other people.&quot; A few nuggets of wisdom on effective writing could help us trying to communicate with others. :-)')
