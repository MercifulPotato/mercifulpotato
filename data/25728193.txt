Whether this really says so much about the system ... I&#x27;m pretty sure that the sampling jitter exceeds 0.4 ps by quite some margin. In a system constructed like this it is actually really easy to turn the ETS rate up to incredibly high values; whether the data that generates is useful, is another question.<p>This was a fully analog system hence the ~.')
