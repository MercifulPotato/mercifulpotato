The crew had a whole slew of EICAS messages and callouts to handle. Clearly, the fact that another machine came down even after this accident chain and the Emergency AD was publicised shows that the &quot;revert trim to neutral and activate the stab trim cutout&quot; checklist items were insufficient.')
