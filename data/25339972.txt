She has far greater commercial appeal however and her music is worth more today if you&#x27;re selling a catalog. The same would factor in to selling the Dylan catalog. Dylan&#x27;s music is not very popular with young people and will not be very popular in the future (see: Elvis, Cher, Neil Diamond, Clapton, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Rod Stewart, Chicago, etc; their music doesn&#x27;t sell at all like it used to), although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be redone endlessly. Do young people care about Simon &amp; Garfunkel? Not in the least and they won&#x27;t tomorrow either. That music will all fade by the year, relegated to a small fraction of the interest it once had, as the primary generation or two that listened to it die.<p>After 60 years Dylan has sold less than the Backstreet Boys. He produced relatively few hits compared to other renowned, popular artists. His style of music doesn&#x27;t lend itself to vast commercial success. Someone will pay a premium to acquire his catalog because he&#x27;s such a great artist and it&#x27;s a large &amp; influential catalog, however there is a practical limit to that.')
