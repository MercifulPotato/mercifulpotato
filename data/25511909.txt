I&#x27;m yet to read the two links you provided, though.<p>The story is different in the interstellar space. The only matter there is sparse gas and neutrons, even lots of them, would have little opportunity to bounce into each other or those gas atoms.<p>Those neutron clouds could eventually form asteroid-like rings around galaxies: invisible, but massive. For the same reason, every massive object, including our planet, would have such a ring. That&#x27;s a falsifiable hypothesis.<p>As for the black hole argument, there could be two explanations: first is that neutrons that are nearby don&#x27;t get to stay too long and either transform into protons and become visible gas, or fall into the black hole; second is that neutrons that are really far, light years away, could happily orbit around the black hole unnoticed and if there&#x27;s enough of them, we would see subtle gravitational lensing effects.<p>There&#x27;s another valid point against neutrons: their lifetime is only 10 minutes. However neutrons and protons are two particular compositions of quarks. Are there reasons why quarks can&#x27;t form a stable neutral particle in the interstellar space? That particle would be much like a neutron, but stable.<p>The reason I&#x27;m pushing for this idea is that there&#x27;s an odd flyby effect: it causes spacecrafts to accelerate and decelerate slightly. We could use those observations to calculate the precise shape, mass and velocity of that &quot;neutron ring&quot;, make a satellite fly in the opposite direction and observe if there&#x27;s strange heating of water or other reactions that could be caused by neutrons. Since it can visibly accelerate a spacecraft, there should be a good deal of those neutral particles and thus they should visibly heat up water.<p>I&#x27;m not a physicist, but this seems a way simpler explanation of dark matter than &quot;axion fields&quot; or whatever is currently trending.')
