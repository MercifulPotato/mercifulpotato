If you&#x27;ve seen what&#x27;s happening with open source and AWS you&#x27;ll understand that this is one of the few ways to protect against cannibalisation of our ecosystem and ability to build a real business. AWS gives nothing back to the creators, and we believe cloud will have its music industry moment. Polyform is a fairly liberal and standardised set of licenses co-drafted by Heather Meeker is well known for her work on open source and enterprise licensing. We believe licensing evolution is required beyond Apache 2.0 and MIT in this new world of cloud and AWS. By choosing licensing standards over custom drafting we think it will make it simpler for companies to adopt and get approval of those in larger orgs. Again happy to speak more on the topic.')
