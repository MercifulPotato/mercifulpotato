It&#x27;s not supported by any actual quantitative evidence at all, nor am I aware of any credence given to it in academia. It&#x27;s essentially made-up. There is no political scientist I&#x27;m aware of who takes it seriously.<p>To my knowledge, it&#x27;s nothing more than a talking point invented by progressives to try to convince other progressives not to be pulled to the center.')
