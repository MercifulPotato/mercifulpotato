And then it fails miserably.<p>I know upper middle class parents whose kids got a disease which need ~$5000&#x2F;month meds for a few years (and nontrivial infusion center costs on top).<p>It worked ok for some, many had been informed that the insurance company decided not to pay - requiring lawsuits (some settled, some ongoing).<p>No European, Canadian or Israeli parent that I know of kid with the  same disease ever had to fight or pay out of pocket - it was all covered by the single payer with no hassles.')
