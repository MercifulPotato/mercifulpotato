They also have a fantastic podcast [0]. \nI don&#x27;t claim to know what Brain Cantrill (one of the founders of Oxide) thinks about Parler&#x27;s situation or their content but from some of his talks you can tell he&#x27;s an incredibly ethically conscious person, so the commenter above is likely assuming he&#x27;s not a fan of Parler.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxide.computer&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxide.computer&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;</a>')
