This can be duplicated across workspaces as needed for different codebases.<p>Often I&#x27;ll find I need to make arbitrary layouts on the fly when debugging an issue or responding to an outage, I can do this without having to engage my brain or reach for my mouse.<p>Can you do the same with floating WMs? Absolutely but you will probably need to think about, breaking your thought process. For me the i3 just does what I need it to without having to engage my brain or reach for the mouse.<p>If you&#x27;re already running Linux I&#x27;d highly suggest giving i3 a go, it&#x27;s hard (for me) to explain how it changed the way I interact with my computer and how much it improved my workflow. I think about the closes I can get is that it&#x27;s like learning vi, sure nano can get text into a file but once you&#x27;re used to vi you&#x27;re going to be far more efficient.')
