You dismiss this as &quot;a hack job piled on top of a hack job&quot; and I gave another example of such a thing (TLS 1.3) which you agree is in fact secure anyway. My point was that this argument is, at best, flimsy.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t that magically the existence of TLS 1.3 makes email secure but that TLS 1.3 is &quot;a hack job piled on top of a hack job&quot; too and it&#x27;s fine.<p>However, since we&#x27;re here now: Depending on which browser you use there are two potential answers to your question.<p>In Firefox the answer is always that Mozilla decided that the CAs which are members of its root trust programme met its requirements. Mozilla&#x27;s oversight of the Web PKI happens entirely in public. If you have a specific reason to think there&#x27;s a problem at a CA based in Turkey or Mainland China which is a member of that programme you should raise it.<p>Otherwise, this decision was made by your OS vendor. If you use a Free Unix then in effect that&#x27;s still Mozilla since all the popular Free Unix system implicitly or explicitly delegate this to Mozilla, but if it&#x27;s Google, Apple or Microsoft then that&#x27;s a matter for them, and they do not have public oversight, good luck with that.<p>Now, since you mentioned Turkey and Mainland China specifically that would narrow things down a lot (unless you run Windows). Mozilla only trusts Kamu (the Turkish government CA) for Turkish stuff, so, it&#x27;s unclear what sort of threat you imagine they impose. When I say &quot;Turkish stuff&quot; I mean like the Turkish government&#x27;s sites, its military, schools that sort of thing, not say a Reddit about Turkey. TURKTRUST which you might have heard of is not trusted at all.<p>When it comes to the Chinese mainland (as opposed to Hong Kong or Taiwan) there are several more, including GDCA and CFCA but we don&#x27;t have any particular reason to doubt these authorities behave in accordance with policy. They seem to be exactly what you&#x27;d expect, for example CFCA is a financial outfit, and sure enough it issues certificates to various Chinese banks. Would it be a good idea for a foreign critic of China to keep money in those banks? Perhaps not, but that&#x27;s hardly a problem with the CA.')
