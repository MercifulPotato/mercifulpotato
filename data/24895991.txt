We know it isn’t higher than that but we also have circumstantial evidence that it likely isn’t below 40%. A complicating factor is that we know the number of infections is <i>much</i> higher than the number of cases but we don’t know by how much and this is not something we can effectively measure retroactively, which makes it challenging to model precisely.')
