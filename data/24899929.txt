But there are big societal problems with viral content which contains lies and incites violence (or voter harassment, etc).<p>So now they are trying to blame the individual sources which is effective to some extent except when the sources are hugely popular with certain segments of society.<p>IMO the real solution is to massively slow  <i>all</i>  viral content&#x27;s spread. That of course would damage the platforms, particularly if their competitors don&#x27;t implement similar limits. So all the platforms are playing this kind of cat-and-mouse game and doing a piecemeal approach fraught with ethical and potential legal issues.')
