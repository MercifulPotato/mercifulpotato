Taking French or German late night news I don&#x27;t recall once that the word &quot;clan&quot; ever used in a positive way. It is always about criminal associations (often about Balkan families) where the attachment of individuals is still stronger within than (the trust) in the state. People are absolutely terrified by the idea of others belonging to a family that knows it&#x27;s roots since 300+ years with an also non-local footprint and reach. Also a clan is usually always a foreign group.')
