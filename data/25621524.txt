It&#x27;s not a hack, and it&#x27;s pretty trivial.  I type &quot;a,&quot; and press up, and run the line from my command history with all the letters in it.  Sympy also has a submodule named abc you can import variables from, but I like defining them as real number variables so I don&#x27;t get complex answers when they don&#x27;t make sense.<p>Sympy is just a Python library, and one of the types it defines is symbolic maths variables, so you define Python variables just like with any other library, and then use them.')
