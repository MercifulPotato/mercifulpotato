I get his point, people who don&#x27;t put any time into furthering their career aren&#x27;t likely to be in a good position later in life, but there are many who have obtained their career goals while &quot;consuming&quot; media for hours each day and there are also many who don&#x27;t use their phone much and are still as poor as ever.<p>I&#x27;m not against motivational articles or against critiques of modern smartphone usage, but this one seems to be to be mostly an emotional appeal with the wrong arguments. Paraphrased, &quot;if you use phones, you won&#x27;t make it anywhere in life, and you don&#x27;t want that, right?&quot;')
