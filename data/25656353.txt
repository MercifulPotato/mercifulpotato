I hope that the model is not doing advanced patchwork&#x2F;stitching of training images. I think that this kind of test should be included when measuring the performance of any generative model. Unfortunately the paper is not yet released, the model is not available and no online demo has been published.\nRecently a team of researchers discovered that in some cases advanced generative text models copy a large chunk of training data-set text ...')
