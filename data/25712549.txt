Although he had freedom of speech, he had no means to get his ideas out in front of more people. He had to resort to extreme measures, like a bombing campaign to blackmail newspapers into printing his manifesto.<p>If he was active today, heâ€™d just post it on YouTube and gather millions of views. If YouTube gets squeamish about the violence, move to Parler.<p>It was easy to guarantee freedom of speech to everyone when people like Ted no means of actually broadcasting their ideas without being gatekeeped by newspaper editors.<p>Our world is different now. It saddens me to say this but maybe our principles have to adapt too.')
