Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=[24670469, 24674870], score=None, time=1601704461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669673, text='I think it&#x27;s more complicated than that.<p>It seems like a <i>lot</i> of markets -- maybe most -- go through consolidation, and the more the market is one whose players benefit from network effects -- like, say, incompatible computing platforms -- the more rapid this consolidation is. Look at the personal computing market: there were a <i>lot</i> of players in the late 1970s and early 80s, and nobody was an obvious winner. Yet by 1990, the IBM PC already had over 80% of the market, Apple was struggling, and other once-major players were on the verge of bankruptcy or had thrown in the towel and started making PC clones. And none of that happened because IBM was &quot;crushing any attempt to take their turf&quot;.<p>Frankly, I really <i>didn&#x27;t</i> expect a repeat of that in the mobile space. It was clear to me in 2007 that the iPhone was going to be a big deal, but it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> clear to me that Android was going to take off the way it did, in no small part because I didn&#x27;t expect everyone else to dramatically collapse in three years. One of the other players was <i>Microsoft,</i> for heaven&#x27;s sake. Nokia was a market leader and had MeeGo almost ready to go (right? right?). Blackberry had bought QNX and were surely going to leverage that talent into a next-generation OS (right? right?).<p>The market <i>as it exists now</i> is down to two players, but this is kind of the confounding factor here: neither Apple nor Google got to their position in the mobile phone market by &quot;playing dirty.&quot; Apple got there because people keep buying iPhones; Google got there because just about everyone who isn&#x27;t Apple went with Android.<p>So supernova87a is, I suspect, fundamentally correct that we got to where we are now because of market dynamics. It&#x27;s arguable that <i>because</i> the market now is down to two players -- and is orders of magnitude larger than it was a decade ago -- that there are antitrust concerns around app stores, although I think that&#x27;s actually even more complicated.')
