Small phone for 2020 standards and works just as I expect it to. I really love the casual design and how it feels in hand. I don&#x27;t like the glass backs or pure metals. I don&#x27;t want edge display. I don&#x27;t care about wireless charging (why do people even feel it&#x27;s necessary?). I would rather have faster cable charging.<p>I want a practical phone. I don&#x27;t care much about gimmicks. The new one plus has 3 useless cameras out of 4. They added two flash and extra cameras for marketing purposes. These little things added by the marketing departments only increase the amount you need to pay and make for a worse experience.')
