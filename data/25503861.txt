I&#x27;ve seen bamboo bikes around SB and Scruz for about 25 years. So I&#x27;m not surprised Calfee decided to do one.<p>I do think it&#x27;s worth pointing out that the Calfee is built by experienced carbon-fiber layup specialists who do this everyday... they use titanium components and almost certainly impregnate the bamboo to offer the 10yr warranty. And total weight 6-7lbs (frame only) is pretty damn light! So 3k for a reliable one of a kind competition bike vs 0.5k for a kit you build yourself and ride carefully for less than a year. You better enjoy building it.')
