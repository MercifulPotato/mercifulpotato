I should be able to go live in the woods alone and not have the government take some percent of my net worth just because I exist.<p>I mean I don&#x27;t have a tonne of sympathy for people with tens of millions of net worth, but it just seems wrong in principle. If I start a company and it gets valued at 30 million dollars, why should the government be allowed to force me to sell my company to pay their wealth tax? Seems wrong to me, if you own something you should be allowed to keep it indefinitely. Property taxes are a bit of a grey area, but they make more sense because of all the infrastructure required for a house to be accessible.<p>Or another example, I own a piece of art or a car passed down through my family that is worth 30 million dollars (maybe it&#x27;s a mclaren f1 or something). Now the government is going to force me to sell my car? I disagree with that, obviously that&#x27;s an extreme case, but laws should still handle cases like that.')
