The arbitrary way that the president can select all federal judges for the entire country (to my understanding) not only skews the judicial system, it adds a whole new dimension the the <i>presidential</i> election which really seems to distort what the job is actually intended to be.<p>For example, it was the sole reason a lot of people voted for Trump: because at this moment in history there happened, through sheer chance, to be this hugely disproportionate opportunity for a party to grab power that will last a <i>generation</i>. Just because a bunch of people retired around the same time. And this momentous opportunity completely hinged on what would already be the most important single election in the land. That doesn&#x27;t feel remotely like what the founding fathers intended.')
