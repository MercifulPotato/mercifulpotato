And can take the lead role to help in building and growing an engineering team. We value written communication, agile practices and passion for building world class products. We believe in giving full autonomy, that is reciprocated with commitment from each and every team member. We welcome people who want to learn and grow with us, rather looking at their academic degrees and current language proficiency. However, if you want to know our current technology stack, then we have Python Flask, React&#x2F;redux, Docker and heavy AWS (with fully automated CICD). But we are not married to those technologies and any other technologies can be explored to build our new microservices and serverless applications.<p>If interested, please reach out to careers@ibexlabs.com with a recent copy of your resume.
