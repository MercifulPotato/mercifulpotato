Item(by='dkersten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607292574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318021, text='C++14 is really just a small patch of improvements to 11, so I think if you&#x27;re going to adopt 11, you may as well adopt 14 and get a better experience.<p>And that is where I intended to stop, but then I started reading and watching content on C++17 and realised the things I thought were complex and scary were not so bad. I mean, there&#x27;s much code I just don&#x27;t understand, but from how it affects me personally, its not so bad and adds a bunch of improvements.<p>C++20 is a different beast altogether and I told myself its too complicated so I&#x27;ll never bother beyond C++17. And then I watched some cppcon videos and realised that concepts, ranges, modules and coroutines are pretty cool. I still don&#x27;t understand anything but the basics of concepts and ranges have some cool properties, but otherwise I dunno if I&#x27;ll use them. But coroutines open a world of interesting possibility and modules have a lot of potential too, so I&#x27;ve started playing around with C++20 and will slowly learn to use it (although I did already notice some stuff that&#x27;s not yet implemented in the clang version my package manager gave me... so not quite ready yet).')
