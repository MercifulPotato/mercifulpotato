Thinking about what you want long-term is far superior to being blown about by the winds of circumstance. I would guess that your issue is your tactics, not your strategy. If you think you&#x27;re picky, you need to be going on more dates and meeting more people, not fewer. You aren&#x27;t going to hurt these people if you communicate honestly and openly with them when you meet them.<p>It&#x27;s like job interviewing. If you only do it (and more importantly only think about it) once a year, and only when you know it&#x27;s a job you _really_ want to get, you&#x27;re going to be really nervous and perform poorly.')
