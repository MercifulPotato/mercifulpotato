For example:<p>- Does it carry power? If so, how much power?<p>- Will it charge my device? Not all USB-C chargers charge all USB-C devices.<p>- Does this cable carry data? If so, what speed?<p>- Does it carry a Thunderbolt 3 signal?<p>On Macbooks we lost utility when we lost Magsafe but &quot;gained&quot; the ability to plug power into any of the 2&#x2F;4 ports. Frankly I&#x27;d rather have Magsafe. I&#x27;m sure that every port supporting power must increase cost. It has issues too as using ports on one side can lead to overheating, for example.<p>And of course no cable can really do everything. The only cables that can are necessarily short (&lt;0.5m) and expensive. I know. I use them for my Thunderbolt dock to my MBP.<p>Where before I had the right ports on my MBP. Now? It&#x27;s almost unusable without a dock or adapter. It&#x27;s so dumb.')
