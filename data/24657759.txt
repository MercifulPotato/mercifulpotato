A FET goes between say, 0.01 Ohms and 1,000,000 Ohms for fully on and fully off.  The times in between are where it passes the most power through it and that&#x27;s because of how Ohms law and Power being current times voltage (ignoring differing phase between current and voltage in AC circuits).  This all still remains true even for the memristors.  You can do analog stuff with higher resistance and lower currents, but then you end up more susceptible to noise and other randomness induced by the environment: thermal noise, electric noise, magnetic noise, and RF noise (technically also electric noise, but more organized), etc.  All that being said, for a NN this might actually be somewhat acceptable, but for general analog circuitry you can&#x27;t get past this problem at all.  That&#x27;s a large reason why most analog circuitry these days does as much as possible in a digital domain before converting back to analog, even simple amplification.  A class D amplifier does the whole job by chopping up a large voltage into just on and off and then filters it afterwards.  Even though you have power loss in the filtering, the end result is much easier to have stable, and get the desired amplification.  You still find class A and B amplifiers where the high frequency chopping noise isn&#x27;t possible to filter out or would cause other problems, particularly when you look at RF circuitry since you&#x27;d end up transmitting that high frequency noise and causing other problems for yourself.')
