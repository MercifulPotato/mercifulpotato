That is, advertising must tell the truth and not mislead consumers. A claim can be misleading if relevant information is left out or if the claim implies something that&#x27;s not true[1].<p>So maybe if Apple made some very strong statements to the tune of &quot;This T2 chip will absolutely never ever be hacked, its impossible&quot;, that might be misleading. I suspect the Apple legal team is a little more clever than that, though.<p>General marketing fluff like &quot;This car is good, you should buy this car&quot; doesn&#x27;t count as false advertising if your car breaks down. I think this falls into that category.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;tips-advice&#x2F;business-center&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;advertising-marketing-internet-rules-road" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;tips-advice&#x2F;business-center&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;adv...</a>')
