Note that this change isn&#x27;t expected to involve increasing temperatures of much note all by itself,  just increasing dryness. AGW will likely do that, however.<p>I&#x27;d also note that talking about the climate of &quot;California&quot; doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. If state boundaries were based on biomes&#x2F;climatic zones, CA would likely be at least 3 different states. The coastal zone of Northern CA is essentially unrelated, climate-wise or ecologically, to either Central Valley, the high Sierras or the start of the great basin to the east.')
