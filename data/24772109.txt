Respect the source material!<p>Though I&#x27;m also curious, that&#x27;s perhaps not the tone I would have used when asking. After all, better a censored archive than no archive.<p>I&#x27;m just speculating, but it may be the policy of usenetarchives.com, in order to accept their upload.<p>Censoring seems to be done around email addresses, names, and offensive words. Perhaps, this is done to reduce the chances of people later asking for the posts to be taken down entirely.<p>For example, I believe the takedown by Google of comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.forth commented elsewhere was done because there was offensive content present. The Google support request that mentioned that reason was taken down, but it&#x27;s what I remember.')
