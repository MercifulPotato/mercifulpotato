I don&#x27;t think you understand what that document actually says.<p>I don&#x27;t rebut evidence, I accept it, if courts accept it when used as evidence in a case. I don&#x27;t know what rebutting evidence means, or what that would accomplish. After four years of nonsense investigations there were no indictments on this so called &quot;collusion&quot;. This fact alone makes anyone involved in making those allegations look completely nutty.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Indictment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Indictment</a><p>No indictment = no charges = no case = no conviction = innocent until proven guilty. Regardless of this report, if Dems had solid evidence to bring criminal charges, I&#x27;d bet my life savings that they&#x27;d have brought cases by now, and we&#x27;d know about it.')
