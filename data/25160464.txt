I&#x27;ve tried this a few times. As a casual emacs user (for almost 30 years though) I like the idea but find the actual practice of using it fairly jarring. Probably if I was an emacs power user I would love this, but I&#x27;ve never become especially adept with managing buffers and windows in emacs and this really requires you to have that down pat. Nor do I think window management in X is particularly great when compared to some of the tiling window managers out there. On the other hand, I always felt that emacs within a tiling window manager was also very awkward.<p>I just tried again with one of the recommended configurations that uses ido and... it was confusing. ace-window looks fairly compelling, maybe.<p>I suppose the right approach to adopting this would be to spend some amount time with emacs full-screened first, trying to do almost everything in it, getting better with buffer and window management. Then make the jump to having it manage windows.')
