And the protocol is busy evolving; with MSCs landing on some clients before others (e.g. FluffyChat implements BlurHash based image thumbnails but Element doesn&#x27;t yet).  So far we haven&#x27;t had massive fragmentation though, because the spec itself is monolithic - it&#x27;s completely unambiguous on what the official recommended featureset is at any point in time.  Anything beyond that is experimental, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that it will work compatibly at all.  So when something like blurhashes turns up as a random community spec change proposal (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;anoa&#x2F;blurhash&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;2448-blurhash-for-media.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;matrix-doc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;anoa&#x2F;blurhash&#x2F;...</a>), some clients go and implement it, and once proven it gets baked into the official spec.')
