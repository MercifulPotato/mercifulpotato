Item(by='sfink', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603127002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822271, text='Sure, but the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s a force with a magnitude that is proportional to the mass&quot; is like me asking &quot;how heavy are you?&quot; and you replying &quot;75 liters&quot;, expecting me to know that humans are basically the density of water.<p>My point is that it really seems like &quot;gravity&quot; is not a force, it&#x27;s an acceleration, but there is something you could call &quot;force due to gravity&quot; that you reverse-engineer from the known acceleration, and that means you need to multiply by the mass. Clearly different masses will just cancel, so the resulting acceleration is the same.<p>I&#x27;m fine with saying &quot;force due to gravity&quot; or even &quot;gravitational force&quot;. Which is what you&#x27;re describing in your first sentence, and I have no disagreement with that. &quot;Force of gravity&quot; starts to sound a little off, and I bet if I ask &quot;what is gravity at Earth&#x27;s surface?&quot; I&#x27;ll get back &quot;9.8 m&#x2F;s^2&quot;, which is an acceleration not a force.')
