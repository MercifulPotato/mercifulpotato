The problem was a bug in our reminder email. We only intended to send the reminder 3 times, but it was going out every 6 weeks forever. We’ve turned off all reminder emails for now (and will audit them after the holidays). Had I realized this was happening sooner, we would have fixed it sooner. I’m absolutely NOT trying to spam &#x2F; growth hack our way to anything. I don’t think that would even work. Our goal is to help people who are strong programmers but don’t have credentialed resumes get jobs. We only succeed by helping engineers. It’s clear from some of the replies here that I’ve lost the trust of a part of this community. I feel pretty bad about this. I’m going to do an Ask HN post next year and get everyone input on what Triplebyte should do to help engineers and not be spammy. If anyone has any thoughts now and would like to talk, please email me at ammon@triplebyte.com. I promise to listen to anyone (I’d especially like to talk to people critical of us). Have a wonderful Christmas, everyone!')
