Item(by='nebulous1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610124151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685966, text='&gt; USDT is only liquid BECAUSE there is no redemption mechanism<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily true, as in that event, although possible, wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have happened.  Much like banks with limited liquidity can survive for a long time.  To your point, it&#x27;s confusing how they managed to thrive after admitting that they were lying about being backed 1:1.<p>Edit: I haven&#x27;t been paying too much attention to tether in ages.  It looks like they&#x27;re now offering redemption of $100k+ at a minimum of $1000 a pop?')
