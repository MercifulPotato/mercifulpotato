I always struggled with design, not because I didn’t know how to, but the feeling of uneasiness that comes up when we don’t have the details or imagination to see the repercussions of our designs. I’m stuck as a senior engineer, even though I have designed and implemented systems, because I think the veneer of design knowledge when talking to others is pretty thin, and as someone who reasons by causality and simulation, it’s hard to hide it. I always wonder how people get around this. What books did you read, general ones, not the ones you use for interviews that crow “here’s how to design twitter”')
