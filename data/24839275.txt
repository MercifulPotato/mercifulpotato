Most of this difference is not related to lifetimes.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this recently: the borrow checker gets a lot of attention, but I think the majority of the learning curve of rust is actually due to &quot;unforced errors&quot; in the language UX which have nothing to do with the language&#x27;s core USP&#x27;s.<p>For instance, the module system just seems needlessly complex.  Like you need a mod.rs file in each subdirectory, and the main.rs&#x2F;lib.rs serves as the module file for the src directory, it took me like a day to figure out what exactly the rules are, and I can&#x27;t understand why there can&#x27;t be sensible defaults to define modules based on the file system structure alone.')
