Your solution to replace CLI parameters with code is a terrible idea...<p>1) CLI support is an additional logic in your program that makes no real work<p>CLI is a user interface, it does real work as giving user way to interact with your program. It&#x27;s an interface.<p>2) Error (exception) handling with CLI is very poor. Another layer of (bad faulty) code is required to make it possible.<p>Like with any other code. That&#x27;s why you should to test it (like any other code).<p>3) Scaling&#x2F;extending is not as easy compared to programming language APIs (see example in the end)<p>It&#x27;s much easier. At least to my wife, who isn&#x27;t programmer, but can use shell.<p>4) CLIs are detached from essential code, which in most cases is disadvantage.<p>What cases?<p>5) Forcing users to use CLI means: stay away from my code, youâ€™d better not work with it.<p>Why having CLI would have to force the user to not use the library (if it is intended to be a library, not a stupid tool)<p>To sum up:<p>API != User Interface.\nAPI = Programming Interface.<p>Two different goals, two different sets of requirements. You can&#x27;t just reduce one to another.')
