Apple has a good track record of improving their chips year over year. Look at initial comments of the iPhone by the competition. They were all laughing. A decade later they are not.<p>With full control over the hardware and not relying on Intel for the processor, Apple is aiming to reproduce its iPhone success in PCs. They have everything going for them.<p>The future looks bleak for Intel and AMD. They are stuck evolving a 30 year-old architecture.<p>In fact, this is where Apple shines in terms of long-term strategy and execution. They are able to create a revolution with a new product&#x2F;architecture (iPod, iPhone, iPad and now PC), then iterate to make it evolve over time. In doing so, they create new markets.
