Item(by='Groxx', descendants=None, kids=[25051441], score=None, time=1605039433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050857, text='There are loads of rants out there that are easy to find, but personally it&#x27;s mostly: you can&#x27;t use it without looking at it to make sure the buttons are <i>what</i> you think they are (nearly always context-sensitive, often surprising when it decides it&#x27;s a new context), and <i>where</i> you think they are (can&#x27;t go by feel, so you need to visually re-calibrate constantly).  Button size and positioning varies widely, and nearly all of them have a keyboard shortcut already that doesn&#x27;t require hand movement or eyes (or at worst previously had an F-key that never moved).<p>The main exception being things like controlling a progress bar (mouse works fine for me, though it&#x27;s a neat demo), or changing system brightness&#x2F;volume with a flick or drag (which is the one thing I find truly better... but I&#x27;d happily trade it back for a fn toggle and F keys).  But that&#x27;s so rarely <i>useful</i>.')
