Apple has always been fanatical about controlling what the user, seller, repair shops, retail, etc can do with their products. Among other reasons, its one of the top reasons I&#x27;ll never use Apple computers. I want complete control of my devices, and the ability to break my machines while pushing boundaries. Apple would rather have me locked in to their 30% fee App Store cash cow with apps that require their approval to exist.')
