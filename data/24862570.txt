I am sure Google is all too happy to <i>promote</i> this angle, suggesting we should protect Chrome out of some misguided attempt to protect Firefox.<p>If Google is stripped of Chrome or prohibited from using various tactics to promote Chrome over alternatives, Firefox will benefit, massively. Revenue may drop in the short term, so it may not look great for Mozilla-the-company, but Firefox usage will soar, and revenue-generating strategies will follow thereafter.<p>It&#x27;s sad Mozilla is hurting themselves here by coming to Google&#x27;s defense, but that&#x27;s how whipped Google has them right now.')
