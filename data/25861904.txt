Every release of BeOS that was marked as a &quot;full release&quot; (as opposed to a developer preview or a &quot;preview release&quot;) could run on Intel hardware, and the BeBox itself was discontinued long before then.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s fair - BeOS was a bad example. Let&#x27;s say AmigaOS then, which largely seems to be limited to Amiga hardware. (Though amazingly it still seems to be maintained?)')
