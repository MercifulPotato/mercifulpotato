I&#x27;m pretty sure I understand why it&#x27;s happening: Apple is managing its full ecosystem for its own benefit.<p>My concern is that as a fallible lil&#x27; human, and moreover one with autism, I find it probably more upsetting than most to have stuff randomly break for no reason. I depend on continuity and repetitiveness to be well. As such I try to operate on computer systems that don&#x27;t change out from under me at someone else&#x27;s whim, because I can be thrown into the inability to function, by something at an unexpected level of abstraction blowing up.<p>This most recently happened under OSX Mojave when my (non-Apple)_apps could no longer check with the authentication server and would not launch. I lost a day to trying to repair my system: Apple had never told me &#x27;by the way, everything you run now has to talk to a server of ours or it&#x27;ll refuse to launch&#x27;. I disabled the functionality, but I can&#x27;t have things like that going on. It makes Apple the cyber-terrorist they are trying to &#x27;protect&#x27; us from.<p>Again, I understand their motivation as they are a titanic collective entity trying to administrate and tend another titanic collective entity, their userbase, which they feel is a part of themselves.<p>However, as a lil&#x27; human type, I am too deeply committed to maintaining usefulness for lots of older computers owned by other lil&#x27; human types, many of whom can&#x27;t consistently throw thousands of dollars at Apple to stay in the ecosystem as Apple understands it. I find Apple&#x27;s actions morally reprehensible (granted, among the least reprehensible actors in the world of computers and internet, but still)')
