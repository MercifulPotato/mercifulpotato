Why would I ever need to interact with any of the application files? Why would I need to move it to another portion of the disk? Give it a shortcut to click on to activate it and who cares? It could be running one file or a million files. The only files I care about are the ones I create and edit. I can&#x27;t imagine any need to interact with the application files. If your users need to interact with the application files or move them around in any way, you&#x27;ve already failed at usability.')
