Most corporate security depts spend a lot of money on salaries, devices, etc. And then some hacker kid comes along and embarrasses them. They retaliate and try to &#x27;kill the messenger&#x27; to save their reputation (internally) and continue to &#x27;play security&#x27; with big budgets and vendor conferences. Really, all they do is CYA. That&#x27;s all that matters to them.<p><i>Edit: This happened to me when I compromised a Windows Active Directory (got domain admin on all the domain controllers) and it has happened to my colleagues as well. The default corporate response is to threaten, marginalize or try to fire the security researcher.</i>')
