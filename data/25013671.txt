Raised to CFO in 90s. <i>Promoted</i> to CAO in 00s. And later head the process <i>and</i> manufacturing operations while forced out Patrick Gelsinger. That was I think in 2009. The Otellini and Bryant era.<p>Paul Otellini retired in 2012, and BK ( Brian Krzanich ) was picked ( by Andy Bryant ) as Otellini&#x27;s successor.<p>There seems to be lots of power play within Intel that we will never know.')
