Google), and their pricing model is simple to understand.<p>Assuming ~120 MiB per compressed CD album, and ignoring the futzing about SI and Binary units, you can store at least 8 CDs worth of ~192 kbps music (~1 GB) in B2 for $0.005&#x2F;month, and since the first 10 GB&#x2F;month is free, your first 80 albums are stored for free. Then, each additional group of 8 albums is another $0.06&#x2F;year.<p>If you&#x27;re still unconvinced, and prefer the particular characteristics of control, convenience, and no direct monetary opex costs that personal self-managed storage affords, then consider that for an <i>extra</i> $25.64 over 12 years ($2.10 for storage-at-rest, yearly), you can have another copy of your 45 GB in the cloud, which significantly reduces the likelihood that your dataset is damaged.<p>You can even think of it as insurance, but with the extremely desirable property that you get your actual data back, and not just some other kind of compensation.')
