This is why spending $22 billion on ITER is a very inefficient use of money for research. Maybe as a diplomatic effort of having all the world&#x27;s major powers [] (China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States) work together it is worth it. Sort of like the space station. Big symbol and cost but little scientific value per dollar.<p>Unfortunately the budget for ITER comes out of the US science budget instead of the State Department. Most US fusion funding only goes to ITER at this point.')
