(The type is inhabited.) Or so I&#x27;ve read; I haven&#x27;t used it.<p>But if you&#x27;re going to run the program, you typically want to know if a function will return promptly, and a total function could still spin for a million years calculating something, in a way that&#x27;s indistinguishable in practice from diverging.')
