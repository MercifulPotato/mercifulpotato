Gab isn’t restricted from doing business. It’s just forced to do it’s business on its own because it’s not seen as a good citizen.<p>Right, and it&#x27;s adhering to its legal responsibilities in the process, so I&#x27;m not seeing your issue. By all appearances, Gab <i>does have</i> the resources to operate responsibly <i>as defined by law</i>. Gab appears to be arguing that it could do better if various SV companies would cooperate.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re not adding anything new, but merely re-observing the stalemate described in TFA between the entrenched players and Gab. Perhaps you&#x27;re adding some moral implication that the established players are right to use child porn as a bargaining chip to get Gab to capitulate on free speech--its purported raison d&#x27;etre. If that&#x27;s your position, that&#x27;s a bit disturbing, but I don&#x27;t know what goes on at Gab very well--I suppose hypothetically it could be worse than child porn, in which case using child porn as leverage is perhaps the right call. But again, that&#x27;s a pretty disturbing, hopefully purely hypothetical scenario.<p>&gt; “I’ll do what I want and you must enable me” isn’t a valid argument.<p>No one is making this argument.')
