CCP is the ruling party, akin to GOP for US, if people want to pretend to only hate the CCP please learn to use the correct terminology. If it doesn&#x27;t make sense to hate on Americans because they voted in GOP, why would it make any more sense to hate on the Chinese for having a ruling party they didn&#x27;t even vote in.')
