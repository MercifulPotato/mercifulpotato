If someone is printing tether to buy bitcoin, then who is selling bitcoin for tether and <i>keeps</i> the tether?<p>I mean, if I had substantial bitcoin, I&#x27;d not sell it for tether. Maybe I&#x27;d use tether as some intermediate currency, but in the end I&#x27;d either buy stocks or real estate or yachts. Or I would keep the BTC. But I would never sell BTC and keep tether. Who does that and why?')
