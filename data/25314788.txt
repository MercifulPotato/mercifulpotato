It&#x27;s obviously important but it&#x27;s also kind of ... obvious. I am surprised they get paid so much.<p>* Lots of processing uses more energy..<p>* Large amounts of data might contain bad data (garbage in, garbage out)<p>* Wealthy countries&#x2F;communities have the most &#x27;content&#x27; online so less wealthy countries&#x2F;communities will be unrepresented.<p>here&#x27;s some more:<p>* AI being forced to chose between two &quot;bad&quot; scenarios will result in an unfavorable outcome for one party<p>* AI could reveal truths people don&#x27;t want to hear e.g. it might say the best team for a project is an all white male team between 25 - 30 rather than a more diverse team. It might say that a &#x27;perfect&#x27; society needs a homogeneous population.<p>* AI could disrupt a lot of lower paid jobs first without governments having proper supports and retraining structures in place')
