There was a time idealistic people thought that removing anonymity from the internet would somehow make it more civilized, but bad actors (e.g. most people using the internet regularly, it seems) have proven the lack of anonymity just makes it easy for people to find new and inventive ways to harass and insult you. For all the non-cis non-white non-males out there, people don&#x27;t even need an excuse to attack you anymore beyond your non-cis, non-white, non-maleness.<p>The blog author seems to grasp tentatively toward recognizing their own privilege, but fails to mention that they have 31,000 twitter followers and, having started their own business, significant adoration from the Twitter tech crowd. I can imagine Twitter seems like a great place to be when you&#x27;ve been elevated by the community. Everyone looks up to you, everyone thinks what you have to say is important. Life is a lot different on the internet for people who don&#x27;t have that same following. I don&#x27;t think trying to curate an online persona and manage a Twitter account where you reply to everyone is a valuable use of your time when you&#x27;re still trying to find a way to consistently feed yourself.')
