I still remember a lot about that project, despite a lot of that information being completely out of date now (My instinct is to still say cruziero as the currency of Brazil even though it&#x27;s wrong). I&#x27;ve never been to the country and probably never will just out of lack of interest, but it&#x27;s funny how some things stick with you.')
