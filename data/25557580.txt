In the case of your example, a huge underlying cause is an economic system based on debt (backed by interest and usurious loans). It&#x27;s for a reason that usury&#x2F;interest is banned in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism for example. It&#x27;s a parasitic practice that makes the economy fundamentally unstable. This includes dangerous practices such as selling debt for debt (again part of the same crisis), and things like stock shorting (which, interestingly enough was also banned during the crisis, at least for some critical company stocks).')
