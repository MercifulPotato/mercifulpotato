Which I agree with, as those are very annoying and takes up way too much sense.<p>However, there is another component to Samsung Ads - the video ads on their Samsung Plus Channel. For those that don&#x27;t know, this channel consists of free content (usually B-level movies, old TV series, etc).<p>Why does anyone have a problem if Samsung puts ads on this content? After all, it does cost them money to license most of this content, and if you don&#x27;t want to watch those ads, you simply don&#x27;t watch that content. Not to mention Youtube and everyone else has the same business model.')
