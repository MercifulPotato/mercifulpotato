I haven&#x27;t seen anyone try to justify this; for whatever reason it&#x27;s not on anyone else&#x27;s radar that I&#x27;ve seen.  For me it&#x27;s a total deal-breaker.<p>If you want a standard you can specify a standard, if you want a framework you can specify a framework.  But requiring it to give you client-side permission to run scripts is something that requires more justification that I&#x27;ve seen anyone give.<p>(I haven&#x27;t checked the official amp website in a year or so, maybe things have changed since then).')
