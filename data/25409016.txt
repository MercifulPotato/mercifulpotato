I&#x27;ll tell you who - FAANG. Good luck starting your company when all of the above is a law! I&#x27;ve had enough clicks on GDPR&#x27;s &quot;OK&quot; buttons. What did it change?<p>All this crying about tracking - how else the owner of the place can make product better? If I own a store - I can see where people go, how they shop, how they walk around, which basket size they prefer, what they buy. If I don&#x27;t collect data on my website - I can&#x27;t THINK about how to make my service better. I can only GUESS. What about data collections for simple functionality - like, when you come back to the half-filled form and I remember the values you already submitted by matching your cookies. Are you against this as well?<p>Sorry, but if this is the alternative - I would rather have Google know everything I do online and hope that they honestly don&#x27;t store data on my Incognito browsing. If they do - worse for them.')
