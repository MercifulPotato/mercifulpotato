You can&#x27;t perform the job and be non-union.<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t like the job, don&#x27;t take it.&quot; It&#x27;s like the argument when discussing child welfare policy where one side says &quot;Don&#x27;t ask society to help; if you need help, don&#x27;t have kids&quot;. Or in healthcare policy, &quot;Don&#x27;t want high medical bills? Buy better insurance.&quot; While true, it is just a way to elevate above the actual problem without providing a satisfactory policy solution.')
