And then you can&#x27;t just have these people unemployed and starving, so I guess we&#x27;ll need an F-35+1 program for them and their descendents. And so on forever, until we break this cycle.<p>This is a big part of the problem.  If you give the F-35 program $1 billion and you give the NSF $1 billion dollars, the F-35 program is going to directly generate more jobs.  They pay people less, and they need more unskilled labor.  The NSF needs very little unskilled labor, relatively speaking.  Scientists are expensive.  Machinery for science is crazy expensive (although so are a lot of F-35 components).  Machinery for science also often involves buying foreign parts, such as the replacement cables for Arecibo that were coming from Germany.<p>One way for the NSF to address that is by requiring parts to be US made like the DoD does.  It will increase the price, and it will often result in less effective parts (as it often does for the DoD), but you can make an easier argument that cutting NSF funding will take away jobs.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a net win or not, but it would probably get them more funding.')
