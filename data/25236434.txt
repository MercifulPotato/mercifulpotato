For example, if you did contrast enhancement after scanning, you likely cut off some extra dark or extra bright pixels.<p>A regular VAE cannot handle this situation that multiple brightness=0 (black) pixels actually had varying negative brightnesses which were clamped to 0 for technical reasons. A continuous Bernoulli can model 0 really meaning &lt;=0. And 1 meaning &gt;=1.<p>That&#x27;s why with a continuous Bernoulli you get more saturated white and blacks than with just a Bernoulli. See the image in 5.1, for example. That&#x27;s a good thing because it increases contrast, thus making your features better and dependent learning tasks easier.')
