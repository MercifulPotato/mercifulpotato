What benefit would I get from switching? Is it workload-dependent?<p>Presumably because Zstd has much better compression, while still being quite fast.<p>I don&#x27;t see however how that invalidates any of my observations. Some filesystems like e.g. UBIFS support LZ4, but now also support Zstd, because both are suitable for the task (and LZ4 was around earlier).<p>In the end it is a classic space vs. time trade-off and there is AFAIK no generic right or wrong answer (except that some algorithms are <i>too slow</i> to even be considered).')
