The model we follow is called the “design recipe” which teaches students to write the documentation for a function as well as some basic examples and tests, all before writing a single line of code for the function itself. The very first of all these steps is to write the purpose statement which serves to document what a function does. As a teaching tool, it helps the students to organize their thoughts and plan their function before they start.<p>This book is almost 20 years old. It derives from earlier works such as SICP. The concept of writing a purpose statement before you write any code is not a new idea at all. But it seems to be a very good idea. If you can’t write one sentence describing what problem your function solves then you’re probably not ready to start writing it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Design_Programs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Design_Programs</a>')
