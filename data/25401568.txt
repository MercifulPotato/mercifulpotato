Item(by='rawrenstein', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607806175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401396, text='Channels can&#x27;t monetize &quot;Adult Content&quot; according to &quot;Advertiser-friendly content guidelines&quot; from YouTube [1]. Each video I encountered was clearly marked by AI for such content. It requires human intervention to successfully verify a claim that the content is educational. I doubt most of these spam  YouTube accounts are doing this. (I&#x27;m claiming spam because separate accounts are copying and pasting the same video descriptions.) It&#x27;s sad to see really. Naked yoga is really great outside of this exploitation. Videos with no verbal instructions and non-instructional shots of genitalia kill the spirit of the practice. Such a shame.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6162278?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6162278?hl=en</a>')
