I didn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;m defining powerful in the same sense the article defines it.<p>My argument in response to your reply is to say there is no reasonable alternate definition and people people are using the term because of an incorrect notion that haskell has more expressive power then say c++ when in fact it has much less expressive power.<p>I put &quot;if you reply at all&quot; to acknowledge the fact that I could&#x27;ve went into a long expose into something and you could just ignore it as an optional retort. My reply is anticipating all possible logical counters. I also wanted to emphasize the fact that I do not believe an alternate definition is reasonable but I am aware that it is the most likely reasoning you will be using in your response. I am letting you know that I am already aware of it. It saves the discussion from going down an avenue of things we already are aware of.<p>I did not anticipate you to go meta and talk about the discussion itself but maybe I should&#x27;ve as I sort of boxed you out of all other alternative paths. I personally think it&#x27;s unnecessary to go here still. If you disagree stay on topic and propose why you think an alternate definition is reasonable. If you agree you can still stay on topic by conceding I&#x27;m right... but human nature prevents 99 percent of all people from ever conceding as conceding is subconsciously perceived to be a form of weakness. By probability, I am hypothesizing that you are within this 99 percent and that you will likely never take this path as an option in your next reply, if you reply at all.')
