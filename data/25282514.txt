I can confirm Delta-8-THC at least will definitely get you very high. It feels slightly different than D9 but it is honestly hard to describe exactly how. Some describe it as being better for people that get anxious on d9 but I have also heard the opposite. I have seen some reports of people having really bad times from eating a ton of candies. Similar problems as with normal edibles, so regulators will feel compelled to step in. Mixing in a little bit of cbd or other cannabinoids seems to enhance the experience and make it more like normal flower.')
