Reproduction needs to involve the interaction of human brain meats with a human level description of the solution.  This is how we make sure that people aren&#x27;t talking about something different than what was actually done, and how we make sure our conclusions are robust against the things we&#x27;ve failed to specify.<p>Imagine saying the same thing for physics: I start replication by running a time machine and using the same apparatus as the original experiment under the same conditions.  Impracticality aside, this would be potentially useful to suss out fraud and certain kinds of errors, but what successful replication tells is is manifestly less powerful than successful replication on a new apparatus in a new location at a new time, with new values for everything we&#x27;ve failed to control.')
