That&#x27;s the entire point of the article, we don&#x27;t know the situations that set off currency debasement well enough. We all assume that there will at least be some period of normal inflation first, before we get to hyperinflation though.<p>When we have become the global currency, there is also great risk when we do not have enough dollars and treasury bills out there. Because the world&#x27;s savings are pretty much equivalent to our &quot;debt.&quot;  As there is more wealth in the world and as more of that wealth is held in US dollars or in US T-bills, if we do not continue to deficit spend, or somehow get more money supply, there are other risks too.')
