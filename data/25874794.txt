Our condo building is just over 100 years old and has 2 parking spots for 6 units (we&#x27;re not one of the lucky ones). We&#x27;d love to own an EV, but it&#x27;s just not practical.<p>This gets to my big complaint with companies like Tesla. They designed an impressive, game changing EV, but their solution ecosystem works best if you have a home with a garage in the suburbs. I don&#x27;t have a garage to install a Tesla Powerwall that&#x27;s charged by a Tesla Solar Roof for me to park a Model S.<p>If Tesla wanted to truly address climate change and get more electric transportation to more people, they&#x27;d solve city charging and start designing commuter transit.')
