Air density is a non-linear function as well- it gets very thick near the ground.<p>To put all your energy into maximizing your speed while you&#x27;re at ground level (the spin launcher) you&#x27;re wasting huge amounts of energy just pushing air out of the way. At hypersonic speeds, you&#x27;<p>Rockets, by contrast, go their slowest at ground level and continually accelerate as they get higher. In SpaceX launches, they actually have a period where they throttle back as they go through &quot;Max-Q&quot;, the highest aerodynamic pressure point, as it&#x27;s more efficient to be slower until you&#x27;re past this point.<p>I guess using electrical energy, which is a much cheaper source than chemicals like rocket fuel, makes the payoff worthwhile? I dunno, I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>Oh also you can only launch this somewhere that no one around will mind an insane sonic boom at ground level.')
