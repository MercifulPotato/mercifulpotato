I think the bulk of the common search queries and information on the web (that isn&#x27;t exotic and super-unique) is accumulated at any one point by a handful of websites (think 100-1000-10000?).<p>It&#x27;s highly conceivable that one could get a completely novel and diverse web and search experience if we were to exclude those concentrated websites entirely from search results. At that point, google can no longer slide on just showing the top results from a tiny subset of their index, and would be forced to always show results from the entire index. As opposed to now where 99.9% of the time, they mostly show you results from that smaller subset and 0.1% of the time show you the rest (that is of course only if you have a super-specific query or you force them with some of their remaining search modifiers).')
