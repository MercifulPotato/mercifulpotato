I know what I&#x27;m talking about. A declaratory judgement suit is in my view the proper avenue to address a tenuous IP claim.<p>Like I said, tortious interference is not a great fit, but it&#x27;s still applicable - interference with my contract with Github counts as interference. If it was an actual DMCA notice then the only remedy would be a 512(f) suit (plus declaratory judgement) because DMCA preempts other causes of action (caveat: [0]), but it&#x27;s not a DMCA notice.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;8166790&#x2F;tech-and-goods-inc-v-30-watt-holdings-llc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;8166790&#x2F;tech-and-goods-...</a> here&#x27;s a recent decision where a tortious interference claim was upheld when a false infringement claim was made to a third party (Amazon in this case).
