That&#x27;s a strategy that makes sense for a game streaming app like Stadia or Steam Link where every frame of latency matters, but for a movie&#x2F;TV streaming app it really doesn&#x27;t.<p>The point is that there was never any good reason to make the Netflix app so timing-dependent.  Had Netflix not done this they wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed.<p>---<p>That said, if a company was releasing an Android 5.0 powered device in late 2017 when Android 8.0 had already been released I can&#x27;t help but say they brought this on themselves by being idiotically out of date.  There&#x27;s no excuse for launching a device with an OS three years and three versions out of date.<p>Everybody in this story is doing really dumb things.')
