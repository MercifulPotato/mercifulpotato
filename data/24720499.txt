GP and I could design the bet with assumptions like &quot;most of the US&quot; and &quot;good weather&quot; but that&#x27;s riddled with issues from a contractual standpoint.<p>So how about it has to take GP from his home to a destination 100+ miles away, the car has to park itself in a legal spot, and it must reverse at least once during the trip?  And I&#x27;d like to see it done at least 3x, including once when it&#x27;s not perfect weather (could be foggy, moderate rain, light snow - whatever).')
