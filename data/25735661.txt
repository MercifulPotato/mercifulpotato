Do your contacts get updated or what? What happens to people with your old number?<p>If your phone breaks, and you get a new one, how do they handle backups? (My iPhone&#x27;s WhatsApp backups somehow disappeared when I got a droid.)<p>These questions are particularly infuriating for digital nomads and people living abroad. I want an inexpensive cheap way to keep my US number I&#x27;ve had for 10 years. I&#x27;ve also heard horror stories that Google Voice (or Fi? Can&#x27;t figure it out) will shut down your account if you live internationally.')
