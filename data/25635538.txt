Item(by='ascagnel_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609784196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25633703, text='&gt; SC4 has some rudimentary water pollution mechanics with agriculture being among the worst polluters. It was pretty easy to avoid just by having a separate water towers or pumps for your farms and city and make sure you didn&#x27;t connect the two systems.<p>That&#x27;s there, but it was pretty dumb -- it didn&#x27;t take terrain topology into account, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about making sure agricultural zones didn&#x27;t wash into rivers&#x2F;lakes&#x2F;oceans that might otherwise be used for water supply.<p>&gt; The Network Addon Mod (NAM) addressed most of the transportation issues I have with SC4. I remember having a mod that had road&#x2F;bus and road&#x2F;subway combo stations but I&#x27;m not sure if it was part of NAM or not.<p>While I love modding in general, I think something so fundamental as being able to put up a &quot;bus stop here&quot; road sign should be included in the default game.  As it exists, a bus stop or subway entrance take up as much space as a small home.<p>The NAM is a great mod if you&#x27;re looking to get into SC4 today, but it really should be included in any new release for the knock-on compatibility benefits (you don&#x27;t have to worry about another mod somehow breaking NAM).<p>&gt; Mixed use zoning would be amazing, absolutely. Without it, it makes designing Main St and walkable cities nearly impossible. This kind of medium density zoning is something that SimCity has always been bad at. Somehow I think Cities Skylines is even worse at it.<p>Skylines is definitely worse at it.  The base game is a little too bare-bones for me (generally, I like games where the simulation is a state machine where you can tweak inputs vs directly messing with it), and the transportation options are lacking even when compared to SC4.  I&#x27;ve tried to get into it a few times, but I keep bouncing off.')
