What I said is not ethnocentric (you&#x27;re presuming I&#x27;m American or white?) or asinine.<p>You&#x27;re not considering the historical consequences of your perspective. And I made no such claim that China is the root cause of the arms race, that&#x27;s a strawman.<p>Historical counterfactual: What would&#x27;ve happened in WW2 in Asia if the US had no aircraft carriers because some pacifists convinced the administration that investing in arms was just tit for tat tribalism and contributing to an arms race?<p>If you can&#x27;t explain why the US should not invest in drones today but they should&#x27;ve invested in aircraft carriers in the 1930s and 1940s, then you&#x27;re holding a sack filled with little more than misplaced confidence.')
