Does Twitter take down that content as soon as there is a complaint? Does it have to wait for some legal action to start or finish? What is the recourse if something is taken down and later found to be legal content?<p>We have the DMCA to cover this... however it&#x27;s currently an extremely broken process. While there is a penalty codified for making claim to something you don&#x27;t own, it is never enforced. That part of it needs to change and the regulation should then act in the manner it was designed to.')
