CPI is about measuring consumables that one needs to live: food, shelter (either rent or mortgage carrying costs), utilities, clothing, etc. If you want to measure something outside of this basket of goods, then use another word, because &quot;inflation&quot; &#x2F; CPI is already taken and you&#x27;re overloading it and causing confusion by conflating different things.<p>This &quot;index&quot; is garbage. Please see &quot;Inflation Truthers&quot;:<p>&gt; <i>But if we take away the outlier 2020 data points, the average real annual GDP growth from 2010-2019 was 2.3%. The inflation rate in that time averaged roughly 1.8% per year.</i><p>&gt; <i>If you’re one of the conspiracy people who believe inflation has actually been running at 5-6% per year, that would assume the economy has been contracting by 1-3% per year over the past 10 years.</i><p>&gt; <i>And if you’re a full tinfoil hat person who assumes inflation is actually 10-12% per year, that’s like saying we’ve been in a full-blown depression and the economy has lost 80% of its value.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;awealthofcommonsense.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;inflation-truthers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;awealthofcommonsense.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;inflation-truthers&#x2F;</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25644580" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25644580</a><p>So if the GDP grew &quot;only&quot; ~2.5%, then any inflation above that (as the &#x27;truthers&#x27; claim), would mean were actually in a recession&#x2F;depression for the last decade… which makes no sense. If inflation is &gt;5% (per the truthers), then the economic growth would have had to been <i>on top of that</i>, for a nominal growth rate of &gt;7%.<p>Has anyone been claiming a US GDP growth of 7% or more?')
