They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re a publicly offered service. That means being non-discriminatory.<p>And I&#x27;m not saying they can&#x27;t moderate, just that it can&#x27;t be based on political affiliation or views, any more than it could be based on the users race.<p>&gt;The purpose of any website is completely arbitrary and determined by the creators.<p>They can call it what they want, but if they operate it as the town square, it&#x27;s the town square. The same way that a trail over private land becomes an irrevocable public right-of-way, if the land owner doesn&#x27;t prevent it from being used. Private rights are forfeited by not treating them as private.<p>Regardless, twitter openly admits it&#x27;s purpose is public discourse, and designs it such that it encourages confrontational engagement.<p>&gt;trespassing laws to arrest Marsh for distribution of religious pamphlets<p>You say tomato, I say being removed \nfrom privately held, but publicly accessable property based only on the content of speech.<p>Getting kicked off the platform today is functionally equivalent to last centuries trespassing arrest&#x2F;removal.<p>Forced removal from a defacto public forum for speech.')
