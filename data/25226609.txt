The Switch isn&#x27;t exactly the beefiest hardware to begin with, but there is a noticeable improvement in the gameplay compared to even just the Wii U version.<p>My favorite game of all time is Chrono Trigger, released in 1995 on the SNES, but part of what made Chrono Trigger special was that many of the game scenarios were hand tuned, down to the placement of enemies on screen and the ways they interacted with you. It is a fun and immersive game, and I still play it every now and then, but you can see the limitations of the original hardware in the game and how much more the all-star crew (seriously, think the Dream Team but for JRPGs, never to be replicated again) could have done with the game with just one generation more of improvements in the hardware.')
