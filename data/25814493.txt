Although entitled to their own opinions, they should not be doing a review on the topic.\n(We leave out the complexity of lists &#x2F; arrays being available in Python, NumPy etc from this discussion).<p>Such a statement in a programming book review would be quickly called out by the programming community a) because it is false and b) potentially harmful information (for new-comers).<p>Despite some opinions that literature, literature analysis and criticism are artsy-fartsy hand-wavy activities, there is significant rigor involved in studying literature seriously.This, as I wrote, involves character analysis.<p>If the guardian reviewer, or whoever made the surname mistake, had done literature studies involving Russian literature, they would be aware of the surname usage specifics.<p>It is as big a tell as the above programming example. It has nothing to do with being able to speak Russian. As I wrote, it is a common topic of interest to readers of Russian literature in translation.<p>I have participated in multiple book-clubs and was briefly a TA on a Russian literature class (taught in English). We had a hand-out, updated from the 60s, on the topic, as it almost always got brought up by attentive readers.')
