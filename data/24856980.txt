Union types in protocol payloads - the spec calls these &quot;polymorphic JSON&quot;, but the reality is you will need to branch on type of a given field. Worse, nothing prevents having two or more subtly different dictionaries in the same field, based on arbitrary&#x2F;implicit conditions.<p>Subtle and surprising payload differences are pretty much guaranteed to introduce weird problems in the real world. And I&#x27;m not ruling out security problems either, because a bug in authorisation logic can easily generate tokens that are valid for wrong scopes.')
