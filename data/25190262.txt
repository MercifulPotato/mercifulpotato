People love to evangelize about k8s more than your average tech but it&#x27;s just one (IMHO overkill) way to do things. A better bet I think is to leverage tools from cloud providers. They specifically offer many different easy to use scaling platforms for a premium for small&#x2F;not experienced teams. Heroku has been mentioned a bunch, something like Elastic Beanstalk on AWS is super easy for the first year or two of a company. Or just go for a single machine somewhere and worry about the 5% chance you need more than that when that happens.')
