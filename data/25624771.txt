Start to advertise this in just one country to one demographics, and look how many out-of-target orders you get.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s even enough if you simply just sell it via mail order, you can then look at the addresses.<p>There&#x27;s probably a natural information spread in any market (word of mouth, trade magazines), and there&#x27;s probably a physical dispersion of the target group of people too (people move, visitors&#x2F;tourists saw the ad&#x2F;product and order it at home), but it still should be a valuable to see how much effect just one campaign has.<p>Maybe one of the best products for this could be a car. They are pretty standard, really not much difference between them, they are in all price ranges, and regularly new models come out. Advertise one in a few major US cities but don&#x27;t in others.')
