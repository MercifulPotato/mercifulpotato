For example, substitute &quot;Best Buy&quot; for App Store.<p>Can I tell my customers that 30% of the price of their widget goes to Best Buy at purchase? No, that&#x27;s privileged information in the contract.<p>When my widget is on a shelf at Best Buy, can I advertise a lower price at Amazon.com on the box? No, of course not. They&#x27;d never place it on their shelves.<p>If I have to redesign my packaging so Best Buy can put a spider wrap around it, do I get to bitch about that to my customers? Nope, just a cost of doing business. It&#x27;s &quot;irrelevant&quot; information to the customer.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting this justifies their behavior. It&#x27;s just an analogy that happens to fit Apple&#x27;s world view of their App Store.')
