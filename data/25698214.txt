You had prominent, important elected officials accusing those that disagree with that assessment of &quot;carrying water for Putin&quot;, &quot; doing the bidding of a dictator&quot;, things like that. You had many of the same people calling for unrest in the streets until Donald Trump is removed from office.<p>If that isn&#x27;t a sustained effort to paint the 2016 election as illegitimate I don&#x27;t know what is.')
