Would the wider world be very much worse off if we had no Bitcoin or stock exchanges?<p>&gt; <i>without the ultimate judge of time at the stock market, there would be no stock market</i><p>I&#x27;m also not sure about that. Yes, in principle, time is a good arbiter - however the descision to follow that rule down to microsecond precision seems like a deliberate choice to allow HFT. The article mentions front running as an attack on the trading system that would occur with inaccurate timekeeping. However, seems to me this could be circumvented: e.g., if an exchange wanted to ensure fairness but also prevent HFT (and the associated technology arms race), they could bucket orders by e.g. second resolution and then execute the orders in a bucket in random ordering. This will give predictable ordering at second resolution but would make front-running or racing impossible as the sub-second ordering would be unpredictable.')
