Who knows that you did so?  I personally find it very implausible that in both elections that Trump was in he produced results about 3% better than polls indicated he would.  And both times alleged that the other side was cheating.  So much so that pollsters are engaged with asking how they are so wrong when Trump is on the ballot.<p>You know the old saw that cheaters always accuse others of cheating?  What does that suggest about Trump?')
