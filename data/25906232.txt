My newer macs - mainly a 2019 15&quot; - have some truly bizarre behaviors around these. One example is that if I switch 3.5mm audio cables too quickly it starts routing audio to my HDMI monitor instead. Macs still can&#x27;t control the volume of HDMI audio out so that means I get hit with a max volume blast. I have to detach one cable, wait 60 seconds, and attach the other to avoid this.<p>Like the author describes, activating the mic on bluetooth headsets on my mac - airpods or 3rd party - brings the audio bitrate down to a quality comparable to AM radio. Strangely, I can use the airpods to make calls on my Android phone with little issue.<p>Audio aside, I routinely encounter bluetooth devices that just won&#x27;t work with my mac. For example keyboards that send just a few keystrokes then bug out or mice that lag and teleport all over the screen.<p>The most infuriating part is that I can attach a USB bluetooth adapter and use it instead of the builtin mac one and all of these problems go away. But am I going to carry around a port adapter and a dongle so I can use a feature that I paid for in my laptop anyway? As if. Furthermore none of these accessories have trouble with other computers - even older macs!<p>&#x2F;rant')
