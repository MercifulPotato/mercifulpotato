Kathy was suspended from Twitter for what she did. Most <i>targeted</i> calls for violence lands you a suspension on Twitter.<p>The reason you feel like one side is given the benefit of the doubt isn’t rooted in reality, at least on Twitter - it’s just far more likely for the other side of the political spectrum to whip up a media frenzy about free speech. And your point about one side being more likely to carry acts of violence out also seems ignorant of what’s happening today. There is only one political leaning that has resulted in people showing up armed to pizza places or trying to kidnap a governor.<p>It’s difficult to understand why you bend over so hard to make excuses for Bannon, when the guy who he was “joking” about has had to literally hire bodyguards for much of the past year.')
