I might have come across as an EV hater. I&#x27;m not one. I do appreciate the technology and acknowledge that it&#x27;s the future. I was pointing out some of the flaws. I don&#x27;t argue against the torque figures and everyone knows that EVs have more torque. Even the base model Teslas are faster off the line compared to some of the ICE super cars. I&#x27;m hopeful that we generate electricity from more renewable sources than burning coal or gas, which defeats the whole purpose. Long charging times, range anxiety and battery longevity are real issues for customers. I don&#x27;t know if durability of electric motors for these sort of applications haven been proven yet. Hydrogen based EVs can fix most of these problem. But only if we can create Hydrogen more efficiently.')
