Its network gives it value (users, wallets, hardware, aka usage and adoption).<p>Ex: Facebook is the most valuable social network on the internet. Forking FB&#x27;s source code and starting my own social network does not mean anyone will use it. FB is valuable because it works, and because users are there.')
