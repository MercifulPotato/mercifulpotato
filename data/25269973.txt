Even something like the Volume buttons that on Linux with DWM I had to manually map to amixer they just work. Of course there are some trade-offs. Bluetooth is a big one that might not work for people. Overall compared to FreeBSD the setup was dead simple with hardly any work. I know people complain about speed on OBSD, but I have not noticed it being that much slower. I am in love and don&#x27;t see myself hopping again for a while (famous last words obviously).')
