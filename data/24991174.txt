I have been running one of those FlightFeeders for over a year now. Antenna mounted on the roof at 11m above ground. As an EE I can say those feeders have much better hardware than average Pi+RTL-SDR+wire. Thanks to a very good GNSS receiver inside I can also now tell exactly where my house is at any time ;). Have you also tried to use the data from GPS  network for any other purpose than flight tracking (seismology, atmospheric studies)?')
