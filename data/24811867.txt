Anything more complex&#x2F;verifiable than napkin math, and I&#x27;ll just use something more serious like Python&#x2F;Julia, Matlab, any CAS, or whatever engineering&#x2F;math software I have at my disposal.<p>So for me, a proper calculator, a tool you master to augment your napkin math, should focus on this:<p>- Keyboard. Absolutely lowest number of keypresses to enter the problem; the thing that is totally lacking in most non-classic calculators. I can&#x27;t stress this enough. I should be able to enter all those sophisticated functions without typing their full name and parens. Simple ODEs&#x2F;integrals should be at my fingertips. I should be able to quickly repeat binary operators for a different argument, and 1&#x2F;x anything I have on the screen without breaking the flow (on-the-fly calculation often conflicts with that). And many more tricks classic calculators had, which are missing from most modern apps.<p>- Startup time. It should pop up in less than 100ms. Modern phones and computers are very good at that, but apps sometimes aren&#x27;t.<p>- Correctness! It sounds silly, but you can&#x27;t trust most math applications out there, calculators are surprisingly unreliable, even for simple arithmetic and trigonometry calculations. What math libraries did you use? Or why should I trust your results in general?')
