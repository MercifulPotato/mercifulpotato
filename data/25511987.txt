He&#x27;s going to have surgery to remove the growth and a neutering to prevent it from coming back.<p>He was probably a lot more to handle because of not neutering him but it worked for us. Next time I think I&#x27;d go ahead with the procedure. He&#x27;ll be just as awesome and will fit into society better.')
