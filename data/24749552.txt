Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602454444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745136, text='&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why this is such a big deal now<p>because, as the article points out, the actor in the deepfake isn&#x27;t going to actually act out what the deefake is later going to produce. So this makes creating nefarious content possible by letting the actor read something harmless and then replacing voice and appearance with say, a scam or whatever else. You could hire an actor to read something random and then use deepfakes to make it look like a kidnapping to extort someone or whatever.<p>If you hire an actual human for the entire thing you&#x27;d have to clue them in, and pretty much every commercial business is probably going to not participate in something criminal. Deepfakes probably could scale one innocent performance up to thousands of potential malicious ones.<p>You know these scams where old people are being called and told that their grandson had an accident and you need to wire them money? Imagine that with video footage and 100% fidelity.')
