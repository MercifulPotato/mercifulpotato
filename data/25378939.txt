In a similar sense I feel there is a continuum of &quot;something&quot; and disabled. I don&#x27;t really know what to call the &quot;something&quot; end of the disability continuum that would be analogous to &quot;hurt&quot; rather then &quot;injured&quot;. For me I&#x27;ll call it &quot;inconvenienced&quot; but I choose that word for me not to insinuate or inflame others.<p>Serving in Afghanistan, I was &quot;hurt&quot; on many occasions and &quot;injured&quot; once. That injury left a very visible scar on my face, migraine like headaches and some hearing loss.<p>Am I disabled? I would say no. I can do everything I have always been able to do. The scar is a conversation starter and the rest is manageable. I view it that I am &quot;inconvenienced&quot; rather than &quot;disabled&quot;.<p>I would say, in general, if you are not sure if you feel you are disabled (even if you have been diagnosed) then I would say you are not.<p>Again, that is just my view and I don&#x27;t offer it to be combative or diminish someone else&#x27;s plight.')
