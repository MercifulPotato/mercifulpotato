Gitlab sells itself as a full-remote global-hiring company and there are plenty of others.\nWith Covid and everything the exception now is being physically in the office.\nI don’t expect things to go back to how they were ever.<p>If you’re being hired for a remote role then at most salary could vary according to time zone, perhaps a small difference due to taxation issues.<p>Paying 40% more to get the same value from someone living in SF has no possible justification (from a business pov) if you’re hiring for a global remote position (which is what Gitlab does)<p>If there’s actually a business reason someone living in SF might add more value they should hire locally.<p>This all sounds like a lame way of ratinalizing paying more to some employees who happen to live in SF (early hires likely) while pretending everyone is treated the same according to some equation.')
