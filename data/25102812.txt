How did they ruin it?&quot;<p>But in reality I think it&#x27;s a good update, although perhaps not as &quot;monumental&quot; as shocking headlines call it.<p>&gt; Ruby 3 is Fast<p>This seems like an answer to the common Ruby naysayer&#x27;s chant: &quot;But Ruby is slooow&quot;. We shouldn&#x27;t pay attention to those people anyway. They don&#x27;t understand the speed&#x2F;expressability tradeoff, or are just trolling.<p>Why should we want &quot;fast&quot;? Is your ruby app doing a lot of processing? Well, it shouldn&#x27;t be. That&#x27;s what C++ gems are for. Go use them. You&#x27;ll never be even a fraction as fast as C++, so while meager improvements are good, don&#x27;t bet the company on Ruby getting faster in 4.0 and 5.0.<p>&gt; Ruby 3 is Easy<p>Really confused by this one. Was there a problem with RVM? Was RVM not easy? What is this &quot;gem dependency hell&quot;? This sounds like it was totally fabricated to have another bullet point in the list. Also how is the &quot;fancy-pants&quot; RVM&#x2F;rbenv-clone going to help with &quot;praying a gem compiles&quot;? Does it use a smarter C++ compiler? (Joking)<p>&gt; Ruby 3 is Sleek<p>These are just reasons Ruby is sleek, even Ruby 1.0! Nothing related to v3 here.<p>&gt; Ruby 3 is Here to Stay<p>This is obvious. But the real point here in this subsection seems to be that Ruby 3 has new features. But what?')
