But I only use it for trades that I can execute over the course of a day. Schwab&#x2F;TOS is probably going to be the best discount broker when they complete the integration. I don’t like IKBR because it’s not that much better than others unless you are a quant. Pick the products you think you want to trade first then pick the brokers. For example, you don’t want to trade on a platform that doesn’t offer futures because you are more than likely to need it later down the road (this is also why some prefer IKBR due to their breadth in products). And make sure you try their mobile apps since most of them are horrible!')
