But, those were just some reasons off the top of my head, i&#x27;m sure when HN was being programmed a bit more thought went into it, or maybe not, who knows?<p>My main point is, I like the simplicity of it all, sure it could be better, but better doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to better quality content.<p>There&#x27;s a minimum amount of distractions, most users find reasonable ways to communicate the context of the content of their posts and scrolling through most threads tends to be a mostly uniform experience where if users are following a few established conventions, you can follow the flow of things pretty well.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s not the best, but I feel like it fits the general vibe and nature of the site. It gives HN an identity among all the other news aggregators and forums.')
