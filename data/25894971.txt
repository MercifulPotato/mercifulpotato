The byproduct is a ton of brine.  Sea water contains about 3ppb Uranium, so our brine contains 6mg of U per ton of fresh water produced.<p>A 1GW nuclear power station consumes about 1t of U per year and produces about 8000GWh of electricity in that time.  So we need about 1mg&#x2F;8kWh.  We got 12 times that much.<p>So, it sort of works out.  Of course, this assumes a breeder reactor and I pretended that brine is purified uranium.  If breeders are commercialized, it might be worth looking into this.  Right now, it isn&#x27;t.')
