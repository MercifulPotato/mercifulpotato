Just go to the danish subreddit and see how the average dane has been subverted into being a conformist who redicules anyone who dares ask questions that oppose the official talking points. (Argue against the handling of the mink scandal, the mask enforcement etc and you get ousted and rediculed even though there really is no counter arguements to whatever you say. Its just easier to redicule than address arguements).')
