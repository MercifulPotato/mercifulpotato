(In the USA. See mea culpa at end.)<p>Why: How does a patient grant access (consent) if they are incapacitated? Like during an ER visit?<p>More: How does a patient manage that consent for all the other care providers? Can a patient ever retract the consent?<p>Source: Implemented 5 regional healthcare medical records exchanges in the mid-aughts. My teammates handled the web portal for accessing same data. The &quot;break the glass&quot; edge use case, where care providers bypassed the consent, was ~80% of daily usage. Because that&#x27;s the reality of healthcare.<p>Mea culpa: Haven&#x27;t yet found the tech specs for TBL&#x27;s Solid. Maybe it does something new. Like translucent data store with centralized key authority. (Something we considered; would be practical at the NHS, where patients have GUIDs.) I reserve the right to change my position.')
