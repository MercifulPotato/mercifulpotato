It seems like a perfectly reasonable question. You have a lot of people who are protesting and some who are even rioting on the pretense that racism is driving police to kill blacks in greater proportion than other races--surely they must have a good reason to think that it&#x27;s racism and not crime rates or some other factor that <i>correlates</i> with race? It doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to want some assurance that there&#x27;s a good reason our cities are being burned and looted.<p>&gt; Besides, it&#x27;s actually irrelevant; those deaths are statistics. What was demanded was prosecutions of specific police for specific shootings of specific, named people such as Breonna Taylor.<p>Nope, &quot;racial disparities in police killings&quot; was frequently and ubiquitously cited as a motivation for the protests and riots. There was some back pedaling from some people that this isn&#x27;t actually about race, but <i>Black</i> lives matter is actually just a generic movement against police brutality; however, that&#x27;s plainly a farce.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s up to the white community to decide if police shootings of white people are too frequent, not frequent enough, or whatever. That is irrelevant to the BLM question.<p>What &quot;white community&quot;? Why should other people who have nothing but pigmentation in common with me decide the likelihood of me being killed by police? Why should we want &#x27;race&#x27; to be a factor (as opposed to a correlation) in police killings at all? What is &quot;the BLM question&quot; if not &quot;why are blacks killed disproportionately than whites&quot;?')
