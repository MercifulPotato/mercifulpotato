I&#x27;ve dated liberals and I&#x27;ve dated conservatives. Well I still vote, I&#x27;m not nearly as political as I used to be. I don&#x27;t use social media ( including online dating) , if only because I found people to be insanely mean. I don&#x27;t want to be called slurs when discussing politics, and that&#x27;s what happens online. Now if I&#x27;m at a bar, I might actually even buy a voter from the other team a beer. I can see his or her humanity. Online the other team is literally a group of evil villains who want to destroy all that is good in the world. And I&#x27;m at the point where I think social media needs to be heavily regulated to stop society from imploding. It&#x27;s just too powerful, too harmful of a tool as is.')
