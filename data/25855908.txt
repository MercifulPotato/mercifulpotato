Not to say that open-source firmware is undesirable, but they won&#x27;t need to be part of an OS installation necessarily.<p>Good Intel Wireless drivers are in the Linux kernel. Mediatek it depends on the chipset, and Realtek only has a crappy free one that will have issues with newer devices. Qualcomm I don&#x27;t have much experience with.<p>Sounds like you know this already, but I think many people are confused about drivers vs firmware - I know I was way back, at least.')
