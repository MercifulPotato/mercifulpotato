Still one of my top-favorite games ever.  I was so into it, I printed out guides and read them when I couldn&#x27;t actively play the game.  I started to memorize the different &quot;pill-taking&quot; layouts so I could easily take a base so quickly and flawlessly.  Well, needless to say my skills weren&#x27;t too useful because I wasn&#x27;t able to arrange AppleTalk games of Bolo very often... but when we played, I usually destroyed!!!  hahaha :)   Ahh, such a great game.  :)')
