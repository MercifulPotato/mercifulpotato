Just look at kernel contributions [1]. I think same applies to most of the infrastructure, someone works on FreeType, Cairo, Pango, etc.<p>In such case <i>disjoint</i> between users and developers is even further. I am professional developer, yet I have zero contributions to my framework and just a few contributions to libraries. After 10 years my contributions to Linux community limited to bug reports, few patches and manuals.<p>In reality there is not enough community support to maintain existing systems. &quot;Freedom to take a project in another direction if they desired&quot; by individual is overrated, that&#x27;s TempleOS.<p>EDITED: Some bragging about making a difference<p>There are a lot of projects with less corporate influence. No systemd on BSD, but hardware support is not as good. Generic distributions is something that works for most of the users. There are a lot of niche distributions and projects (Void Linux runit!). Current state is just a reflection of users priorities.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.itsfoss.com&#x2F;huawei-kernel-contribution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.itsfoss.com&#x2F;huawei-kernel-contribution&#x2F;</a>')
