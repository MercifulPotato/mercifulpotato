Or how jazz musicians are expected to pick up a tune on the spot even if they don&#x27;t know it. The key to this seems to be that most jazz progressions are based on circle of fifths, or interlocking cells of CoF progressions. This would imply that there is a grammar of jazz chord sequences that experienced musicians use to play or fake a massive amount of repertoire without having to cram rote learning every day.')
