(Prior to getting the software, you cannot tell how it is going to be implemented.)<p>There is a measurable cost <i>to me</i> for using these “lazy” apps:<p>- time and data plan spent downloading and updating these monsters<p>- my disk space (yes, my previous laptop <i>ran out of space</i>, which is hard to accept when you see “simple” apps using hundreds of megabytes)<p>- my battery life and utility bill (it is easy to measure the absurd CPU use of some of these things)<p>I am literally subsidizing your development with my own resources, because you couldn’t be bothered to create something that is at least <i>moderately</i> optimized for users.')
