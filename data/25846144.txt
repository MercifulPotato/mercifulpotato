It&#x27;s quite common to have long-ish dialogue scenes with lower-grade animation, and save the high-quality work on scenes with interesting things to look at happening on the screen.<p>As an example, the final conversation between Okabe and FB in Steins;Gate is really not good animation, but it is crucial to the plot, and the dialogue and voice acting still make it a very impactful scene.')
