So you tell them &quot;you can get the source from foo:&#x2F;&#x2F;bar.baz&#x2F;phaf&quot; ... this just has to be a publically accessible address with no additional authentication or authorization. You are not required to announce this in any way other than in the written offer which accompanies the object&#x2F;executable.<p>So, although in theory any third party has access to the source code, you are not being required to put it in a publically visible location, merely a publically accessible one.<p>[EDIT: I was saying that GPLv3 also does not have transitivity,so we agree about that ]<p>[EDIT: I admit that I am misleading in my final sentence ... yes, any third party has the right to access the source code, but you are not required to notify &quot;any third party&quot; of this fact, only those you gave the object&#x2F;executable to. ]')
