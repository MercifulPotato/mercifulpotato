I believe most sports fans and participants want sports to remain free of exogenous performance enhancing drugs.<p>The second: the situation you describe would disadvantage everyone who does not engage in maximizing their use of such PEDs, and the sport in question would rapidly be transformed from what it is now into something vastly different, as the people willing to ingest these modifications would quickly displace the ones that aren&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t embrace the practice as fully.<p>That may be fine for you, but it is a big change, and many people like it the way it is now.<p>Personally, I agree with you. There should probably be a drugs league where people get as insanely artificially enhanced as human bodies can support, I might even watch that. But it&#x27;s absolutely silly to equate that to what is happening today because &quot;today&#x27;s athletes are not natural&quot;.  It&#x27;s not the same thing at all.')
