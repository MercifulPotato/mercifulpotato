It could only make simple text pages.<p>Then the internet revolution of the 1990s happened, and everyone wanted to put make their webpage look like a glossy pamphlet.  So along came extra HTML tags, and the widespread abuse of &lt;TABLE&gt; and other tags added to HTML to make web pages look like glossy pamphlets.<p>At the same time, CSS was developed so the HTML could stay clean and maintainble, and the layout of the “glossy pamphlet” look was in a separate file.  HTML + CSS wasn’t designed to make an interactive app.  It was designed to make a magazine article or an online resume.  One would use Java (1990s) or Flash (first 2000s decade) for anything interactive.<p>It was in the 2010s, long after Java applets stopped being widely supported, and when Flash was too proprietary and too insecure, that the ability to make a fully interactive app was tacked on to Javascript; this was not the original intent of Javascript nor of CSS.<p>So, there is no real underlying design.  It was something hacked on to a standard designed to share text documents.<p>If Steve Jobs were alive today, I think Apple or someone else would create a new interactive standard without all of the baggage of HTML + CSS + Javascript.  It’s like the problem we have had for years, where a modern x86_64 chip is a 64-bit extension of a 32-bit extension of an originally 16-bit chip; it’s only now with the M1 that we are <i>finally</i> using a more elegant and well-designed chip architecture for desktop computers.')
