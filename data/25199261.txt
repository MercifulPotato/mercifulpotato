Git stats have been used against me on performance reviews even though there&#x27;s no context to the situation. I went from a programming role to an ops role because the ops person left the team and I was the only one left that could do the work, so my number of check-ins dropped, but my contributions that improved the ops section weren&#x27;t acknowledged.<p>Any company can create bad metrics if they want. The only solution is to either play the game, or change companies.<p>That said, I fail to see how effective employee monitoring would be via Office 365. I don&#x27;t know who would be evaluated on number of emails sent per day, unless they were some sort of support personnel. And if so, they are already being monitored by other means. Any other type of evaluation sounds absurd, ex. number of Word docs opened or created, number of spreadsheets opened, number of presentations created, etc.')
