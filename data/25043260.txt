India is next-door, they have a massive demographic bomb coming because of the one child policy, and buying friends is unsustainable long-term, especially as those friends get wealthier too. This isn&#x27;t to mention internal instability that massive concentration camps are unlikely to solve. We&#x27;ll see what happens I suppose but one thing I do wish is all the best for the Chinese populace.')
