If you&#x27;re building your own desktop PC, then you&#x27;re clearly not comparing it to a laptop.<p>On top of that, Apple charges $300 (in Sweden) for every 8GB of RAM, and $300 for every 500GB of SSD storage you add. The costs quickly even out. Unless you buy the absolute cheapest Mac Mini version, a self-built PC will be cheaper, at least according to the PCs I&#x27;ve built.')
