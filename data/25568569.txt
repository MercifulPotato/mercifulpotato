The GBA SP is the last one that can play GBC games, as it&#x27;s the last one with the 8-bit coprocessor - the DS can play GBA games because it&#x27;s &quot;small&quot; processor is the same, but it can no longer play GBC games. The 3DS can no longer play GBA games as they no longer physically fit.')
