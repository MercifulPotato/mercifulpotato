TBH, given the behaviour (public email saying &quot;stop working on what mgmt asks you to, it doesn&#x27;t really matter!&quot; and email to manager saying &quot;do X,Y or I&#x27;ll quit!&quot;) - the way this was handled is not discriminatory, it&#x27;s what would happen to 99% of the employees. She was a star employee and thought it can&#x27;t happen to her, but apparently she overstepped some boundaries.')
