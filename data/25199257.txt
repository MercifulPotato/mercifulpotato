So this explains, why electric cars get a lower range, the faster you guy, the more air resistance they have to overcome vs local driving with less resistance.<p>but what about gass engines.  This is simple: gas engines are inefficient.  they can&#x27;t be configured to produce exactly as much energy as needed (as opposed to a drawing from a battery).  Therefore, at lower speeds, they are producing much more energy than is needed and it gets wasted.  at higher speeds, even though they have to overcome the same amount of more resistance, much less energy is being wasted as more is needed.  This has gone into why so much tech has gone into trying to make gas engines more efficient, from the prius&#x27;s hybrid system, to stop&#x2F;start to deactivating cylinders and on and on.<p>how well did your passat do on local driving?  my guess perhaps 2&#x2F;3 of that number?')
