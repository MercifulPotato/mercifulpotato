The U.S. should be able to look around, realize that they have more important stuff to worry about, and embrace Iran as an economic partner like Europe and China have done.<p>It&#x27;s ok for the U.S. to take the first step and extend an open hand. Go to the Wikipedia page on the &#x27;Reactions to the September 11 attacks.&#x27; The Iranians deserve it on the basis of their behavior in the early days after 9&#x2F;11, and the help they gave the U.S. in the early days of the Afghan War. They&#x27;re not bad people, and have expressed a great deal of kindness to the United States in times of vulnerability.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reactions_to_the_September_11_attacks#Muslim_world_and_Middle_East" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reactions_to_the_September_11_...</a><p>Push soft power aggressively, offer a more prosperous alternative, and you&#x27;ll pull the damn rug right out from under the hard-liner&#x27;s justification for their hold on power.<p>If the U.S. has learned anything from Cuba, it should be that the stupid 60-year embargo didn&#x27;t do anything but keep the Cuban people poor and bitter, and the Castro brothers in power.<p>Our current policy is something dragged up from the Carter administration. It&#x27;s not the seventies anymore.<p>More GitHub. Less John Bolton.')
