Item(by='Daishiman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610303724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711721, text='&gt; Your hand waving is not very convincing. I mean Antifa setup it’s own autonomous zone in Seattle, effectively overthrowing the gov’ts authority (albeit on a small and temporary scale). People were killed there. Is this that not sedition or at least a direct attempt to usurp the gov’ts authority?<p>Were people actually concerned that this movement was going to blow out into a full-on anarchist revolt? Was this based on an idea of an all-out violent revolution? This is the only example where they may be a slight point and even so I&#x27;m not seeing an explicit call to join into this being amplified.<p>&gt; “Protestors” took over a Seattle City Hall and demanded the mayor resign. Is that not disrupting the legitimate legislative process? Isn’t that attempting to force a legitimately elected official out of office?<p>Were they coming in with guns? Did they organize multiple days in advance with the idea of kidnapping legislators? This sounds like infrequent but very much run-on-the-mill instance of protesting.<p>&gt; The point is the left said nothing about about all this violence and rioting and in some cases encouraged it. Said “it was legitimate anger” and therefore authorities shouldn’t try and stop it.<p>This is not true, and I&#x27;m the sort of person that consumes news from people who are not in favor of the current system.  The critique was the violent overreaction of police forces and the fact that while they&#x27;re getting rubber bullets in the head, actually seditious traitors that stormed the Capitol get coddled and kindly asked to leave.<p>_That_ is the double standard. The US has a history of allowing violence by white majorities, visible and obvious in the favorable treatment by police forces and legislators, while disproportionally repressing other forces. The deescalation is reserved for seditionists and white supremacists.')
