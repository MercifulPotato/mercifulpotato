Source: have a Windows box, am repeatedly amazed at how bad it is.  Seriously, it is <i>embarrassing</i> to use Windows.  I think the only reason people enjoy it is the fact that they have not gotten a chance to really spend time in a good tiling window manager on X11&#x2F;GNU&#x2F;Linux.  The GUI is ugly and laggy.  The ads are an insult.  The shells are either childish or stupidly (emphasis on the stupid) verbose, and gratuitously incompatible.<p>There seriously is no comparison: in 2020, Linux is head and shoulders above Windows on the desktop.')
