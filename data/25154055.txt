Sometime in dreams it is a mall-like place, in other dreams it might look and feel more like an old university building with rich, wide, wooden hand rails, stone steps.... Often crowded, always seeming infinite.<p>I have had a fascination with the Kowloon Walled City once I learned about it â€” it seemed to echo my dreams.<p>In these dreams I am both fascinated and frightened. Fascinated I suppose by the possibilities, about exploring. Frightened perhaps by the confusion of it, lacking a reference point, a sense of an inability to return, backtrack and take a different passage.<p>Freud, are you listening?
