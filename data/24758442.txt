For a while I&#x27;ve been thinking that&#x27;s more or less a classic false choice -- this argument that those in the &quot;saving lives&quot; camp are somehow refusing to care about the powerful value in our economy.<p>But I think you save the economy <i>by</i> beating the virus.   People won&#x27;t walk into a crowded and poorly ventilated restaurant until the virus is gone.  Anything that prolongs the virus&#x27;s presence in our country will drag down the economy.   I feel like some of the &quot;pro-economy&quot; people aren&#x27;t sufficiently recognizing that.')
