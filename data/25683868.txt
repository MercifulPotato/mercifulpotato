Talking a quarter million chips or more per year. That&#x27;s just the way the wind blows in their business. Gotta recoup as much R&amp;D expenditure as possible up front. I&#x27;ve worked with them on these sorts of designs. They employ tons of really sharp engineers and still make lots of high quality, very useful chips. You just have to buy enough of them for it to be worth it for TI to work with you.<p>No OSHW application I know of has ever moved enough units to cross this bar. Not even close.')
