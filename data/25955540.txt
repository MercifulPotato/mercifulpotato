I find this sketchy as anything. Why do I need to keep a track of my purchases at a particular shop? Its not like I dont already know which shop sells cheapest bread, I dont want to track it at all.<p>I dont care how I drove or rode because I already did it and know. Keeping track of it for what? So my spouse can keep an eye on me? Or track of children?<p>What this project is &quot;aiming&quot; for is IMO solution to a problem that doesnt exist. Why? To build a market for themselves otherwise all this &quot;smarts&quot; that is thrown with iot is just used for data mining at a mass scale. Only projects like openhab make it selfhosted and your own.<p>Nothing personal about the team behind this but I am not sold. Sorry. I&#x27;d rather my data not be anywhere in the first place than be in a central location which now I have to guard against people. Sorry')
