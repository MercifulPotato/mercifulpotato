I made an app that was somewhat successful (about 2000â‚¬ a month, enough to pay for a students living expenses).<p>Within short time, a chinese speaking developer cloned it. They copied the icon (slighlty different color), they copied the UI, they even copied all the text in the dialog boxes. They released the app with a slightly different name.<p>I contacted Apple to complain about the obvious copyright infringement, but they only forwarded my complaint to the developer. Interestingly enough, the developer actually replied to me. They sent an email threating legal action. I asked them to at least change the icon, and they did. But until today, the rest of the cloned app is still on the app store and competes with my app.<p>It&#x27;s not comparable to your case, since in my case the competitor wasn&#x27;t a scammer, just someone with a very lose interpretation of intellectual property.<p>But it makes me feel that Apple really doesn&#x27;t give a shit what goes on in their store, as long as they make their 30%. (or 15% from small fish like me now)')
