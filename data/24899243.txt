Shasta.&quot; Because the approaches are mostly from Rt. 5, you&#x27;ll have no problem getting a usable response. Another approach from Rt 89 exists, so I don&#x27;t know how you expect Google to know which &quot;mountain pass&quot; you mean. However, should you ask Google &quot;What is the closest gas station to Mt Shasta on Rt 89&quot;, you will get an appropriate response. Should you be approaching from the opposite side of the mountain, unlikely though that is, Rt 5 or Rt 89 would still be the closest<p>3) I don&#x27;t know why you expect a computer to answer this question well at all. I&#x27;m not aware of an API that would track this sort of thing. Google doing this itself, at scale, for any popular destination would be a very large project in ML with a very high error rate: Instagram photos are unlikely to be representative of a whole, the data set for a given location may be sparse, and especially for an outside location it is entirely likely (as I did at a local pumpkin farm) that people at an outside tourist destination will move away from a crowd, remove their mask, and take a nice photo safely, while people in close proximation still adhere to appropriate social distancing. Effective use would also need to be real-time: from day-to-day a given location could attract people that wear masks, and the next day a large group does not, especially in the &gt; 300 square mile area you specified. It is not reasonable to expect this question to be meaningfully answered by either a human or a computer.')
