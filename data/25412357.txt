There&#x27;s a great little tool called ddcutil [1] that allows you to send commands to your monitor via the i2c bus embedded in your HDMI&#x2F;DisplayPort connection, so I tried to write a script to do the monitor input swap on either a key binding or after detecting the appropriate USB event.<p>It <i>almost</i> worked. My monitor only listens to the i2c bus of the selected input, so I need to run this script on both my desktop and laptop rather than just on the desktop. But apparently there was a bug in the way my (TB3) dock handled forwarding of the DP i2c data to the docking host. And by bug, I mean write forwarding was just not implemented in the kernel driver. So ddcutil would work on my laptop with a direct HDMI connection, but not when it was connected via the dock.<p>Anyway, long story short:<p>5.10 fixes this [2], so I&#x27;m particularly excited about this release.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Cable-Matters-Sharing-Computers-Peripherals&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B083JKDNRJ&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Cable-Matters-Sharing-Computers-Perip...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rockowitz&#x2F;ddcutil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rockowitz&#x2F;ddcutil</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;2020&#x2F;9&#x2F;1&#x2F;300" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;2020&#x2F;9&#x2F;1&#x2F;300</a>')
