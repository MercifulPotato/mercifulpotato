The light bulb moment for me was when I read: &quot;prefer composition to inheritance&quot;. Which Wikipedia tells me comes from &quot;Design Patterns&quot; but I&#x27;m pretty sure I remember the argument from &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code.&quot; Obviously it&#x27;s not a hard rule to avoid inheritance, but once I started asking myself, &quot;Is this relationship an is or a has?&quot;, my designs got a lot better. And by better I mean they quit making me angry when I revisited them months later.<p>PS. Highly recommend that book BTW. Especially (and somewhat ironically) for people designing new systems. Everything is eventually legacy. :-)')
