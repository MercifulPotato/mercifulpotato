Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610443427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741314, text='&gt; You appear to no longer be claiming that blasphemy laws were a direct contributor to the holocaust.<p>I&#x27;m claiming that they were a necessary condition. Am I changing my position? No. I&#x27;ve no idea how you came to that.<p>&gt; Yes, widespread antisemitism was a contributor to the holocaust<p>We agree.<p>&gt;  but that wasn&#x27;t primarily or even really particularly due to blasphemy laws<p>In which free speech zone did a similar situation occur? Your statement is pure speculation. At least try attribute things to conditions that are present or have something to compare with to show the contrast.<p>&gt; blaming it, in any significant part, on a lack of free speech, is not something that has any mainstream historic support.<p>I&#x27;d like to know what these mysterious &quot;mainstream&quot; historians think was behind the anti-semitism that was so rife in <i>Christian</i> Europe for so long. Where did Nazis get the idea of blood libel from? What ever could be the reasonâ€¦?<p>On a less sarcastic note, I hope they don&#x27;t blame the Jews for their predicament, as the only other explanation would be that the hatred arose from nothing but some rousing speeches by Hitler. That to me would seem incredibly childish a notion and not in the slightest supported by the accounts of prominent Nazi party members of the time but at least it&#x27;s better than victim blaming.<p>Of course, we could rely again on looking at the conditions present and what effects correlate - what happens when blasphemy laws are present, and what happens when freedom of conscience (free speech + freedom of religion) is present - does support for Christianity go down? Does anti-semitism rise or fall? Is this consistent across the world? Is the same true for Europe?<p>&gt; for example, Germany blasphemy laws pre-WWII, as written, actually protected Judaism<p>On the one hand there are the hate speech laws that were in place for a few years, and on the other is the rampant anti-semitism for at least <i>hundreds</i> of years prior (supported by blasphemy laws), and to top it all off the hate speech laws didn&#x27;t even work! On the contrary, they <i>contributed</i> to the rise of the National Socialists.<p>In both cases a lack of free speech resulted in a negative outcome. Yet, you seem to be against free speech. Maybe it&#x27;s your comfort levels, and I agree, that really is a problem with free speech.<p>I&#x27;ll take it over the alternatives though.')
