I was at the Portland protests this summer, and nothing even close to this happened. They&#x27;d have gone to mass use of tear gas and less lethal munitions long before that point, and if by some improbable chance a context like the above video push into a building arose, there&#x27;s no question in my mind the CBP and related agency unmarked officers would have just straight up opened fire.<p>There <i>are</i> two standards at work in how protests are treated. This is a factual matter, not an opinion. It doesn&#x27;t mean every protester on the left is a blameless, as obviously that&#x27;s a straw man position on its face. But the disparity in how violence is used, and in particular how early its used is very clear. You can&#x27;t just handwave that away. Likewise you can&#x27;t handwave away that showing up with military style gear and loaded firearms is a defining feature of right wing protests that is not duplicated on the left.')
