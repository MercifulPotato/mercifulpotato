And to that point, while SolarWinds&#x27; bending over backward to characterize it as &quot;an incredibly complex and sophisticated attack&quot; is predictable, it&#x27;s also ludicrous without saying how the initial intrusion occurred. That is, everything I&#x27;ve read has explained how <i>the actual payload</i> that was delivered to the victims&#x27; networks was sophisticated and complex, but it&#x27;s possible the original build server vulnerability was braindead simple. We just don&#x27;t know until that is revealed.')
