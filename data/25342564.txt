Obviously, it wouldn&#x27;t.<p>At that point, either 1) there are two cable modems with the same burned in address or 2) one of the two cable modems is cloning&#x2F;spoofing its MAC address. Which one of those is more likely?<p>(If you&#x27;re interested in the details, try &quot;DHCP Option 82&quot; as your search term.)')
