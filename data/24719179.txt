The average salary, even in PPP terms, was about 30% of the Western European ones back in 2007. In absolute terms, salaries were even worse (probably 10% in 2007, something like 25% now), and absolute terms matter because many things are imported.<p>After huge growth, the average salary in PPP terms is now about 50% of the Western ones. Romanian workers in the West have definitely depressed the average salaries in several fields.<p>And that&#x27;s with somewhat controlled migration.<p>My point is: controlled migration is there for a reason. Building a working state is extremely difficult and takes a lot of time. It&#x27;s a very fragile and delicate thing. Once you&#x27;ve managed to build it... you really don&#x27;t want to upset the balance.')
