Perhaps it makes more sense to say that retailers are a participant and beneficiary of the bad behavior of whoever is selling the water to both Costco and Nestle.<p>In either case, it gives companies like Costco&#x2F;Walmart&#x2F;Target the ability to gain greater market share in ways that aren&#x27;t accessible to small businesses. If you don&#x27;t mind economic concentration, I can see why this wouldn&#x27;t seem like an issue to you. I believe that America functions best when wealth and economic activity are geographically well distributed, and when individuals have greater control over their own ability to be productive. That means diminishing chain retailers and giving more agency to individual retailers. Pricing games are the number one way that retail chains are able to drive small, local retailers out of business â€” they&#x27;ve been doing it with varying levels of success for over 100 years.<p>&gt; Yes, that is how market power works. A participant with greater market power can use that as leverage to negotiate pricing. This is an acceptable use of market power; for example, it is the basis behind insurance pools, coops, group discounts, etc.<p>That&#x27;s not an acceptable use of market power. It specifically disadvantages small businesses that do not have access to private label brands. It&#x27;s a competitive advantage exclusive to chain stores that allows them to engage in discriminatory pricing games. Employer healthcare also creates an anti-competitive advantage for larger companies for the same reason, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.')
