Repos can be synced and patches exchanged in numerous ways and any decentral copy is a full backup of everything.<p>But as someone having worked in larger companies, there are huuge red flags with this that you wouldn&#x27;t want the wrong people in your company to know about. Fully functional repos anywhere means central control is impossible. You can&#x27;t just limit access in any meaningful way, you can&#x27;t control info leaks, if someone can carry out a git clone on an USB stick.
