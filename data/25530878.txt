Theme parks, film and streaming, extended reality, and commercial retail. It&#x27;s our most powerful tool to trigger recognition. Today we use primitive devices with fixed scents, but there&#x27;s no search engine for smells there&#x27;s no reprogrammable scratch and sniff - we&#x27;re using analog smells in a digital world.<p>We want to revolutionize the way we smell by democratizing scent. Provide new technologies to discover and recreate smells in any environment, at home or on location.<p>The applications are endless. We can train medical professionals and industrial workers to recognize dangerous scents without putting them in harms way. We can create the next generation of virtual experience, expanding art into new dimensions.<p>---<p>This has been done before, going back to the 60s. It&#x27;s kind of niche but the practical issues of building a device that can do it and one that people will buy have been insurmountable.')
