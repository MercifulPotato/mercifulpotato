We went to school, 4 days a week until high school. Wednesdays were off back then.<p>I was not referring to home schooling but &quot;managing kids&quot; nowadays compared to the 80s. To my father, which was well involved in our education and housekeeping btw,  it seems there wasn’t much anxiety about it.
