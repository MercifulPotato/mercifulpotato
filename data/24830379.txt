Microsoft makes it look easy, but on the other hand, Apple is about to remove any 3rd party code out of their kernel.<p>About 1: I believe that this hurts more than it helps. Expecting nVidia to move their OS-agnostic codebase into the Linux kernel sounds like a massive effort with no real benefit for them. That seems unlikely to happen. With, for example, OpenZFS, this might be possible if Oracle relicenses their last open-source version. Still, I don&#x27;t see the Android OEMs budging on their stance of releasing binary blobs alongside their SoCs.<p>Android is currently the largest install base of Linux kernels across the world, and the lack of a stable ABI means that none of these devices can run the latest and greatest Linux version ever during their lifetime. It is easy to shove all the blame over to Qualcomm, Mediathek, etc. but we also have to see it as a failure of Linux as a platform.<p>Not every participant of a platform will always play nice, and these kinds of issues could all be solved by providing a stable ABI.')
