No one &quot;does mathematics&quot; in ZFC. Mathematicians don&#x27;t express their reasoning in set-theoretic axioms; they do so in common language proofs. You can see this by opening any graduate textbook or journal.<p>Mainstream mathematicians are not being prevented from proving theorems because they lack &quot;better ways of reasoning about equality of types.&quot;<p>The importance of ZFC is that it ensures our common language reasoning isn&#x27;t incoherent (among other things). Once you&#x27;ve done that, you don&#x27;t need to do it again.')
