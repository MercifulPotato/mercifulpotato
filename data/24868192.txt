I entered Vietnam a couple of days before they closed their borders. I ended up staying for four months, and then flew back to Europe in July.<p>Vietnam&#x27;s government handled the situation rather well, so by pure luck I ended up being in one of the safest countries in the world through the Spring. When it came time to leave, a border guard tried to scam me into paying some fine or bribe by suggesting that my visa had expired. It didn&#x27;t wash because I had done my homework and I had prepared to have on-hand the government&#x27;s official website which explains in Vietnamese that all tourist visa are automatically extended for free.<p>Travel is still possible, but you need to be well-prepared, and you need a certain level of financial and temporal freedom.<p>If you are unsure (and asking questions here would suggest that) then do yourself (and everyone else) a favour and just stay home.')
