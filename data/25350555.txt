Many years ago I was just a young developer completely immersed in tech and algorithms, but I was frustrated that the teams I was involved with weren&#x27;t better at making software. <i>Code Complete</i>, <i>Software Project Survival Guide</i>, and his other writings really helped me appreciate how important craftsmanship, design, process, and forethought are to a project&#x27;s success.<p>I&#x27;ve never been under the impression that he figured it all out on their own, or that they captured the end-all, be-all of how to make software. Some of the things he wrote about have evolved tremendously over the years. But I still get incredible value of revisiting those books and reinforcing better engineering practices and habits he evangelizes.')
