However most of their methods are to process new inventory, their notification process is disconnected somehow and delayed for some reason. From the community I&#x27;ve been working to build as well, they all say the platform is much faster than the stores&#x27; versions.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;namepromo.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;namepromo.com</a>')
