I&#x27;m so glad that the media vigorously looked into these allegations of corruption and fraud, instead of dismissing them for partisan reasons, because then we might have a split, between people who get their information from mainstream outlets believing nearly half the nation are conspiracy nuts or violent bigots, and those who get their news from independent media online believing that half the nation are brain dead sheep or lying sycophants.')
