If you end up pursuing your diff concept here are a few things which might help point you in the right area or give you some additional keywords when searching:<p>1. CT images measure densities of tissue (in Hounsfield units).<p>2. The images will first need to be aligned&#x2F;registered&#x2F;fused. There are different ways to do this but it can be difficult if the two scans were done with different protocols&#x2F;hardware as the image resolutions and dimensions can differ but also anatomy regularly changes (not as much in the head area).<p>3. Fusions are often described as having a primary (unchanged) and a secondary (the image that&#x27;s modified to align to the primary).<p>4. Fusions can be very basic rigid alignments (like moving one photo on top of another) or be fancy by moving voxels independently (often called deformable registration, like cutting a photo into squares and moving them) however these are difficult to evaluate for correctness.<p>5. Fusions are often viewed as a transparency overlay of one image on top of another (in the case of deformable it&#x27;s the deformed image over top the primary).<p>6. After doing a fusion a subtraction can be performed to find the difference in image values (the densities).<p>Best of luck and enjoy the field.')
