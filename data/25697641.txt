It’s only once the mob actually showed up that they banned him. If the ayatollah was saying “go here and destroy this building” and it got done then they’d ban him based on this precedent<p>It’s also a funny argument to me because you have people comparing trump to the ayatollah and mao and thinking it helps their case.')
