This is nothing like a religion and this type of backwards thinking is what holds us, as a species back. And, either way, it doesn’t matter - every scientific practice does not need to be repeated down to the minutia by every human being to be effective. I imagine most people taking HIV&#x2F;AIDs suppressants have never looked through an electron microscope to verify exactly how they work, but that has nothing to do with anything.<p>Your analogy is, frankly, awful and way off the mark.<p>Edit, to add an example: a patient listening to a doctor who has set many broken bones about how the doctor is going to set that particular patient’s bones is nothing like a religious adherent listening to a priest who has never spoken to god about what god says and expects of the adherent... that’s just absurd.')
