Most of the time my enums are well defined: ContactStatus, AwardLevel, JugeStatus, for example. I have not control over the names or values and all have a &quot;Revoked&quot; value. When they come in from an external system it&#x27;s pretty easy to parse them and convert them to the wrong type if someone isn&#x27;t paying close attention. Then they don&#x27;t get caught for a week or so because the code compiles, runs, and appears to work correctly except for these occasional odd results.')
