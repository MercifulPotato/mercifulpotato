For example, if there is a 1% chance your startup will succeed, but one million people try it, statistically one of them will have 3 successful startups in a row even without being better than average.<p>Though, realistically, the chance should increase for the following attempts, because you can reuse some resources and contacts you gained with the first success. The first startup is like &quot;I need to succeed within three years, or return to a regular job to pay my bills&quot;. But if it succeeds, the second startup is like &quot;I can keep trying as long as I want to, no pressure&quot;.')
