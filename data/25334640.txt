From what I&#x27;ve read, the average Bay Area house produces more from solar than it uses.<p>Anecdotally, every person I know with solar does not pay an electric bill (I also live in the Bay Area).  My neighbor has solar, and has four adults in the house. They also run a catering business so they have a commercial walk in freezer and refrigerator in addition to their normal appliances, and they don&#x27;t pay an electric bill either.<p>And when I run the calculator for my own house, it looks like I won&#x27;t pay a bill either, despite running the A&#x2F;C all summer and the heat all winter.  We&#x27;ve just been too lazy to get it done.<p>Maybe your system isn&#x27;t working correctly?')
