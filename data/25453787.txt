I really hope we reach some platonic ideal of decentralization and decentralized value in the future. However, I&#x27;m not sure that Bitcoin is the right vehicle for this, or that price targets are a good way to measure these developments.<p>Advancements that make microloans easier to access for farmers in Peru or land ownership verifiable in rural Zambia are worth more to me than a lumbering deflationary asset class like Bitcoin. I also think this was the original &quot;Satoshi vision,&quot; and having been in this space since before the hype started, it saddens me to see everything focused around price. IMO, price is a good measure only when it actually represents <i>value created</i>, and not speculation.<p>On an unrelated note, I like what you&#x27;re doing with hook.vc! I&#x27;d be interested to get your feedback on a project I&#x27;m working on for decentralized scientific publishing. (Especially given that you&#x27;ve been through the academic&#x2F;PhD pipeline.) Do you have an email?')
