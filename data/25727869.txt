Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board IBM-PC-compatible hardware, including Intel 80286, 80386, or 80486 microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware.<p>from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motorola_68040" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motorola_68040</a>\nThe 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486, but on a clock-for-clock basis could significantly outperform the Intel chip in integer and floating point instructions. However, the 80486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems.')
