It&#x27;s why antitrust legislation gets pursued in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s the raising of prices in the absence of market forces that gives room for the payment processor to increase fees. Theoretically all payment processors benefit from advocating that their clients raise prices. If some companies raise their prices, no issue, but the coordinated effort to do it is where you &quot;smell a rat&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s then up to the litigating party to try to find collusion between companies to do this. This is like how the anti-competitive hiring practices of Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc were surfaced.  They all had a set of practices that stood out as anomalous and during the subsequent investigation it was found that they colluded with each other to set the market (rate for hiring talent).<p>It&#x27;s probably not the case here...and also patio11 has little risk saying so while living in Japan where industries are highly vertically-integrated&#x2F;monopolistic.')
