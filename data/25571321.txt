Wikileaks, even from the early days they, seemed to craft their own narratives in a way that many journalists find uncomfortable.<p>Even in the earlier days of Wikileaks when they had a facebook page (not sure if they do anymore) they&#x27;d regularly announce an upcoming data dump and imply that it was very important and serious and imply what it was about .... then radio silence.  They never would release anything on that topic...<p>If you asked on their page, your comment was deleted ... whey did they not release it?  No word.  Many of these weren&#x27;t national security type situations and there was enough info that you knew they never released it ever, just radio silence.<p>I liked the idea of what I thought Wikileaks was early on, but it never was that, and I&#x27;m suspicious of their choices and etc.   They seem as interested in crafting something, what I&#x27;m not sure, keeping their own secrets, as any state.  Who really is Wikileaks, what are they up to, I wonder sometimes...<p>On the internet of course this is all or nothing.  You either are for a thing and against everything deemed to be the polar opposite or the other way.   It&#x27;s hard to have nuanced discussions about these things but I think that grey area is where you see the concern from journalists.')
