Speed limits are simply a <i>bad idea</i>. A <i>much better</i> idea is speed <i>constraints</i> - roundabouts, speed bumps, chicanes [0] - i.e. actually <i>forcing</i> people to drive slower <i>or else they ruin their cars</i>.<p>The fact that governments default to traffic cameras etc. is proof (revealed preference) that they don&#x27;t <i>actually</i> care about safety and people driving slowly, but what they want most is making their citizens live in fear, punishing them and extracting money from them. This is particularly obvious when there&#x27;s a hidden police &#x2F; traffic control on some section of the road where it&#x27;s <i>obviously safe</i> to drive fast, but it&#x27;s just <i>technically</i> within city limits so it has a low speed limit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chicane#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:One-lane_chicane_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chicane#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:One-lane_c...</a>')
