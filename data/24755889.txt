They hit 100% support on their broadband network in 2014. They run a lot of the own stuff on IPv6, such as on-demand video on their set-top boxes. I think any home modem&#x2F;router that they support that did not support IPv6 hit EOL long ago and was replaced.<p>There may be some class A owners who are trying to hold back IPv6 so they can make money off their class A, but Comcast isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>Apple has long had IPv6 support in their operating systems, so I don&#x27;t think they have been trying to hold it back either.<p>Ford, Softbank, Daimler, and Prudential? It is not immediately obvious to me if they could do anything to hold it back even if they wanted to.')
