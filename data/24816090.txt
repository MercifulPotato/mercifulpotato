But that&#x27;s okay. The citations (of the pre-print version) speak for themselves. If papers like these are good enough that new students entering the field use it as a ramp-up resource, they won&#x27;t hesitate to cite it over and over again when they submit something for peer-review.<p>So journal publication is not the only means of recognition.<p>Speaking of which, computer science is a bit weird in that conference papers tend to have higher visibility than journals, even though the latter still has some of its grandfathered glory. Not all conferences are equal, obviously. Some have a more rigorous submission process than others. But our field definitely carries a bit of skepticism about the value added by journal publishers.')
