What is naive here, is that you think things are the way there are, for no reason.<p>Mail is <i>decades</i> old, built upon millions of hours of work crafting software, RFC standards, and works the way it does, <i>including</i> bounces, to <i>ensure</i> stability.<p>A 5xx error means &#x27;perm failure&#x27;.  There are a variety of 5xx class responses, from &#x27;user account deleted&#x27; to &#x27;no such domain&#x27;.  It is, in fact, a <i>working</i> mail system, which responds with 5xx, or 4xx (temp fail) or 2xx (received OK) messages.<p>A severely broken system is incapable of even responding.<p>For a mail system to respond with 5xx, when it is internally broken, is 100% a configuration issue.  Every MTA on the planet, is designed (eg, postfix, sendmail, etc) to respond with a 4xx TEMP fail message if something is borked.  A milter gone bad.  A library missing.  A full disk.  A config issue.  An issue forking.  Memory limits.  All of it.<p>By default, MTAs are designed to 4xx(tempfail) on those errors.  Loads, and loads, and loads of work to ensure that.  Code meticulously crafted.  This is how good engineering works.  This is how the RFC works.<p>You either get no ACK for your SYN, because it is so borked, or you get a 4xx if it can run, but has a failure condition.. OR someone did something very, very wrong.<p>I understand your angst, but the real problem isn&#x27;t the RFC, or the sender not retrying.  The problem is:<p>- the MTA was up and running<p>- it had an error condition on its back end<p>- whomever set everything up, didn&#x27;t taking into account internal failure conditions, and to respond with a 4xx if that was the case<p>THAT is where the &quot;good engineering&quot; failed.<p>Mail accounts are deactivated all the time.  Domains are deactivated all the time.  5xx tells us this.  Someone replying with 5xx, when they did not mean to, has a configuration issue on their end.<p>That&#x27;s all there is to it.<p>I&#x27;ll put this another way.<p>What you want to do is make 5xx like 4xx, because you feel there should never be any way for a SMTP server to say &quot;No, really, this email address doesn&#x27;t exist.. don&#x27;t bother trying again&quot;.')
