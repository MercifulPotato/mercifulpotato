Knowing with certainty what type will be returned in a single brief glance, without the cognitive overhead of parsing function body and checking various return statements (at best: returning a variable obtained from an external source may obscure type further).<p>For me this also greatly improves my ability to refactor quickly and confidently (not needing to check additional places&#x2F;files during refactor for edge cases in expected type).<p>Yes any type-related refactor mistakes should in theory be picked up at compile time, or by smart IDEs but having the context in front of you still greatly improves speed when writing.<p>It&#x27;s also great for code reviews where grokking context is trickier and IDE goodies are typically not as rich.')
