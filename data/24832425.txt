This past weekend, in an interview with a local Wisconsin TV station, Trump insisted Foxconn had built “one of the most incredible plants I’ve ever seen” in Mount Pleasant and would keep its promises and more if he was reelected. “They will do what I tell them to do,” he said. “If we win the election, Foxconn is going to come into our country with money like no other company has come into our country.”<p>IMO a fascinatingly complex story about the kinds of plays which occur at this level, and how much money it takes to keep up an empty story going. The city and state legislature acted most shamefully in denying its citizens any insight or oversight into what was happening.')
