There are two PIO blocks with four state machines each, that can\nindependently execute sequential programs to manipulate GPIOs and transfer data.</i><p><i>PIO is highly performant as well as flexible, thanks to a carefully selected set of fixed-function hardware inside each state machine. When outputting DPI, PIO can sustain 360 Mb&#x2F;s during the active scanline period when running from a 48 MHz system clock. In this example, one state machine is handling frame&#x2F;scanline timing and generating the pixel clock, while another is handling the pixel data, and unpacking run-length-encoded scanlines.</i><p><i>State machines&#x27; inputs and outputs are mapped to up to 32 GPIOs (limited to 30 GPIOs for RP2040), and all state machines have independent, simultaneous access to any GPIO.</i><p>Will definitely pick a few of these up to play with.')
