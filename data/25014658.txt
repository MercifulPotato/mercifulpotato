Item(by='capableweb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604751624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014551, text='&gt; because the video and especially audio quality is so atrocious for many of them<p>Of the few ones you watched, which had atrocious audio quality? I&#x27;ve watched many of them, and the video has been fine for all the recordings, and the audio quality obviously depends on the speakers setup, not the processing&#x2F;encoding&#x2F;quality of the video. But of the ones I&#x27;ve seen, the audio has been perfectly fine to be able to understand what&#x27;s being said.<p>CCC has been perfecting the art of &quot;recording, streaming and storing conference talks&quot; for many many years, so it would be weird if it suddenly took a dive in quality. Would like to see what videos you&#x27;re talking about here.<p>Edit: I just quickly went through all the videos on the page from the submission, to check the video&#x2F;audio quality. All of them have perfectly OK video&#x2F;audio quality while 2 videos could have been better mixed&#x2F;mastered (volume too low) but nothing raising the level of your speaker wouldn&#x27;t be able to fix.')
