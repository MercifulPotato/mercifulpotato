Downtime shouldn&#x27;t be to engage in more stressful mental activity. Think about it. Go to the gym. Study for a big exam. Are you really engaged on the goals of a gym? Are you really engaged in getting a good grade on an exam? If you are, you are finite and I highly suspect that the high performers aren&#x27;t going to try and add more stress on their lives (political or anything else). I&#x27;m suggesting they aren&#x27;t sweating enough at the gym. I&#x27;m suggesting they aren&#x27;t working hard enough. I&#x27;m not suggesting that they&#x27;re a slave. I&#x27;m not suggesting they are a wage slave.<p>I&#x27;m suggesting they are more likely to be working in a half-assed way and don&#x27;t have a &#x27;buy-in&#x27; to the company&#x27;s objectives. Which tends to be true based on numerous business management studies (since at least the 1970s that I&#x27;ve read).<p>Hard workers want enjoyable leisure. Not pissing off a Karen. Or dealing with a Greg. This is a toxic mindset that doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>P.S. There is also another variable. That some people are closed minded but, imho, that can be overcome with good soft skills of a good manager&#x2F;vision&#x2F;buy-in.')
