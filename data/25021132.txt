I heard the tire screech and looked over to see a driver clearly panicked both because they realized they nearly hit someone and there phone was now nowhere to be found.<p>That is a great thing.<p>But what if someone inside of TESLA, the folks who write the software and send it over the air to your car, decided to add their own &quot;feature&quot; to the car such that they could override the safety system with a network packet, or a text message to the car. That person would be in a position to tell the car to ignore its safety systems and kill its occupant.<p>It is kind of a staple of dystopian fiction, but now that we&#x27;re getting closer to having that software out there in real time, the question becomes less fiction and more &quot;What would have to be true for that to happen?&quot;<p>The change here is cars that are always connected to the Internet and have command authority over all of the systems in the car. Before if you wanted to alter the software controlling a car you took it to a dealer, or a mod-shop, but now it just shows up in your car. What sort of insider threat programs does Tesla have? What sort of controls are their on releases? Do third parties have any opportunity to audit everything in the code? What happens if Elon orders an employee to put some code in? Do they do it? Do they report it?<p>And not to pick on Tesla here, the same goes for GM&#x2F;Cruise and Waymo right? ALL self driving systems that are currently in development have full control of the car, an always connected component, and a dynamic software update capability. Should it be required they also have a mechanical switch that forces manual control without any means of circumventing the switch in software? That would have to come as a government regulation right? And then what happens when someone steals the Waymo van by throwing the switch and driving away with it?<p>Hopefully that gives you a sense of where my head is here in these questions.')
