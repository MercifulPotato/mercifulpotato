Every single time I&#x27;ve tried it, it has been a terrible experience.  For GUI mail clients I tend to swing between evolution and claws.  Evolution does all the fancy stuff (html e-mail, seemless integration of calendar invites, outlook support) way better than Thunderbird and claws does all the workhorse stuff way better than Thunderbird (flexible mail fitering, organization,  &amp;c.).<p>Meanwhile Thunderbird has corrupted my inbox 3 times in a sum total of about 3 years of me using it spread out over a decade, crashes more than evolution, and does the core messaging features worse than claws.')
