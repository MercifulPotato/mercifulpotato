They would need to take the burden themselves and falling behind economically (something China in particular would strongly resist). A few defectors can ruin the entire plan because of economic pressure. I think we should be nearing an accord with greater control anyway -- defectors will need to suffer harsh economic sanctions greater than what they&#x27;d spend on the accord anyway. I expect this to happen within a few years.')
