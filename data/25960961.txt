I&#x27;m having a hard time finding it, but the gist from my notes:<p>* Taibbi story claimed that PE firms were behind the 2008 crisis (obviously not)<p>* Taibbi claimed that Blackstone Group was &quot;Democrat-leaning&quot; (quite the opposite)<p>* Taibbi claimed that the major returns from PE LBOs came regardless of whether companies succeeded (which is false, and confuses downside protection in some deals with an actual portfolio strategy that can raise a fund)<p>* Taibbi claimed that after running with Milkin in the 80s, Bain Capital moved on to do LBOs in the tech sector during the first tech bubble<p>There were a bunch of other things, like refutable empirical claims (for instance, at the time, the numbers showed that PE deals didn&#x27;t materially impact payroll, despite Taibbi&#x27;s claims) but that stuff is boring, the more interesting things to me are the places where he&#x27;s saying stuff that <i>can&#x27;t</i> be true, like that PE firms were doing LBOs of unprofitable 2-year-old tech companies.<p>My take on Taibbi is that he has a gift for saying things that <i>feel</i> true, but a poor track record of reliably saying things that <i>are</i> true. That doesn&#x27;t mean the opposite of whatever Taibbi is on about is false; it means that you can&#x27;t tell from his writing whether it is, any more than you could by flipping a coin.')
