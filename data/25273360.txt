My experiment’s total code base was at least 100kloc of C++ and Fortran if not more, and used a farm with over 20k cores for massive distributed processing, single jobs regularly taking hundreds or thousands of cores and terabytes of memory.<p>I’m currently working on distributed GPU accelerated hydrodynamic simulations where a single input is in the ~1-10Gb range of structured mesh data and the calculation requires ~200+ Gb of GPU memory.<p>I really don’t see how excel would be a viable option for basically anything I have worked on in my scientific career, beyond my undergraduate toy analyses.')
