Obviously information workers are largely remote right now, but we still don&#x27;t know how many companies will insist on going back to physical offices when they can.<p>The reason I&#x27;m thinking about this is because unless another comment above, I&#x27;ve seen non-competes pretty often. And I also had to negotiate redlines. I didn&#x27;t think about this early in my career, but then I changed employers... and ended up sued. The new employer paid for a lawyer and it was largely non-issue, though at my age, I found it a very harrowing experience (and an education.) Many hopefully won&#x27;t get that same experience, but they may also lack the education or wisdom to negotiate around non-competes. In the physical world, some non-competes would essentially require you to pack up and move if you want to remain in the same line of work. That&#x27;s great for a company, and terrible for talent. Remote work would eliminate that particular effect - assuming non-competes were still worded around physical geography. But a well-worded non-compete that applies universally could very well tie someones hands - either leave your line of work, or stay with the employer that now owns you.<p>All &quot;free market&quot; theories emphasize individual choice, and they all rely on individuals having the ability and information to make those choices. But non-compete (basically the exact phrase meaning to eliminate competition and therefore choice) agreements tend to be giving companies the power to remove choice from individual employees. So while theoretically a &quot;perfect&quot; market would result in all employees mindfully rejecting non-compete and choosing incentives wisely, this would seem to fall into a similar category as other &quot;big business, big lawyer team&quot; situations, where the advantage lies clearly with those in power, not individuals trying to have and make choices.<p>Laws against monopolies, and attempts to prevent propaganda and misinformation that take choice away from individuals exist as a check against power imbalances that remove freedom from markets.')
