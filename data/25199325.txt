I believed the issue is about the memory usage reported by the OS vs the memory usage reported by the logical JS Heap Snapshot, which is a common topic for garbage collected runtimes, such as JS &#x2F; v8. That is why we believed the issue is about the v8 VM not freeing memory back to the OS when we freed memory logically.<p>But it turns out I tried the steps again just now, and there is a real memory leak in there! It only reproduces when running a built version of VS Code, such as VS Code Insiders or VS Code Stable. The built versions of VS Code offer file type extension recommendations, for example you open a `.php` file and a recommendation comes in to point you to the PHP extension. When running out of sources, those recommendations do not show up and the entire code responsible for those does not execute.<p>Thank you for bringing this up to my attention and I&#x27;m sorry for misunderstanding the initial issue.')
