For instance, the C++ ecosystem still outmatches rust regarding high performance libraries for several scientific computing domains; GUI graphical user interface libraries, such as Qt, MFC, wxWidget; Game engines and so on. In addition, Rust lacks openMP feature which allows parallelizing for-loops, which are widespread on scientific computing, for taking advantage of multi-core CPUs and from SIMD.')
