Programming, engineering, robotics, electronics, physics, etc. Even much of mathematics!<p>With languages, the only way I start to truly grasp them is by analysing grammar, syntax and etymology, then starting to match those to pronounciation, and then I can go from there.<p>The idea that everybody should learn a language in way you deem better has hindered my ability to learn many, and has slowed me down a lot. I wonder how many other people learn like me and are currently out of options when it comes to language courses because of this kind of one-size-fits-all approach to teaching.')
