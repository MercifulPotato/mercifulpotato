Highly affordable. I save a lot here and don&#x27;t miss anything.<p>Opportunities open themselves up as well. You can get a really nice homes here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;mcallen-tx&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;mcallen-tx&#x2F;</a> + hit &quot;remove boundary&quot;. You could snap up houses here and rent em. Buy one. This is a market where I could see it growing in the next 5-10 years with more remote work.<p>Dallas, Houston, and Austin were all viable opportunities but the cost just didn&#x27;t have the value. Harlingen &#x2F; Brownsville &#x2F; McAllen, if you google it, often come up dead first for cheapest cities.<p>That said, it&#x27;s way out there. TX is super big. This is 2.5+ hours away from Corpus Christi, 5 hours away from Houston. It makes flying a pain. So it doesn&#x27;t fit a lifestyle where you need to bounce around a lot. So I highly doubt the prices will fluctuate much, but a lot of TX is like that.<p>And the SpaceX Starship place is near us (Boca Chica, TX)')
