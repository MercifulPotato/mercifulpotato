Neurologist asked how often I had a migraine and I said &quot;once&quot; and then he asked how long &quot;4 years so far&quot;. The cardiologist was much more help when we figured it out eventually. Heart surgery fixed it.<p>Chronic pain on that timeline does a lot of harm to your physical and mental health. I&#x27;m still re-learning how to relate and respond appropriately respond to pain as a stimulus. I&#x27;m dangerously used to ignoring it. Empathizing with other people&#x27;s pain took years to re-learn despite recognizing my failure fairly one in the process.
