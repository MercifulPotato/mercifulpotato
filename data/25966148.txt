Item(by='dmqctx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611981725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965955, text='I&#x27;m unable to disagree with most of your points, but &quot;I can barely run Windows for a day or two without rebooting.&quot; is hyperbole.   If this is actually true, there is something seriously wrong with your install.  Apart from that, Win10 pisses me off daily.   It&#x27;s insane that I harken back to the Win7 days as often as I do.')
