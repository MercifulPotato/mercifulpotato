Most of the attitude of locals during a decade in Asia which I experienced was very forward-looking and upbeat. Returning back to Europe was incredibly depressing since everyone was complaining (even they had everything)<p>IMO it&#x27;s about perceived wealth because I saw the same in Europe (Croatia and Poland have very cheerful people compared to the South of France which is full of rich French and Brits and everyone is complaining).<p>When I spent time in Poland between 2005-2010 there was a running joke about &quot;Poland can&#x27;t even manage to do the financial crisis properly&quot; (7% growth iirc so Poland would be a &quot;depressive Slavic country&quot; where everyone is upbeat. ofc don&#x27;t ask the Polish because they joke about being the only country where people are even more complaining than Brits. But if you come from France, Germany, Belgium or other very West EU countries where the attitude is hostile towards new technologies and ideas in general then Poland is refreshingly upbeat).<p>agree with you about a lot of this is attitude and a shared sense of trust among citizens in their systems. if we take Japan again, that same shared trust (&quot;yes-saying&quot;, never question your elderly or superior, or blind trust in authority) is what has led to Fukushima disaster. There is huge value in moaning and being critical about all things that promise an easy fix.')
