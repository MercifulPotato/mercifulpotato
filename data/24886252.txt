It doesn’t claim to be a takedown notice.<p>RIAA sent a letter asking GitHub to take a repo down and they listened. They weren’t legally obligated to but they chose to and that’s their right. A counter notification wouldn’t necessarily do anything since the original letter was not a takedown notice. GitHub can’t be compelled to host something they no longer wish to host.')
