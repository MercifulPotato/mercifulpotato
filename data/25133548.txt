Then when you see something you like at the mall or Macy&#x27;s, get it. If there&#x27;s stuff in your closet you don&#x27;t wear (or don&#x27;t like to wear), fold it and put it in storage and if you haven&#x27;t needed it for 6-12 months, give it away and replace it with a garment of the same type that you like.')
