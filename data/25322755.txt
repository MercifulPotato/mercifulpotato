I&#x27;d paid with my CC (a UK card; not sure why it would be any different with a US CC?). I forget the exact sum, but it was something like Â£1,500.<p>Ryanair completely took the piss - they were very clearly trying to hold on to everyone&#x27;s money for the duration, and ignored communications or offered ridiculous, short-lived credit notes in lieu of a refund. Several months passed like this.<p>Eventually I read up on how charge backs worked and called my card provider. They sent a form, and within a couple of weeks, the money was back in my account - the whole process was really straightforward, and I fully recommend using it if a vendor is outright refusing to uphold their side of the bargain.')
