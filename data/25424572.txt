This bug can be fixed, hopefully with some work this whole class of bugs can be made rarer. If you were relying on your safety guarantees to include a bug free compiler - rust isn&#x27;t there yet and you should stop. If you&#x27;re relying on a bug free happy path, rust is as close as any other language implementation (with one or two exceptions pointed out in sibling comments).<p>So, I mean, if you&#x27;re arguing that C&#x2F;C++ programmers are culturally less repulsed by bugs... you might be right about that. Other than that I think it&#x27;s about the same scale for C&#x2F;C++ and rust - a bug is a bug no matter what language you wrote it in.<p>The only fundamental implications I think it has is that maybe we need to put more of an emphasis on formalizing the memory model if we want to reduce the number of soundness bugs (something that a number of people are already doing some awesome work towards).')
