For people who genuinely wish to learn things, relevant facts will make their way to them.<p>And for people who genuinely don&#x27;t want to learn things, they have no trouble rejecting true things regardless of how they are written. People in filter bubbles always have been exposed to the truth at least once; they simply reject it.<p>So I don&#x27;t find any problems with blocking rude people. The author here wrote the Block button on Quora, and I use it vigorously. I would be unable to use the site otherwise, because it attracts a lot of very hostile people. It also has many smart people with a wide variety of perspectives, and they&#x27;ll inform me when I&#x27;m missing something. All I lose out on is hostility.')
