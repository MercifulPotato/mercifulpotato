The daily &quot;You are at Google!&quot;-elitist chatting makes you feel kind cool at first, but after two years you just get sick of hearing it and it becomes unbearable. (YMMV, I suppose it&#x27;s not the same at all locations or within all departments ...)<p>Regarding the article: The &quot;Why?&quot; paragraph talks about a lot of things, but not why you should quit using Google. If anything it tells you why you should quit using Facebook&#x2F;Whatsapp. If the argument is &quot;Facebook is bad, so Google must be bad&quot; you might as well stop using the internet all together right now, as this can be applied to basically any other service provider of any kind.')
