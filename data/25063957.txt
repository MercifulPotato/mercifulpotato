I don&#x27;t foresee Apple offering the fat binary support in the long term. It&#x27;s probably only an intermediate  solution for the transitional period. Also, does it mean the native version of R will finally work on the iPad? I know Apple doesn&#x27;t allow compilers but there are a few examples like Pythonista and Apple&#x27;s own Swift playground. It&#x27;d be cool to get R Studio on the iPad.')
