It is much better for me to remember handwritten notes than typed ones. In college, one of my study methods was to transcribe my typed notes into handwritten ones. I took typed notes in the first place for the simple reason that I type _much_ faster than I write.<p>Professionally, I am still the same way. When flipping back from pen-and-paper to something like Evernote I definitely remember written ones better.<p>Long-term I&#x27;m looking for a solution where I can take notes handwritten and OCR scan it into a digital platform to have the best of both worlds (my memory plus full text search, sorting, and tagging)')
