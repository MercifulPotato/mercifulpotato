Once they got the Tesla it became the vehicle used for all long trips.   There are very few destinations that aren&#x27;t within 250 miles of a supercharger and do not have at least a 115V plug available to recharge the car while you&#x27;re at the destination.<p>And as far as I&#x27;m concerned a Y is a large family vehicle.   It&#x27;s no Escalade, but it&#x27;s larger than our small minivan.   If you disagree, there are some large trucks and SUV&#x27;s coming in 2021&#x2F;2022.<p>Depreciation is a kicker all right, but in the other direction.   All actively cooled electric cars (IOW everything except the Leaf) depreciate a lot slower than a gas car.   And that&#x27;s just going to accelerate.   Imagine trying to sell a 2020 ICE car in 2030.   98% of 2020 cars are ICE, but in 2030 the majority of new car purchases are going to be electric.   Buyers of used cars want basically the same thing as buyers of electric cars, so the small number of available electrics are going to be in high demand.')
