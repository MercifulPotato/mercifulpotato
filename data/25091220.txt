One can attempt to detect and block this in hardware, but a compressed EDM track with reduced dynamics can look pretty close to loud noise at some short moments.<p>Now let&#x27;s say you have a high power Amp configured correctly for mixing a -24db classical music recording and then the OS glitches out and you hear 0db noise. That might blow up your speakers, headphones, or even worse, your ears.<p>My experience writing kernel drivers for audio software is that Windows will accept the click sound and then stop processing if the buffer runs dry. OS X used to have issues that it&#x27;ll continue playing, meaning it&#x27;ll reinterpret random memory as sound. Not sure if that was fixed in recent Mac versions, as their approach does have memory &amp; performance benefits. But it means that audio driver glitches on Mac can be physically painful for the user.')
