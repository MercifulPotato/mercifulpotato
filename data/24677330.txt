I checked the example, and the difference is that YAML places the &gt; following the attribute name, and this format places it before the text.<p>BTW, I happen to like YAML as a configuration format. It&#x27;s much more readable than JSON. It&#x27;s not that suitable for serialization, and probably shouldn&#x27;t be used to create huge config files, but for the rest, it&#x27;s as good as it gets.')
