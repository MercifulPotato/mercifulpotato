The popular shows &#x2F; movies (including anime) have quite different themes, which is easy to understand since countries import different productions. The exported culture for our consumption is mostly typical of asian interest, or more &#x27;Americanised&#x27; &#x2F; westernised even. Whereas comparing with western media there are more &#x27;culture shock&#x27; type of eyeball-catching material, which to be frank doesn&#x27;t stir much attention in east asia.<p>There are good side effects though. I have been to so many museums with Japanese art exhibitions showcasing varieties of works since it draws much interest in western population. The latest (pre pandemic) being the &quot;inspiration from Japan&quot; in Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which is eye-opening (I never realised the Japanese art that have connections with European art).<p>In conclusion, Japan portrayed in the west for me is more about obsession of elegance, extreme aesthetics, and bizarrity. These are merely my terrible personal generalisation &#x2F; opinions.')
