Item(by='lumost', descendants=None, kids=[25983206], score=None, time=1612114422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979900, text='As a tech worker in the US, the prospect of some form of a tech employee associatation seems like the right way to go.<p>- Employees are regularly screwed on misrepresented equity compensation<p>- Employees are expected to work uncompensated on-call shifts which vary from &quot;doesn&#x27;t affect me&quot; to &quot;impossible to function on&quot; such as being paged once per hour for 1 week with the expectation to do it again in a weeks time.<p>- Employees are subject to highly opaque performance review processes that take into account employee performance, as well as what work they happened to be assigned - Some assignments may be incompatible with the companies expectation for a given role e.g. Software Engineers assigned to put together excel reports<p>- Employees may be asked to perform ethically or legally dubious activities where they may be held criminally liable ( see dieselgate, and to a lesser extent the 737 max ).<p>- Employees may be asked to work 80+ hours to hit goals which were underfunded or poorly planned (see CDPR and every other software project which misses a deadline)<p>This is a small list of reasons an industry employee group such as a guild&#x2F;union&#x2F;certification board&#x2F;association could be a good idea. However very few of these items relate to traditional union activities. The thought of pulling in specific hires with specific union skills seems like either forcing a square peg through a round hole or just paying to support someone who will fill their time with activities related to &quot;unions&quot; to little employee benefit.')
