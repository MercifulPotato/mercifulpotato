For instance Google might not exist (the search engine) because for the first few years of its life it was basically giving the web search engine away for free and hoping to make money by selling search appliances for intranets. That business plan didn&#x27;t work out and they eventually pivoted to making money on the main search engine.<p>But what if they&#x27;d not been allowed to do this and been forced to charge for web search from day one? With no ad network and without being allowed to take VC money to build up traffic, they&#x27;d not have been able to establish a market for ads and thus, would have had to rely entirely on revenue from search appliances, which was tiny. Search would have ended up dominated by their competitors simply because they could never bootstrap themselves to the point where they&#x27;d be interesting to advertisers.<p>So this stuff is complex and even though there seems to clearly be a problem here with VC money subsidising broken businesses forever that suck all the oxygen out of the room, it&#x27;s unclear that governments effectively setting prices  is better (after all, setting price floors is a form of price control). SoftBank  will eventually run out of money unless Son finds another Alibaba. Government controls don&#x27;t run out like that.')
