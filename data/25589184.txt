Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609384372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585541, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a practical distinction between EV and non-EV certs any more anyway.<p>I believe EV user interface treatment is still a thing in Internet Explorer, and for all I know the Chromium Edge has it too, I never run those browsers. Some minority browsers also distinguish, mostly using the CA&#x2F;B reserved OID whereas historically Firefox and Chrome had a list of issuer specific policy OIDs flagged.<p>From the issuer&#x27;s point of view, the generic EV OID is reserved by that same document for certificates which obeyed the BR rules for how to identify the name, business number (if appropriate) and location of the business, but that is not so different from OV. Private OIDs might correspond to some other (potentially stricter) policy.<p>There is another CA&#x2F;B document about EV, but in practice reform has mostly taken place in the BRs and so rules there, or enacted by the trust stores (e.g Apple&#x27;s 398 day rule) make most of the provisions of the CA&#x2F;B EV rules obsolete.<p>The original goal of EV was to find a mutually satisfactory way to improve on the status quo at that time which was a price free fall for long-lived domain validated certificates using whatever method satisfied the issuer&#x27;s needs to confirm control over the names issued. The browsers got issuers to do a better job (their main ask) and the issuers got a cool UI (the &quot;green bar&quot;) to help sell expensive certificates.<p>The most important legacy of that was the standing meeting, the CA&#x2F;Browser Forum, which means there is an ongoing dialog between the CAs and the browser vendors rather than them only talking when there&#x27;s a grave and urgent problem. It took some work to design a structure that&#x27;s legal, that gets the job done but isn&#x27;t a cartel, because cartels are illegal (OPEC is&#x2F; was a cartel but its members are sovereign entities, and so they are immune to prosecution for running a cartel)<p>There&#x27;s considerable value in being able to get the other participants in an ecosystem to agree (even if begrudgingly) that a policy change is necessary rather than forcing it upon them. Getting to 825 day certificate lifetimes was done by agreement, and not even so very long ago, while 398 day lifetimes was done by Apple&#x27;s fiat after they struck out in negotiations.<p>Visa doesn&#x27;t have to worry about PCI-DSS, unlike a retailer who is going to &quot;stop&quot; Visa from doing stuff that is prohibited by PCI-DSS? Nobody. Like the banks, the networks gave themselves the independent right to decide to just break the rules if they want to. For example if your e-commerce website uses SHA-1 that&#x27;s a huge No-no right? But if Visa has a system that uses SHA-1 and replacing it to do SHA-256 would cost say $1M, they can decide actually it&#x27;s fine as it is, they keep the $1M and that&#x27;s OK under rules they helped write.')
