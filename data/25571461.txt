The problem though I think is that people who are aggressive to begin with may in fact normalize violence and in a stressful thoughtless moment IRL they may act on that violence. Again, this is not for most gamer folk but the ones who are predisposed to violence in the first place. Also sedentarism in children may be a factor to increase of violence.')
