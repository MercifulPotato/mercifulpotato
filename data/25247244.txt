Certainly, some of these changes conflict with others. But that&#x27;s totally ok, since you can pull them independently.<p>For example, when preparing release 1.0.0-alpha.9, I didn&#x27;t pull the latest patch from that discussion into my main local channel, and I preferred to pull some of the older ones instead.\nI did this because the latest one doesn&#x27;t detect whether the standard output is a TTY. If I apply them to the main channel on the Nest, my current local channel will be in sync with it, even though I&#x27;ve worked on ten other features since then.')
