I wanted a nice status page for Koj (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.koj.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.koj.co</a>) and was previously using Uptime Robot which didn&#x27;t allow much customization to the website.<p>It started with the idea of using GitHub issues for incident reports and using the GitHub API to populate the status page. The obvious next step was opening the issues automatically, so the uptime monitor was born. I love using GitHub Actions in interesting ways (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.blog&#x2F;2020-08-13-github-actions-karuna&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.blog&#x2F;2020-08-13-github-actions-karuna&#x2F;</a>) and have made it a large part of my toolkit!')
