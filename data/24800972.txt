I do not want to defend Facebook per se. However, blaming Facebook as an entity seems over-simplistic (feel free to correct that view or possibly unpopular opinion).<p>Look at it this way: A social platform that makes information more accessible to people is a threat to democracy? Suppose things would work out in a utopian manner. In that case, such platforms should lead to a better-informed society and, therefore, a better democracy.<p>Suppose one party in an election can take advantage of social media to nudge their voters. Why shouldn&#x27;t the other party do so?<p>Where do we draw the line regarding what is allowed and what is not? I guess there is some work to be done regarding what constitutes information warfare legally speaking.')
