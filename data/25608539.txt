They&#x27;re built to a human scale (not too tall, decent amounts of internal room), have generous numbers of windows, and are set in outdoor space with grass and trees.<p>There are, on the other hand, lots of practical problems with this kind of building. The flat roofs have a tendency to leak, they&#x27;re decades past their design life, thermal control is poor, they&#x27;re riddled with asbestos, and a number of other issues. And lots of people think they&#x27;re ugly. But this doesn&#x27;t make them inhuman, just a flawed solution to a real-world problem.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to forget just what difficulties the UK was in for building in the 1950s and 1960s. There was a spectacular shortage of housing (a baby boom and the effects of WW2 bombing didn&#x27;t help) and a chronic shortage of both money and skilled labour for building. There is, bluntly, no way that enough traditional brick and stone buildings could have been put up for there to be enough schools. So you can certainly argue that better cheap and&#x2F;or mass produced buildings should have been made, or that the aesthetics were bad, but writing off all the architecture without understanding its context is unhelpful.<p>[Edit: in my view, the most inhuman feature of the images is the fencing, but that is almost certainly not original - security in schools was really stepped up from the 1990s onwards]')
