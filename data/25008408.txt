Some people are tempted to do that with investors, hiring, PR. It&#x27;s a short-term optimization and no good will come out of it in the long run, even from a purely amoral standpoint.<p>In my experience, the conversations we had with our clients, advisors, investors are really good because even when they make a mistake assuming something, we correct it on the spot: &quot;No. We are not able to do that right now because we have B issue and we&#x27;re working to solve it given we do not have expertise on this. It will take some time. For now, we&#x27;re doing Y instead because of X. We don&#x27;t have Z capability&quot;.<p>The trust that grows from having these conversations is invaluable. You can&#x27;t build it back when it&#x27;s gone. Even if you&#x27;re not in a managerial or executive position and your manager makes the mistake of wrongly claiming something, you pull them aside and correct them. They most likely <i>thought</i> what they said was correct, and will follow up on that and send an erratum&#x2F;clarification.')
