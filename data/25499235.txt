The only thing that will happen, without a complete overhaul of the way medical services are paid for in the US, is that patients will be given one extra form to sign before being allowed any services by any provider:<p><pre><code>  Patient waives any and all rights granted by [anti-surprise laws]\n  and agrees to indemnify Provider for any related costs.\n</code></pre>\nYou have to understand it&#x27;s not just about the rules, medical insurance companies will do plenty to stay compliant but they&#x27;ll still screw you. Sometimes they&#x27;ll send you a bill for something they already said was covered, then suddenly it&#x27;s on <i>you</i> to fight a several billion dollar company into just doing what they promised.')
