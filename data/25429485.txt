Some example: You can&#x27;t not communicate. So even not persuading is persuading. What if the presidential candidate would just not give a scheduled speech? How do you communicate information objectively? Casual language creates bias, so does scientific language, simple language, passive language, active language. &quot;Cognitive Bias&quot; might as well be called &quot;Cognition&quot;, since it is just how the brain works. You have to think &quot;tree&quot; immediately when you see one, even before you validated that all leaves are real and that the whole thing is not a projection on an transparent screen. Otherwise you can&#x27;t function.<p><i>But:</i> Big tech throws us in a situation where a small group of people influences our perception on a massive scale. Facebook changes a sentence on their homepage and <i>a billion people</i> read it. Youtube raises some parameter (yeah I know that&#x27;s not how AI works) by 0.01 and the political opinion about the Grenfell tower disaster changes ever so slightly - for 30 million people. Google&#x27;s filter has a tiny hole and some troll broadcasts wrong medical information about gout to 200k people.<p>Every time one of these things happen, the world shakes. Dozens die or survive. Demonstrations form and elections swing. Opportunities are wasted and ideas surface.<p>I am not arrogant to actually propose an easy solution to this, and I don&#x27;t think there is one. Just be aware that &quot;I can always go and stab someone&quot; is not a good argument when you are discussing a fully automated drone swarm with kill authority.')
