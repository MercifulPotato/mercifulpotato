GHC has always used a statically typed intermediate language, one of very few production compilers to do so. (Maybe even the only one.) Let&#x27;s keep that property. Richard&#x27;s thesis makes it clear that doing so is not straightforward.<p>-- Simon PJ (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;pull&#x2F;378#issuecomment-728113583" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;ghc-proposals&#x2F;pull&#x2F;378#issu...</a>)<p>So it looks like it&#x27;s rare to even have a typed intermediate language, let alone one whose structure forces it to be well typed.  The latter would require some sort of dependent types.')
