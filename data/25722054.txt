Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25722092], score=None, time=1610323733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721889, text='&gt; I&#x27;m a free speech absolutist<p>No you are not. Why lie? A free speech absolutist means that you believe any speech is acceptable. You comments clearly show you believe in limits to speech.<p>&gt; but violent speech, &quot;fighting words,&quot; insurrectionist speech, etc. are not protected under any free speech doctrine<p>&quot;Insurrectionist speech&quot;. You just gave yourself away. It&#x27;s not &quot;free speech doctrine&quot; that prevents it. It&#x27;s a supreme court ruling. The US was mostly free speech absolutist until the courts ruled direct threats to be illegal.<p>In case you think america limited free speech before the 20th century...<p>Politicians could threaten each other and duel each other...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel</a><p>&gt; I&#x27;ve argued in favor of free speech here on HN (and got the downvotes to prove it) more times than I can<p>As someone who has been downvoted defending free speech, I commiserate. But you don&#x27;t strike me as a free speech guy. You have the strangest way of being &quot;in favor of free speech&quot;.<p>&gt; Free speech isn&#x27;t some carte blanche that allows anyone to say anything at any time.<p>But you just claimed to be a free speech absolutist. That&#x27;s exactly what a free speech absolutist believe. That you can say anything anytime.<p>&gt; This has nothing to do with free speech, and Gab is an absolute cesspool of delusional QAnon conspiracies.<p>But you are a free speech absolutist. No?<p>Why do propagandists always do this? They pretend to be the other side and argue against the other side. It&#x27;s like a meat eater pretending to be vegan and saying bad things about the vegan diet. And you have the gall to accuse gab of being disingenuous.')
