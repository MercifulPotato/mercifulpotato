But when I tried Nix, the <i>first</i> thing that happened was that it did not deliver what it promised.  The package was not properly isolated, so it ended up depending on something from &#x2F;usr&#x2F;<i>&#x2F;bin.  This was pretty disappointing for a first try.<p>Also, while this is a minor cosmetic thing, I highly dislike the location of the nix-store.  It doesn&#x27;t belong in &#x2F;<p></i>and*, long path names (due to the hashes) are very impractical to use.  All in all, I hear a lot of good things about Nix, esp. from the Haskell community, but whenever I try it, I develop a deeply rooted dislike for the implementation of the concept.')
