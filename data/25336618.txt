Any frequent reader of HN will know that HN is pretty aggressive with censoring posts that don&#x27;t fit with the overall ideology here, no matter how up-voted the content is.<p>I used to play a game with myself at predicting which posts I would see in the morning would be removed with in 30 minutes. My favorite example was an article on how important it is to openly talk about the impacts and causes of climate change. It made it to the FP, had lots of discussion and was removed within 30 minutes.<p>Posts that are likewise seriously critical of the startup world get remove very quickly.<p>In this particular case I don&#x27;t think this post is necessarily being censored, but HN does do this very frequently so it&#x27;s not a crazy question to ask.')
