Technology would advance tremendously during their construction. In fact, their construction might be planned to never end.<p>The first bits might not even be functional; their only purpose might be to act as a place to build the next bits on to.<p>Even when we get to the functional bits, they might be designed and built to be replaced, or built over, like Mike Mulligan&#x27;s steam shovel.<p>They would also have to be designed and built to be safe even if civilization collapses. An interesting challenge would be to leave behind instructions, constantly updated while we&#x27;re still around, to any future civilization to be able to &quot;take up the tools&quot; when they&#x27;re ready.')
