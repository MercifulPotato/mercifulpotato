That’s how Haskell feels like.<p>The only way I can see this being true is if you really hate TypeScript with a passion.  I can&#x27;t really imagine any contemporary language feeling 10x better than another.<p>&gt; Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also handle way more requests than a nodejs application.<p>I&#x27;m not here to defend node.js... but this links to a blog post from 2011 with a benchmark which uses a single node.js process on a 4-core server vs Haskell which will use all four cores. That&#x27;s a cool feature on the Haskell side but it&#x27;s not comparing like-for-like, since you&#x27;d normally spin up a cluster of node.js processes one-per-core in this scenario.<p>If you multiply the node.js result from this ancient benchmark x4 you find that it&#x27;s faster than Yesod, the Haskell framework')
