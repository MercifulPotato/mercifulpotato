I think you are confusing the scientific worldview, which is diametrically opposed to religious culture--religious culture says certain beliefs are declared to be not open to question at all, no matter how much your intelligence wants to question them; the scientific worldview says <i>all</i> beliefs are open to question, no matter how much you think they&#x27;re right--with pronouncements made by particular scientists to lay people, which often do seem like certain beliefs are being treated more like religious beliefs.')
