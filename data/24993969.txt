I got disciplined because some kid was punching me on the playground, so I kicked him. I told the school administrators, they didn&#x27;t care. The phrase they used was &quot;we don&#x27;t use karate on people here!&quot; I had no idea what karate was.<p>I got bullied at the next couple schools I went to, and the only way anyone would stop was the few times I (or somebody else on my behalf) fought back. But of course then I would get in trouble for fighting.<p>I was later told many times I had a &quot;problem with authority&quot;. Who wouldn&#x27;t? How do you learn fairness, justice, or to respect authority if it treats you like crap?')
