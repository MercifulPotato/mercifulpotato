That said, I wonder if it isn&#x27;t more productive to look at China and each country in the region based on its own characteristics instead of a regional idea. Looking at all those you cited, they all have pretty specific ways of doing things and very different histories. I think they have less in common than say France and Germany have together, but that&#x27;s my personal impression.<p>Ultimately China has much to gain from changing the world order, just like it was natural for the US to export its values and overthrow governments back in its own heyday. It&#x27;s frustrating to see Western countries reason along the lines of &quot;1. Be democratic 2. ??? 3. profit&quot; instead of remembering why it has historically been a successful model and working from those first principles. This veering into cargo cult and magical thinking territory is of paramount danger if China is currently developing a competing model.')
