However I can maybe see 170,000 making sense if it&#x27;s based on household income and a household may have two manager class employees making 90,000 a year.<p>That said i&#x27;m still having a hard time believing the claim that a large number of households will have top 5% earnings.  I&#x27;d love to see a blog post or something along those lines contexualizing that journal article.')
