A great deal of expertise and care is necessary to do the job right. If you have been misled into purchasing one of these inferior versions (for example, a Kindle edition), the publishers have told me that they will replace your copy with the PDF edition that I have personally approved. Do not purchase eTAOCP in Kindle format if you expect the mathematics to make sense. (The ePUB format may be just as bad; I really don&#x27;t want to know, and I am really sorry that it was released.) Please do not tell me about errors that you find in a non-PDF eBook; such mistakes should be reported directly to the publisher.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu&#x2F;~knuth&#x2F;taocp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu&#x2F;~knuth&#x2F;taocp.html</a>')
