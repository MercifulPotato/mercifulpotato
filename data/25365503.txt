It&#x27;s results are choked with ads (like half of the page), and its search optimization heavily favors promotion of products, services, and brands.  Unless that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for (and generally it&#x27;s not) often I no longer can find what I&#x27;m looking for without repeated searches adding contextual clues, sometimes repeating the search 3 to 5 times.  That&#x27;s damned annoying, especially for a service that had none of these problems a couple years ago.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been using DuckDuckGo and even Bing more.  I can&#x27;t say Bing has added much value, but Duck seems to fare about as well as Google for simpler searches while generating none of the spam.  Maybe Apple can do this better still.  If so, more power to Apple.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;d love to see the government step in and create a search engine as a public service that lets the user choose what emphasis they want when they search: commercial, non-commercial, regional, historic, etc.  Since the WWW&#x27;s arrival ~25 years ago it&#x27;s become obvious to everyone how important web search is to EVERYTHING we do online.  It&#x27;s a primary window onto the world.  To put that power entirely in the hands of one company, especially one who&#x27;s lost its way as badly as Google (Do No Harm, indeed), is insane.  It&#x27;s time for search to become a public utility and adopt some basic design principles that serve the user as its primary mission.  Maybe Jimmy Wales could offer some good ideas.<p>Another service a gov&#x27;t-funded search engine site should provide is phone number lookup.  It&#x27;s absurd that there&#x27;s no directory for phone numbers any more.  Do we really WANT to obstruct people&#x27;s ability to stay in touch with each other?')
