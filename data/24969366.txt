However, C++ is moving in this directly, bu there is the &quot;gap&quot; as it was described in the cited talk from the CppCon 2020.<p>However, there article is about FAST programming languages. Which means, and I stated this explicitly at the beginning of the article, that the main factor for the article is the speed of the generated code.<p>This is why I compared the single Rust implementation with 3 C&#x2F;C++ implementations. The question was: whether Rust does something unreachable for C&#x2F;C++? And the answer is &quot;NOT&quot;. Also please keep in mind that all the benchmark programs, using the same algorithms, are still coded in bit different ways. And the differences impact performance significantly. I analyzed two programs, in Rust and C, to show the differences.')
