Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611759785, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925861, text='For the record, I am also a Christian, and I suppose to an outsider Catholicism probably looks very odd indeed, what with the feet and the noses and the gall bladders in the jars in the cathedrals and whatnot. But David Jang&#x27;s &quot;The Community&quot; is odd in a different way --- in a more &quot;Reunification Church&quot; kind of way. Maybe mentally replace &quot;odd&quot; with &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; or &quot;noteworthy&quot;. It was late when I wrote that, and I was a bit into my cups.<p>The word I was originally going to use was the one articles about the new &quot;Newsweek&quot; use: &quot;cult&quot;. But that didn&#x27;t seem quite right either.')
