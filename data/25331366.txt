It&#x27;s based on papers currently in Israel&#x27;s National Archives[2]. He very much used the same scientific techniques for all his studies, whatever the topic.<p>The most fascinating thing is that, based on these methods, he predicted the return of the Jews to the ancient Land of Israel starting in the 1880&#x27;s (correct), and that a great misfortune would befall them in the 1940&#x27;s (also correct).<p>I do not know how many things he got wrong, or if these were just coincidences. But the article was an interesting read nonetheless.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iyun.org.il&#x2F;maremakom&#x2F;newtons-theology&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iyun.org.il&#x2F;maremakom&#x2F;newtons-theology&#x2F;</a> In Hebrew, and unfortunately Google translates it very badly for some reason<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.nli.org.il&#x2F;sites&#x2F;NLI&#x2F;English&#x2F;collections&#x2F;Humanities&#x2F;newton&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;list.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.nli.org.il&#x2F;sites&#x2F;NLI&#x2F;English&#x2F;collections&#x2F;Humanit...</a>')
