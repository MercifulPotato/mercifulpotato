During the Middle Ages, 4 levels of interpretation: literal, allegorical, moral and mystical. Of these, the literal was generally seen as the least important.<p>Of course there are parts in the bible that do describe literal history, and those are still very important for context, but a lot of stories are very clearly not literal, and even in the middle ages, an important Christian thinker or cardinal (I forgot who it was and can&#x27;t find the quote at the moment) said: if our interpretation of scripture conflicts with our observation of the world, then our interpretation must be wrong. He wasn&#x27;t stoned or burned at the stake for that. And 2000 years ago, it certainly wasn&#x27;t the Christians who were stoning people.<p>No, the &quot;figurative interpretation&quot;, as you call it, has been with us for millennia. Biblical Literalism is only a fairly recent movement, and quite at odds with the bible, Christianity, and reality.')
