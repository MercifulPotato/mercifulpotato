Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606219871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197323, text='&gt; The price of the asset being mined determines the costs of the energy put in to mine it.<p>No, you have it backwards. A BTC that is already mined has as much value as a BTC that is yet to be mined, whether now or twenty years in the future.<p>Again, the fact that we spend energy to get <i>more</i> BTC is just accidental. There is no absolute law that postulates that the cost of energy and price of the asset need to be correlated.<p>&gt; Decentralization of hashing power will continue to increase as the renewable energy costs continue to lower.<p>You are talking about spherical cows, I am talking about actual implementation of the system. Renewable energy costs mean <i>jack shit</i> when you have big central entities subsidizing dirty energy and if no one pays for the externalities. Also, it doesn&#x27;t matter how &quot;clean&quot; a source of energy is. Unless you find a way to break the law of thermodynamics, the best way to be sustainable is to not consume the energy in the first place.<p>There are already plenty of market incentives for us to be more efficient and produce energy, we don&#x27;t need to have an artificial component added to this system for it to work.')
