Like a car, it&#x27;s a device for a responsible and independent adult. There aren&#x27;t 4 billion cars in the world, nor 4 billion independent adults.<p>&gt; If you aren&#x27;t an independent adult, and you don&#x27;t need or even shouldn&#x27;t have unconditional digital freedom (no one&#x27;s 8-year-old daughter needs unconditional digital freedom), a moon from someone else&#x27;s planet is fine.<p>WTF!? What is their definition of &quot;independent adult&quot; !? (Is it car ownership ?!?) This is IPv4 all over again...')
