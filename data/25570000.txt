This mere effort adds a layer of complexity which can kind of turn the user off to bookmarking.<p>That assumes the main goal is quantity of bookmarks. That you want to lower the cost of bookmarking as close to zero as possible. As someone that has been using bookmarks in the browser since the very early days of the WWW, I can&#x27;t endorse that system for most bookmarks. The more important thing is to make it easy to add metadata, store the links, and then query&#x2F;browse the information. A low-resistance system is simply opening the link in a new tab, and then when you decide it&#x27;s time to clean up your tabs, you store them inside a system that holds the metadata necessary to make use of those links in the future. Everything is secondary to getting the metadata right.')
