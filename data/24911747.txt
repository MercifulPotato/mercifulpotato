When you speak or write, some words have a higher probability than others<p>No you&#x27;re not, and that is very easy to disprove. Look at the sentence <i>&quot;John took the water bottle out of the backpack so that it would be lighter</i>&quot;. What does <i>it</i> refer to in the sentence, the bottle or the backpack?<p>Did it statistically come to you or did you need to consult Google? No, you <i>know</i> the right answer, it&#x27;s the backpack. Why? Because you have a physical understanding of the world. The bottle doesn&#x27;t get lighter, when you take it out of the backpack, the backpack does, because the bottle is not in there any more. This is not statistics, it&#x27;s not manipulating strings, it&#x27;s having a fundamental physical model of the world in your head, and an idea about how entities operate in it.<p>When you talk you don&#x27;t do random statistical inference, you match language to the semantics you want to express, which is not statistical.')
