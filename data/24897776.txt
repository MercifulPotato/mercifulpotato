He was previously governor of California. Guess when California stopped offering free higher education?<p>Chicago is in Illinois, which has had a lot of flip-flopping between red and blue governors and has an infamous history of governors going to jail for corruption.<p>Also I&#x27;m not claiming that Democrats haven&#x27;t done shitty things. Daley bankrupted Chicago and privatized a lot of our public services while running as a Democrat and some of those jailed governors were democrats, but I do think the GOP is more homogeneous in its efforts to break down the government. I mean privatizing everything is a platform they openly campaign on!<p>If your claim that prosperity has nothing to do with who is in charge were true, we wouldn&#x27;t see a pattern of blue states outperforming red states economically or a national pattern of economic growth after a democrat president and decline after a republican president.<p>Coincidentally, I live in Chicago and used to live in California. People love to use both places as punching bags when talking about national problems, despite one being a state and the other a city! It&#x27;s different types&#x2F;scales of problems.')
