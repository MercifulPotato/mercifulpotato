The Saudi Arabian government has already admitted to murdering Khashoggi (but denied that MBS had anything to do with it)[0]. There was plenty of reviewed evidence, including CCTV footage, audio recordings, etc, not just &quot;everybody knows&quot;.</i><p>If there were evidence, that shift would never have happened. We wouldn&#x27;t be talking about worldwide governmental consensus.<p>This is not an isolated demand of rigor. You cited the evidence. I asked if you had examined the evidence you cited. Now we&#x27;re about worldwide governmental concensus and demand of rigor.<p>&gt;<i>This passive-aggressive nonsense is ridiculous. You seem to clinging to some fiction that the SA has not literally and materially admitted to wrongdoing.</i><p>One of my points was that news outlets have mentioned evidence in the form of audio recordings and video footage, detail that the body was dismembered, mentioning the tools, quoting phone conversations of alleged operatives, and leading the public to talk about audio recordings and video footage mentioning details of how the body was dismembered with neither the former producing&#x2F;publishing them, nor the latter having examined them.')
