You can get your paperwork sorted, buy a car, a bank account, deal with the government and have a social life all in English. I have done.<p>But, all of the comments I&#x27;m seeing here are saying that while this is true, if you want to take the step forward into learning Finnish, it _is_ harder than other languages and that the resources around doing so as an adult are not as developed as in other languages. The fact that you don&#x27;t strictly need to and that a lot of people have excellent English here anyway makes it harder, therefore active and sustained effort is needed on your part, you are not going to &#x27;just pick it up&#x27;. If I had lived in France for as long as I have in Finland (not even a full year), then there is no question that my French would be at a much higher level than my Finnish is now.')
