We all have many opportunities to say no. \nYou know how much time I spent working on projects that didn&#x27;t go anywhere and were a complete waste of time and money? (not mine, my employer&#x27;s). I didn&#x27;t say no. My manager didn&#x27;t say no. Their manager didn&#x27;t say no. You may say that&#x27;s part of being successful, many things fail but a few stick and make it big. That&#x27;s true but often the writing is on the wall but people ignore it.<p>One thing I do agree is that not everyone can say no. For example, if you&#x27;re a software engineer in a big company, you might not have much say. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to get yourself into a position where you have more control on the things you work on. Not easy but you don&#x27;t need to be Buffet to achieve that.')
