What is described in the quoted excerpt as &quot;naturalism&quot; is... simply not a position that any modern linguist (at the very least since Saussure) would take, because it is plainly ridiculous and flies in the face of basically all evidence.<p>Generally, I don&#x27;t think that philosophical ideas exist in a vacuum, they are informed by the real world and by science (hence why e.g. quantum mechanics plays such an important role). Plato bases his ideas off of specific premises (that&#x27;s the whole point of the socratic dialogues), but I find the premises often very flawed. For example, how does Platonism and the idea that there is &quot;an ideal horse&quot; make sense in the context of evolution? It doesn&#x27;t, IMHO, and cognitive science seems to give much better answers to such question as how we can recognise the concept of &quot;horse&quot;.')
