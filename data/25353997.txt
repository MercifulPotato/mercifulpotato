Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25354305], score=None, time=1607475937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351635, text='For prescriptions that are pills, I&#x27;d like to see a smartphone&#x2F;tablet app to help with things like that.<p>At the simplest, it would just remind me when it is time to take pills and tell you which pills to take. That could help with the confusion of having pill A on a twice a day schedule and pill C on a thrice a day schedule.<p>Better would be if you could also show the app your pills using your device&#x27;s camera when you first start a new prescription. Then when you take your scheduled doses you could show the app what pills you are going to take and it could check that you have the right number of pills and they are the right colors and shapes and sizes.')
