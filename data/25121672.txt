There are times where you fill out government forms with your address, but there&#x27;s no way to know for sure where someone is living at any given moment. As far as the &quot;government&quot; is concerned (which government? state, local, federal? AFAIK it&#x27;s all pretty decentralised) I&#x27;m still living at the place I registered to vote from years ago.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s cultural differences. There&#x27;s a staunchly individualistic attitude in the US and the idea of a central government tracking its citizens is very unpopular. I get it, too. If you take a look at the &quot;Anmeldung&quot; process in Germany, where the government has a list of everyone and their race&#x2F;religion&#x2F;nationality, along with exactly where they live&#x2F;which building&#x2F;which floor&#x2F;which side of the building, you can see how such a system could be dangerous if Germany were to ever shift from the liberal democracy it is today.')
