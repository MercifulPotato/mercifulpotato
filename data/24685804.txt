How exactly do you put the squares together?<p>Stacking them (even with rotations by mutlplies of pi&#x2F;2) will not detect the case when every edge has the same kind of deviation from the straight line, right?<p>Putting them edge to edge will assure every edge is straight and the same length (within observation limits) but may get you a rhombus which is not a square.<p>Do you somehow iteratively combine both of the above?')
