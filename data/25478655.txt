Item(by='sershe', descendants=None, kids=[25480137], score=None, time=1608396423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476834, text='The only &quot;social construct&quot; involved here is &quot;private property&quot;. If I hire someone to install carpet and pay them $X, we sign a contract about that and that only. They don&#x27;t tell me how I should paint my walls; and I don&#x27;t tell them how to spend their money. That&#x27;s kind of the idea. If they start issuing ultimatums about painting my walls pink, or agitate with the painters that it&#x27;s wrong to not do it, I&#x27;m going to fire them. Apparently, in the old days, by custom that was not like that, and you were expected to paint your walls pink if they insist; perhaps in other places it was even mandated by law.<p>Then Milton Friedman showed up and said &quot;Hey, you just acceded to your walls being painted pink but, by the rules, you didn&#x27;t have to do that!&quot; If getting this notion across is activism, then I guess I&#x27;d stop thinking of activism as a dirty word. I thought it was more like education on a common-sense notion.<p>Come think of it, an alternative structure you seem to be advocating is also a solved problem in this scheme - it&#x27;s called a co-op, and there are many successful ones around, from farms to clothing stores. Go found an internet search coop, and as a co-owner you&#x27;d be able to decide how it should be run.')
