Redistricting is one aspect of it, sure, but it&#x27;s not the sole reason a census is done.<p>It&#x27;s done primarily to predict tax revenues, predict infrastructure needs, predict growth patterns, support municipal planning, etc., all of which are necessities for projects that often span decades.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about the vote, deal with the challenge posed by the electoral college instead. The Census is used for too many other things to be manipulated for the sake of political interests by one party.')
