This in turn led to the DI spots being filled primarily by people who were in trouble, didn&#x27;t care or were &quot;bad apples&quot;.<p>At some point, the questions were raised: &quot;Wait, why are we putting some of our worst Marines to train new Marines? Wouldn&#x27;t it it make more sense to have our BEST Marines train the next generation?&quot;. The follow up was then: so how do we actually make that happen?<p>The answer was to make being a DI one of the stepping stones to higher level ranks. This dramatically increased the quality of DIs and in turn, raised the quality of the training and finally the Marines.<p>There is a similar story in some countries with socialized medicine. E.g. to get a license to practice medicine privately, you first have to spend N years working in a public hospital. This ensures that you can get top quality people working even in a public healthcare based system.')
