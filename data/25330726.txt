It&#x27;s pretty normal to have some lunches with a beer, beer is a very cultural thing for Germans and having a beer during a lunch out with the team is completely normal, no one is impaired, no one is drinking 2-3 liters of beer in one sitting. Even here in Sweden where alcohol drinking is much more frowned upon I&#x27;ve had lunches (usually on Fridays) with my teams where we would have a beer or two.<p>There are very different degrees of what and how much to drink, it can be a socially responsible and enjoyable activity, it&#x27;s relaxing to let go from the whole super-professional office culture and have a beer and cheers with colleagues.<p>The world isn&#x27;t black-and-white.')
