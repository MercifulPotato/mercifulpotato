Sure, they had meaning historically but today they&#x27;re often just symlinks because we don&#x27;t really need the distinction.<p>&gt; Its as simple as it gets, I dont see a way you could make a &quot;better&quot; system<p>I do, we could stop separating binaries from the associated other files they require in order to work. That is an artifact of how UNIX was originally implemented that is irrelevant today. Case in point: the existence of containers, flatpak, AppImage, and other such things that do exactly that! Not to mention all the operating systems, like Windows and Mac, that <i>always</i> worked that way.')
