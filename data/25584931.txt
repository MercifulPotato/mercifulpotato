That plane had a design issue, not a manufacturing issue. While the loss of life was tragic, it also wasn&#x27;t a major design blunder; it&#x27;s the sort of thing you can fix with a new sensor and a software update. On the other hand, the 787 shows that the US <i>can</i> build planes.<p>&gt; trains<p>Bombardier still makes trains in North America, and Alsom builds some trains in the US.<p>I actually agree with your point, but tech manufacturing moving to East Asia is the bigger story. There&#x27;s also an argument that the jobs didn&#x27;t materialize because the workers weren&#x27;t educated enough for better paying jobs and were too expensive for manufacturing jobs.')
