There&#x27;s also a distinct assertion on what must happen going forward, to the opinion of the speakers.<p>Suburbs don&#x27;t scale. Yet, cities don&#x27;t scale either. This is why people get priced out or want to move out and most cities have been low growth modes for years.<p>I find it interesting that recognizing that the path of least resistance (suburbs) may be slowly and haphazardly changing (true), is ccheered by all academics.<p>Yet I don&#x27;t see any expert opinion about about having cities be more receptive to change to accommodate growth....<p>Sure sounds like a NIMBY from academics about their cities, no?')
