Unlike on private platforms like Twitter, where arbitrary censorship and blocking of discussion&#x2F;access is perfectly legal.<p>All of this junk occurring on private websites like Twitter&#x2F;FB is completely misguided and a tremendous disservice to the American public.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;media&#x2F;steve-scully-cspan-suspended&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;media&#x2F;steve-scully-cspan-susp...</a>')
