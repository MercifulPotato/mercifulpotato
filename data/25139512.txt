The biggest problem IMO is that &quot;no phone&quot; isn&#x27;t an option.  Kids need a phone to participate in society.  That&#x27;s just the way it is.  The problem I see is that phones have super addictive apps like TikTok that target young kids, so giving them the &quot;good half&quot; of a phone means you also end up giving them the &quot;bad half&quot; and kids aren&#x27;t good at understanding why the bad half is bad for them.<p>It&#x27;s like serving a kid a plate of food with vegetables and meth side-by-side and the meth dealer is making every effort they can to push the meth into the vegetables.')
