Rather, it&#x27;s droves of people susceptible to propaganda and misinformation campaigns.<p>Correct.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s be clear: there was no widespread election fraud, certainly not by large enough margins to overturn the election.<p>I am not 100% committed to that being an impossibility, but I have yet to see any evidence to make me question the final outcome of the 2020 US election.  I&#x27;m legitimately concerned about small scale voter fraud, but nothing significant enough to invalidate the final result.<p>&gt; Videos that purport otherwise are not improving public discourse; in fact, they&#x27;re causing it to disintegrate.<p>I agree.  But far be it from me to determine what constitutes &quot;quality public discourse&quot;.  I have a history of being wrong about a great many things so I&#x27;d rather not have myself - or any individual or organization - arbitrate on what the public is allowed to discuss.<p>&gt; I agree that Youtube should not have carte blanche to remove content that it finds objectionable per its own capricious standards. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it should have no discretion at all.<p>Maybe I&#x27;d be less critical of Goolge if they actually had some sort of guidelines for objectively determining what content should be allowed on their platforms.  This inconsistent &quot;whatever we think is best&quot; policy strategy is way too susceptible to abuse and Google hasn&#x27;t proven themselves trustworthy.')
