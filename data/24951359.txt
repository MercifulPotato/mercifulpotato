This recounts the story of the Cragg Vale Coiners who clipped coins and used those clippings to mint new coins. Rather than being driven by greed the clippers used the money to help feed the rest of their community. It&#x27;s a really lovely book and gives a fantastic insight into the lives of the people of that period and area.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hive.co.uk&#x2F;Product&#x2F;Benjamin-Myers&#x2F;The-Gallows-Pole&#x2F;23336840" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hive.co.uk&#x2F;Product&#x2F;Benjamin-Myers&#x2F;The-Gallows-Po...</a>')
