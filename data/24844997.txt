I am starting to think more and more that it&#x27;s important for our politicians to be &quot;with it&quot; and at least try to understand modern society, culture, and technology. Why is that?<p>The median age in the U.S. is 37.9. The average age of a congressional representative, however, is ~58, and senator ~62. There are dinosaurs like Dianne Feinstein in the Senate, who is 87. She is certainly not &quot;with it&quot;, and happens to support insane legislation such as that which would make strong encryption illegal. I don&#x27;t feel represented at all by the likes of her, or Nancy Pelosi, or pretty much any of the other politicians out there. I don&#x27;t trust them to make good decisions for my future - rather, I expect them only to use the political machine they have at their backs to advance their own selfish goals. It really does feel like a gerontocracy.<p>The internet now makes it possible for an entire congressional district&#x27;s worth of people to interact with their representative in this novel, light hearted, and humanizing manner. By demonstrating that she is capable of understanding and using modern technology in this way, it makes me a tiny bit more confident that someone like AOC _might_ legislate the internet in an effective manner.')
