This is highly personal, takes time for experiments to see what works for you right now, and when your situation&#x2F;environment changes, you must adapt and perhaps change or create new crutches.<p>Still, there is a lot of stuff you simply cannot fix w&#x2F;o medication: Impulsivity and focus are my biggest Achilles heels.<p>If there is no way for you to get medication you have to learn what problematic situations will be for you and try to avoid them from the start, because there is no way you can trust in prolonged self control if you have ADHD.')
