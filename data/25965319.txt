They were 4mb and 8mb.  Yes you read that right, that is &quot;m&quot; as in megabytes.  My setup was a 25 megahertz open case motherboard, a few of these.  It was part of the last quality control station and I would pop each vga card into the PCI slot and boot it up.<p>I would basically run a macro which cycle through the resolutions from b&#x2F;w, 4 colors, 16, 256, ... and up to a million or so.   I think there is a name for this, but basically watching a prism of rainbow colors.  At a million+ the color tones are very smooth and you don&#x27;t see an outline.<p>I could not imagine I would be able to differentiate a billion colors from its previous factor.
