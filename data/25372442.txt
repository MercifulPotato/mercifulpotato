There are roughly equal amounts of people on both sides, who believe extremely different things.<p>Yet it is the latter group that is unilaterally and universally censored by big tech and big media.  The latter group is casually dismissed, with extreme prejudice.<p>Regardless of which camp you fall under, censoring such a large group of people in such a dismissive way, is neither healthy nor productive.  It breeds distrust, hostility, and division.<p>For the record, as is probably obvious, I fall in the latter half.  I have done my own research, and to me, it seems unquestionable that election laws were broken in a variety of significant ways that meaningfully impacted the result of the election.<p>I say this as a person who really does not care if Trump wins or loses.
