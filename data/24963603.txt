One of the ways they get stronger is through a process where you exercise and use them, and this causes damage to the muscles (microtears), and the body responds to these microtears by rebuilding the muscles stronger. This is why you need a recovery period when strength training... the strength training is actually damaging your body, and your body becomes stronger after recovery.<p>It&#x27;s also why you don&#x27;t want to overtrain. Too much training and you get too much damage to your body, and you won&#x27;t be stronger afterwards.<p>With enough overtraining, damaged muscles will die off, releasing cell contents into your bloodstream and causing rhabdomyolysis, which is quite serious, but fairly rare.')
