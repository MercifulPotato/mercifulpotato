The first candidate likely dropped out after receiving the poor offer which explains the 10 day delay.  You took the below market pay as a personal insult and decided to be a jerk to the recruiter&#x2F;company.<p>I don&#x27;t say this as an insult or an accusation.  I am simply pointing out that we often judge others based on a lack of complete information. It isn&#x27;t necessarily fair to blame recruiters for every indignity that occurs during the recruitment process.  Inherently almost everyone who interacts with a recruiter comes away feeling disappointed and slighted.  It is a tough job.')
