They only need to do that if you have enabled fractional scaling. If you really want to avoid the overdraw associated with that, just don&#x27;t use any scaling on your primary display and then turn the font size in your client up. Anything else that passes the fractional scale onto the client is going to have issues. The reason you pass the buffer scale in wayland is because you explicitly want the compositor to scale your buffer and you want it to do it correctly. If you don&#x27;t want that, don&#x27;t bother with messing with fractional scaling.<p>&gt;you have a 150x150 window on which to display content at 1.33x scale, just give me back a buffer with those properties<p>Again, this comes back to the issue where now you need to deal with rounding in the client. Only the simplest of browsers, image viewers, 3D renderers, PDF viewers that have no UI chrome could get away with just passing on a fractionally scaled buffer. And for those, you can do what I described above, disable fractional scaling and do your scaling in the client, you don&#x27;t need any special support in the compositor. I believe in most applications you can press Ctrl-Plus and Ctrl-Minus :)')
