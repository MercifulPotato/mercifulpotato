Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609265607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570611, text='The numbers in here are a bit scattered and tell a bizarre story because some are inflation adjusted and some aren&#x27;t. The one that set this rant off was the super misleading housing numbers.<p>From 1996 to 2019 (the article uses a mix of 2019 and 2020 figures), inflation boosts prices  1.63x.<p>Homer&#x27;s $25k 1996 income would be $40.75k in 2019 ($41.5 today). That puts them at the 30th percentile of household income and him the 36th percentile of individual income today [0].<p>For the house affordability the  Q3 2019 vs Q3 1996 median house price increased 2.27x [3]. After adjusting for 1.63x inflation, it&#x27;s 1.4x more expensive.<p>But mortgages are way cheaper today. The 1996 December average mortgage interest rates was around 7.7% [1]. Today&#x27;s 30 year fixed  rate mortgage is around 2.9% [2]. Homer&#x27;s monthly mortgage payments on the same mortgage today would would be 58% of what they were then. Adjusting for the 1.4x real house  price increase, a Homer buying today would have monthly payments of 82% what he would in 96. That&#x27;s 18% lower! (This is what set off my rant, seeing the &#x27;2.4x higher housing costs!&#x27; in the article)<p>Healthcare costs are about 3x higher, as the article says, so about 1.8x after inflation adjustment.<p>Median tuition for  a four year college is 2.6x more expensive in 2017-2018 (the last year in their source) and 1.64x more expensive after inflation adjustment, so who knows where their 1.8x number came from.<p>All together, the Simpsons&#x27; family&#x27;s biggest expense would probably be their mortgage, which would be cheaper today. Not to say anything about expecting TV lifestyles  to be affordable. Cue the Friends and How I Met Your Mother giant apartment jokes. There&#x27;s a story to be told about increasingly inaccessible lifestyles, but this article isn&#x27;t it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;household-income-percentile-calculator&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;household-income-percentile-calculator&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mortgage-x.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;national_monthly_average.asp?y=1996" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mortgage-x.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;national_monthly_average.asp?y...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nerdwallet.com&#x2F;mortgages&#x2F;mortgage-rates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nerdwallet.com&#x2F;mortgages&#x2F;mortgage-rates</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MSPUS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MSPUS</a>')
