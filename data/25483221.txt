It doesn&#x27;t matter what the per core wattage is, because you can&#x27;t get that one core without the package.<p>This is the desktop Zen 3 which is still using the 12nm I&#x2F;O die. It uses more power as a result, which nobody really cares about on the desktop. The Ryzen laptops use a single die which is entirely 7nm and thereby less power with no corresponding reduction in performance.')
