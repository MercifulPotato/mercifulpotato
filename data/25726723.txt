In that Press Release, Twilio accidentally revealed which services Parler was using. Turns out it was all of the security authentications that were used to register a user. This allowed anyone to create a user, and not have to verify an email address, and immediately have a logged-on account.<p>Well, because of that access, it gave them access to the behind the login box API that is used to deliver content -- ALL CONTENT (parleys, video, images, user profiles, user information, etc) --. But what it also did was revealed which USERS had &quot;Administration&quot; rights, &quot;Moderation&quot; rights.<p>Well, then what happened, those user accounts that had Administration rights to the entire platform... The hackers, internet warriors, call it what you will, was able to use the forgot password link to change the password. Why? Because Twilio was no longer authenticating emails. This meant, they&#x27;d get directly to the reset password screen of that Administration user.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not from the US, but as an outsider, this leaves a really bad taste with how Twilio handled the situation AS A BUSINESS.')
