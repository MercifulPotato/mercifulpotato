If I&#x27;m understanding correctly: with Isolated (which is still being built), any given object is reachable from only one thread. It can be used for message-passing but not shared memory.<p>It looks like they&#x27;ve talked about shared memory as important for efficiency, eg <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;araq&#x2F;concurrency.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;araq&#x2F;concurrency.html</a> (from back in 2013 apparently, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a &quot;canonical&quot; project view or not) says:<p>&gt; For real CPU efficiency on commodity hardware shared memory is unavoidable. Message passing doesn&#x27;t cut it and ultimately doesn&#x27;t address the same problems.

Is it intended to be memory-safe (as in the Rust terminology) or not?')
