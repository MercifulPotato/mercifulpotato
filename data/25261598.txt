Item(by='kinkrtyavimoodh', descendants=None, kids=[25263139], score=None, time=1606789672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261209, text='IANAL so please correct me if I am wrong, but doesn&#x27;t counterfeiting imply that the scamming party is claiming to sell something else while actually selling fake goods? Such as passing off their random shirt as a Gucci shirt? Or mixing chemicals themselves and calling it a Versace perfume.<p>In this case the other listing isn&#x27;t claiming to sell BeltBro, they are claiming to sell AAROMANO. The fact that they stole the copy etc is wrong but it sounds like a different problem. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any misrepresentation or counterfeiting.')
