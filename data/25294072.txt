He told a story about a manager of a missile program, who was responsible for managing &amp; executing launch tests. When notified about an upcoming test, he would take off a few days before the launch, and the day of the launch itself. Such was his confidence in the program, procedures, and his crew. (I am sure I have some minor details incorrect). Different fields, but wouldn&#x27;t that be an amazing place to get to for s&#x2F;w projects, as opposed to this chaos.')
