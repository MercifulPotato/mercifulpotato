Item(by='bonestamp2', descendants=None, kids=[25876001], score=None, time=1611343347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874744, text='&gt; I assume the developer popularity is a result of the iPhone gold rush, which Apple exploited using exclusivity tactics. Therefore I consider it an abomination to see developers embrace the platform so thoroughly.<p>That&#x27;s not why most developers I know use macs. We use them because we got tired of spending a couple days a year (on average) unfucking our Windows machine after something goes wrong. When you&#x27;re a developer, you&#x27;re often installing, uninstalling and changing things... much more than the average personal or business user. That means there are a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong, and they do. Even most Google employees were using macs until they themselves started making high end Chromebooks; tens of thousands of google employees still use macs. Some users have moved on to linux, but most stay on mac because they want to spend time in the OS and not on the OS. I can appreciate both perspectives, there&#x27;s no right answer for everyone.<p>I share your wish that the hardware was more serviceable but everything is a compromise at the end of the day and that&#x27;s the compromise I&#x27;m willing to take in exchange for the other benefits.<p>Some complain about the price, but the high end macbook pros aren&#x27;t even more expensive than windows workstation laptops. Our company actually saved several hundred dollars per machine when we switched from ThinkPads with the same specs. Not to mention, our IT support costs were cut almost in half with macs.<p>So, aside from gaming or some specific edgecase requirements, it&#x27;s hard for me to justify owning a PC. That said, I have one of those edgecase requirements with one of my clients so I have a ThinkPad just for them. But, it stays in a drawer when I&#x27;m not working on that specific thing.')
