Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=[25151057], score=None, time=1605800219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25150433, text='&gt; <i>what do we know?</i><p>I’ll reply again: <i>a lot</i>. You can’t possibly expect me to summarise the vast, complex state of the art knowledge of RNA biology for a lay person here — it literally fills books. At the very least ask more specific questions, I’ll be happy to answer them, if I can.<p>&gt; <i>You clearly know nothing about the long term effects</i><p>Wrong. I’m no expert on all aspects of RNA vaccines, but I <i>am</i> an expert on RNA biology. What I do know allows me to conclusively exclude the possibility of the RNA in vaccines incorporating into the host genome (because that notion is simply not coherent). I’m not parroting any line here.')
