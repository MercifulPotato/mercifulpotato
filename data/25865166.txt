Item(by='mewse', descendants=None, kids=[25865528], score=None, time=1611267262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864821, text='&gt; isolating and pushing out so called &quot;deplorables&quot; is escalating the current American political conflicts to serious violence.<p>Can you provide references that back up this claim?<p>Bear in mind that the deplatforming began after January 6th of this year, so any escalating violence which may have occurred on or before that point is not evidence of your claim.  And after the events of the 6th I imagine it’d be difficult to compose a compelling argument that <i>not</i> deplatforming prevents violence.<p>In any case, the only news on the topic that I’ve seen has been that election misinformation on Facebook&#x2F;Twitter has dropped by 70% since the deplatforming happened on those platforms[1].  That isn’t directly about violence, but presumably will result in less alt-right radicalisation, since their ability to reach new people is reduced.  Though obviously it’s much too early to have a good understanding of the long-term impact of actions like this.<p>Which is why I’m so curious about how you’re making statements like this as if they’re plain facts.  I’m super interested to see any references you can provide!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;misinformation-trump-twitter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;misinfo...</a>')
