It could be turning the indicator on&#x2F;off for <i>anything</i> that somebody else told it to do it for.<p>(Originally, I was using an Arduino Nano and a USB serial interface for communication, but my flatmate rewrote it to go over UDP to a Pi Zero W, as he wanted to use a particular RPi hat as the indicator lights)<p>Detecting the microphone on&#x2F;off status on OS X was shamelessly ripped off from the answer to this StackExchange question:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;37470201&#x2F;how-can-i-tell-if-the-camera-is-in-use-by-another-process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;37470201&#x2F;how-can-i-tell-...</a>.
