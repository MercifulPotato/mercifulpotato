One project I&#x27;m working on part time is switching from class based components + Redux to functional components + graphql and I must say I&#x27;m enjoying graphql a lot more than I was writing actions, sagas and reducers.<p>I don&#x27;t have any recommendations for pure client side applications though, but for those you can probably get away with using contexts and hooks for quite a lot of the state management.')
