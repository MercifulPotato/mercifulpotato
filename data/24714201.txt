Are you suggesting that people still look at this problem as if the choice was random, even when they know it is not? (e.g., if they think the &#x27;random&#x27; and &#x27;chosen&#x27; cases are equivalent.) That is also plausible, but if it is common, that would imply that the phrasing of the problem is not the root cause of their misunderstanding of the optimal strategy.<p>Personally, IIRC, my first reaction was to assume the second box opening was not random (perhaps only because the question is not phrased as being conditional on this act revealing a goat) but did not see how this gave any useful information.<p>Here&#x27;s another possible way of getting it wrong, regardless of the phrasing of the problem: assuming that, after the reveal (and whether one thinks of it as random or not), one is, as it were, starting over, except with a choice between two boxes rather than three, and no other information.')
