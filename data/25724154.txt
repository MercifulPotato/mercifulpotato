It feels like Big Tech flourished in last 4 years with advertisement revenue while staying hush about these issues, but all of a sudden they have an epiphany now.<p>Big Tech leaders are selfish, cowards, clueless and just as vulnerable as the government leaders. They were interested in milking billions in Ads from these hate speech, particularly Twitter.<p>If I were employees at these big companies, I would raise internal questions - why wasn&#x27;t this done earlier? What changed? The US Capitol riots is the specific moment that made them all wake up?<p>These are rhetorical questions. All big tech leaders appeared in front of Congress in last 4 years, and weasled and squeeked instead of prowl and roar. Spineless and immoral, speaking double speak to appease the board of directors and the shareholders. At some point, the world would be destroyed but we&#x27;ve created a lot of value for our shareholders. Reminds me of this [1]. Pardon my cynicism, open for your comments.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Benioff&#x2F;status&#x2F;549339156854214656&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Benioff&#x2F;status&#x2F;549339156854214656&#x2F;photo&#x2F;...</a>')
