I find that a quick search for &quot;best ___ reddit&quot; typically gets me better results than whatever lists are posted on blogs. Feels more accurate to see community-upvoted recommendations rather than the opinion of one random person who may not even be particularly familiar with the recommendations they&#x27;re making (generally not likely they&#x27;ve actually used everything on their list extensively). Youtube is also decent for this since you can skim the comments to see the consensus.')
