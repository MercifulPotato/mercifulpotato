I&#x27;ll share my experience before my theory.<p>I never used matches. I assume this is some variation on the &quot;like&quot; or &quot;swipe-right&quot; system. Women get bombarded with these. Conversely, women don&#x27;t a high ratio of high quality messages.<p>I maybe looked at the compatibility score if it&#x27;s there (e.g. OKCupid), read through the profiles, and if there was enough to grab my interest I&#x27;d write a message that at least makes some reference to what&#x27;s mentioned in their profile. I got a response 8-9&#x2F;10 times. Personally I think I look average enough and don&#x27;t have amazing conversation skills, I just put in the work to send thoughtful messages.<p>As to why the match system doesn&#x27;t work, the sheer amount of noise in online dating (and over-representation of men, I think) is such that these &quot;match&quot; systems amount to glancing through a ton of pictures and picking the best-looking ones. Particularly since profiles are best fairly compact, and don&#x27;t tell you a ton about a person at the onset. You&#x27;re a complete stranger to women on these platforms, with 0 trust value to your name, and so actually having a meaningful interaction is a great way to expedite that trust. You won&#x27;t get there with &quot;hey babe&quot;, &quot;nice pic&quot;, &quot;nice outfit&quot;, &quot;nice smile&quot;. I mean, maybe you can if you&#x27;re one of the fortunate few to cut through the noise and get someone&#x27;s interest on the strength of your &quot;playboy&quot; looking mug. But most likely, it&#x27;s a weak approach.<p>EDIT: worth taking a good picture of yourself. Get a second opinion on it.')
