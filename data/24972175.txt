You need to plan for failure, like any cloud provider.<p>&gt; the raw compute is cheaper<p>Dramatically so. 20% of the price.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s also storage<p>You can get local NVMe, cheaply, with literally 100x the perf you can get with the most expensive EBS volumes. AWS does not have a storage offering that comes close, not even their instance store NVMe.<p>&gt; what happens to his disks<p>VM images can be backed up automatically without downtime (on a schedule, not live.) They offer an EBS equivalent.<p>&gt; OVH doesn&#x27;t have regions everywhere<p>They have enough. us-west, us-east, eu-west, APAC, others. I&#x27;ll grant that the US regions are operated by a different corporate entity and a different web interface, and that is annoying.')
