I started writing books as a last-ditch effort in late 2018. Had left my job in 2014, was living on savings and the occasional workshops I conducted in colleges. I had plenty of material prepared for workshops, so I started converting them to books.<p>First book didn&#x27;t sell much but initial sales of the second one got me enough to cover about 2 months of expenses. Combined with workshops, books helped me through 2019 and early 2020. (Note that I live alone, in outskirts of a city in India - my monthly living expenses is around $150, which includes rent and domestic help)<p>Pandemic meant I didn&#x27;t get workshops anymore, but fortunately, my ebooks sale picked up enough to more than cover that loss. I even spent about 5 months to just update my earlier books. Currently working on 9th book that I hope to publish by end of this month.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnbyexample.github.io&#x2F;books&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnbyexample.github.io&#x2F;books&#x2F;</a>')
