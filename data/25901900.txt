Decent ones are still not quite in balance.<p>&gt;because of a failure of forecasting<p>It depends on which side of forecasting, was it demand or supply? It is always easy for outsider to say they should have built 10 Fabs 4 years ago and they would have been riding the tide. But even older ones are still CapEx intensive and relatively long ROI. Which means from a business prospective it is better safe than sorry.<p>And that is especially true with TSMC who are extremely conservative.<p>There was another comment about Auto Maker should built their own Fab. I really dont see how this would make any sense. All Auto Maker has to do to guarantee supply was to sign a long term agreement with TSMC, or even ask TSMC to built dedicated Fabs for them. But not a single client ( apart from Apple ) was willing to bet. No one was willing to bet their game for 3-4 years in advance. There is also the conservative nature of traditional business in demand side. If they sign it now at a cost that is 40% higher than their previous median, will they end up like Airliners hedging on Oil Price and ultimately cost them the billions.<p>So it really is the problem from both side.<p>And the same is true in <i>ALL</i> other market. Anyone who has ever worked in buy and sell, supply chain should see how similar the conversations are.')
