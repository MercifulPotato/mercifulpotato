But vote counting Florida <i>didn&#x27;t start on election day</i>. The state was allowed (because they are smart about this) to start counting 23 days in advance of e-day. The author of this thread is unaware of that, and has been fooled by Florida&#x27;s efficiency into believing that vote returns are uniform everywhere. But that wasn&#x27;t true in PA, where there was no preprocessing time at all. The clock started in PA on e-day, and the busiest, largest, most Democratic counties naturally took longer to count.')
