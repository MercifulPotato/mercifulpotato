To put it very short, we give every user a trust rank. It varies overtime. If you consistently, and for a long while, reported attacks that could be correlated by others and our own botnet, you progress, until you reach trust rank 1. Other are listened to, but need double verification from TR1 and&#x2F;or our own botnet. We also have a canari list, which contains IP not too shoot. (Google bot, Microsoft update, DNS, etc.) and last but not list, an AI mashing logs to extract larger patterns. With this &quot;consensus&quot; chamber, a weighted vote is cast and the IP is then included in the DB. (We are always on the more conservative side if in doubt) If you ever feed bad intel, your TR regresses. If you shoot a canari, we&#x27;ll either presume you are trying to poison or that your scenario is too twitchy. If you feed a bad intel, you TR regresses instantly and your voice weight less in the consensus (actually nothing in fact). IP are fresh, they were seen doing crap at max 72h before. Beyond this threshold, we consider them not relevant anymore and wait for a refresh. So if you are doing &quot;headshots&quot;, 0 days style, only, the system would have hard time catching you. But if you port &#x2F; web scan, bruteforce, do credential or CC stuffing, or whatever else, the system catches you quite quickly.')
