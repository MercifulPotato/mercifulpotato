It&#x27;s a shame because I do believe it is very much cultural - it is possible to write very clear, expressive and safe Scala code. But it doesn&#x27;t seem the community has settled on that as a cultural idiom. Instead they frequently favor maxing out the power of the language and type system at every opportunity and that means you often encounter lines of code that look like a string of hieroglyphics, or functional programming concepts and higher order types thrown at basic simple logic that could be imperatively written with much more clarity.')
