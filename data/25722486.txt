If I have that file open, why should I navigate the directory hierarchy in the open panel? I can just drag the proxy icon for that document straight into the open panel. Bam, the open panel is pointing at the correct location.<p>On Windows you can drag the file right onto the &#x27;Browse...&#x27; button on the web page. (this does require some precision, as otherwise you&#x27;ll open the file in the browser)<p>&gt; Something shouldn’t act as something else, especially if it’s destructive. That, in my opinion, violates the principle of least surprise — an interface to C or R should not U or D.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m too used to Windows&#x27;s idiosyncrasies, but an open&#x2F;save dialog is an Explorer window (at least in a functional sense). When you drag a file onto it, it does the same thing as an Explorer window. This does not seem that surprising to me.')
