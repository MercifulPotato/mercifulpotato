Whether R6RS was &quot;widely rejected&quot; is of course up for debate, but the people that didn&#x27;t like it decided that mostly after Matthew and Kent&#x27;s contributions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecraven.github.io&#x2F;r7rs-benchmarks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecraven.github.io&#x2F;r7rs-benchmarks&#x2F;</a> is an ok comparison between Scheme implementations; you can see that Chez is much faster than Chicken in general. Chez also already supports many features beyond Chicken that were needed to implement Racket (for example, internal support that made delimited continuations easy).<p>It&#x27;s hard to know exactly how many people use what, but it seems likely that Racket is the most widely used Scheme derivative.')
