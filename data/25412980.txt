What becomes abundantly clear when reading it is what I think I was trying to express above, that there is so much that could be better in systemd but that it&#x27;s hampered by it&#x27;s own legacy baggage, which accumulated very quickly and very soon after the first implementation was released.<p>That link is a long read, but if you have any time or effort invested into systemd and systems that use it, and find yourself having to create unit files or diagnose weirdness with services, it&#x27;s very worthwhile to read if you haven&#x27;t already.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darknedgy.net&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;02&#x2F;0&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darknedgy.net&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;02&#x2F;0&#x2F;</a>')
