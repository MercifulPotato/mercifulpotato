Amazon products (whether maliciously or not) capture far more audio than they need to do their job, they send it to Amazon, and Amazon sends it to third-party contractors to analze by hand as a step in building their NLP models and whatnot. Echoes are marketed as AI magic, and a reasonable consumer would not expect that hours of sensitive conversations are being listened to by anyone, much less an unknown third party that Amazon has little control over. In my mind, that scenario is qualitatively different from and worse than shipping small amounts of pertinent data to a machine which can&#x27;t be bribed or manipulated.')
