Watch the last link in my original post. It explains the propaganda barrage perfectly.<p>There are a bunch of deadlines and appellate levels baked into this process for a reason. If Al Gore could hold things up for over a month over a few hundred votes, all the concerns about following lawful process are null and void. Same with histrionics about &quot;overturning democracy&quot;.<p>The choice is pretty simple even to Trump voters: either Trump finds the smoking gun and deservedly gets a second term, or he&#x27;s full of shit and he doesn&#x27;t deserve a second term. Nobody on the right will set cities on fire either way.')
