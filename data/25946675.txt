Colorado Civil Rights Commission</i> case, it wasn&#x27;t about free speech rights at all: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colo...</a><p>Both sides of that case agreed that the company was choosing to deny its custom wedding cake services to a gay wedding because of the owner&#x27;s religious beliefs against gay weddings, not because of anyone&#x27;s speech. In other words, they objected to making a wedding cake because of attributes inherent to who the engaged couple were, not anything that was being said or expressed.<p>I view it as plenty consistent to forbid businesses which serve the public from choosing not to serve customers based on innate aspects of who they are, like being the same sex or gender as each other, while still allowing them to make such choices in reaction to the customer&#x27;s speech. Sometimes the line is clear (no speech was at issue in this case), and sometimes it&#x27;s blurry, but that&#x27;s absolutely a consistent rule whether or not it&#x27;s the one you support.<p>The reason the Supreme Court ruled for the bakeshop was very narrow. The ruling acknowledged that states can constitutionally have non-discrimination laws that apply neutrally to businesses without making available exemptions due to religious beliefs. The ruling was just about the behavior of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission in applying their state law to this case, which the Supreme Court majority viewers as hostile to the owner&#x27;s religious beliefs and not religiously neutral as the government must be. So it was about religious bias in the government action, only. One member of the 5-4 majority wrote that he might well have ruled the other way had the commission acted neutrally.')
