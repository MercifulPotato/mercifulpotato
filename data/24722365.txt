Of course its convenient for people who live there!<p>Hmm, I guess a lot of this comes down to where you&#x27;re going, where you&#x27;re coming from, and what you&#x27;re planning to do.<p>My friends live in Brooklyn and Manhattan. They pay high rent prices by they sold their cars (100% car free). So if I visit NYC, I have to figure out transportation on my own to meet them at whatever location. (Broadway, or various talk-shows like  Colbert etc. etc.), which are typically on Manhattan proper.<p>----<p>I&#x27;ll say this: from the perspective of Wash DC -&gt; NYC, I have the choice of either Planes or Trains. The Trains run along-side the Airports (in fact, there are more Train stops). Trains seem like the more convenient option.<p>From your perspective: NYC -&gt; Wash DC, I think the airport makes more sense. There&#x27;s less to do in Wash DC than NYC. Union Station is cool and all, but most of what to do in the area is in the suburbs, which inevitably means you need a car. If you&#x27;re getting a car, might as well land at an airport.<p>The Wash DC -&gt; NYC trip however is accomplished without ever renting a car, and just staying on the subway lines to get wherever you need.')
