It&#x27;s up the desktop computational capacity scale where use cases aren&#x27;t as elegant as the fairly easy to circumscribe NUC applications. (Least those I can imagine).<p>Second I forgot that Intel shipped the Scale MP authored RAM to block driver for Optane that let you tell your OS to treat storage attached Optane as RAM.<p>Because of unrelated factors the systems acquisition I was running in  H218 is starting over now and as a consequence I never tested components not sure about relevance and 2nd order road map business effects. So since the only pixels I&#x27;ve read about the RAM to block driver option have been 9n the launch specifications and my 3 comments about this since I have no idea if you actually can use storage Optane as RAM.<p>(Dropping the semantics &quot;storage class&quot; and  &quot;memory class&quot; would be my first edict at the helm of Intel strategy. I bet this nomenclature actually confuses the internal planning and delivery itself it&#x27;s so insidiously confusing I could write one of those hideous corporate communications &quot;style guide&quot; about the possibilities for disaster this way )<p>Below is my original question I still would dearly appreciate learning your answer to. But I owe you a apology for doubting you in the original because I originally thought that Optane could my to.a lot of beating in a 1l chassis and less. Check out Patrick at Serve the Home for a super series of reviews of inexpensive and bargain performance mini NUC style desktops I&#x27;m sure you get no better than with a stick of Optane added.(To a PCIE riser adapter n.b. some of these tiny models give you bifurcation on their only pcie slot which could transform your use cases.<p>[Original below &#x2F;<p>Intel &quot;new unit of computing&quot; skus have block storage drivers for Optane???<p>touisteur I must beg your indulgence my desire for knowledge! Can you possibly post a sky &#x2F; model number of the most capable NUC you have working with Optane?')
