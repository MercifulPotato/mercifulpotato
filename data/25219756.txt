After all, the hardware is basically capable of both roles, potentially ergonomics aside (I haven&#x27;t encountered a removeable keyboard that really works like a laptop does which I often use on my lap).<p>At the same time, it may be worth observing that tablets took off when Apple basically threw out laptop compatibility and made tablets their own (well, phone-related) thing. So convergence would be interesting but I don&#x27;t want them to de-optimize either the tablet or the laptop to do so. (Though I expect they&#x27;ll get there at some point and have no doubt they&#x27;re experimenting internally.)')
