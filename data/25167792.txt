The history of the peer review process is outlined here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcg-random.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;history-of-the-pcg-paper.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcg-random.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;history-of-the-pcg-paper.ht...</a><p>I&#x27;m confused about why the author didn&#x27;t just resubmit it elsewhere, but to me PCG as an example raises a lot of questions about the value of peer review today, and about how it is conducted (not that I think it does or doesn&#x27;t have value, but it raises a lot of questions about it). At least from the author&#x27;s perspective it seems the concerns were about presentation rather than substance. Speaking from personal experience, peer review can be quixotic and I put little weight on it not appearing in a peer-reviewed journal, as opposed to any specific criticisms that might have been raised in a review (given the attention to PCG at this point, if there were serious criticisms of it it seems a failing on the part of the journal not to address these).')
