Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608551776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493910, text='&gt; I find all these slavery comparisons in poor taste. Across history you will find slaves that were treated well, accumulated wealth, were educated and held in high regard - yet they still legally were the <i>property of another person</i>. The fundamental distinction with slavery is not a bad paycheck.<p>&quot;Poor taste&quot;? Seriously? I didn&#x27;t say this <i>is</i> slavery, did I? I compared 19th century slaves&#x27; <i>wages</i> with these factory workers&#x27; <i>wages</i>. Somehow I can&#x27;t do that because... why, exactly? Because you don&#x27;t like it when people compare the working conditions of slaves with those of modern workers?<p>And it&#x27;s not like I cherry-picked some well-off slaves here. $100 is the <i>minimum</i> slave wage numbers I could find—even the page said it was for <i>unskilled labor</i>. And to add insult to injury, those numbers appear to be NOT adjusted for (15x?) inflation! (Probably worth double-checking this part, but see: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lestweforget.hamptonu.edu&#x2F;page.cfm?uuid=9FEC4E79-B361-4EEE-E0FADE75507425B7" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lestweforget.hamptonu.edu&#x2F;page.cfm?uuid=9FEC4E79-B361...</a>)<p>&gt; In this case, the distinction wasn&#x27;t a bad paycheck either. The compensation was fine on paper,<p>The average Indian factory worker earns ₹330,000&#x2F;year or $371&#x2F;month. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.payscale.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;IN&#x2F;Job=Factory_Worker&#x2F;Hourly_Rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.payscale.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;IN&#x2F;Job=Factory_Worker&#x2F;Hour...</a><p>The <i>engineers</i> here hired for $286&#x2F;mo and had their pay <i>&quot;on paper&quot;</i> reduced to $163&#x2F;month ($109&#x2F;month for non-engineers).<p>I don&#x27;t know what your standard for &quot;a bad paycheck&quot; is, but I suppose, given how you were fine with this being equal to actual slaves&#x27; wages, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that less than half the average salary for a person who build products for the world&#x27;s richest company isn&#x27;t bad enough for you.')
