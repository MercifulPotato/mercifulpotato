That kind of thing would be so much cleaner to do on a completely server-side platform.<p>However, a large game like that would need a large budget to back it. Without Stadia being more popular I don&#x27;t see anyone throwing all their eggs in that basket. Because it <i>could</i> only run on Stadia and nowhere else.<p>One way to mitigate risk would have been to build for both Luna (Amazon) and Stadia. But neither are very popular, and one is Windows-only while the other is Linux-only. So my risk would actually double, not mitigate since I have to develop for two platforms.<p>I&#x27;m ignoring xCloud since it&#x27;s just a bunch of Xboxes and no thanks.<p>For smaller, mid-size&#x2F;indie studios which are not building a massively multiplayer game, I just don&#x27;t see the up side of making a Stadia-only game. They wouldn&#x27;t be trivially portable to other platforms and players have learnt to live with network latencies.<p>So, unless a Google-owned studio does it, I don&#x27;t see truly cloud-first multiplayer game happening.  Assuming that&#x27;s what you meant by &quot;cloud first&quot;.<p>OTOH Ubisoft does ship their games on Stadia and I&#x27;d be curious to know if the experience in, for example, The Division 2 is any better.  Even if the game doesn&#x27;t scale the number of players in an instance, they should still get some benefit of  being on Stadia.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a very popular mode in the game&#x27;s subreddit though.')
