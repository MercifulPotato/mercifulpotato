Especially, since I have the feeling I&#x27;m not an easy person to work with and finding a co-founder that fits would be sheer luck, haha.<p>But I&#x27;m currently planning to build a SaaS product, that I want to turn into a company, if it works out.<p>&quot;Slack for microblogging&quot; or &quot;Twitter for companies&quot;, depending on the perspective. Making asynchronous company communication better.<p>I&#x27;m a self-employed dev consultant and technical writer from Germany, who makes most of his money with tech blogging right now.
