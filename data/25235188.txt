Unlike regular small businesses which do not necessarily meet this definition.<p>Pursuing scale does not mean starting immediately with scalability in mind. It means creating a scalable business model, that is able to scale in subsequent stages.<p>That means that in the beginning you will have to iterate quickly to find that formula, aggresively discarding ideas (and therefore code) and moving fast.<p>But that&#x27;s not sustainable. Once you&#x27;ve found that formula, then you have to rebuild it solidly so that it&#x27;s secure, performant, scalable and reliable.')
