Bikes breaking the law cause few, speeding cars cause many.<p>Dismissing the regular lawbreaking of cars doesn’t seem rational. Just because you don’t like the way bikes break the law doesn’t mean bikes breaking the law has a negative impact.<p>Cursory search turns this up:<p>&gt; Speeding was a factor in 26% of all traffic fatalities in 2018, killing 9,378, or an average of over 25 people per day.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;injuryfacts.nsc.org&#x2F;motor-vehicle&#x2F;motor-vehicle-safety-issues&#x2F;speeding&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;injuryfacts.nsc.org&#x2F;motor-vehicle&#x2F;motor-vehicle-safe...</a>')
