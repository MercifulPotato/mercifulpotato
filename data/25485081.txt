Multiplying that to a month and converting to a weaker currency means a lot of money (probably 3x as much as what I&#x27;m making as a senior developer, also in a 3rd world country).<p>Probably for now it&#x27;s still very viable, but the scene might change quite a bit in 5 years time. Also your entire income is tied to Youtube, just one arbitrary rule change on their side and there goes your whole life.')
