What&#x27;s behind the similarities is different as well, for example the reason for their obsession with the past. I&#x27;m sure you can find similarities between many stories when you do it in such a vague way.<p>Besides that, there&#x27;s more to those books than the main plot. I always assumed that TGG is this well regarded because of themes it handles and how they&#x27;re presented by the story of Gatsby. The same goes for The Count of Monte Cristo. I find them to be too different to call on even a version of the other, let alone a crappy one.')
