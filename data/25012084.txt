But a) It wouldn&#x27;t be terribly useful because this is a rather stupid way to write code, and b) It would always be possible to contrive yet another example that the &quot;extended type checker&quot; would fail on, because static analysis can never completely replace running the program. That&#x27;s basically Rice&#x27;s Theorem.')
