They’re a very important affordance. If you’re not fond of the æsthetics of a strong underline, one technique I consider reasonable (and use on my own website) is to reduce the opacity of the underline with something like `text-decoration-color: #03c5` (unfortunately you’ll have to write it out each time you change the colour of a link; I really want color-mix(currentColor transparent 33%) from the CSS Color Module Level 5 draft).<p>• When styling :hover and :active, consider :focus as well. For example, where you’ve hidden link underlines, you’ve shown them on :hover and :active, but you should probably show them on :focus as well. (If you want to get fancy and recent, you could consider using :focus-visible instead of :focus; if you do, just make sure it’s in a separate rule set from the others so it doesn’t break older browsers.)<p>• On something like this, killing the purple colouring of visited links makes me sad. Please consider restoring it, it’s useful on content websites.<p>• The markup you use for heading anchors (&lt;h2 id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#foo&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;) isn’t great, and precludes putting <i>actual</i> links in headings (which is normally not a good idea, but there are definitely cases where I’ve reckoned it worthwhile and done it). If you want heading anchor links, go for something like &lt;h2 id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;Foo &lt;a href=&quot;#foo&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; title=&quot;Link to this heading&quot;&gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt; (some of the most common characters used for this: # NUMBER SIGN, § SECTION SIGN, ¶ PILCROW SIGN, U+1F517 LINK SYMBOL), and show the anchor on hover only (but make sure it’s part of layout either the whole time (e.g. `visibility: hidden` when not hovered) or none of the time (e.g. `position: absolute`) in order to avoid layout flap). This will make life better for users of screen readers especially (so they’re not getting a spurious link). If anyone else has opinions on heading anchors, I’d be interested to hear them; don’t think I’ve ever seen a detailed analysis of all the techniques and their implications.<p>• One of your headings has a typo: &lt;h2 id=&quot;Blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#blockquote&quot;&gt;Blockquote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;, id needs to be lower case (IDs are case sensitive).<p>• Good job on appropriate use of pre, code, samp and kbd.')
