Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605428796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098886, text='&gt; but I’d be shocked if the Inca actually never thought of “kill the leader”.<p>Not having a plan on transfer of control in case the leader is dead or otherwise unable to lead is, for intents and purposes, the same thing as never thought of it.<p>&gt; Just identifying having a highly developed material culture with having greater access to historical knowledge doesn’t cut it.<p>I already identified how the Romans could beat a barbarian army 10 times their size and better armed. This was done with organization, tactics, and discipline. These were developed through centuries of experience, and writing is how these things are remembered.<p>A big part of what West Point teaches is military history, and it&#x27;s not for the lulz. It&#x27;s to learn the lessons of the past. My father (Air Force) received a lot of training as an officer, I still have his training books, and it&#x27;s largely military history. The military is very interested in learning from history, and you can even see the constant changes in tactics in wars like WW1 and WW2 as they learn from mistakes.<p>&gt; transplanting western military practice to south Vietnam (as ARVN forces) failed while the Viet Cong flourished.<p>That is indeed an interesting case history. The US, though, crippled itself by being unwilling (not unaware) to employ what was necessary to win. The VC took every advantage of what they knew the US was unwilling to do. Ho Chi Minh was no fool, had spent time in the west, and had access to military history. I.e. it was not a conflict between a society with military history knowledge and one without.')
