Item(by='rendall', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602833491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24797342, text='&gt; Again the hard evidence that you are dying to see is classified and would reveal American hacking capabilities. &lt;<p>Then we are back to exactly what I said at the start: they remain allegations only. Nothing has been proven, as you said. One either believes anonymous sources within the CIA and the people who believe them, or one wants evidence for such an extraordinary claim.<p>Remember: it&#x27;s not just about Russians, but the original allegation was that the Trump campaign was involved and that has been very quietly walked back.<p>The DNC was definitely hacked and the content of the emails were embarrassing to powerful people, but whenever the content of the emails are discussed, people start shouting about Russians and Trump&#x27;s love of Putin.<p>The email exposure could have been a revelatory renaissance for the DNC, a real moment of self-aware house-cleaning. I was really hoping they would slim down and become a truly effective opposition party. Instead, it&#x27;s Russians.<p>Given the lack of evidence <i>and</i> the unprecedented political climate, particularly the distraction from the emails themselves, I would like more evidence than &quot;Trust the DNC and the CIA and the NSA when we say: Trump colluded with Russians to get elected!&quot;<p>Do new Presidents have a meeting with Head Spook who says &quot;Support our illegal, unethical mass surveillance program or we&#x27;ll make everyone think you like to get peed on&quot;?<p>Every single American should demand that evidence even if they despise Trump. The same destabilizing allegation can be made against anyone without that <i>requirement for evidence</i> irrespective of political persuasion. I would be this oppositional on behalf of Clinton, Biden, Obama, anyone. You should too.')
