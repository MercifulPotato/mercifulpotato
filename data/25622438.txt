Item(by='allworknoplay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609689268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597513, text='The value derived from public goods is mostly not factored into GDP growth and (when executed well) serves people both more efficiently and more equitably than the purchases GDP does account for (obvious examples, public or publicly funded healthcare, parks, libraries). The degrowth argument is that overall this increase in efficiency would reduce production&#x2F;consumption while improving lives, but it does also not ignore that particularly wasteful nations&#x2F;lifestyles may need to live differently.<p>Hickel and others who write on degrowth are mostly very clear about these definitions (and Less is More is exceedingly thorough on the matter), but obviously you have to read past the surface level to pick up some of the detail. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> meant as a dig at you or to imply that you&#x27;re not willing to do more reading, just to clarify that because oftentimes these analyses are miles apart from typical US&#x2F;western thinking, a lot of digging can be necessary.<p>As I noted above, Hickel applies a historical materialist analysis in a lot of his work, which can take some time getting used to (and, indeed, did for me).')
