It would definitely not be an option for me, I drive 1200km in roughly 12h - 14h each night, for 2w long tours:<p>- Heviz to Saint Tropez 1200km<p>- Empuriabrava to Malaga 1100km<p>- Porto to Andorra 1100km<p>- Krakow to Bucharest 1200km<p>- other shorter trips (700km-800km)<p>-----<p>- business trip Bucharest to Leipzig 1600km (I go much farther without passengers)<p>- Leizig to London 1200km (slow ferry)<p>- etc<p>I drive a diesel and it&#x27;s just excellent for my family&#x27;s holidaying, we would be wasting considerable time charging, reducing the overall time to enjoy the tour&#x27;s destinations.')
