Calling them collectively &quot;evolution&quot; is not a subtle mistake to make.<p>But they absolutely are the same category. 100%, and always have been. Just look at how mating preference has affected many species, ex: the peacock. &quot;Cultural&quot; pressure preferred men with a colorful booty, and over time genetics conformed. The same is true if the &quot;culture&quot; prefers people who are soft spoken, adversarial, drawn to the color green, or have a funny left ear. If the culture means that people with a certain trait are more successful and thus more likely to reproduce over a sufficient period of time genetics will trend towards producing more individuals like that.<p>As for the rest of your comment, I keep reading it over and over and I can&#x27;t figure out what your getting at. Developing a vaccine means more people in my group are likely to survive to reproduce, thus (given sufficient time) evolution will favor those species that can produce vaccines (or not be vulnerable to the disease in the first place).')
