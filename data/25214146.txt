For example credential stuffing or a dictionary attack.<p>The information the attacker is looking for is the validity of the password. If you want to use a captcha to protect against this, the outcome must be the same whether the password is valid or not. Because if you only show the captcha for failed logins, the attacker can find out that the password was incorrect without solving a captctha, which by symmetry means they can also find out if it&#x27;s correct without solving one.')
