And yes, maybe this means having your personal information public for all to see.<p>If you make a shitty judgement and destroy someone&#x27;s life and you end up getting targeted as a result, then maybe you shouldn&#x27;t have made an unjust judgment and destroyed someone&#x27;s life. Your judgements should have weight, and shouldn&#x27;t be made lightly.<p>Maybe if there was more personal accountability in our justice system then the American judicial system would stop focusing so much on prison profitability and punishment, and would start focusing more on positive concepts like rehabilitation and social support structures?')
