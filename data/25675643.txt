When you send money it could take them literally over an hour to get that money.  (Usually within 5 minutes though.)  This is not ideal for a business.  There are bitcoin services that smooth this over, giving them cash immediately, and automatically transferring it to USD so the company never touches a bitcoin.  To the business it&#x27;s basically a credit card.<p>2) Transfer fees.  While not the end of the world in the early days, they&#x27;re worse than credit cards today.  Expect to pay a lot to buy a latte, almost 1.5x due to fees.<p>The bitcoin community for a while has been strongly pushing for BCH or Bitcoin Cash.  It addresses these two issues, reducing fees significantly and accelerating transfer.  It&#x27;s the alt currency the bitcoin community has been pushing.  However, I admit I have zero experience using it to buy items.')
