The only small negative is the its life is a little too long... even if I take it at 7am, I find I have difficulty getting to sleep sometimes up till 3am... and then my whole sleep schedule gets shifted and it’s damn difficult to get it back to a proper rhythm.<p>That aside, I _so_ agree with grandparent post about the negative stigma associated with medication for adhd. I’m so angry at society, parents, everyone for having done this to me in my early years — if only I had started earlier instead of in my mid-20s.')
