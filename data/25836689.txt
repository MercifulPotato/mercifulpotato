If I instantiate two strings and add them with `+`, I&#x27;d better understand that I&#x27;m calling an overloaded operator -- what else could I possibly think I&#x27;d be doing there?<p>So I really don&#x27;t agree that operator overloading is misleading -- that&#x27;s only true if you ignore underlying data types. By this logic, any form of polymorphism is potentially misleading.')
