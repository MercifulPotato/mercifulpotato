At no point did I mention that a CS degree wasn&#x27;t worth it...I did raise a couple of questions and share a few options that some people might not have known were there. This is definitely not a debate of whether a CS degree is worth it or not...It&#x27;s my hope that those interested in tech will see that CS is just one among the very many options...and tech as we know it is huge! Each one of us has a place in tech not only those who did CS in college. And there are so many paths to get into tech apart from CS')
