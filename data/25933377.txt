Looking at what Forbes said his charity (which does not mean 100% his money) they donated $410 million in 2018. That&#x27;s ~0.006% of his wealth meaning it&#x27;s not even giving away a penny out of $100. It&#x27;s close to half a penny out of $100.<p>I understand net worth of $69B is on paper but none of these guys are philanthropic.')
