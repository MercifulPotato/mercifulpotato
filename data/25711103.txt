At stake in that case, and those on the right, was a concern of being coerced into violating one&#x27;s religious beliefs because of Colorado&#x27;s anti-discrimination law. The legal arguments at the time were if it violated the cake shop&#x27;s 1st amendment rights of free exercise of religion.<p>In today&#x27;s context there is no anti-discrimination law for the likes of Parler, nor is there a concern that being forced to keep an app like Parler online would violate any constitutionally protected rights of these service providers should a statute ever be passed that did.<p>Those backing the cake shop decision did largely for the free exercise of religion, not an appeal to the free market.<p>Disclaimer: I didn&#x27;t think a cake shop should be allowed to deny service because it&#x27;s for a gay wedding.')
