MagSafe is neat, but I don&#x27;t miss the $80 proprietary charger with a cable that&#x27;s fixed to the brick and will probably fail if you do anything other than leave it sitting at a desk.<p>Magsafe is more than neat, it pretty much solved the major annoyance with laptop power cables (e.g. someone trips on cable, and laptop gets jerked around, eventually damaging something).<p>Apple likes to toot its own horn way to much, but they deserve tons of credit for Magsafe.')
