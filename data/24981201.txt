If you work as an employee and have a 401(k), you are participating in a form of tax avoidance: deferral. Your money goes into it, but it&#x27;s not taxed until much later when you retire and take it out. If you have an HSA, a Roth IRA or a 529 plan for your kid&#x27;s education, you&#x27;re also deferring and&#x2F;or avoiding taxes. If you buy municipal bonds you&#x27;re avoiding some taxes. There are a few &quot;it would be foolish not to&quot; ways for middle class people to keep their finances tax efficient. Obviously there are many more ways available to rich people and businesses, and they can shelter orders of magnitude more money than us, but let&#x27;s not pretend that tax avoidance is something only they do.')
