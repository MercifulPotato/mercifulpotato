I&#x27;ve written an LL(1) parser generator that (generates a function that) parses modern awk, without semicolons, but with operator-less concatenation, and that can deal with tokens that can be keywords and identifiers (which is also needed for e.g. FORTRAN). As long as your language is deterministic, it can be expressed as an LR grammar, although legibility might suffer.')
