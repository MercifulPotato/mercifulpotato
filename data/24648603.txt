(Mind you, we&#x27;re talking European cars here, there&#x27;s a chance our options would have been greater in North America.)<p>However, it only took us a little longer because we weren&#x27;t keen on a (mini) van -- had we considered vans too, there would have been a lot more options, and they&#x27;re often even more affordable than other types of (spacious) cars.<p>I understand that not everyone can afford to go out and buy a new car -- but if that is in your way of having more children, I&#x27;d say the reason was not the car seat requirement but cost considerations. And I think that&#x27;s very much a reasonable consideration.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;only 57 child deaths&quot; argument - besides obviously being ethically questionable, deaths is not the only thing you want to prevent: how about (severe) non-lethal injuries? The reason car seats are mandatory (and regulated, too) is not because there is a strong car seat lobby but because of the merits they provide. For instance, buckling up a child that isn&#x27;t tall enough yet bears the risk of getting the belt wrapped around their neck instead of across their chest which in case of an impact is certainly not what you want.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a rocket surgeon to find the narrative of this paper questionable. Being a parent myself, I find it very hard to imagine a couple going: &quot;Oh, we would so love to have a third child if it wasn&#x27;t for that dang car seat problem...&quot;  Not that it&#x27;s completely inconceivable but, I mean, come on...')
