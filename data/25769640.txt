And as many have said, &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it go start your own social network&quot; is an acceptable response.<p>The real issue is at the next layer down, the service providers which collectively operate what we know as &quot;the Internet&quot;:  what if you <i>can&#x27;t</i> go start your own social network because none of the server hosts or domain registrars will provide their services to you?<p>But do we really want to mandate (and regulate) that hosting providers <i>must</i> provide service to anyone that asks, no matter how undesirable or troublesome they might be?  Should there be a &quot;provider of last resort&quot; for those that are unable to find a willing host?  I&#x27;d like to see more discussion and debate on this topic.')
