If you have a larger family with babies, a dishwasher can be very useful. Baby bottles have many of different parts and washing them by hand can be time consuming, baby toys can be washed in the dishwasher as well...<p>And if you cook your own food rather than buying prepared food, you&#x27;ll also be washing a lot of stuff: frying pans, pots, cutting boards, blender cups, etc.')
