After all, that&#x27;s less than 1%, right?<p>But it&#x27;s not so simple. That 0.5% comes out of the profit margin. If a company has 50% profit margins, losing that extra 0.5% isn&#x27;t a big deal. However, if a company is operating on 10% margins, that 0.5% suddenly becomes an extra 5% overhead.')
