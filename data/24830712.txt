Its a shame that NVLink is isolated to pretty much the DGX-line of computers and POWER9 (The &quot;big&quot; ones too, I don&#x27;t think Talos II supports NVLink). But I guess an interconnect that fast will require dedicated, non-standard hardware.<p>----------<p>AMD&#x27;s GPU Infinity Fabric seems to be a different infinity fabric from their CPU. CPU Infinity Fabric is ~50GB&#x2F;s, but the GPU Infinity Fabric is GPU-to-GPU links of ~90GB&#x2F;s.<p>Realistically, PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 will be the path forward for standard PCs. There will always be incredible application-specific solutions (such as NVLink &#x2F; NVSwitch on the DGX), but the general computer user will wait for the open standards to support such speeds before adopting them.<p>At the moment, GPU-to-GPU communications probably will scale better than CPU-to-GPU comms. CPUs just aren&#x27;t built for the bandwidth (outside of POWER9 &#x2F; POWER10).')
