First, checking result values is dumb.  It adds 50% more code.  Add exception handling.<p>Second, the way imports work is obviously due to some internal google kitschy-ness.  Remote import paths are so dumb.  People set up entire domains and CDN&#x27;s just to host some code.  The import path has to have a specific format, you can&#x27;t have three levels. github.com&#x2F;me&#x2F;sub1&#x2F;module won&#x27;t work, so everyone creates mypersonalgithub.com&#x2F;sub1&#x2F;module.  It feels like one L3 at google set this up on a Friday, and the industry has to live with it.  Of course all this code will be broken in 3 years.<p>There is no easy way to point imports to a local development copy of a repo because google uses a monorepo and everyone else has to live with it.')
