Simply going to the store on LSD to buy snacks can become like some kind of deeply symbolic adventure. I remember going “ghost hunting” on a high dose of mushrooms with my buddies which consisted of us marching around in the snow with beers in the middle of the night through downtown urban parks laughing our asses of at “no ghosts here. We’ll get em next time” etc. I once ate a perfectly ripe orange bell pepper and it was the sensory equivalent of an actual religious experience. I’ve balled my eyes out crying like a bitch on acid while watching a very cheesy and manipulative infomercial about supporting a kid in Africa for only one dollar a day.<p>One of the powers of psychedelics are their ability to transform basic tasks and cliches into meaningful experiences. Opening you mind to the wonders of the universe, of being alive briefly somehow and here. A bazooka joe bubblegum comic can become charged with more meaning than Finnegans Wake.<p>But I don’t see the value of microdosing. I actually find the practice a little repugnant? maybe that’s too strong of a word or not strong enough but I feel like the whole point of something like LSD is to enrich, deepen, unravel, perplex, and push forward that little spark of awareness inside. It’s not a performance enhancing drug like a creativity steroid for like power working at the office.')
