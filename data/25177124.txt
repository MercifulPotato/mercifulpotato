Item(by='input_sh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606050277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159931, text='Logic Magazine (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logicmag.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logicmag.io&#x2F;</a>) is the only one I truly care about. I don&#x27;t have their entire catalogue, but I&#x27;ve read everything they&#x27;ve produced in the last year or so. They&#x27;ve recently released a couple of ebooks and I&#x27;m slowly making my way through them. I&#x27;m surprised nobody mentioned them yet.<p>Other than that, I occasionally read 2600 and Jacobin, though I&#x27;m not as engaged with them as I am with Logic.')
