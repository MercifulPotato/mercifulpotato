But even so, your first paragraph does not contradict what I wrote. You&#x27;re also incorrect: there is no transitivity to providing source. Section 6 makes clear that if your offer of source relies on someone else&#x27;s server (i.e. you are redistributing the work but do not control the location where the source is available): <i>&quot;Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements&quot;</i>. These clauses in the GPL cover <i>you</i> the person distributing a copy of the work, not &quot;them&quot; (the people who gave you a copy of the work).<p>You&#x27;re incorrect about GPLv2. Section 3 states that if you distribute the work &quot;in object code or executable form&quot;, you have to do one of 3 possible things:<p><pre><code>  1. accompany the object&#x2F;executable with machine readable code\n  2. accompany the object&#x2F;executable with a written offer of access to machine readable code\n  3. accompany the object&#x2F;executable with the same information you received with the object&#x2F;executable. (This option is only available for non-commercial distribution)\n</code></pre>\nSo you&#x27;re simply completely wrong about this.')
