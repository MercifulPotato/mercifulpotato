The difference comes from the usual rebates, but the largest part is that commercial users don&#x27;t pay the renewable tax that is mandatory for non-commercial users. For the really big users, such as smeltings, there are additional subsidies on top to keep the price of power even lower.<p>So the situation might be different elsewhere, but in Germany, poor consumers pay for Energiewende plus subsidies.')
