The patterns are still widely in use to this day. The trade offs between lease times and availability are so clearly put, reading this could save a lot of hard earned lessons. This paper is such a great top-down explanation of consensus and Paxos.<p>If I could go back in time I’d start off my interest in distributed systems by reading just this paper. That would have been a much better approach than feeling like I’m getting beat in the face over and over again by a water mill. The path I took was like many others: You see some distributed database that gets you really excited. CAP leads to Paxos, that leads to FLP, you rebel for a few months by getting interested in CRDTs, and then you have a bunch of hang overs from papers not using the term consistency consistently. The rest of it can best be drawn by giving a toddler a box of crayons.<p>Just read this instead.')
