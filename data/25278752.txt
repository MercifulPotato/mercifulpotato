Two HR problems really, as exemplified by both your sentences.<p>&gt; They have a real problem finding developers that will want to work on it.<p>At most companies, you don&#x27;t get to choose projects you <i>want</i> to work on. You get assigned a project whether you like it or not. Almost every other company functions like this, Google&#x27;s insistence on being different is shooting them in the foot.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t get promoted at Google for maintaining a product that isn&#x27;t growing.<p>Maybe Google should be selecting for people who aren&#x27;t interested in chasing promotions. There are plenty of &#x27;workman&#x27; developers in the world who are okay with spending the rest of their careers maintaining legacy systems. This probably ties into good ol&#x27; Silicon Valley age discrimination: they spend so much time chasing young hotshots with chips on their shoulders, while most of the workman developers are in their 50s.')
