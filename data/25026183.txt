Especially binaries and&#x2F;or Steam games, things running through Wine can be a pain because standard libraries are in non-standard locations.<p>What I ended up doing since about a year or so is just make my whole root partition something I can generate with Debian debootstrap + chroot. I have a +- 250 LOC bash script which I just invoke on a free partition, and it just completely reinstalls Debian in there as if it were a Docker container.<p>I then rerun this about once every month, reboot, switch to the new partition (and fall back to the old one in case things went wrong, which almost never happens) and I couldnâ€™t be happier with it. Happy middle ground.')
