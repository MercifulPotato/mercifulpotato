If strong man Randy Savage wanted to give a public speech on your front lawn, you should have the right to say no because that&#x27;s your property. You should also be able to say yes. This gets complicated because these online platforms blur the lines between public and private spaces. Objectively they are private spaces because the companies own the &quot;land.&quot; But we as users think about them as public spaces because they facilitate similar things to public spaces in the offline world. There&#x27;d also be an inherit danger to making those platforms a real public space, controlled by governments (who&#x27;s!). The case is honestly really messy and we don&#x27;t need to overly simplify it, we need to solve the problem (as a society) and figure out how to move forward.')
