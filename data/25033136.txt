Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25033223], score=None, time=1604915655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023594, text='I strongly advise against this style of justification:<p><pre><code>  text-align: justify;\n  text-justify: inter-character;\n</code></pre>\nJustification is typically only particularly suitable for fairly narrow columns, combined with hyphenation. And inter-character justification is… hazardous, only to be entered into with substantial caution.<p>Sometimes layouts and what occurs to the inline-end [right] of the layout can also justify justification<p>But unless one of these conditions is true, I recommend against any form of justification, <i>especially</i> inter-character.<p>Another bit of CSS that I would like removed is the `html { cursor: default; }`. Apps can do that so that chrome uses the default cursor (and restore it to auto in content areas), but content websites shouldn’t do that. I want to see the usual I-beam when I’m hovering over text.')
