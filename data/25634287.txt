The story behind their newly founded N division is very interesting. They poached a long-time BMW executive Albert Biermann who headed multiple vehicle developments and the BMW M group, and tasked him with bringing up the N high performance divison within Hyundai (N as in Namyang R&amp;D, but he says also Nurburgring). Since then he&#x27;s been promoted to President &amp; Head of R&amp;D.
