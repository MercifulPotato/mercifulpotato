Whether that is how things <i>should be</i> from an ethical or societal standpoint is a separate question.<p>Pornhub itself could use a similar defense to what you suggest. Is it their job to police the content instead of the police? If they were hosting content with minors and rape (and it seems highly likely they were), they were profiting from illegal activities.<p>I&#x27;m on the fence. At some point the law should hold people who profit from hurting people liable. While Master Card (or PornHub) were not necessarily active participants here, they both profited from criminal activity.<p>Where you draw the line is tough.')
