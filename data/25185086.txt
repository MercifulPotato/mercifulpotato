Item(by='LeonM', descendants=None, kids=[25208239, 25185291], score=None, time=1606124584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175980, text='I&#x27;ve owned several Lexuses (Lexi?), and the one thing that struck me was the recalls, and how long they keep doing that.<p>I got my first experience when I bought an 2006 IS250. In 2014 (the car was now 8 years old) I got a recall letter that one of the windshield wiper bolts may not have been torqued to spec at the factory. Not kidding. I ignored this letter, as I was sure this was just some trick to get me to visit the dealership. After 2 months I got another letter telling me that this issue was not yet resolved, urging me to go get the free repair. I did.<p>In 2015 I had a complaint that the parcel shelf would make a creaking noise if the car was parked in the sun for a while. They replaced the parcel shelf under warranty (this was a 9 year old car at the time!).<p>In 2016 I got a recall that the fuel filter may not have been properly installed 10 years prior at the factory, so I got a free repair again.<p>Finally in 2018 (12 year old car), they replaced the passenger airbags free of charge, as there may be something wrong with those.<p>Their attention to quality is insane. In the 10+ years that I have owned Lexus cars (first an IS250, now an IS-F), I&#x27;ve had zero defects (that I had to pay for). That said, I do always bring in the car for service at dealership at the recommended intervals. Proper maintenance gets you a long way.')
