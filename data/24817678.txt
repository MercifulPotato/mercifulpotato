So there are definitely some valid concerns...<p>Actually, I forgot that christian terrorism is actually global now, with the Christchurch (N.Z.) mosque shooter having inspired multiple copycat terrorist attacks in California (U.S.), Texas (U.S.) and Norway. Of course these massacres are in addition to the other, white-supremacist christian terror attacks that had already been widespread in the United States before COVID took us all out of public places.')
