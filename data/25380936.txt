We don&#x27;t have to guess and say &quot;them&quot; and &quot;their&quot; work.<p>This, to me, indicates that you want the previous person to say &quot;him&quot; and &quot;his&quot; where they said &quot;them&quot; and &quot;their&quot;. Even in this post you&#x27;re displaying a negative opinion about the use of singular &quot;they&quot;, and expressing that you want others to stop using singular &quot;they&quot; this way. Am I wrong?<p>Like, if you referred to Dominique McLean with &quot;he&quot;, and someone said to you &quot;We know that person prefers they&#x2F;them pronouns, we don&#x27;t have to guess based on appearances and say &#x27;he&#x27;,&quot; would you not characterize them as dictating that you have to use certain language?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t speak in vagaries when something is specific and known.<p>I hope you do. (And I&#x27;m pretty sure you do.) Omitting information that is specific, known, and <i>irrelevant</i> is a basic part of communicating well. Not every failure to bring up something that is specific and known constitutes &quot;dumbing down of discourse&quot;.')
