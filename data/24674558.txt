A  meeting held in Moscow on 7-8 February, 2001 by the  Arctic Council for “The ecological  reasonable  management in  field of stores of out-of-date pesticides“ project  have  identified priority Regions whereby the inventory of out-of-date pesticides should be documented. These Regions are the  Kamchatka Peninsula, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Magadan Oblast, Sakha Republic (Yakutia) and Tyumen Oblast of the Russian Federation. Furthermore, inventory for out-of-date pesticides in three sub-boreal Regions have been identified: Altai Krai, Kurgan and Omsk Oblast (Shekhovtsov, 2002). Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have a large quantity of PTS which are obsolete and redundant. A conservative estimate suggests there is greater than 150000  t of obsolete pesticides. Much is in poor condition and not  properly managed (PAN UK, 2000).</i>')
