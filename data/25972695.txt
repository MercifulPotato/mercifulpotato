You still have to wait for the intra refresh to cover the frame before you can start watching properly.  That takes just as long as waiting for a keyframe, and needs slightly more bytes.<p>The benefit of intra refresh is that you avoid having any particularly large frames.  If you&#x27;re using a sub-second buffer, then intra refresh makes your maximum frame size <i>much</i> smaller without sacrificing quality.  It&#x27;s a godsend for getting latency down to tiny amounts.  But if you have 1 or 2 seconds of buffer then it&#x27;s no big deal if a keyframe is an order of magnitude bigger than other frames, and intra refresh is pointless.<p>Also it&#x27;s not really a codec thing, it&#x27;s a clever encoder trick that you can do on basically anything.')
