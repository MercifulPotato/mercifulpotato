This causes most people with it to be deficient in all fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and to typically have far too little body fat.<p>Ironically, although I have shrunk as my edema has improved, I probably have more subcutaneous fat, making it possible to go into ketogenesis. I probably had no (or too little) fat reserves to draw upon previously, making fasting particularly hard on me.')
