It does make sense that you can skip having a separate consent step by making it part of the contract, <i>if and only if</i> the user is actually aware that is part of the terms (and no, the fiction that they will read through the legalese does not count). If the contract said something prominent like &quot;Faceboot will process your data for purposes of publishing it to your friends&quot;, that would be reasonable consent to me. But it is obviously nonsensical for a user to be thinking they&#x27;re signing up to interact with their friends, while insisting they&#x27;re technically somehow contracting for &quot;advertising services&quot;. There&#x27;s also the severability part of the GDPR, where a user should be able to consent solely for the interaction with friends, while explicitly not consenting for these &quot;advertising services&quot;.')
