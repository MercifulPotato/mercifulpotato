Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607884798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25408304, text='&gt;Iâ€™m always amused by how fixated Americans (even liberals) are on race in this matter. America is very diverse when it comes to ethnicities but it has a strong program of secular-national indoctrination, which results in a very homogenous culture considering its size.<p>Race in this case shows up because the mind wants to find an explanation for the discrepancy in social and public trust. Norwegians trust their institutions much more than Americans do. We also know that public trust was higher until the US&#x27;s &quot;lost decade&quot; in the &#x27;70s and figure it probably depends on some factors that have been recently changing.<p>We look for instinctive, emotional explanations because we&#x27;re interested in &quot;forcing functions&quot;: it&#x27;s not interesting to say that low-quality government caused by low-trust society leads to low-trust society because that postulates a universal dynamical property of social trust that doesn&#x27;t really distinguish between societies. The hysteria surrounding the presidency of Barack Obama and the reputational endurance of a tyrant who came into the political limelight spreading ludicrous conspiracy theories about the same, in light of his significance as the first non-white POTUS, is one of many common-knowledge observations lending credence to the idea that racial resentment and mistrust drives an unwillingness to cooperate in American society. And then, of course, it&#x27;s not really that easy to find truly well-run multiracial societies. Singapore and Israel have both invested in top-down integration and racial justice initiatives but resentment and discrimination stick around -- yet those are probably the <i>best</i> examples. Trinidad might be another example, but may be coasting on easy money from oil extraction.')
