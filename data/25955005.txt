(So the settlement houses allowed sell orders to go through.)<p>The tl;dr is - when you are trading through a discount broker, you get a discount service. Serious brokerages, that are used by institutional investors don&#x27;t have these problems, but they also charge a <i>lot</i> more for their services.')
