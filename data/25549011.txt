The efficacy results are certainly disappointing compared to the near-miraculous results with the two mRNA vaccines, but 60%+ efficacy is still enough to save many, <i>many</i> lives and bring the world back to normalcy. Remember, the 60% number doesn&#x27;t mean 60% see improvement, it means of the people who would&#x27;ve gotten COVID without the vaccine, 60% didn&#x27;t get it at all and 40% got it with significantly less negative effects. In all likelihood it will also greatly reduce the ability to spread the virus.<p>They have already begun testing the half-full dose as another trial, so if that works better than full-full we may see the approval modified down the line.<p>&gt; we already have Pfizer and Moderna<p>Unfortunately production constraints are going to mean that it will take a long time for those two vaccines to be produced in enough quantity to vaccinate most of the rich world. The cost for them and temperature requirements mean that they&#x27;d be impractical for most countries even in a few years.')
