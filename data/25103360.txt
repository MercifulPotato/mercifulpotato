Item(by='Veen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605464239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25101702, text='&gt; The problem goes further than the police into the prosecutors<p>Yes.<p>&gt; Hence the refusal to prosecute in cases of murder by police of black people.<p>No. They refuse to prosecute cases of murder by police regardless of race. The race of the person killed is largely irrelevant, which is the point I was making in the previous comment. Black officers aren&#x27;t prosecuted, white officers aren&#x27;t prosecuted. They aren&#x27;t prosecuted when they kill white people or people of color. The problem is that police (and the prosecutors) aren&#x27;t accountable, and they know it.<p>You make it about race rather than accountability and the problem will not be fixed.')
