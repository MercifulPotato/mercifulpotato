These are people who can plunge a knife into your face and feel nothing. These people fit our definition of &quot;dark.&quot; These traits are actually physically measurable and the fact that these people exist proves your statement as only one part of a more complex story.<p>The science actually says that at the far end of the spectrum a psychopath tends to not be successful due to there inability to self control. Ordinarily your behavior is tempered by fear and empathy but a psychopath can only temper his impulses through raw logic overall leading to more problems.')
