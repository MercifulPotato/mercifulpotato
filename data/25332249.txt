That does not mean that people who produce a high amount of commits are the top performers in your company.<p>I&#x27;ve had to deal with plenty of colleagues who moved very fast, committed extremely often, and were praised by management for the amount of work they produced. But in reality their work was rushed, sloppy, riddled with issues and a nightmare to maintain. And it would inevitably fall upon us &quot;lesser&quot; performers to actually investigate and fix all those issues, making us look less productive in the process.<p>In my opinion a better metric to quantify someone&#x27;s performance is to count the amount of problems they solve vs. the amount of problems they create. I bet that many of the rockstar programmers out there would land on the negative side of that particular scale.')
