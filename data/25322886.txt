In my network I have people who 1) I know personally, close friends 2) professionally, where a friendship lasts as long as we work together 3) also people who I&#x27;ve seen on meetups etc., we both know we work in the same area of expertise, but never had a chance to talk 4) and people who look like we could do business together.<p>I think it&#x27;s good thing to keep up with all of them, but it also obscures professional network for all of us.')
