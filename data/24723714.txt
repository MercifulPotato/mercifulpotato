So I had to Google it, and it was the 4th result.<p>I tried to CTRL-F &quot;SDR&quot; on the article page, but there was no mention of what the abbreviation stands for. I realize it&#x27;s meant for technically inclined readers, and it is a great article and project. I should&#x27;ve checked the linked websites first, but it was easier to just Google it :)<p>I&#x27;d include a short mention of what SDR stands for (maybe with a link to Wikipedia) at the top so people unfamiliar with it can get an idea of what they&#x27;re about to read. Just imo.')
