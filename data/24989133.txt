So, if hypothetically Solar was 2c&#x2F;kWh and peaking natural gas was 6c&#x2F;kWh then you would want to add more solar until 3kWh of new Solar only offset 1kWh of natural gas with the other 2kWh being wasted.<p>Which does not mean 2&#x2F;3 of total solar energy would be wasted. Further, storage and energy markets also complicate things.  However, it does illustrate why you want an over supply of the cheapest option even if not all of it gets used.')
