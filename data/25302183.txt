For me, the increased markup is worth it knowing that I&#x27;ll be able to get a laptop that runs Linux and plays video games with little to no configuration.<p>What makes me hesitant is the build quality. I&#x27;ve seen enough comments online (and in this thread) with complaints about parts needing to be replaced.<p>That being said, I want to note that System76 has great documentation on repairing their laptops. For example, here are the docs for the Oryx Pro 6: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech-docs.system76.com&#x2F;models&#x2F;oryp6&#x2F;repairs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech-docs.system76.com&#x2F;models&#x2F;oryp6&#x2F;repairs.html</a>.<p>It&#x27;s pretty straightforward to upgrade the internals, replace parts, re-paste the CPU, etc. Repairability is an important factor for me, especially considering the next laptop I buy I&#x27;m going to use it for a while (I&#x27;m currently using a 2013 T530).<p>Still, the complaints about needing to replace things makes me hesitate.<p>It&#x27;s nice for a machine to be easily repairable and upgradeable, but I don&#x27;t want to invest so much money in a machine where I&#x27;ll need to replace parts right away. Also, I imagine most people looking for a new laptop don&#x27;t own the tools needed to repair nor are they comfortable with opening up a very expensive machine. Heck, I&#x27;m only comfortable with fiddling with my T530 because it&#x27;s so cheap.')
