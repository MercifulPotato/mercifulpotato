Item(by='CivBase', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607612619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360139, text='&gt; 20 years ago reputed organizations such as newspapers, radio stations and television informed people the truth. Conspiracy theories were fringe and didn&#x27;t have a way to spread. Today more than half the population believes in conspiracy theories because they learn the &quot;truth&quot; from disreputable sources on social media.<p>Why do you suppose that is, though?  Could it be because algorithms designed to feed users content they like promote and reinforce echo chambers which, in turn, incentivize the creation and spread of convenient misinformation?<p>Social media did not <i>start</i> the echo chambers, but they have played a huge role in making them more accessible and extreme than ever before.  How can we trust them to safeguard us from misinformation when they are the ones profiting from it?<p>I do not want Google deciding what is and isn&#x27;t &quot;misinformation&quot;.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they&#x27;re more guilty of the mess we&#x27;re now in than any media organization or content creator.')
