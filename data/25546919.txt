The other is how everyone seem to act like CPUs like the Ryzens don&#x27;t matter anymore because they are not ARM. I mean, I get it, this is nice for some usage. I&#x27;m in game development and I don&#x27;t see things like these making me switch anytime soon. 3D animation, game development, gaming, AI, all of this benefit more from really powerful CPU&#x2F;GPU and don&#x27;t care much about power consumption. And this is a big user base. \nI don&#x27;t want to sound like I hater (I&#x27;m not), and I&#x27;m glad something new is happening, but it&#x27;s not like this going to move suddenly everyone to ARM.')
