When I was in college I bought the shitiest, cheapest IKEA shelves (LACK?) basically made from cartboard that&#x27;s mounted on a steel rack. They survived three moves, no damage whatsoever.<p>I&#x27;m sure that this does not apply to every piece they make, but I wouldn&#x27;t shit on every thing they make.<p>Another thing I like about IKEA is that I can get parts for most of the things that tend to break. My friend had a custom made kitchen. One of the cabinet hindges broke but the contractor was nowhere to be found to replace it, and he had to scour the internets for that specific replacement. If one of the hindges in my IKEA kitchen breaks I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to replace it, probably at no cost, because it&#x27;s still being made and probably will still be made in 10 years.')
