After all it is the least vulnerable who are most likely to be the main spreaders, and until a reasonable portion of &lt;65 year olds are vaccinated, the spread is likely to continue and probably even flatten before that point.<p>However since most countries in the world are in the middle of a 2nd&#x2F;3rd wave, it makes absolute sense to vaccinate the vulnerable first rather than try race against the curve with a vaccination programme. Especially when the vaccination lag is longer than the spread.')
