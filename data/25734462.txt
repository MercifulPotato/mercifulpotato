IMHO this includes deciding not to conduct business with another private party. I do not consider this on their part to be &quot;censorship,&quot; at least not moreso than any restriction on their decision to do this.<p>The underlying issue is that services provided by private companies have effectively become essential infrastructure. This causes a host of problems, which have been pointed out by far-sighted individuals, and only now are some of this issues becoming visible to a broader audience. These private companies are structurally not designed to take responsibility for the activities happening on their platform, and in fact some of them are designed around <i>not</i> being responsible. But there&#x27;s no one else to shift that responsibility onto, and a large area with a vacumm of accountability has caused problems.<p>Compared to private companies becoming the gatekeepers of public discourse, I have a variety of things I would prefer, including regulation. But I don&#x27;t know if any of those alternatives are realistic. So, &quot;yes with caveats.&quot;')
