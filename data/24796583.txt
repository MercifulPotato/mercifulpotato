I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s also, but I still find myself pivoting frequently. I think it may be a balance issue in my case. Meaning, working a full time job and having family that need my time and attention. In this case, I try to find something that sticks, and if not, I move on. But maybe that approach is flawed. Maybe the overall vision of becoming financially free is the wrong approach. Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of focusing on something you really enjoy. Not enjoy as in for a few months but find something you love and has meaning. Maybe that&#x27;s more fulfilling and will lead to financial reward?? I really no have clue, it&#x27;s such a hard landscape to maintain, cut, water, weed etc.\nI&#x27;m glad you found enjoyment in what you do! I&#x27;m happy for you even though I don&#x27;t know you. Good luck with the rest of your journey!!!')
