You won&#x27;t just be moving people from A to B; you will be erasing countless generations worth of cultural identity, placing people in an unfamiliar environment where their previously acquired skills will be largely irrelevant, so you need to re-educate most of them. And you will be doing it using force, because I guarantee you there will be a lot of opposition.<p>Oh, and you need to get the current urban population to accept that they need to pay for it all, because, you know, you&#x27;ll be taking everything from the rural population. Furthermore, they need to integrate and intermingle with the recent arrivals to prevent them from becoming a new underclass.<p>I see what you&#x27;re trying to argue, but we&#x27;ve got several recent waves of migrants facing less problems and which European societies still failed to integrate properly. If we can&#x27;t do it with a few million immigrants, then I assure you that it can&#x27;t be done with the 115 million people living on the European countryside.')
