Most of us work regular ass jobs full time just like everyone else here and we&#x27;re lucky to get 1&#x2F;3 of our unit strength to report within a few hours. Plenty of service members don&#x27;t even live in the same state where they are in the Guard, especially on the East Coast. Then it takes time to make a plan, organize, issue equipment, load&#x2F;prep vehicles, and roll out.<p>Finally, NG commanders can&#x27;t just choose to deploy somewhere on their own because there&#x27;s an emergency. It has to be authorized by the state governor. I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly for DC though. The Secretary of the Army was part of a press briefing Wednesday announcing NG deployment, but the NGs for the 50 states aren&#x27;t part of the Department of the Army, but rather the states and the National Guard Bureau until mobilized under Title 10 authority (not a drop of the hat thing). Maybe the DC Guard is under some direct Executive Branch control which in this case would be bad news, because look who was more than happy to have the Capitol overrun.')
