I don&#x27;t want to dig between issues and thousands of repos or docs. I imagine commercial software have even less patience, maybe that&#x27;s why Zoom used the proprietary GNOME thing instead of the open standard.<p>Wayland works really well, I think people who can&#x27;t use it yet because of features they miss should just use x.org and stop complaining and harassing open source developers.
