For example, generated assembly for C++ code with or without noexcept can be quite different. Part of the reason is that DFA based optimizations get overwhelmed by the number of implied execution paths when exceptions may be thrown. So the optimizer essentially is forced give up more often, resulting in slower code for the normal case. This is orthogonal to any binary size issues from linking the runtime support for exceptions.')
