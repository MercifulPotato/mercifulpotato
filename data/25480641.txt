I don&#x27;t think anyone reasonably concludes that his account is mostly honest or accurate, just that it may contain truth. He literally gets outed and confronted about being a liar.<p>They might &quot;complicate the narrative&quot; but they&#x27;re putting it out there as being at least partially true when it was actually entirely false. It isn&#x27;t &quot;honest&quot; journalism to keep putting out your sensationalized stories with just a little added &quot;narrative tension.&quot;<p>&gt; I see nothing wrong with this tweet<p>Read the entire thread - she is basically suggesting that the reason they didn&#x27;t charge him is because they are incompetent.<p>Both of my parents are former editors at major national publications.
