It may be described sequentially in parts but there is no mixing of output with input so can be thought of happening instantaneously.<p>This is also the same reason why I like SQL, it describes properties of the result set--if your thinking of it as procedural steps it&#x27;s more difficult. When it comes down to performance tuning however, you do have to consider what really happens in terms of index choices, loop nesting, etc. I never got into FP problems large&#x2F;complex enough to hit this point where I have to understand how FP sausages are made.')
