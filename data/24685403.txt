Exhausts are pointed backwards. Cars are built so well today that they barely let in any noise. I was surprised so many times while driving a car, because a motorbike was suddenly overtaking me out of nowhere.\nI can&#x27;t even hear a motorbike passing me when I am on a motorbike myself, up to the point when the other rider is right next to me.<p>They maybe help pedestrians and cyclists, but cars, trucks, other bikes etc. don&#x27;t really hear motorbikes.')
