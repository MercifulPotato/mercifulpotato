I really like this option: it is elegant (no spurious license files and headers polluting your program), morally irreproachable, and it gets the job done (only people who are ridiculously obsessed with legal papers will not be able to use your software).<p>The only problem is that if your software becomes somehow well-known, you&#x27;ll be bugged to no end to release it into <i>any</i> license, and you will need to develop an anti-spam filter to automatically delete these mails.')
