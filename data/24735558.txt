Other technologies outperform it very substantially in almost every metric, often simultaneously.<p>Hydrogen is energy inefficient to produce, space inefficient to store, dangerously explosive, reactive with common engineering metals, and unproven.<p>The <i>one</i> thing hydrogen is optimal for is mass efficiency, but methane is almost as good and far easier and safer to store than hydrogen, and has a much higher energy density by volume, which matters more than you&#x27;d think, even for planes and rockets. The new super-heavy rocket designed by Space X uses methane, and the current ones use kerosene.<p>For grid storage, the sole advantage of Hydrogen -- its low density -- is utterly pointless. Nobody cares how heavy building-sized storage is. Efficiency matters, and the electricity-to-hydrogen-to-electricity round trip efficiency is woeful. There&#x27;s no clear way to make this anywhere near as efficient as batteries either.<p>Not to mention that the <i>huge</i> benefit of batteries is nearly instant (single-digit millisecond!) reaction time, allowing power demand fluctuations to be efficiently smoothed out. Hydrogen can&#x27;t do that, even with fuel cells.<p>Lastly, we make hydrogen for ammonia to use as fertiliser. This doesn&#x27;t in any way mean that it this is efficient or worthwhile for power storage.')
