So, in the past, you got CentOS 7.1, then 7.2, etc., with streams, you get CentOS 8.x.<p>&gt; Saying that this is moving away from RHEL stability sounds highly disingenuous.<p>If it were so great, they&#x27;d do the same for paying customers. That they don&#x27;t move RHEL to being just 8.X makes me think that Red Hat does in fact understand that that undermines the stability of the platform.')
