Couple things I&#x27;m running into:<p>1. I registered on my laptop, opened account verification email on my phone. Verification link says I&#x27;m verified, laptop say&#x27;s I&#x27;m not even after logging out&#x2F;in.<p>2. It says 5 alerts are free, but at 3 alerts I&#x27;m presented with a message stating I&#x27;ve reached my limit.<p>3. Last pass doesn&#x27;t seem to like the email field on sign in. It won&#x27;t autofill it :(')
