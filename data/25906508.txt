What confused me a lot recently was, that the reset link sent to a certain email is <i>not</i> necessarily for the login associated with that email.<p>I tried to to login at Stack Overflow after a long time. Entered my current mail and pw. Did not work, clicked pw recovery, received mail, reset pw, got logged in. So far so good.<p>Logged out, couldn&#x27;t log in again. After a few password resets I realized that, while the mail was sent to my current address, the reset link actually was for the pw of a login associated with an old email.<p>At least for me that was not clear from the recovery email.\nHere is the full text with only email redacted:<p>&gt; <i>Account Recovery - Stack Overflow</i><p>&gt; <i>We received an account recovery request on Stack Overflow for new@example.com.</i><p>&gt; <i>If you initiated this request, reset your password here.</i><p>&gt; <i>You can use any of the following credentials to log in to your account:</i><p>&gt; <i>Email and Password (old@example.com)</i><p>&gt; <i>Email and Password (new@example.com)</i><p>&gt; <i>Once logged in, you can review existing credentials and add new ones. Simply visit your profile, click on Edit Profile &amp; Settings and My Logins.</i><p>To be clear, <i>&quot;reset your password here.&quot;</i> is a link and it changes the pw <i>only</i> for old@example.com.')
