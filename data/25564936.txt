The whole worry about flight over people is two-fold:<p>1. Props still spinning waiting to cut people up in event of flyaways or loss of power from one or more props<p>2. In the event of total loss of power, what is the total kinetic energy that would be imparted on an individual should the falling drone strike them<p>Parachute systems effectively deal with both. A proper setup will power off the drone, making sure the props aren&#x27;t spinning, and lower the rate of descent so minimal kinetic energy will be transferred in the event of a collision with a human being.<p>The new rules firmly codify what requirements must be met to operate over people safely, and parachutes along with prop guards should easily meet them.')
