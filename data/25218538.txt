Your soul is not your brain! Life begins for us when we don&#x27;t have brains after all. God also exists outside our brains and bodies. God has given our souls tools (brain, body) which work in marvellous ways. What motivates you and gives you meaning isn&#x27;t something that is conjured up by your brain to just to budget energy in the body.<p>For those who don&#x27;t believe in souls: Your heart is not your brain. Love is not your brain. What you feel deep down to be right, good and true is our heart. What motivates you and gives you meaning isn&#x27;t something that is conjured up by your brain just to budget energy in the body.<p>To those who don&#x27;t believe in (one or more of:) heart, soul, love, meaning, motivation, or anything higher: Assuming your thoughts are that humans are a bio-robot, the system itself creates meaning and motivation. The system, as if in a simulation, creates these sub-systems which for all intents and purposes are designed to be as if they are real. These sub systems are present in nature also to a lesser (or at least more opaque) extent. If you believe that X is not real because your body, brain and the robot you are in, simulates X, then X is at the very least functionally real if not fundamentally. Thus, similar to the question about what we should do if we were in a simulation, it&#x27;s probably going to be best to go along with the ride.')
