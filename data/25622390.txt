If a person asks a computer for a &quot;week number 23 of 2021&quot;, the only sensible solution in any culture I think would be to use the ISO system. Only locale dependent thing should be on which &quot;ISO week number&quot; the Sunday falls.<p>My point is the &quot;customary US system&quot; seems to actually have nothing to do with week <i>numbering</i> - or has anyone actually heard someone say &quot;23rd week of 2021&quot; or such? This system seems to only make sense when talking about ordinal weeks in and around the New Year, meaning terms like &quot;first week of 2021&quot;, &quot;second week of 2021&quot; or &quot;last week of 2020&quot;. But those are ambiguous, even in cultures that use ISO weeks. In my country ISO weeks are used extensively in business, but if you were talking about &quot;first week of 2021&quot; (ordinal), I would think you&#x27;re talking about the week on which January 1 falls - same as the &quot;US customary&quot; system. But if you said &quot;week 1 of 2021&quot; (cardinal) I would understand immediately it as the ISO week 1 of 2021, which I know from experience is not always the same as &quot;first week of 2021&quot;.')
