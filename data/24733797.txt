The problem we&#x27;re facing right now, to me, is that Twitter and Facebook have built communities that they are incapable of moderating effectively because of their scale, but they ask us to give them time to manage this difficult problem and we give it to them, absorbing more damage while they make billions. How much time do they need? They&#x27;ve all been around for over a decade. It&#x27;s time to start demanding results.<p>These platforms aren&#x27;t required to exist. If they can&#x27;t prevent their services from causing damage to societies across the world, then they should be required to fix that. If they can&#x27;t fix it, then they should be shut down.')
