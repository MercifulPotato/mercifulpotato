That&#x27;s why it makes sense to think of it as a &quot;babbler&quot;; it is incapable of not saying the first thing that comes to mind.<p>However, when you give GPT-3 the opportunity to iterate on a strategy, by asking it to follow each step of the strategy sequentially, you can see its behavior become much more similar to basic human thought.')
