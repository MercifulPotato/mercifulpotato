I have spent long hours with a router.  All these years later it it one of those tools I hate to touch. I know lots of publications like to market the router as the swiss army knife of the workshop,  but they are noisy agressive machines that turn wood into horrible fine dust. They are expensive and so is the tooling. The tooling does not last long.   If you are woodworking for fun then consider another way. Pick up an old moulding or plough plane second hand and enjoy what you are doing as a hobby.<p>I built my professional router table with an 6mm polycarbonate insert. Make a second one with a smaller hole, then you don&#x27;t need the 3d printed bits.  I never put a lift on it, I tipped it on its side to adjust it. Changing tooling is far more common than changing height, and that is a pita in a table whatever, unless it turns over. The whole setup cost maybe Â£50 if you bought everything new.  My fence was homemade too, it was heavy and tall and made out of MDF.<p>Seriously though, buy some saws, chisels and planes and have fun. They are quiet,  safe and produce chips not dust and can do everything a router can in a slower but more enjoyable way.')
