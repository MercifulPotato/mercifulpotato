(I&#x27;ve even experienced a station with 5 bays where none of them would charge - yet they all showed available).<p>I don&#x27;t even bother with L2 stations as I&#x27;m never in a place long enough to get any meaningful charge out of one - and I&#x27;m not going to go out of my way to a location that has one.<p>With all that said, taking a long trip is out of the question for me.')
