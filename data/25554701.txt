But once you’ve doubled then the opposing player gets the next opportunity to double. This is the part of the gave that really sets apart the good players I think? Over a series of games you have to calculate your advantage at certain points. I think this element makes it more a game of skill (like chess where there is no randomness and all game knowledge is shared at all times) than people give it credit for.<p>I can also see why gamblers like it so much. Nothing like a mid game “more action” button.')
