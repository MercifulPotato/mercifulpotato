For example, I’m pretty sure a “black, therefore, no loan” algorithm is illegal, regardless of whether that parameter was learned or programmed. It’s a huge problem in some of these models that latent racism can bubble up into a putatively unbiased algorithm. In some industries, including finance, I think that can expose to some regulatory risk, hence explainability being quite helpful.')
