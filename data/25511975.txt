(title of CEO doesn&#x27;t really matter all that matters is the voting rights you&#x27;re not an employee).<p>&gt; if there&#x27;s a law suit and dispute between founders no investor will touch the company with a 10 foot pole, so if he goes for a fight he loses everything.<p>&gt; there&#x27;s no reason to go down to 3% when you own 10% next month. and people think of 10 idea everyday all that matters is execution and if you wrote the code and gave around a year of your life that&#x27;s worth around 100k for an entry level engineer so I&#x27;d say you put in more than the 10k he put in.<p>&gt; finally you have the code and you can tweak it and make it open-source there&#x27;s no IP laws protecting code so at that point he owns nothing.<p>&gt; honestly the company is done, the investor is neutral cause he&#x27;s already written the company off and I would say this is the point of no return no matter which side this goes the chances of running the company are rather slim.<p>&gt; the reason he doesn&#x27;t want to monetize it is because he was probably planning on doing this to you, it&#x27;ll be much harder to do it if the company is making money if you get out he&#x27;ll monetize it the next day<p>I&#x27;d stick to my guns and tell them if they don&#x27;t buy you out then the company is dead. The only scenarios are - \n1. he buys you out.\n2. lets your equity remain ( he probably can&#x27;t fire you ).\n3. company goes down')
