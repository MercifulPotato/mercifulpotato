Since we work with our minds, I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to be successful in tech with such a condition. I don&#x27;t know anybody who has bipolar, schizophrenia, delusion disorder etc who has been successful in tech. It would be great if you could share your story so that others suffering with the same can be inspired and know that they are not alone.')
