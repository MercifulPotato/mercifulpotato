Data science has&#x2F;had a lot of hype over the last decade, and people seem to have an inherent tend to want trendy things to fail. Combined with that, you have a bunch of people hopping on the data science bandwagon, so you get a lot of grifters, snake oil salesmen, or simply individuals whose output is poor quality. Seems to have created a feedback loop, where there is always a new example of some AI solution failing, or a data science initiative that didn&#x27;t work out that everyone can point at and say &quot;See! I always knew this trend was dumb!&quot;.<p>Reality is that data science is here to stay. It&#x27;s coming out of the honeymoon period, and things may never be as hyped up as it has been the last decade, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing for the field. Everyone will probably move on to hating the next up and coming thing. I have a hunch it could be something in data engineering because, while not exactly new, it is absolutely the next &quot;data science&quot; in terms of demand, and with products like Snowflake having so much hype behind them, it seems the backlash will be inevitable.')
