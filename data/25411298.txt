A guy in a car turned onto the road a nearly hit me. So unnecessary. He could have just waited 2 seconds for me to pass. I was incandescent with rage and gave chase, while screaming obscenities. Just as well he didn&#x27;t stop as it was a long uphill and I would have been barely able to stand, let alone fight. ;0)')
