[0]\n- Microservices, hard as 1, 2, 3 - You can move it but complexity is still here [1]\n- Microservices — architecture nihilism in minimalism&#x27;s clothes [2]\n- Do I Really Need Kubernetes? [3]\n- Your team might not need Kubernetes [4]<p>I doubt that any of those articles could convince higher management. I don&#x27;t know what a &quot;respected source&quot; actually means. I general I believe that advice from consulting agency and cloud providers should be taken with a grain of salt.<p>If you drew the same conclusion from the &quot;Who’s at the Helm?&quot; article than I, there is only one way out which is a curated container catalog. VMware&#x27;s Tanzu Application Catalog [5] is the only product in that space I&#x27;m aware of. I have quoted the price tag on HN, I think it was removed since that, so I won&#x27;t repeat it here again. In any way it was magnitudes higher than the EKS base price which already seen as a showstopper by many small shops. Bottom line is: it is really hard and really expensive to operate containers in a secure manner. Probably too hard and too expensive that it would be a good idea to start with it before you actually need it.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlorenc.medium.com&#x2F;whos-at-the-helm-1101c37bf0f1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlorenc.medium.com&#x2F;whos-at-the-helm-1101c37bf0f1</a>\n1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@danielpetisme&#x2F;microservices-hard-as-1-2-3-af4e33899af4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@danielpetisme&#x2F;microservices-hard-as-1-2-...</a>\n2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vlfig.me&#x2F;posts&#x2F;microservices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vlfig.me&#x2F;posts&#x2F;microservices</a>\n3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;do-i-really-need-kubernetes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;do-i-really-need-kubernetes&#x2F;</a>\n4: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;faun&#x2F;your-team-might-not-need-kubernetes-57240e8d554a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;faun&#x2F;your-team-might-not-need-kubernetes-...</a>\n5: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tanzu.vmware.com&#x2F;application-catalog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tanzu.vmware.com&#x2F;application-catalog</a>')
