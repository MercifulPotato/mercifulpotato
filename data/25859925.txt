The one thing I am not super clear on however is doing end to end browser based testing in Web Apps. I didn&#x27;t find a lot of good documentation on this currently. I can&#x27;t tell if the &quot;correct&quot; solution is to also load something like headless chrome into the Dockerfile and install it manually or go down the path of trying to set things up in a different container with a docker-compose approach.')
