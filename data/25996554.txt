The &quot;official&quot; price isn&#x27;t really the price if any random person can&#x27;t actually buy shares at that price.  (Kind of like the Raspberry pi zero that can buy for $10 or so but you can&#x27;t actually buy in volume at that price.)  And supposing that you&#x27;re sitting on 101% of the stock and people are still buying and selling, then what in the world is going on?<p>(I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s really what&#x27;s happening with Gamestop.)<p>Anyways, even if the price is artificially low because of some artificial trades driving it down, that doesn&#x27;t really matter in the sense of the shorts being able to unwind their positions.  If the people who hold most of the stock aren&#x27;t willing to sell for less than a certain amount, then that&#x27;s what the shorts will have to pay if there aren&#x27;t any other available shares.  That requires the people with the stock to hold out for a good price (even if some infinitely wealthy person is borrowing real or imaginary shares and selling them for $1), but if they do they &quot;win&quot;.  At least, that&#x27;s my (possibly inaccurate) understanding of the situation.<p>One aspect of this whole thing I don&#x27;t understand is what happens in a &quot;failure to deliver&quot; situation?  If the shorts just can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to pay the market price for a share, what&#x27;s the penalty?  Do they get sued?  Declare bankruptcy?  Is the exchange or brokerage liable for their debts?')
