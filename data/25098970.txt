The article basically takes companies that are considered prestigious to a smaller subset of harvard undergrads and claims that since a larger subset of the population doesn&#x27;t find them prestigious they are somehow &quot;underrated&quot; and need to be looked at more.<p>At the end of the day, prestige comes with money, full stop. In CS, prestige at first might start out as just FAANG, and then later on also include well off start ups like Stripe or various HFT firms &#x2F; hedge funds since more people start to realize their compensation is equal or higher.')
