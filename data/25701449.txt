I forget which edition I have but there are one or two newer ones since then.  I used to hurt myself and be useless for a week or two, since I got the book it&#x27;s been a day or two. It&#x27;s basically a guide for effective self massage.<p>Funny side note, I learned about it from a character in a fictional book called sex drugs and blueberries, which I randomly picked up from the local section of a book store while visiting Maine about 10 years ago.')
