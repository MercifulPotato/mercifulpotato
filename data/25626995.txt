It seems like a natural extension of the film scanning and editing process that they could put out an HD 4:3 version.<p>As usual it probably comes down to cost and money - as Simon writes, it was hard enough to get the edit right and on time for the 16:9 version, and who knows how much of that effort would have to be duplicated for 4:3, even with the original as a guide. Still, it seems a missed opportunity.')
