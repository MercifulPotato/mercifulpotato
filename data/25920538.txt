My understanding is that you need to pay the top tier to get UI integrations for these things.<p>As the monorepo support could be better as it wouldn&#x27;t support multiple reporter files, like junit xmls.<p>Personally, if I had the choice I would go for Github Enterprise. Big chance with Gitlab you have to pay for hosting your own Gitlab runners anyways.')
