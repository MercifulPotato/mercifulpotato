I haven’t read the article (yet), but presumably being able to go from desired protein shape to plausible nucleotide sequences to mRNA to produce them would enable a lot of drugs to be developed that were cost&#x2F;resource prohibitive previously. Presuming you can get access to DeepFold and the compute time to run it on semi-random sequences until you get matching shapes.')
