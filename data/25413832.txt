Something about her still makes me ambitious. She&#x27;s now working for the government and I work for the media, but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work out. She worked days, I worked nights... it just wasn&#x27;t really going anywhere. So she was the spark that kept me going for a very long time. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still there, but time kind of forces you to move on a bit.<p>What keeps me going today, however, is the fact that I&#x27;ve just worked too many jobs of bosses trying to control me, not enough raises, empty promises of promotions, etc. At my latest dream job, they had me train a supervisor and when I got done and he thought he knew everything, he attempted to fire me.. and has tried at least every other month for the past 6 years. Fortunately for me, his boss hired me long before even knowing him, so he can threaten me all he wants. His boss has the final say and because I&#x27;m good at my job, I let him think he has that control -- even play the part and act like I&#x27;m scared, even though I couldn&#x27;t care less if he somehow managed to pull it off. But I&#x27;ve been with the company for 8 years now... not sure how far he&#x27;s going to get. A few months ago, I decided to call him on his bullshit, told him to write up the severance package and that I&#x27;d leave if he gave me a year salary including my 6 weeks PTO, or else he could fire me and I&#x27;d collect unemployment... surely collecting unemployment during COVID ain&#x27;t too hard to do. Nothing happened. He hasn&#x27;t threatened me since.<p>So... I&#x27;m always working on &quot;fuck you money&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=fuck%20you%20money" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=fuck%20you%2...</a>) and independent money which, for me, is to replace my entire salary so I can quit the job without ever worrying again. I&#x27;ve been working at it.. I&#x27;ve built up a business and all that, but I&#x27;ve not matched the salary quite yet, and working there for so long comes with its many benefits.<p>Anyways, if we&#x27;re talking about what inspires my creativity for the web applications I build... I often see something that has an insane price, and I know I can make it better, so I do and sometimes undercut the competition. Other times I just want to take a single thing out of the product and I&#x27;ll keep it simple and monetize that. I also love cdnjs.com and find a lot of new scripts there that inspire me to build something around those, particularly the CSS templates mixed in with the javascript files they offer. There are times where I will be working on one thing and I start to get bored, so I develop something else that actually helps me to understand a certain direction in the application I got bored with -- so that renews my interest in finishing it, during or after I finish the new application I started.')
