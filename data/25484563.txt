I actually ran into a pair of covid guards from the council, the only time I&#x27;ve seen them, and I kid you not they had their noses over their masks.<p>The rules stopped being followed some time ago, and I&#x27;ll tell you why.<p>We can&#x27;t believe in the government anymore, and it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s been too many cases of one rule for the people, one for the rulers. Multiple government level staff have been caught breaking the rules. Cummings was maybe the most egregious case, a known positive driving hundreds of miles to his parents, who is then protected by the PM from sacking. On top of that, when he actually did get sacked it was due to a petty internal power struggle months later, with no mention of the breach. Then there was the scientist with the affair, the MP who took the train back to Scotland, and so on. Plus stories of cronyism in who was given contracts to service the covid needs.<p>I can see why people think the rules are a theatre. They obviously don&#x27;t think the rules matter, or that it matters whether we get the required projects done by competent people.<p>We elected a talker to waffle his way through the Brexit negotiations. That would have worked, because those treaties are impenetrable to normal people; He can do a bit of clever rhetoric to talk up this or that point, and nobody is any wiser because they won&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to be a cheese import business with no voice in the media. Now the game is up, because you can&#x27;t talk your way out of a global pandemic, it&#x27;s too far from normal politics to have practiced stepping around.')
