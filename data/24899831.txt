It gives us back the &quot;bare specifies&quot; that CommonJS introduced, where you say `import $ from &quot;jquery&#x2F;index.js&quot;` in the code you write. Then the import-map helps the browser understand which CDN or otherwise to reach out to get that index.js file. We think this will allow ES Modules to be broadly usable &amp; &quot;modular&quot;, in a way that they have not been. I &amp; a bunch of others are holding our breath on this one. It feels like it really can fix this huge hang up, giving us a way to author modules in a way that allows modular consumption.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wicg.github.io&#x2F;import-maps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wicg.github.io&#x2F;import-maps&#x2F;</a>')
