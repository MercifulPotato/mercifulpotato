Item(by='Memosyne', descendants=None, kids=[24896313], score=None, time=1603649621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886689, text='&gt; No, you&#x27;d blame the manufacturer for building an exploding car.<p>A better analogy would be accidentally crashing the vehicle - an action resulting from negligence or incompetence rather than some 1&#x2F;1000000 chance of your car exploding due to a failure in functional safety. If someone is operating a vehicle in a manner that it was not intended to be used should we blame the manufacturer? You expect litigation to follow someone forgetting their keys, driving their car into a lake, or running out of gas on a busy freeway?<p>The solution should be to mandate more certifications and security audits for high-risk organizations. The safety mechanisms should be legal and not technical; you shouldn&#x27;t be permitted to operate a business dealing with sensitive data if you haven&#x27;t been audited. Delegating more responsibility to the system architects doesn&#x27;t solve the fact that you have incompetent people performing the administrative tasks and malicious actors abusing this incompetence. It isn&#x27;t about someone making a mistake, it&#x27;s about someone being irresponsible in a security sensitive environment - something that should carry severe legal repercussions.')
