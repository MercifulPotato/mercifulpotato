I think the speech part should always be 100% free. Of course any crimes that derive from it are and will always been fully enforceable. I just question whether or not the speech itself should be viewed as illegal,<p>So would you say, for instance,  that we should be able to do an unlimited amount of discussion, planning, and coordination of an elected official&#x27;s death.  And it&#x27;s only when one person takes a concrete action towards the plan that they should anyone be able to be arrested, and only that person?  Because the rest is all protected speech?')
