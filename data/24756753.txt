Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24756949], score=None, time=1602523000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756018, text='This is indeed a problem, so acknowledge it as such.  But do not use this problem as a justification for misrepresenting actual reality - that is dishonest.  If your position is correct and righteous, misrepresenting reality should not be necessary.<p>It is a rather sad and concerning state of affairs that there is such a widespread aversion to honesty on a site as normally clear-thinking as HN.  As well, there seems to also be a very strong aversion to discussing this phenomenon (that people <i>regularly</i> misrepresent reality here) in the abstract.  I am infinitely curious about this behavior, that is observable in large quantities.<p>-------------------------------------------------<p>EDIT:  FYI, I am only allowed a few posts per day here (overton window maintenance?), so I will have to put my answer to your child comment here as an edit...<p>&gt; Sorry, what exactly am I misrepresenting?<p>This:<p>&gt;&gt; You can disagree with opinions, but not facts. Facts are... facts. That the Holocaust happened is a fact. Denying that fact should indeed not be tolerated.<p>The ~dispute regarding the holocaust <i>does not consist of a simple binary of whether the event occurred, or not</i>.  There is all sorts of complexity and uncertainty (as is typically the case in reality, our recorded history of it, and <i>alterations</i> to that recorded history of historic events as time progresses)...and in turn, our individual perceptions of events (which we mistake for reality, as is always the case in every conversation of this type on HN, and elsewhere) are highly inconsistent with each other, as well as with <i>that which physically occurred.<p>So my question is:  why describe it as if it is a simple binary?  </i>What is the motive for this misrepresentation<i>?  Might it be perhaps, with conscious intent or not, to persuade others to adopt your style of thinking and opinions</i>?  Just speculating of course - I am very interested in knowing the actual underlying reason of why there is such a strong aversion here on HN to discussing reality <i>in its true, high dimensional nature</i>.<p>I speculate that: because we do not do this, it has real world effects similar to that which would be experienced if one wrote software on top of a specification that leaves out 3&#x2F;4 of the actual complexity of the problem space.  And so, I beat this same dead horse, day after day, hoping that some day one individual will be able to acknowledge that indeed, there is actually a horse in the room.')
