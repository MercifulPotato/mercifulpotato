It&#x27;s crazily inconsistent.<p><pre><code>  &gt; l = [1,2,3]\n  (3) [1, 2, 3]\n  &gt; l[3] = 4\n  4\n  &gt; l\n  (4) [1, 2, 3, 4]\n  &gt; l[-1] = &quot;eek&quot;\n  &quot;eek&quot;\n  &gt; l\n  (4) [1, 2, 3, 4, -1: &quot;eek&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nSo adding a 4 as a &quot;key&quot; is a proper array element; adding -1 is an object key. I&#x27;m struggling to see how anyone could think this is a good idea. Saying that they&#x27;re objects is not reasonable. Objects don&#x27;t need to do this (in most languages lists are objects, and they don&#x27;t also do key-value pairs at the same time); they just decided to make them do this.')
