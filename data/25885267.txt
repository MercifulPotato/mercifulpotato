Sex workers are a common target for bullying. It stands to reason that bullying by claiming CP is probably not uncommon.<p>Completely irrelevant concern. Kid&#x27;s safety is more important, than any concerns about &#x27;sex workers&#x27; publishing pornographic content on Twitter. Avoiding the bullying of kids by removing revenge porn published on social media is more important than your concerns about &#x27;sex workers&#x27; getting their porn removed.<p>Twitter is legally required to be able to trace the source of anything pornographic uploaded on their platform at first place, as porn is not protected by safe harbor laws or section 230. A sex worker didn&#x27;t post that child porn video featuring that young boy Twitter refused to remove.<p>There is plenty of other avenues for &#x27;sex workers&#x27; to post pornographic content on the internet, removing it from Twitter doesn&#x27;t make anyone a &#x27;victim&#x27;, it protect children.')
