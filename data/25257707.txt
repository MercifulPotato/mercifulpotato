It&#x27;s expensive comparative to local socal jobs but not to tech salaries(both me and my wife work in bay area tech companies). For comparison I want to live in 3&#x2F;3 bdrm house in a good school district that does not need a total overhaul. In the Bay Area, good school district cities (Palo Alto, Cupertino, Menlo Park, Los Altos, etc) all have houses priced close to $2M+ starting for a 3 bdrm house. In socal where I live now places are 800k - 1.1M and the schools are 9&#x27;s &amp; 10&#x27;s. The mortgage we now have is 40% cheaper than the  bay area house we had, and in the bay area all of our schools were 3&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s.')
