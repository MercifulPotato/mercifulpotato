It&#x27;s not suitable for learning Lisp; it&#x27;s written for people who already know Lisp but need an implementation-specific question answered.<p>Let me illustrate:<p>Suppose I want to compile my lisp code into an executable for easy deployment.  My first step is opening the SBCL manual and reading the entire section on the compiler.  There&#x27;s nothing in there about how to actually invoke the compiler.  Maybe there&#x27;s a command line option.  Read section 3 and find the &quot;saving a core image&quot; section.  It has lots of verbiage about saving state to disk so that you can restart the program <i>in the same state</i>.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to restart in whatever garbled development state I&#x27;m currently in.  I want the program to start in the initial state and progress normally, the way a program in just about any other language would naturally execute.  I want execution to begin at the entry point (does Lisp even have &quot;entry points&quot;?  There&#x27;s another 5 hours of wasted time trying to figure that one out) and progress naturally like it does in literally any other language I can think of.  By saving the current state how do I know I&#x27;m not introducing bugs due to some variable holding inadvertent state when I save-and-die?<p>Okay so now I&#x27;m down the rabbit hole of stackoverflow and personal websites from random PhD computer science students at Carnegie Mellon from 2001 and about now is when I usually get frustrated, say &quot;fuck it&quot;, and move on to a language like C# that actually has good documentation with copious examples (not to mention a library for just about everything), has an execution model that&#x27;s actually easy to understand, and move on with my life.<p>I say this as an aerospace engineer:  I&#x27;m a smart guy but Lisp must be beyond my reach as a mere mortal without a computer science degree.  I went through most of the Gigamonkeys book and while I can write a mean LOOP macro I can&#x27;t actually do anything useful with lisp.  The documentation is too confusing and too fragmented.<p>I want to like Lisp but it fights me every step of the way.')
