Would love that. But almost never-never-never gonna happen.<p>Culturally, Japan does a much better job than most in teaching (and learning from) war history. Hiroshimaa and Nagasaki are still quite fresh in their minds. They&#x27;re not Germany; Japan still identifies as, acknowledges being, and is deeply ashamed that they are the same nation&#x2F;people that bombed Pearl Harbor and fought in WW2.<p>The power plant meltdowns also don&#x27;t help, but is probably less culturally entrenched.<p>Only chance of changing that is <i>maybe one-day</i> for parity with N Korean capabilities, or an imminent major war with China.<p>It&#x27;d be... historically &amp; culturally <i>interesting</i>, if Japan accepted US nukes or technology as assistance in a wartime emergency. Could potentially create one hell of a bond between allies, if played right. Or a whole lot of hate, if Japan&#x27;s public opinion isn&#x27;t won over first.<p>As for South Korea, and in the context of North Korea:<p>As long as N Korea is N Korea, I don&#x27;t know if we want to just drop nukes into the equation, as is, unless we&#x27;re talking about US-controlled weapons-sharing. With the downside of being a less effective threat due to direct US involvement, and culpability.<p>What would be ideal is:<p><i>Somehow</i> make Korean reunification happen, under a democratic government that inherits NK&#x27;s nuke program. And then advances it with US blessings and&#x2F;or assistance (either openly or modeled on something like the Israeli program).<p>Japan won&#x27;t like it, but it also <i>might</i> be enough to encourge them to overcome their aversion, Hiroshima&#x2F;Nagasaki be damned.<p>It would require overcoming a constitutional ban, so not easy. But they make an increasing number of exceptions for weapons constitutionally limited to &quot;defensive capabilities,&quot; which somehow now includes two aircraft carriers with F-35Bs.<p>And which China already hates.')
