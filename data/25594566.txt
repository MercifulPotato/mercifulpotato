I didn&#x27;t want to leave any work out as I wanted to show all the work being done. Eventually my manager just wanted some very high level stuff absent of any detail and it mostly died out. My new manager just wants a few bullet points once a week on what you&#x27;ve been up to. I feel like I can convey the same information in like 3 minutes instead of using a complicated tool. The advantage is JIRA automatically tracks this stuff for you as opposed to email.<p>I think it mainly caters to micromanagers and allows them to justify additional head count &quot;look at how large our back log is&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t matter that 99% of the backlog isn&#x27;t very relevant work and hasn&#x27;t been touched in 2 years for a reason.')
