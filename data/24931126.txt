Item(by='tartoran', descendants=None, kids=[24931150, 24931399], score=None, time=1603983337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931035, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see anything intrinsically wrong with what GrubHub is doing, but I could see them needing to clearly note the relationship. There are lots of personal shopping&#x2F;delivery services which phone in orders and go pick something up without having a pre-existing relationship with the restaurant.<p>The problem is that Grubhub is not asking permission to list the business on their site and it borders on abusive behavior. The said business may have an ordering system already or a phone number to order because they simply don&#x27;t to share a hefty cut with Grubhub. Why they don&#x27;t simply ask for permission? Because some restaurants wouldn&#x27;t give it and Grubhub forces their hand. I think this is what this lawsuit is about.')
