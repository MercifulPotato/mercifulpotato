It&#x27;s better to stay away from the crazy conspiracy theories. Even the following is sufficient and true:<p>&quot;Imagine your child&#x27;s calendar, real-time location, grades, medical history, selfies, search and video viewing history, chats with friends hackable by any predator.

Ask them why they want to make children less safe. Stop saying &quot;you can&#x27;t outlaw math&quot; and &quot;terrorists will use encryption anyway&quot; - people either don&#x27;t understand, or don&#x27;t care.')
