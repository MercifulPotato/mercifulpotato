It&#x27;s perhaps telling that the share of White Evangelical Protestant (78%) and, White non-evangelical Protestants (52%), and White Catholics (53%) that supported Trump (in an October survey, [0]) are very similar to the share of each (72%, 56%, and 53%, respectively, in an August survey [1]) that believed “police killings of Black men are isolated incidents”.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;white-christians-continue-to-favor-trump-over-biden-but-support-has-slipped&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;white-chris...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prri.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;racial-justice-2020-george-floyd&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prri.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;racial-justice-2020-george-flo...</a>')
