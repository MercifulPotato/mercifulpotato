What even <i>is</i> a state, if not its people? What even <i>is</i> a local or state government, if not the people in the city or state? Can you even have a state or a state government if there are no people in the state?<p>What&#x27;s special about the state or state government specifically that it should get its representation separate from the people it governs? Are the state or state government&#x27;s aims and objectives different from the people of the state? If so, why, and what legitimacy does it have? If not, why have it represented?<p>Moreover, if this was really and actually true, why was the 17th Amendment passed? Why aren&#x27;t senators still chosen by state legislatures, or nominated by governors and confirmed by legislatures? Why does the state get represented <i>twice</i> (Senate and EC) but the people only get represented once? Isn&#x27;t that an imbalance?<p>&gt; Seems like a well-balanced system to me.<p>Because it favors your side. You&#x27;d be singing a different tune if it was the other way around.')
