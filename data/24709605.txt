I found this to be really surprising:<p>&quot;In a web browsing test, 5G only reduced page loading times (PLT) by about 5% compared to 4G. This is because most of the time goes into rendering, i.e., is compute-bound. Even if we just compare download times, 5G only shows a 20.68% improvement over 4G.&quot;')
