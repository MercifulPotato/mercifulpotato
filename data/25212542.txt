I&#x27;m pushing back on people who judge people for <i>not</i> walking out, like &#x27;they had it coming, why didn&#x27;t they just walk out?&#x27;<p>My GF is in this position right now, where walking out would mean switching industries in a pandemic, because other facilities aren&#x27;t any better off. She&#x27;s burnt out as hell, and puts up with an enormous amount of shit to make patients lives better, so I&#x27;m sensitive to anything that sounds like &quot;well they had it coming for not walking out.&quot;<p>&gt; It’s society’s moral failing to not properly allocate resources to them.<p>God damned right.')
