It takes two to tango.<p>It didn&#x27;t <i>pass</i> it, unlike the House and HEROES. The Senate could have acted on the passed House bill. The House had no bill from the Senate to take up, since the Senate bill died in (Republican-led) committee.<p>The House is the only one on the dance floor.<p>And Nancy Pelosi may have opposed the Republican position in negotiations, but Nancy Pelosi has no control on what the Senate passes.')
