I think the author missed the point on what Java is designed for. It&#x27;s supposed to be a friendlier, safer, more general purpose C++ for when you need good but not the absolute best performance. And in this I think its the best thing out there.<p>The cruft in Java, and hacks like Lombok to reduce it exist in every statically typed language I&#x27;ve used. And if you&#x27;ve worked on a big enough project you&#x27;ll start to see why dynamic languages like JS and Python are bad choices for enterprise apps.<p>It&#x27;s telling that every major dynamic language now has optional typings. Once you get to a certain size the ceremony around access modifier and statically typed objects makes sense.<p>And the author falls into the common idiom of &quot;the JVM is huge it uses too much ram&quot;. Then advocates for dynamically typed languages with even bigger run times that use multiple times more ram. Dynamic languages like Python and JS, as a generality, use 3-10X as much ram as VM languages like Java and C#. They&#x27;re also equally slower. And the runtime argument makes zero sense. V8 is massive. CPython is massive. Any popular language over time develops a huge runtime.<p>The author also complains about Spring. Spring isn&#x27;t Java. There&#x27;s a ton of Java web frameworks that aren&#x27;t Spring. No matter how much you like Java you can always find common ground hating on Spring.<p>Overall the article is a common set of complaints from developers that never used Java or only did a few Spring tutorials, got frustrated at the complexity of the language, and moved on to something else.<p>Java is one of the fastest popular languages and uses way less ram than many alternatives. And the JVM is a great runtime, not a bloated one. Look at how massive V8 is and the JS standard library is still complete trash compared to Java&#x27;s. The JVM is possibly the best runtime out there, and a big part of why Java is so popular.<p>The JVM has great and fast FFI, profiling, metrics, multiple world class GC&#x27;s, it&#x27;s rock stable, it optimizes code to within spitting distance of C, it handled projects with hundreds of megs of code with no problem.')
