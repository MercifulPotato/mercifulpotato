E.g., 2018 data shows that the &quot;Bottom 40% of US income distribution account for no more than 22% of total consumption. Top 20% account for almost 40%.&quot; [0]<p>I could see the capitalistic economy continuing to function despite a shrinking middle class if this consumption inequality grows.<p>Going with the jeans example, the 500 middle class families buying 5,000 pairs of jeans at $40 each ($200,000 total) may be replaced by 50 upper middle class families buying 1,000 pairs of jeans at $200 a pair.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not endorsing nor condoning such growing inequalities.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;adam_tooze&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308013103855087618" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;adam_tooze&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308013103855087618</a>')
