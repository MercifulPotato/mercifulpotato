Only when I went to college in a college town did people largely seem to want to live and let live.<p>Any society will try to grind your unique edges off to more smoothly fit into their culture. Perhaps you were more inclined to explore liberalism or intellectualism (more prone to be the culture around colleges) or had had enough of conservative religiousness. I had that same kind of inclination from ~18-30 years old.<p>I have seen plenty of discrimination and judgment coming from &#x27;the right&#x27; in my upbringing (usually directed toward others). But now that I&#x27;m much more center road and no longer extremist leftist, I am experiencing increasing hostility from my still left leaning friends&#x2F;groups.<p>I hope that the internet can somehow transform into a vehicle of understanding rather than a vehicle of argument. Maybe video comments would be more helpful in this regard.')
