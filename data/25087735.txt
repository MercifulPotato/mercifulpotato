You use an API design tool for that.<p>There are two ways to design APIs: code-first and design-first.<p>With code-first you write your code and then automatically generate the OpenAPI spec from that. I do it in Java using JAX RS and it works fine. It is strongly-typed and has all of the same advantages you get by designing your protobuffers first.<p>The world is moving toward design-first, though. You use a tool to write your API and then generate code from that. It&#x27;s a nice idea, but I&#x27;m not there yet because I don&#x27;t like the tooling.<p>I expect that in a few years the tooling will be good and we&#x27;ll be able to generate both APIs and database schemas in one place. Looking forward to it.')
