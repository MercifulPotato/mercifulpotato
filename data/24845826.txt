Didn&#x27;t know this wasn&#x27;t a Hibernate but instead a Spring Data feature :-)<p>@watt You&#x27;re right, I could&#x27;ve added an offset&#x2F;limit.  Wasn&#x27;t the main point though (readability was).<p>@vitro Depends on the approach, but it won&#x27;t be done &#x2F;for you&#x2F;, the mapping is a manual step (grab field X, etc.).<p>@piokoch, nice suggestion.  Of course in the real world we work in teams and some people will prefer this ;-)')
