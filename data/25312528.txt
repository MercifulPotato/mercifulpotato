I&#x27;ve worked on a web app that had extensive keyboard shortcuts because it was designed for power-users. There are some platform-specific inconveniences like listening for Cmd on Mac vs Ctrl on Windows&#x2F;Linux, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to writing an entirely separate application for each platform.<p>I think they don&#x27;t get made because of a) a cultural shift, and maybe also b) because the browser itself has some keyboard shortcuts that users may care about more (and don&#x27;t want overridden). For example Twitter actually has a bunch of shortcuts and I usually invoke them on accident. But if your users are power-users then they probably know what features are available, and of course if you&#x27;re using electron then the point is moot.')
