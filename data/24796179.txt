A kind of data structure and synchronization approach whereby beplicas can be updated independently and concurrently without typical coordination. Can be good for distributed collaborative real time editing, and&#x2F;or syncing live data among machines.<p>State-based replication: send all CRDT state to each replica; no need to send operations. Typically good when state is small relative to operations, and&#x2F;or when communications are unreliable. A.k.a. CvRDT, convergent replicated data types.<p>Operation-based replication: send all CRDT operations to each replica; no need to send state. Typically good when state is large relative to operations, and&#x2F;or when communications are reliable. A.k.a. CmRDT, commutative replicated data types.')
