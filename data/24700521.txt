And it seems the Unlicense predates npm by at least 11 days (1 January 2010 vs 12 January 2010, but it seems like npm didn&#x27;t start that word for this meaning until much later anyway).<p>I wonder how much the Unlicense&#x27;s name was inspired by 7-Up&#x27;s long-running &quot;The Uncola&quot; advertising campaign or other similar pop culture usages of &quot;un-&quot; as a joke-ish like that.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect use of the word, perhaps, but it&#x27;s cute without being offensive so I like it (this is ignoring any actual concerns about its content, which would be a distinct discussion).')
