I think there is a business opportunity: NAS vendors can turn their NAS service to a platform that allows it&#x27;s users to rent &quot;apps&quot; from the platform by paying a small amount of money every month or year. Most of the money goes to the app developers to support their development. When the developer updates the app, the NAS will then automatically download and apply the update.<p>There is no vendor lock-in as long as the user has the root control of the NAS device (Or at least get their data out of the machine). If the user decided to switch to another NAS vendor, they can simply migrate the data to the new machine.')
