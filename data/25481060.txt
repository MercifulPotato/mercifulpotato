Item(by='elyobo', descendants=None, kids=[25482116], score=None, time=1608411077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480624, text='&quot;Australia&quot; has a low population density because most of it has close to no population; it&#x27;s easy to be mislead by this if you&#x27;re not aware of how the population is distributed within a huge area, but the areas where most people live do not have low population density. It&#x27;s heavily urbanised (more so than the UK), with the vast majority of the population living in reasonably dense metropolitan areas.<p>It&#x27;s the willingness and ability to take effective measures, not the geography, that matters.')
