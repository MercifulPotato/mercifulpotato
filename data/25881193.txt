Even using it&#x27;s primary feature can be a pain because nobody documents their types as far as I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s surprisingly common for me to write code that compiles but crashes at runtime. Other, better JS-targeting languages manage to allow me to retain type-level features at runtime while also outputting leaner, faster, and safer code. The only value prop I really see is the momentum, but it feels like a huge push for the right reasons and in the worst possible direction.<p>It&#x27;s not that TypeScript hasn&#x27;t helped at all, it just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s this revolutionary thing that people treat it as. And I&#x27;m not even going to touch how visually noisy and distracting I find the C#-style type syntax to be.')
