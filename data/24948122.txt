Not chronic pain, but I&#x27;ve dealt with chronic debilitating lack of sleep (brought on by a strong urge to urinate all night). I got to some places of really deep despair with feeling complete exhaustion but no ability to sleep for any substantial period of time.<p>It took a while before I found some things that worked between sleep doctors, urologist, physical therapists, primary doctors etc. It was particularly frustrating because frequent urination was seen as a kind of low-level thing. Still it was causing great difficulty where I could barely keep functioning.<p>Ultimately, what ended up mattering was (1) enlisting family to help advocate for me to my doctors (2) getting 2nd and 3rd opinions (3) being persistent and continuing to try new things, not being stuck with one doctors opinion<p>I got the impression that unless you&#x2F;someone is advocating for you strongly and working actively to solve the problem, continuing to keep going back to the same doctor over and over and trying to give them the benefit of the doubt doesn&#x27;t work.')
