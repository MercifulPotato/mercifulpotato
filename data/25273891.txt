Among other reasons, a call for insurrection isn&#x27;t falsifiable.<p>As for his arguments themselves (see [0] for reference) they&#x27;re a good reminder that there&#x27;s no virtue in contrarianism in and of itself. I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious at this point that advocating for reduced mask usage at the margin will impact mask usage in &quot;public settings&quot; in &quot;areas with known or suspected widespread transmission&quot; - a situation in which the WHO report Atlas cites [1] unambiguously recommends that the general public wear masks. But of course, I&#x27;m sure Atlas&#x27;s decision to sum up that nuanced balance of evidence as &quot;Masks work? NO&quot; were rational and non-partisan.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;white-house-expert-scott-atlas-censored-by-twitter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;white-house-expert-scot...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.who.int&#x2F;iris&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;10665&#x2F;332293&#x2F;WHO-2019-nCov-IPC_Masks-2020.4-eng.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.who.int&#x2F;iris&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;10665&#x2F;332293&#x2F;WHO-...</a>')
