The assumption here (which IMHO is often practically sensible) was that there is a certain fixed set of all possible keys, e.g. from a bounded set of integers. In that case, hash tables indeed have constant-time operations no matter how many elements you have.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit similar to saying that e.g. Gauss elimination is O(n^3). This is only true for fixed-size numbers, e.g. floats or bounded integer types, not for arbitrary integers - in fact, the Gauss algorithm is incredibly bad for true, arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Nevertheless, the algorithm is incredibly useful, because the fixed-size assumption is often warranted - the most notable exceptions are probably from the realm of cryptography.')
