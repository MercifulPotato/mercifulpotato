In your report, all of the AWS results are limited to either 5Gbps or 10Gbps, but this is because of a very specific test condition.<p>From my understanding of the test scenario, you are using a single TCP connection to run the throughput test, and hitting AWS&#x27; documented[1] throughput limit for a single flow: 10 Gbps if the two instances are in the same placement group and 5 Gbps otherwise. The reason some of the network-optimized instances were &quot;slower&quot; than the non-optimized ones is most likely a random draw of whether both instances in the test were physically close to each other (basically whether or not they are accidentally in placement groups).<p>To show the true throughput you would need to use multiple connections&#x2F;flows, 5-10 would probably suffice. If the single flow test case was important then maybe you should have mentioned that AWS has a specific limitation around this. Personally I don&#x27;t think a single flow test case is particularly realistic for a throughput test. Either way, how it is presented is pretty misleading.<p>1. &quot;Single TCP flow is limited to 10 Gbps for instances in the same placement group and 5 Gbps between instances anywhere else.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ec2-networking-for-telecom&#x2F;overall-instance-bandwidth-limitations.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ec2-networkin...</a>')
