There&#x27;s alway someone ignoring the style guide, no one is really sure when a slide is finished, orphaned comments left ignored, etc.<p>I know this is blaming the tool for the way it is used, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that the tool is contributing to the problem. In my experience, 9 times out of 10 delegating sections of content with a final edit and sign off by a designated individual would work very well - no real time collaboration needed.')
