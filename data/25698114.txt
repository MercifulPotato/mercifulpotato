If you contract them to independently create something new, it might be your responsibility in part; I dunno.<p>Edit: reviewing the article linked by conistonwater&#x27;s sibling comment, it seems pretty clear from Blumenthal v. Drudge that a contractor&#x27;s work is not the site&#x27;s responsibility. I imagine there could be circumstances where the site specifically sanctionable content, and they might be held responsible.')
