It&#x27;s impossible to placate this small group, they decide what gets upvoted and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>It is the same problem on Reddit too. Anybody can create multiple accounts or buy aged ones, use different proxies to downvote. On the server side, what can you really do to fight this?<p>Fingerprinting, IP address intelligence, account age, points, user activity that will be compared to the normal distribution of most legitimate user activity (I doubt this is used efficiently).<p>edit: Case example, within minutes of posting my parent comment, its downvoted to oblivion and they are probably going through all of my comment history to do the same. It&#x27;s really churlish and parochial.')
