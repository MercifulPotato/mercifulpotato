This means that all the people who believe the stock&#x2F;bond is no good have no way to lend their belief to the price of the stock&#x2F;bond. This represents an optimistic asymmetry in the stock&#x2F;bond price. By having the ability to short, some of the asymmetry is removed thus making the price better able to reflect the future expected value of stock&#x2F;bond. That’s what makes it “more efficient”.')
