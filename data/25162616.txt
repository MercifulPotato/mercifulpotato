I apologize, I could have looked up the PCIE bandwidth and answered part of my question, it didn&#x27;t occur to me.<p>Do you know an application (other than 2-D&#x2F;3D transforms) where someone would move data from CPU-&gt;VRAM then perform a whole bunch of 1-D FFTs on that memory? If any given complex value is only part of only 1-2 FFTs, then PCI-E bandwidth is the limiting factor.<p>As just a curiosity, why don&#x27;t FFT benchmarks (CPU&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;otherwise) ever simply plot FFTs per second on the y-axis? That&#x27;s the number we all care about right? It&#x27;s always bandwidth (with some nuance as you described) or worse, MFLOPs with some arbitrary scaling factor. Fine for relative performance, but if your not comparing it to my platform, its not that useful unless I measure my platform and convert to the same representation.')
