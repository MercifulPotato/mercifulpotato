Claimed that if you put $6000 into the market instead (instead of a ring) and got 11% per year you&#x27;d have over $1M at your 50th anniversary. Absolutely sure that he picked the unrealistic 11% only because it got the number over a psychologically meaningful threshold (which isn&#x27;t even that meaningful because he ignored inflation). A more realistic outcome would have been around $69K BTW. This kind of dishonesty is everywhere, which is why we have to stay on our toes.<p>But back to the case at hand. Yes, the numbers are a bit off, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the basic idea. That&#x27;s another too-common fallacy. $160K is nothing to sneeze at, and your $43K is just as much a fiction as Ackman&#x27;s $1M. S&amp;P grew 168% over 20 years despite volatility. It&#x27;s already factored in. It looks like you&#x27;re doing the same thing with double-adjusting for inflation too. The fact is that the bond would yield enough to make a significant difference for the people it&#x27;s meant to help. Your numerology doesn&#x27;t change that.')
