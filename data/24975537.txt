It&#x27;s usually correct but when it&#x27;s wrong it&#x27;s really wrong.<p>In a thread about getting off Google, I&#x27;m also getting off Apple. I just finished killing iCloud and now have all my backups etc in OneDrive.<p>At least with OneDrive, I have cross platform support and it&#x27;s easy to sync and upload&#x2F;download and I know where my data is. Apple, who knows. It took 2 days and 95% of that time was getting my data out of iCloud.<p>Ultimately I want my device to basically be a dumb view into whatever accounts I have set up. Sick of the lock in and &quot;ecosystem&quot;.')
