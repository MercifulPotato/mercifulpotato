Their integration, advertising, and procurement advantages makes it MUCH easier to win contracts before the OSS devs may even know it is being used and without \na bid process. For a fraction of the effort and contribution, they are switching it to a model of monopoly channel owners vs content producers and and driving the sw margins to 0 on the content side. That&#x27;s why anti-big-cloud LGPL-when-SaaS style licenses are emerging. There are always exceptions, but it&#x27;s not the axis to compete on unless you do such a license..<p>- I agree about the community aspect, indirectly. If the software, in addition to being OSS, relies somehow on community and its steward -- not just source code -- and participation in it is somehow what&#x27;s paying for the OSS dev, yes. For example, maybe the community is also a social network (Slack&#x2F;Teams across orgs), or generating threat intel -- the software (post-scale) matters less post-scale, so forking is ok.')
