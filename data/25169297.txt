I mean, I still avoid it if I can, but that&#x27;s not React&#x27;s fault.<p>The fact that most front-end frameworks implement some kind of React-ish approach should at the very least make you wonder if dismissing it as &#x27;cool-kiddery&#x27; is perhaps a bit too broad a swipe.<p>With Tailwind, at first I had similar concerns. I used it a bit and it seemed okay, but went back to the good old fashioned way of doing things. Then, in a later project, I decided to give it a proper shot and it measurably increases my productivity, reduces complexity, and reading articles about why it&#x27;s not &#x27;separation of concerns&#x27; (in many cases) convinced me I had no real basis for being against it other than being a curmudgeonly old-skool guy.<p>It&#x27;s totally fair to stick with what works for you, but perhaps dismissing both React and Tailwind as &#x27;cool-kiddery&#x27; is more a &#x27;stuck in your ways and insecure enough to need to justify it&#x27; kind of thing than it is a reasonable perspective. Sometimes new things &#x2F;are&#x2F; better!')
