TLDR: Review programs aren&#x27;t downright evil, but this one is egregious.<p>Most people here are enraged by fake reviews, I think that&#x27;s more than fair, but I also encourage everyone to think broader about the issues here.<p>In general, review programs are necessary to prime the pump and Amazon has even rolled out their own version.  Reviews are a critical piece of a winning listing on Amazon and without a path to get your product in front of consumers, you have no path to get reviews and only the incumbent products win.  That&#x27;s pretty bad for everyone, especially the consumer, it&#x27;s not how a free market should operate.<p>What&#x27;s egregious here (outside of violating Amazon terms) is getting a refund <i>only for a 5 star review</i>.  I strongly believe you should be able to give out a free product for a review, but that review should be honest.  I understand that the incentives might make someone want to leave a positive review, but with proper guidance and even selection of quality reviewers you can mitigate that.<p>Here&#x27;s the big truth: at some point an Amazon listing has to live on it&#x27;s own.  At some point, your product will start to sell organically and there will be so many organic reviews, it will sink a listing really fast.<p>The market opportunity to incentivize reviews (or even pay for fake reviews) with a bad product is actually pretty poor, good luck making enough profit to support all those free products you just shipped.')
