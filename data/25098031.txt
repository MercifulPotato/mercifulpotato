But over the past several months, it feels like <i>my entire personality and being</i> is a rug that has been pulled out from underneath me. I&#x27;m no longer the driven and interested person that I used to be. I struggle to sit down and work - my brain feels scattered and no matter how much I sleep and rest, I feel so tired that my body literally aches. The only thing I really feel is a subtle sadness, like a background hum that feels like it&#x27;s dragging me down. It also feels like it&#x27;s never going to go away.<p>So is that depression? I have no idea, but I hate the feeling and I pray that once this pandemic is over, the symptoms will fade.')
