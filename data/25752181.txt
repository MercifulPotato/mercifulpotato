A good representative example is the recent Twisted Tea smackdown video that made the rounds.  If a police officer had swooped in and arrested the instigator before he got hit the arrest likely would have been kosher under the doctrine because the n-word is generally so vulgar you don&#x27;t expect to be able to use it in that manner and not start a fight.  Basically it&#x27;s used to justify arresting someone for speech so inflammatory that even though you are not picking a fight someone is inevitably gonna pick a fight with you whether you want one or not.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any case where it was used to prosecute someone for calling for &quot;adjacent to violence&quot; type behavior.   I am unaware of any cases (that have not been overturned) where fighting words doctrine was used as a justification for suppressing political speech.  If you know of any examples I&#x27;d be interested to read them.')
