In the end, it was becoming a huge wall of text, which is not something that I think this site is suitable for. So, I wrote a blog post about it instead:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andregarzia.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;lua-a-misunderstood-language.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andregarzia.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;lua-a-misunderstood-language...</a><p>I&#x27;m speaking from the point-of-view of someone who used Lua for games, hardware, and web, in there. I am not an expert in the language, but I feel that many people here are approaching the language with the wrong perspective, and thus are unable to see what makes it great.<p>All I write there is my own personal opinion of course, I&#x27;m totally OK if you still hate Lua after reading it, but I&#x27;d encourage those here who have criticism about it to double check my article and reach out if they want to talk more about it.')
