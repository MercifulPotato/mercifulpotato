So that would be the ideal. We could have states just mandate very strict shelter in place. Would you like that?<p>Probably not, in which case we have to allow people to get outside their homes. When we do that we come up with rules to try to minimize infection rates, distance and mask wearing is supposed to help with that. Is your argument that mask wearing has 0 impact on COVID19 spreading rate?<p>This article seems to go over a number of studies showing correlation between mask wearing and lower death rates:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02801-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02801-8</a><p>But if mask wearing isn&#x27;t helping at all with infectious diseases like COVID19, why are health experts always wearing them? It&#x27;s a lot more comfortable to not be wearing any mask so they could do that instead. They&#x27;d have the data and the skills to determine if it helps or not, much better than we would.')
