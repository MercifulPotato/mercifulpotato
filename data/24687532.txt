Using your back of the envelope calculations, 200k or even quite a bit less is a lot of money to many, if not most, people. The median USA income is apparently 50k, so they&#x27;d be earning more than most other people. Compared to a hard working minimum wage job, which can have longer, inflexible hours, this is definitely worth the squeeze for many people.')
