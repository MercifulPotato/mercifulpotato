Maybe the lack of lidars makes the task 100 times harder, i.e. de facto impossible. We don&#x27;t know. This is a big risk for Tesla but they didn&#x27;t have a choice. If lidars were as cheap as cameras, of course they would use them.<p>On the other hand, Waymo et. al. are not risking anything by using lidars. If they turn out to be redundant, it should be easy to remove them cheaply.')
