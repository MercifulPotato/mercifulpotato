Which is understandable, but ultimately a red herring that detracts from a productive political movement forming around the real issue of the rent treadmill. eg Restaurateurs don&#x27;t actually want to be open for indoor dining right now, they&#x27;re just forced to by an economy which has been warped to prioritize &quot;growth&quot; metrics above human concerns. But the political machine has gone to work telling them the pandemic is a hoax, and with that assumption it must be the response that is to blame. Somehow herds of people always end up running in the wrong direction.<p>As for general questioning, yes in the abstract everything should be questioned. But when most of the people raising questions seem to be acting in bad faith, then eventually the questions they&#x27;re asking are going to be reflexively rejected. That creates an irrational blind spot for sure, but that&#x27;s still a <i>smaller</i> rationality disruption than letting the bad faith questioners continue to destroy the discourse. Given the way herds work, I definitely agree that there <i>could</i> be something wrong with the specifics of the mask consensus. But my general prioritization heuristic asks <i>why</i> that would be someone&#x27;s focus when there are significantly more pressing issues. And so any argument has a very high bar to clear, probably to the level of conclusive studies showing mask wearing is actively harmful, and not just simple conjecture on the mechanics from first principles.<p>&gt; <i>As for police state tactics, I don’t think they’d be considered if people were just smart and took precautions. They’re on the table because too many people insist on refusing to do simple things.</i><p>This is the real pisser. Being a libertarian myself, it galls me how much damage has been done to freedom, supposedly in the name of freedom. Allowing a pandemic to spread unchecked, meaning I need to treat everyone I come into contact with as potentially infected (including wearing a mask in my own house as I&#x27;ve got healthcare visiting), has been a <i>grave</i> damage to my freedom. I can only conclude the covidiots see &quot;freedom&quot; as the ability to behave like spoiled children, rather than the opportunity to make responsible choices.')
