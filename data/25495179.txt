Apple chooses not to do this since it doesn&#x27;t fit their marketing strategy.<p>As for those missing chargers, they probably have multiple reasons for not including them.  The environmental impact may even play a small role.  Ultimately though, the main reasons are going to be business driven (e.g. reduced manufacturing costs and perhaps increased sales of chargers).  If these people were truly interested in protecting the environment, they wouldn&#x27;t be in the business of selling disposable consumer goods.')
