For me, I&#x27;ll happily earn less if it means that my conscience[2] is clear.<p>[1] I mean, I&#x27;m using &quot;evil&quot; loosely here. Its just an illustration, I&#x27;m not going to argue about how evil or not evil FAANG are.<p>[2] Of course, everyone has a different definition of what they consider questionable and will therefore draw the line in different places. Its a personal decision, but you should hopefully understand why someone who doesn&#x27;t agree with your definition might judge you for it, rightly or wrongly.')
