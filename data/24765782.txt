So if one looks at this text they need to know the prevailing conditions of that time. Probably read the Arthshstra and will get an idea what I am talking about [1].<p>“<i>In Kautilya’s India, religion was ubiquitous and invasive. An elaborate form of Hinduism, unlike the one practiced currently, formed the basis of people’s identity in the socioeconomic sphere, and also in matters of life and death. The class system (varnas) and the caste system (jatis) got entrenched in people’s private and public lives around Kautilya’s time. To this end, Hindu principles were supposed to be a broad framework of guidelines and morals that were meant to provide directions to individual lives, particularly for the attainment of moksha, or self-liberation, through knowledge (gyana-yoga), devotion (bhakti-yoga), and duty (karma-yoga&#x2F;dharma). However, they became overly prescriptive in nature, controlling every detail of an individual’s life, such as their education, social standing, professional&#x2F;occupational qualifications, and economic status.<p>The varna system divided Hindu society into four classes: Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (mercantile&#x2F;trade class) and Shudras (slaves, lowest order workers). An individual’s placement in the varna system defined their education, social and economic status, and also their choice of work. The system was codified in such a manner so as to not facilitate any form of mobility, either upward or downward. In short, this hierarchical system, with the priests occupying the highest rung on the social ladder and the slaves occupying the lowest rung, was also hereditary. The scylla and charybdis of hierarchy and hereditary stagnated the class system, paving the way for rulers to partake of the system’s in-built oppression in order to facilitate submission and smooth rule. Furthermore, the jatis, or subcastes, that were based on a greater specialization of labor, solidified the varna-imposed hierarchy system to an even greater extent.</i>”<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;Arthasastra_English_Translation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;Arthasastra_English_Translation</a>')
