Companies can and do hide whatever they want in lengthy legalese which can have no limit in size. There should be the equivalent of a plain English abstract which is customised for the use case and target audience.<p>What we have now is a small percentage people who actually read those terms and conditions and of those people a handful of them write about it and that’s how we learn about dodgy terms and conditions. It’s very haphazard.')
