There&#x27;s a reason why the CEO has a fancy office with a beautiful view that you have to go past 3 tiers of security&#x2F;admins to get to.  It sends a signal to everyone that they should respect this person.  It&#x27;s the same reason you have a shitty low walled cube that you share with 3 other people.  It&#x27;s harder to have that same visual persuasion if the CEO is wearing jeans and a tshirt in his living room on a Zoom meeting.')
