If you read my comment as somehow saying this transition is not going smoothly, I&#x27;d like to understand why you&#x27;d think that and I&#x27;ll update my comment.<p>What I&#x27;m commenting on is that anything that is not already completely bought into Apple&#x27;s stack is not there yet, and that reveals where Apple&#x27;s priorities are. Anything that&#x27;s cross platform or depends on cross platform components needs to play catch up now. It&#x27;s <i>fine</i> if they have priorities though?')
