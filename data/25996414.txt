The format is meant to be human-understandable, not machine-readable.<p>I disagree that it&#x27;s not meant to be machine-readable. Accessibility clients rely on heading levels to infer sections and subsections. HTML has `&lt;section&gt;`, but a Gemini client only has heading levels to go by.<p>But anyway, that&#x27;s why I said it&#x27;d be &quot;awkward&quot;, not &quot;impossible&quot;, to reuse the title heading level for section headings. The rich-text Gemini client as well as the human user reading the raw file have to special-case that the first `#` is the page title and not equivalent to other `#` in the file.<p>And like I said, even once you get over that awkwardness, three levels is still very limiting. I&#x27;m looking at a markdown documentation file right now that has five levels of headings. That&#x27;s with one unique level for the page title, so even if it were to reuse the title heading level for the section headings it would still require four levels of headings.<p>&gt;And behold, the Gemini FAQ [0] itself has [...]<p>Ha, I didn&#x27;t know about that one. I had noticed in the past that the homepage [1] uses a unique level for the title, but the specs page [2] does not because it can&#x27;t afford to.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.mozz.us&#x2F;gemini&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;?raw=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.mozz.us&#x2F;gemini&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;?raw=...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.mozz.us&#x2F;gemini&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;specification.gmi?raw=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.mozz.us&#x2F;gemini&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;...</a>')
