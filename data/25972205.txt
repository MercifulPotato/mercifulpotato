It&#x27;s a restriction on spreading misinformation to pump and dump a stock. You could say that the perpetrators were meming, or they didn&#x27;t know the illegality, or they got caught up in the moment but that defense<p>1) gives too much benefit of doubt to these people. WSB types know very well that what they&#x27;re doing is unethical and illegal. It&#x27;s exactly what they accuse hedgefund boogeymen of doing to stir up their victims.<p>2) This situation isn&#x27;t as novel as it seems. There are already deliberations and legal mechanisms  in place to determine the culpability of someone who only took a small part in a crime, is a first-time offender or whatever other excuse there is.<p>3) To carry this point home, I think HackerNews already censors (thankfully) links that try to pump random penny stocks. This type of internet scheme is not new, and most of us have already decided it is something we won&#x27;t tolerate. This behavior is outrageous and it&#x27;s not made any better because it&#x27;s happening in broad daylight or on a large scale. We shouldn&#x27;t be in such awe of the &#x27;revolution&#x27; that we are blinded to its impact.')
