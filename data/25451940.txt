Or perhaps there&#x27;s enough unknown, unknowns that throwing something at the wall is a legit way to get data if it&#x27;s not a one-way decision.<p>However the attitude on display above is a problem because you&#x27;ve just alienated those people who may have come from a different background or do know the theory but are approaching a problem in a different way.')
