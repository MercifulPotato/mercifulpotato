Lots of those that were young and suffered through are adults now, the ones that were adults are getting older and everyone is still pissed off about what happened.<p>I definitely feel I&#x27;m getting squeezed, even though I&#x27;ve increased my salary quite a lot since 2005, including moving continents to pretty good jobs in Europe. I can feel the squeeze in society, with friends that even in a rich nation with a good salary still don&#x27;t look very brightly into the future. Climate disasters incoming, also propelled up by the elites (or at least delaying action against, inaction is an attack in this case).<p>People were tired, now a lot are tired, bored, unemployed and angry.')
