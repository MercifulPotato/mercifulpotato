If you&#x27;re a millionaire, it&#x27;s just luck and people around you; if you&#x27;re homeless, it&#x27;s the opposite. Nothing that you personally do really matters, and people deep down are all the same.<p>This may be a reaction to the opposite viewpoint that was popular in the old, WASP US, but I do think that it&#x27;s been taken a bit too far now. If you think that &quot;we treat homeless people like crap&quot;, ask yourself: would you wanted your own success or failure to be wholly attributed to circumstances out of your control? Would it feel good to be so stripped of agency?<p>For me personally, to respect a person also means to treat him more like a responsible adult and less than a mindless child.')
