That&#x27;s the same shenanigans that got them into trouble with the 68000. Everyone stuffed data into the top 8 bits of pointers because even though the 68000 had 32-bit addressing registers, it only had a 24-bit address bus and the top 8 bits were dontcare&#x27;s. Then, the 6802x came out with more address lines and...<p>...and that&#x27;s basically why x86_64 was specified to require a particular bit pattern in high-order bits - it was to stop applications and OS programmers from writing a bunch of software with tagged pointers which would tie Intel&#x27;s and AMD&#x27;s hands when adding address lines. I guess Apple is ok with tying their own hands.')
