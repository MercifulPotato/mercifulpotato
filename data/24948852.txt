Not sure what the McDonalds part has to do with it - a huge number of kids start there.  I did - and in the next 40 years I&#x27;ve been Chief Architect of a startup, found my own startup (with a install base over 12 million), and am currently a Principal Architect at Microsoft (and was a lead in Microsoft Research a few years ago)<p>All good - and  I look back at my McDonald days (somewhat) fondly, and it was good experience at doing fairly unpleasant work - but my nights hack and phone freaking and coding had 100x more to do with my success then that first job :)')
