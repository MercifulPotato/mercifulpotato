Sometimes that means bringing in new investments and cleaning out old.<p>That analogy however does not work well with the idea of paying down debt etc. Because paying down debt is drawn out process with a clear result and changing your investments is probably not as drawn out and the result is still somewhat up in the air.<p>In conclusion, analogies are a land of contrasts of varying applicability.')
