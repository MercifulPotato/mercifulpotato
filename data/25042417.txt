It’s a short blog post about struggles with a TV remote, and then an image of an MSPaint remote which LITERALLY has hieroglyphics on it<p>I guess I should make a comment about UX design though. In the past year I watched a really informative video where design and usability expert Dan Formosa reviews the usability of various kitchen gadgets (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w08XDXjJhsQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w08XDXjJhsQ</a>). The part of his review process which I found enlightening was that he had this thing called the “Left-hand oil test,” where he lubed up his non-dominant hand and attempted to use the appliance he was reviewing to emulate a person with a disability.<p>In terms of software and UX, I think the best analogue for this sort of test is to attempt to use your app while you’re stoned out of your mind. If you can’t figure out how to do things in this condition, then your app is likely introducing cognitive overhead which can be reduced.<p>It really is too bad that too often “design roles” are given to people who fit a certain stereotype or mainly have the ability to make things prettier looking. I firmly believe true UX design requires a holistic approach which at the very least requires you to be able to code demos of the behavior you want from applications.')
