Familiarising yourself with software patterns definitely puts you ahead, but being able to use debuggers to understand code that has no pattern, that&#x27;s when you become the kind of bug-squasher&#x2F;problem-solver that projects like that require. If you have good debugging skills, you can work on any project, because you can find out all the information you need by stepping through the code.')
