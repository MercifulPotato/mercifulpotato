Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24898416], score=None, time=1603691062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893033, text='&gt; Can I open a shop only for &lt;insert skin color&gt; people only and claim that if you don&#x27;t like it, go somewhere else? How about other categories, protected or otherwise?<p>You&#x27;re missing the fine distinction between protected and non-protected categories. Discrimination based on what you <i>are</i> is banned - those constitute the protected categories. Sex, gender, national origin, race, family status, veteran status, religion, and sexual orientation all fall under things you <i>are</i>.<p>Business and private organizations however, are allowed to discriminate against their customers based on their actions. It gets fuzzier if those actions intersect with a protected category (e.g. a supermarket probably (IANAL) can&#x27;t throw out a gay couple for family-friendly PDA if a hetero couple would be allowed to stay). But by and large, if you do or say something on my premises that I dislike, I can kick you out.<p>Imagine if weren&#x27;t so. Anyone could disrupt religious services by shouting obscenities. You couldn&#x27;t have a peaceful shopping trip or grocery run. It would be total chaos.')
