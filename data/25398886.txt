The probability of making syntax errors is a lot lower than with languages like Java and you can see them without going through a build. But language servers are the only way to make vim an acceptable choice for a lot of other languages. Otherwise your productivity is just much lower than with an ide. Personally i use vim for terminal work, searching, merging, editing sql and other files, sometimes building and Eclipse for coding on my current project.')
