The amount of things we &#x27;know&#x27; now is staggering, and has built up some boundaries on what&#x27;s possible or not. Those boundaries might actually be wrong, but the more you learn the more boxed in your mind can get.<p>Sometimes it takes an outsider that&#x27;s ignorant of those boundaries to break through them, try the thing that other people just think would be impossible and it works. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if these people didn&#x27;t even consider it a possibility that you could bake bread from ancient dormant yeast until this amateur Blackley claimed he did it the first time (and was mistaken).<p>I had no idea yeast could survive in a dormant state for 4,500 years in ceramic pots. I have yeast that doesn&#x27;t always reactivate that&#x27;s only a few years old, let alone 4,500 years. It would never even occur to me to even try, as I had a now clearly false belief that yeast doesn&#x27;t last that long in my head.<p>I&#x27;ve probably spent most of my life thinking about games in one way or another, and coming up with new game ideas, but even still I never really come up with something truly genre-breaking. And yet board games have done that a few times in recent years, with someone coming up with deckbuilders, another person coming up with the idea of legacy board games, another a hidden traitor mechanic, etc, and creating a whole new genre out of it.<p>But even then, it&#x27;s not super common. Most board games coming out now are a mix of established things, with a bit of a twist or an unconventional theme.')
