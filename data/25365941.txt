There have been election observers pushed out of counting centers. In Georgia, people were told a pipe burst, sent observers home, and then people kept counting for hours (on video).<p>These are NOT baseless claims! They should be investigated.<p>Let me ask you, if they were baseless, would YouTube even need to ban videos? They are banning them because they&#x27;re afraid. I&#x27;ve watched hours of the hearings and looked at a lot of the information. There are serious issues with this election and they need to be investigated fully.')
