It should be regardless of what “class” you’re in, you should be able to live a happy and fulfilling life without a lot of worry. Instead, we paint it like, you have to get out of X class in order to even have the most “simple” of worries covered. (Food, housing, healthcare, etc)<p>And I hate to think of any “class” being superior. “Wish I was of the superior race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;orientation&#x2F;class&#x2F;etc”.  To me, people see class as something you can change (true to some extent) but why even make one class seem worse than the other? It’s only because it’s sometimes possible for people to change socioeconomic classes that we critique them for being in one and accept that being in a poorer class  can have hardships that we don’t like but find acceptable because “you can change it”. But... not everyone can be rich. And a lot of our system is setup to profit off of the hard work of the working poor... so without fundamental change to the entire system, there will always have to be poor people and there is no way for everyone to be lifted out and live a less worrisome life where we aren’t concerned with class.<p>We live in some weird ass feudalistic society now and think the peasants deserve what they get. I don’t agree.')
