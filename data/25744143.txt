He basically was super-populist (fund Social Security&#x2F;Medicare, get rid of immigration), and indeed seemed like he had no firm commitment to the Republican party. I actually hoped that he&#x27;d end up governing from the center (especially after the Dems took the house).<p>But then he got elected, and essentially governed as a standard trickle-down Republican, with a side order of conspiracy theories and showmanship.<p>Like, it&#x27;s important to remember that Bernie Sanders was anti-immigration without stronger labour standards, and that many Trump&#x2F;Sanders voters (in 2016) liked the other candidate more than those in their respective primaries.<p>The US just needs one set of people who&#x27;ll actually do good things for the lower half of the populace, but it doesn&#x27;t look like that&#x27;s going to happen.')
