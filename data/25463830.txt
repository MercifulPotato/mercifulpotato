There&#x27;s one consumer at the end, there are thousands of laborers contributing between extraction of raw materials and delivery of finished product. It seems that in order for appreciably more to be paid for labor, the cost of goods would skyrocket and people would have to learn to have less stuff.<p>&gt; If the decreased efficiency anx higher costs were born by the company (i. e mgmt and shareholders) instead of consumers, costs wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to go up either.<p>Doubtful. There&#x27;s not much juice to squeeze from mgmt and labor. Have you looked at returns relative to investment recently?')
