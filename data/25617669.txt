The second one I saw in a public presentation from a security company mentioning 4 CVEs on OpenWrt and I was only aware of 3.<p>When we or a real security researcher request a CVE for a real problem as an organization it often takes weeks till we get it, we released some security updates without a CVE, because we didn&#x27;t want to wait so long. It would also be nice to update them later to contain a link to our detailed security report.')
