Or idk, write another book about it?  Obviously startups didnt exactly work out for you?<p>You know you&#x27;ve done something right when you trigger a <i>journalist</i> who can&#x27;t defend or argue their work with  a real argument ;) ~ To be frank, you&#x27;re almost as endearing as the Lambda School guy who replies to every single comment in HN threads critical of lambda school.')
