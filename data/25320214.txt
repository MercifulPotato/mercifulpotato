Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607219167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319604, text='Most of the money is going to places that aren&#x27;t immediately visible: it&#x27;s paying to keep people with marginal financial situations in their homes (and paying to keep newly re-housed people housed).  Without that help, there would be many more people living on the streets than there are now.  The stuff that you <i>do</i> notice, like hiring people to do street outreach and try to help homeless people directly, is a small part of the homelessness budget.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s going super great.  There are still a lot of people on the streets, obviously, and depending on where you look, either it&#x27;s getting worse, or at best it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re treading water.<p>But it turns out combating homeless is just expensive, even though arguably it can be cheaper than just doing nothing (taxpayers end up paying for those 911 calls and unpaid emergency room visits after all), but there are a lot of people who have an aversion to &quot;just giving away money to people who don&#x27;t deserve it&quot;.  They&#x27;d rather pay to clean up after a homeless person, year after year, than pay to make that person not homeless, even if the latter would cost less.  So funding is hard to fight for, and funding levels are never enough to fix things.<p>San Francisco&#x27;s allocation for this is a single-digit percentage of the city budget (your assertion that their budget is &quot;huge&quot; is incorrect; here it&#x27;s a few hundred million on a $5B budget), and yet it is one of the biggest, most obviously visible problems the city is facing.  Sure, simply throwing more money at a problem doesn&#x27;t make it go away, but insufficient funding -- as is currently the case -- is going to ensure the problem remains.')
