There are fewer &quot;entire community mobilized against existential threat&quot; type wars these days, but there seems to be a constant brew of conflict world wide (proxy wars, drone strikes, etc). Frankly, I find Stoicism one of the best ways to cope with the two quotes I keep hearing in my mind: &quot;high school never ends&quot; and &quot;war never changes&quot;.<p>Finally - We&#x27;re just on the very tip of the cusp of the effects of climate change. Entire regions supported by subsistence farming for millennia will within a lifetime become a literal hell. As we go from a world of seemingly endless abundance to constrained resources (arable land, potable water, etc.) I think &quot;war like city states&quot; more closely represents our future than anyone really wants to accept.')
