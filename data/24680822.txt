Item(by='aikah', descendants=None, kids=[24680879, 24680903], score=None, time=1601833685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680735, text='&gt;  It&#x27;s facile and wrong to think of Oxycontin as an unmitigated evil in society. What about all the people who were diagnosed with terminal cancer and were suffering from unimaginable pain? It doesn&#x27;t matter if you will get a crippling addiction if you&#x27;re going to be dead in 8 months anyway. From what I&#x27;ve read, Oxycontin was the first available drug that could be easily administered at home once or twice a day and gave meaningful pain relief even for the worst pain. The drug may well have made bearable the last months of millions of people.<p>Problem is that it was pushed on people who didn&#x27;t suffer from terminal disease but milder chronic pain, only to make more money, not for the sake of their health. Yes it was effective but it turned people in hardcore addicts who then turned to nastier drugs when they couldn&#x27;t get their fix. It killed a lot of people and destroyed a lot of families.')
