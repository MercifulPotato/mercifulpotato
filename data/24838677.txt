My only quibble is axios did not link directly to the white paper explaining the methodology, but that link is prominent on the linked page. So, 2 clicks away from the explanation of the numbers. Much better than the vast majority of articles, whether MSM or blogger, that get thrown around as <i>evidence</i> for this or that.<p>As has been pointed out, the article title is rather <i>click-baity</i>. No information source is perfect...and it is all narrative.')
