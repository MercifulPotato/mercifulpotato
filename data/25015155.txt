The idea behind MIT&#x2F;ISC and the like is to let other people use your software, which they aren&#x27;t automatically allowed to do because copyright is broken by default.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of software that I would like to use in my day job that I can&#x27;t touch because it&#x27;s GPL. This is by design.<p>&gt; These companies try hard to push the narrative that MIT is &quot;practical&quot; and GPL is &quot;political&quot; - guess why.<p>I have no sympathy for FAANG, but that happens to be correct. GPL is explicitly political in its intent.')
