Anyone who are remotely familiar with how OS works would definitely get as much RAM as possible.  Virtually it&#x27;s like the cash of the virtual world (pardon the pun), the more you have the better you are.<p>Having said that, according to the article &quot;Intelâ€™s Disruption is Now Complete&quot; discussed in HN before, Intel&#x27;s lowest end of Celeron CPU line was introduced just to delay the inevitable [1][2]. But what the article did not mention is that Intel purposely crippled its low end CPU with the minimum amount of RAM. Until very recently the most RAM you can get with Celeron based processors is only a few GBs. However, perhaps due to the competition of AMD and other ARM based manufacturers, Intel has done the unthinkable and with the latest Gold processor series (11th Gen) you can have up to 128GB of RAM [3][4]. FYI, the Gold processor series is conveniently placed in between the Core and Celeron back in 2016 and essentially it&#x27;s a beefed up Celeron. Not only that, it can now supports Optane, a new Intel&#x27;s proprietary non-volatile or persistent memory technology that can provide its lower end CPUs with potentially more than TB of working memory [5]. Imagine using a tablet&#x2F;PC&#x2F;home server in the year 2021 having an equivalent of humongous terabytes of RAM!<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamesallworth.medium.com&#x2F;intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamesallworth.medium.com&#x2F;intels-disruption-is-now-co...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25092721" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25092721</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsroom.intel.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;iot-processors-industrial-edge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsroom.intel.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;iot-processors-industrial-ed...</a><p>[4]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ark.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;ark&#x2F;products&#x2F;199288&#x2F;intel-pentium-gold-g6400-processor-4m-cache-4-00-ghz.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ark.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;ark&#x2F;products&#x2F;199288&#x2F;...</a><p>[5]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;architecture-and-technology&#x2F;intel-optane-technology.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;architecture-and-tec...</a>')
