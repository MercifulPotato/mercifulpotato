I&#x27;m not a big user of health functions, but sleep tracking, being able to see messages quickly without having to reach for my phone, and having an alarm on my wrist that is guaranteed to wake me up are the 3 biggest benefits. I also prefer a round watch face, it give a more classic feel. I feel a rectangular watch face shouts &quot;I&#x27;m a smartwatch user!&quot; a bit too much.')
