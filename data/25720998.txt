What was nice for me was this kind of thrill to push something for everyone to share.<p>I put more attention into the details, description, etc. A very fulfilling learning experience.<p>This is going to help me release the 10 or so other projects I was keeping private but was ashamed to publish. I just need to find some time to polish them.')
