The performance is great, it had a great price and doesn’t look half bad. The UI is very much “pro” in the sense that you get all the options you might ever want to play with which for 90% of the time is just too much.<p>The wiki is good and the community is really friendly. If you have networking experience or want to something to tinker with it’s a nice deal. If you want something you can set and forget I’d look elsewhere though as the UI is not friendly at all.')
