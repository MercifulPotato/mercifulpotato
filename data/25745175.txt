The new leadership is moving development to cheaper regions and, if the interviews and comments about &quot;entitlement&quot; etc are to be believed, you can bet they are not fussed about hiring the best talent in the new regions - they are going to be hunting out the &quot;good enough&quot; agencies and&#x2F;or employees, which is most definitely going to reduce quality.<p>I&#x27;d like to also add that from my own perspective Ubiquiti gear and software is&#x2F;was _exceptionally_ good. So converting to &quot;just another network gear company&quot; level of quality is going to have a much greater impact on my perception of the company compared to if this news of off-shoring came from say cisco.')
