Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606308599, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25205503, text='&gt; <i>over the course of his medical education...he also got an MBA and has started on a PhD, because being a GP would be immensely dissatisfying to his intellect</i><p>To put it charitably, it seems unlikely that <i>while in medical school</i> someone can also complete a full-time two-year business program <i>and</i> start a doctorate. But taking the comment at face value...<p>There are plenty of specialties much more challenging than family med (which is what 99.999% of GPs do for residency). It&#x27;s one of the least competitive and least well-paid specialties. This is why most of the med students who don&#x27;t match end up scrambling into family med, because those are the (toxic) programs that have unmatched slots. If you don&#x27;t own the practice you&#x27;ll be lucky to break $200k cash comp without a post-residency fellowship. Infectious disease, pathology, and radiology are much more challenging intellectually and <i>any</i> surgical residency, including ones that you don&#x27;t typically think of surgical like OB&#x2F;GYN are similarly challenging. Hell, if you&#x27;re in it for the money gynocologic ongcology and neurosurgery both have median cash comps well over half a million a year.<p>&gt; Just 1) find a doctor who understands his limits and 2) approach the conversation as a meeting of mutually-interested peers logically discussing a problem (your health): one who has substantial headstart on the intimate, sometimes-inarticulable details of the problem, and one who has a substantial headstart on general research that&#x27;s relevant to the problem.<p>I&#x27;m not a &quot;peer&quot; with my doctor because whether it&#x27;s rote memorization or not, they&#x27;ve got at least 7 years of training I don&#x27;t, and much more if they&#x27;re a specialist and not a GP. You do not have a &quot;substantial headstart&quot; on any research relevant to your problem unless you&#x27;ve had it for years and are seeing a new GP just to get a referral to a new specialist. In which case, honestly, your old specialist can probably just refer you somewhere else.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean doctors know their limits, I&#x27;ve heard some absolutely boneheaded nonsense out of GPs who got out of their lane - my favorite was a 70 year old, borderline morbidly obese physician telling me not to do back squats below parallel because &quot;it will destroy your knees,&quot; and he subsequently groaned when he stood out of the chair. But that&#x27;s in the same vein as going into a GP because you&#x27;ve had bad headaches for the last two weeks and approaching it as a &quot;meeting of mutually-interested peers.&quot;')
