Let me tell you why from a perspective of &quot;major&quot; vaning power that is UK. The lockdown was a huge mistake with catastrophic economic consequences for a densely populated country like UK. The conservative government did it to save their voting base which is mostly old people who are in the risk group. It was supposed to last a few weeks, but instead went on for 6 months and is still effectively not over. They keep coming up with rules that are more retarded than the previous ones. Right now I can spend the whole day in the office without a mask, but I can&#x27;t go out to lunch with my coworkers. It gets worse - in my gym I have to wear a mask for those 20 meters between the door and the gym floor where the receptionist sits who is walled off with glass better than a bank teller. They keep millions of people on furlough like chinese government keeps lights on in empty factories to cover up shrinking economy. Most of those jobs are not coming back. Admitting all those incredibly stupid mistakes for the government would mean an instant political suicide.<p>Also, nobody will probably read this, because I noticed this post has been flagged into oblivion.')
