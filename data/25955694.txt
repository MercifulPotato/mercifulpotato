I don&#x27;t get the sense he&#x27;s their big hero, the core WSB community is far too chaotic-neutral to agree on a hero.<p>edit: To the second half you added to your comment, we can take a quick trip through a few key WSB threads and see for ourselves how this evolved.<p>First, there&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kxw4hu&#x2F;dont_relent_now_boys_i_just_bought_1000_on_margin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kxw4hu&#x2F;dont...</a> from about two weeks ago, where the activity was pretty typical WSB stuff and GME was just starting to look like it might have some legs.<p>Then, there was the post that ignited WSB a week ago, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l2x7he&#x2F;gme_yolo_update_jan_22_2021&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l2x7he&#x2F;gme_...</a> , which is still mostly WSB commentary but the first stick-it-to-the-hedge-fund comments are there. At this time GME was still in the $50 to $65 range and the party hadn&#x27;t really started yet. I think this makes a good case against the pump-and-dump explanation.<p>Right around the same time there was the person that paid off their student loans, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3aj4z&#x2F;i_love_you_guys&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3aj4z&#x2F;i_lo...</a> , and the comments are still pretty typical WSB but with pepperings of diamond-hands &amp;etc.<p>Within 24 hours, attention started to leak out of WSB and into places like CNBC, which started to accuse WSB of things like &quot;market manipulation&quot;, and that led to posts like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3z0n8&#x2F;howd_you_guys_manage_to_win_so_big_it_made_these&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3z0n8&#x2F;howd...</a> , which is when things really started to turn into a proper protest.<p>Initially some WSB nutcases figured they could gamble their way into a little bit of money, but when Wall Street took them seriously and started fighting back, it became a protest.')
