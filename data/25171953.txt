The output resolution is 1024x768 @ 60Hz, but the 3D portion of the screen is rendered at 256x128 @ 30Hz. The design consists of a custom 16-bit CPU (running at 32.6Mhz) and a custom raytracing &quot;GPU&quot; that can handle up to 4 rays in parallel.<p>Input happens via a N64 controller! Those are actually fairly easy to work with at a low level.<p>The code is not public, though I&#x27;m considering open sourcing the project when it&#x27;s done.\nMoreover, there&#x27;s a lot of additional details that I could potentially go into, so I&#x27;m considering also writing a few blogs posts with more info if people are interested!')
