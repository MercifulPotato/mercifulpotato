There&#x27;s a lot of luck on initial refractive error, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t need reading glasses.  One reason is I have one eye with a slightly near refractive error and one with a slightly far refractive error.  They&#x27;re also both pretty close to nominal, so losing a bit of range on focusing doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as if I&#x27;d been biased one way or another.<p>I do notice that I prefer slightly larger text than before.  I bet if I tried reading glasses that I&#x27;d find that they lend some benefit.')
