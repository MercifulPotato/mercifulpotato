I&#x27;ve worked with Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, and other big consultancies for a diverse range of reasons (regulation audits, security reviews, staff augmentations, etc.) and the value you get for the money you&#x27;re paying is pretty insane. I&#x27;d say the value you&#x27;re getting is probably 20% of the price you&#x27;re paying, and I&#x27;m being optimistic. You can get good value if you know the people you&#x27;re hiring, if you scope your project well, and if you have clear expectations. But let me tell you, nobody knows how to do this, unless they&#x27;ve been on the other side.<p>Now, you don&#x27;t always have a choice, the expertise is sometimes there, or you need one of the big four to do a prior audit before a real audit from another big four. But be prepared to have a team of OK people who will spend a lot of time producing slides and organize unproductive meetings with lots of other people (including yours) to give out a false sense of &quot;we&#x27;re making progress here&quot;. You&#x27;ll have to do the PM&#x27;ing and be extremely strict with what you want from them, and you&#x27;ll have to be ready to collaborate heavily. What I mean by this is: don&#x27;t wait for them to ask questions, you&#x27;ll have to do most of the work of onboarding them, almost like they&#x27;re your coworker except that they don&#x27;t have connections with the folks they need to work with, they don&#x27;t have access to internal stuff, they don&#x27;t know how to get there.')
