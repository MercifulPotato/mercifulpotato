That&#x27;s seen in every market in history sooner or later. The time and extent of capital dominance is determined by regulation - the more regulation, the later and less rigged in favour of the richest participant the market is.<p>These are just facts - free markets aren&#x27;t free, they aren&#x27;t efficient and they aren&#x27;t good.<p>Unfortunately the known alternative is a fudge.')
