Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24962543], score=None, time=1604259127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958878, text='<i>&gt; In a formal set theory, like ZFC, we postulate the existence of the set of natural numbers.</i><p>But if your theory is a first-order theory, you cannot pin down &quot;the set of natural numbers&quot; to the one you and everyone else is actually thinking of; no matter <i>what</i> set of axioms you use to define &quot;the set of natural numbers&quot; (the Peano axioms, etc.), there will be semantic models <i>other</i> than the set of natural numbers you are thinking of that satisfy those axioms. The only way to precisely pin down &quot;the set of natural numbers&quot; to one semantic model--the one you actually want--is to use second-order logic.<p>So it seems to me that there is a genuine tradeoff here. If you want enough expressive power to be able to precisely pin down what semantic model your theory is talking about, you need to accept that your theory will be making statements that are non-constructive--you can have an axiom that says every set has a power set, but you can&#x27;t construct that power set in the general case. If you want your theory to be constructive, so that for every set that your theory says exists, you can see how to construct it explicitly, you need to accept that your theory will have multiple semantic models and only one of them is the one you want, and your theory can&#x27;t pin it down for you.')
