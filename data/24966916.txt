For login we stored a hash of the normalized email address (all lowercase, and handling gmail&#x27;s dots and plusses). For sending emails we had them encrypted in a separate database, which only the mail-sending servers had access to - not the web-facing servers. That way we didn&#x27;t need to ask for the email address every time, and it was still fairly well protected.')
