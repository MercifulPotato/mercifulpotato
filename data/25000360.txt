I wanted to use the term &quot;agent&quot; because &quot;actor&quot; already has a slightly different connotation in common programming speak, and I wanted something a little more specific. That&#x27;s why I used that term. I do know the etymology of the terms Agent and Actor, but the point I was making is that these abstracted concepts don&#x27;t actually &quot;do&quot; anything in reality. They are abstractions we use to help us structure and think about programs (regardless of it they are actually useful in practice or not)<p>I was also using the term &quot;linear&quot; with respect to graphs: \n* All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees. All linear graphs are a form of tree.<p>Whereabouts was I using the term _linear_ in two different senses?')
