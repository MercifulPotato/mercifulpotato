Like if you are a farmer, you work hard and send your kids to school. Your kids will probably then move to the city or at least a more populous area and take up a job other than farming. As this happens more and more, doesn&#x27;t the population of small scale farmers decrease to the point where we have to rely more on large scale farms?</i><p>That assumes some combination of extreme social mobility and a steady state population. We have a growing population and the benefits of much of our industrial production to go a fraction of that population, so it doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>According to the UN, there were about 2 billion people living in ~475 million rural small farm households in 2015, which by definition are &quot;poor and food insecure and have limited access to markets and services&quot; [1] so they wouldn&#x27;t reap the benefits of industrialized agriculture. Most estimates have the global human population breaking 2 billion circa 1927 so we have more subsistence farmers alive today than there were human beings alive a hundred years ago (!!!)<p>The birth rate inversion in developed countries is a well known phenomenon [2] so many of the subsistence agriculture dependent populations are organically growing in contrast to most of the developed world which is only growing through immigration.<p>Throw in all the market distortions like water pricing and oncoming climate change... where this goes, nobody knows.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fao.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;a-i5251e.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fao.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;a-i5251e.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Income_and_fertility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Income_and_fertility</a>')
