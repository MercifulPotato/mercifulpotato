It makes a massive difference compared to your local state school. To be able to spend £16k a year cash you need to reach around this £70k income level before tax for both parents... For a single child. So IMHO, in the UK the level at which extra money no longer makes a difference to way of life or well-being is quite higher than £70k.<p>I do agree that claiming that $70k (£52k) is not even a living wage in some western cities seems outlandish...')
