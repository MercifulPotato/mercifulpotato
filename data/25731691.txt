What I can tell you is that there is an immense amount of pressure from competitors and from customers to keep service prices low. So the prospect of raising service prices is challenging when your customers are spoiled with cheap labor.<p>Also, servicing a lower-end bike ends up meaning the service is a large percentage of the original cost. So the prospect of paying, say, $150 for a tune-up, cables, and a new chain on a $400 bike <i>feels</i> excessive.
