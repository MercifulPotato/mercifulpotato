In many states a course must be undertaken to obtain a concealed carry permit, and some states put many restrictions on obtaining one.<p>A driving licence does however allow you to use any public road, whereas concealed carry permits are per state. I&#x27;ve wondered if lawmakers could use the possibility of federal level permits in exchange for tightening of current restrictions on say background checks.')
