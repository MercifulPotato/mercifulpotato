They were either orthogonal to UUID use (don&#x27;t store them as string, don&#x27;t share them publicly) or seemed to not actually come to a conclusion. The &quot;UUIDs are a pain&quot; point makes sense as does the &quot;Primary keys get around&quot; section. But the section &quot;Planning for real scale&quot; seems to stop short of saying anything against UUIDs (it only talks about ints versus bigints?).<p>The author even concludes (confusingly) with:<p>&gt; So, in reality, the right solution is probably: use UUIDs for keys, and donâ€™t ever expose them.<p>Can someone shed light on this?')
