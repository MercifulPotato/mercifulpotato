I&#x27;m from Western Europe and I don&#x27;t know any neighboring country nor my own where you can vote without an ID. \nIn my country it works like this:\nEvery citizen automatically gets a paper in the mail telling them where to vote. You show the paper and your ID at the polling place so they can check if you&#x27;re a real person. Then you vote. If you&#x27;re sick or old you have to sign a paper and give your ID, the signed paper and the paper you got in the mail to a person that will go to the polling place for you.\nMail-in ballots are only allowed for people living abroad and every election things go wrong with those. \nAll the experts telling mail-in ballots are perfectly safe used to say different things.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;as-more-vote-by-mail-faulty-ballots-could-impact-elections.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;as-more-vote-...</a>\nAnd honestly, not requiring voter ID for an election is just dumb.<p>The evidence is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hereistheevidence.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hereistheevidence.com</a>, in case you think it was only that stats page?')
