Perhaps one focused on helping&#x2F;coaching&#x2F;training companies manage remote meetings effectively.<p>This service would be admittedly a tough sell, and hard to scale since it would depend on your partner attending many meetings and providing feedback for each one.<p>But even if you get a few customers, then you have some cashflow and provide a sales channel to slowly start onboarding them on full-code product as you build more features. It will also allow you to quickly identify the most useful features to prioritise, and some features you might have not even thought about.<p>Lastly, it would give you much more credibility when trying to raise seed funding if you are able to show you sold the no-code version of the service.')
