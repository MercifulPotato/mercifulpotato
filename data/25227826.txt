(Edit: To be extra clear... While this is a bitter pill - I do not like it when others do it to me - I do find it to be very effective for reinforcing good faith in close, trusting relationships. I also do appreciate when others use this question on me; the temporary frustration&#x2F;discomfort is worth reminding me to center myself.)<p>When someone is feeling outraged about something (often politics) simply ask: &quot;but are they correct?&quot; The answer is almost always: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure&quot; (myself included). When doing this to myself, this is often enough for me to shrug off the outrage and realize that I actually do not care. It really doesn&#x27;t matter to me what political statements a mayor from a town in another state made.<p>&gt; In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force.<p>This subject implies another that is closely related, and is my biggest complaint about ads. Ads try to tell you what to think, and they are sometimes successful. But more importantly, they tell you what to think _about_, and they are much more successful at this. I like being focused on the problems that I have, and ads try as hard as they can to take that focus away.')
