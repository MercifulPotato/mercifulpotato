Closing tabs is so slow you can actually see them closing one at a time (after selecting close all tabs). Vivaldi UI is written in javascript (react) and runs as blocking single thread - Firing slow operation like closing a tab means UI freezes and stops accepting new commands for up to one second. Going fullscreen on Youtube can also take over one second.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-uCA2qIIG1M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-uCA2qIIG1M</a><p>&gt;going full-screen on YT: over 1 second<p>&gt;returning from full-screen on YT: over 1.2 seconds<p>&gt;opening Tab: 700 millisecond, 1.75 seconds, 3.453 seconds, 6.078 seconds, 7.734 seconds<p>&gt;opening Tab totals: 0.700-7.7 seconds<p>&gt;closing Tab: 1.468 seconds, 2.407 seconds, infinity because browser lost the Click event, 968 millisecond, 1.390 seconds, infinity, 700 millisecond<p>&gt;closing Tab totals: 0.7-2.4 seconds or infinity if you aren&#x27;t lucky<p>&gt;time you have to wait after opening few tabs in background for the page to regaining usability: 11 seconds!<p>All of that on 4GHz Haswell.<p>Vivaldi is Gmail levels slow, new Youtube levels slow. Remember kids, dont do UI in javascript.')
