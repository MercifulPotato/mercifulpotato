In the U.S. at least, we&#x27;re acculturated to this ideology our whole lives through education and media.<p>That said, many&#x2F;most of the wealthiest or influential market participants, fortune 500 CEOS, academics from top biz&#x2F;econ programs understand the importance of trust in the economy and the role that an effective government (contracts, the rule of law, and regulation) play in enabling that trust.<p>If you or your industry are the target of regulation, though, government BAD, regulation BAD, regardless of what you philosophically believe.')
