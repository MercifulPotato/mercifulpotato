It&#x27;s not Turing complete, so there is absolutely no way it would extend GPL virality from the kernel into userspace.<p>eBPF is code, and follows similar rules to kernel modules. That is, non-GPL-compatible eBPF code is allowed, but a subset of APIs (helpers, like module symbols) are only available to GPL-compatible eBPF programs.')
