So Iâ€™m happy to make a leap of faith and say that liberal democracy will still be with us, but with new and interesting permutations, at the turn of the 22nd century.<p>This is absolutely false, would you rather live in Haiti or China? Also, what makes &quot;Democracy&quot; isn&#x27;t really clear, you don&#x27;t necessarily have a say in what you&#x27;d like in Democracy. It&#x27;s just a vehicle to give government legitimacy, even if the votes don&#x27;t actually matter or are even real.<p>&gt; We can&#x27;t even have a civil war, as it&#x27;s impossible to draw the lines.<p>This is more false hope, it&#x27;s very easy to have a civil war even without clear lines. Aggrieved parties just need to pick up a rifle and attack their enemies. You don&#x27;t need uniforms and flags to have an insurgency.')
