They contain significantly less ink&#x2F;toner than a replacement cartridge. If you are buying a new printer rather than new cartridges, you are NOT saving money.<p>This is not HP-specific, either.  AFAIK, every printer manufacturer does this.  I have a Dell laser printer and I&#x27;m fairly certain that the toner cartridges that came with it are rated for 200 pages, while replacements are rated at 800 pages.')
