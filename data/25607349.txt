I thought this paragraph really stood out in your post:<p>&quot;This is while the rest of the team were taking weeks and months to complete a task that takes an hour, were on vacation or just out of office or out of touch. The time they were out of office was more than 2 months in one year!&quot;<p>Sounds like you were perceived as a threat to the career stability of people who have been there a long time, have figured out how to coast, and don&#x27;t want a spotlight shone on their general area. This is not intended to be a justification of any part of what you experienced, but this does sound like it wasn&#x27;t all personal.')
