Having type signatures goes a long, long way to understanding an API.  Python replaces that with rambling, unclear, prose.  The same goes for Python&#x27;s standard library and popular libraries like flask, pandas and matplotlib.<p>(Haskell&#x27;s direct links to source are also good, but there&#x27;s no fundamental reason Python couldn&#x27;t have those.  I&#x27;ve never seen it though.)')
