Item(by='geoelectric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604615041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24997104, text='How is this differentiated from, say, Todoist Premium or Business?<p>That also lets you do a one-field quick task entry that includes +collaborators or an arbitrary number of @tags, Those appear to be the two pieces of data you capture beyond the descriptive text. You get a few more than ten projects too, which is the max number you support for the most expensive plan.<p>The big obvious difference is the pricing model. You&#x27;re $80 a month for unlimited users on the annual startup plan, vs. $5&#x2F;mo&#x2F;user for Todoist Business. For an org of any size, Todoist would get more expensive for sure.<p>But under that 16 team member break even point, it sure looks like you&#x27;re implementing a pretty sharp subset of standard features. And when you consider Todoist Premium is $3&#x2F;mo&#x2F;user (so now a 27 person break even) and can be used for simple workgroup collaboration as long as you don&#x27;t need centralized billing or a team admin interface--which seems squarely like your target based on the simplicity pitch--you&#x27;re very much on the high side of pricing, but with a minimum of features.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no advantage here, but I certainly can&#x27;t tell what it is from your landing page. Once you&#x27;re at enough users where the pricing makes sense, I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d really miss a lot of other standard functionality. Unless there are queries, due dates, the ability to attach a comment chain (or at least a notes field!) to the task, etc, I wouldn&#x27;t think this would cut it. If those features do exist, they&#x27;re too well-hidden before signing up.')
