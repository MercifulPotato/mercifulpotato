In 2020 (nearly 2021). FFS.<p>Come on Apple: get your act together. The 16GB limit was frustrating as hell when I bought my last MBP in 2015: now it&#x27;s absolutely unforgiveable.<p>(The iMac obviously goes way beyond 16GB but isn&#x27;t yet available with Apple silicon, and obviously the attraction with the Mini is the relatively ludicrous performance of that Apple silicon.)')
