I was reading the article and thinking “wow the amount of scientific knowledge these guys need to know to understand what they are doing is way beyond me”. I work in health care and I always talk to clients about all the cool things they witnessed in their life. Cell phones, TVs, microwaves are some obvious ones I like to talk about. I sit and wonder what are the things my generation will get to look back on and say “I was alive when that happened”. I guess for many of us we will talk about how the internet was vs what it surely will be in the future, a shell of its initial glory.')
