John had invested in Freegate and we were discussing risks and why things failed.<p>He helped me understand both the concept of &#x27;stacking risk&#x27; (where the startup is taking on more unknowns than it should) and &#x27;over burning&#x27; where a startup attempts to hire itself into shortening its schedule which not only fails but exhausts needed capital.<p>To this day I never hire an engineer if I cannot write down EXACTLY what they will be working on and how it will help the schedule. Even if they are a &quot;super star&quot;, if I don&#x27;t have something for them to do that will check off things that are currently on the path to the next milestone, no offer.<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve watched over hiring from inside or outside it tends to end badly.')
