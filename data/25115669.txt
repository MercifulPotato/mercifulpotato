No go, something, something about an intel compatibility.<p>Do online and start googling the error I was getting.<p>Seems the newest version determined that my quad core Xeon processors didn&#x27;t support SSE 4.2 or later. A LOT of people were fuming online that in order to run the latest version, they would have to get a new PC or laptop with a new processor that was now required for the newest version.<p>The current solution for many is to now install an earlier version until they figure out what they want to do. Ironically, I still run a lot of stuff on my old Mac Mini so I found out that I can run the most recent version of Photoshop on there instead.<p>I haven&#x27;t checked into the issue for a week or so. I&#x27;m still not sure if anybody came up with a solid solution without having to buy new equipment.')
