And viri as deadly as Ebola aren&#x27;t particularly successful as they tend to kill their host before spreading sufficiently (HIV is quite nefarious in that respect and I&#x27;d think close to worst case).<p>Humankind is in no danger of extinction from this virus or any other known.  The old and infirm need to take precautions, as well as those tending to them.  The rest of us have other things to worry about.  Stop the fear mongering.')
