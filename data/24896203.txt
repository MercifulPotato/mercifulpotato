I&#x27;m sure microsoft doesn&#x27;t mind a captive market, but if the government decides to use slack or whatever instead, you&#x27;re going to switch over to slack regardless of any protest from microsoft.<p>The companies which seem to benefit the most from the government&#x27;s power are the ones which would suffer the most from losing the government&#x27;s current favor.
