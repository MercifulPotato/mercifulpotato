Item(by='syllogism', descendants=None, kids=[24795719], score=None, time=1602794798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24792464, text='&gt; lazyness of spacy developers by making everything dynamic they broke the autocompletion that is normally working in python.<p>Actually it&#x27;s the opposite of &quot;making everything dynamic&quot;. spaCy is mostly implemented in Cython, which is a language for writing C extensions for Python. So things are statically typed and memory managed, which sometimes doesn&#x27;t work well with inspect. We set whatever compilation flags we can to make the annotations passed through though. It&#x27;s definitely not a question of laziness though...You could say we worked extremely hard to break things in this particular way.<p>In v3 we&#x27;ve been able to finally ditch Python 2 support, which means we&#x27;re able to embrace type annotations. Our machine learning library, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinc.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinc.ai</a>, is extensively type-annotated and actually you can get type hints and type errors for composing layers incorrectly.<p>Personally I use vim and don&#x27;t use autocompletion, I find it makes the typing laggy and I&#x27;ve just never really wanted it. We do have developers on the team who use autocompletion though and I think spaCy actually supports it better than you suggest, I&#x27;m not sure whether you had a specific problem, but maybe see whether it works if you install spacy-nightly.<p>Btw I do think you&#x27;ve come across as a weird jerk in this thread though? You might want to read over your messages and think about that. Like, I (and I think most others) genuinely didn&#x27;t get what you meant in your first few messages; I thought you were saying spaCy didn&#x27;t let you _build_ autocomplete.')
