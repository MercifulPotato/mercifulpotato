It always seemed to be focused on that part more than in any other. I&#x27;m not saying everything else is bad, it just a gut feeling that code review always got the maximum attention.<p>And another catch is that it seems they lost their momentum even in this area. I recall times when we waited for weekly status update to see if there is something we&#x27;d have as excuse for an upgrade.
