In &#x27;86 they stopped allowing new registrations for automatic weapons, but existing registered weapons were grandfathered in. US gun law considers the lower receiver to bear the &quot;identity&quot; of the weapon, so some pretty extensive modification can occur while it technically stays &quot;the same gun&quot; in a Ship of Theseus fashion.')
