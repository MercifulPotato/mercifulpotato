People who attack short sellers only do it when they are protecting their rich friends who are CEOs.<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with redditors fucking with short sellers. People who are clutching their pearls about this are only trying to protect rich friends who are hedge fund managers.<p>There is nothing wrong, illegal, or immoral about trying to &quot;manipulate&quot; the stock market unless you are committing fraud or have insider information. CEOs of companies, activist investors, and analysts do this for a living every day. They are not more qualified than us to have and share opinions and history tells us they are perhaps much less.<p>There is absolutely zero reason for anyone - SEC, The Government, robinhood, the exchanges, Facebook - to intervene and anyone who is considering intervention right now is only doing it to protect their rich hedge-fund friends.')
