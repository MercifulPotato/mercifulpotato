Personally I never had an issue with tripping over the power cable. I think USB-C w&#x2F; PD is better. I can connect one cable for power and data and on any side of the laptop. If Apple did reintroduce MagSafe we would be back to a minimum of 2 cables: a dedicated power port on one side and docking station&#x2F;display USB-C. Perhaps Apple could come up with a MagSafe USB-C design.')
