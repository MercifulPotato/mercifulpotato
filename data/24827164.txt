Before each interview, he conducts the most in-depth research on them that anyone has ever conducted, mentioning people, places, early inspirations from their childhood and musical career, things that only a handful of people, the rappers&#x27; parents or only themselves could know - which often astounds, confuses or even frightens them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QZP8OwCdO1E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QZP8OwCdO1E</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5RKbSi87J5Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5RKbSi87J5Q</a><p>I agree with the previous comments, Lex&#x27; guests are really great, maybe the above can serve as inspiration :)')
