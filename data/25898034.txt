L4 is &quot;terminal&quot; in that there&#x27;s no explicit up-or-out pressure beyond that point. L5 is senior, and I&#x27;d say most people don&#x27;t make it beyond L5 without intent. L6 has a few shifts from prior levels. Notably that a high performing L3 is an L4 and a high performing L4 is an L5 (usually), but simply performing well at L5 isn&#x27;t enough to get to L6, the scope of work and goals shift between L5&#x2F;6. You generally won&#x27;t be considered for L5 without 10+ yoe, as I understand it, although internally you can reach it faster.')
