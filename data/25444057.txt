You can be down for hours without losing mail. The sending servers will retry for a while.<p>I’m aware senders will retry for days if your server doesn’t reply, but it still requires monitoring and is not just a “fire and forget” solution.<p>Also, if your server starts bouncing emails, chances are you’ll be missing mails. Again, needs monitoring.')
