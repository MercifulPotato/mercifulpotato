Put it on your hands and head and you&#x27;re good to go. You should try it. For me this was the biggest game changer. I use this multiple times a day for my workouts &#x2F; game sessions.<p>Prior to that, it was really annoying with PCVR. It felt like a ritual setting up PCVR prior to playing and it was a chore cleaning up.')
