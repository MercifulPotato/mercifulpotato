While I do think the constant focus on individual responsibility and small changes within domestic households is largely a misdirect to divert attention from real systemic &amp; political&#x2F;corporate causes of climate change, those large political&#x2F;corporate entities are still ultimately sustained by societal behaviour; we would literally need to change everything (at the very least in the western world) to avert climate change, which is very much a social challenge.<p>&gt; <i>Climate change is a slow process</i><p>This may have been true in the 50s or 60s. It sounds like that&#x27;s the last time you took an interest in this topic.<p>&gt; <i>Technology is fast enough to catch up with it and solve it</i><p>Is this satire?<p>&gt; <i>Automation is too(And my guess in the near future, it would be a much bigger problem)</i><p>People have been saying this since ancient Rome or before (see Vespasian), but it hasn&#x27;t happened nor will it ever.
