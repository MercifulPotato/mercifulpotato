The OpenComputers Package Manager (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MightyPirates&#x2F;OpenComputers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master-MC1.7.10&#x2F;src&#x2F;main&#x2F;resources&#x2F;assets&#x2F;opencomputers&#x2F;loot&#x2F;oppm&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;oppm.lua" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MightyPirates&#x2F;OpenComputers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master-M...</a>) became a limiting factor to my players as they wanted some ability to load from other sources so I converted the program to MoonScript (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moonscript.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moonscript.org&#x2F;</a>) and maintained a fork with modifications for them.<p>MoonScript was certainly more pleasant to write and maintain (compared to Lua), but type safety would&#x27;ve definitely helped squash some of the weirder side effect driven bugs. That said, I still think MoonScript is a great middle ground for things that are written in Lua but need some extra organizational tools.')
