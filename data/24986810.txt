There is no ambiguity. There is no overlap with other DBMS names or non-database entities. They are easy to spell correctly[5]. Everyone refers to them by their full name. Nobody mistakingly calls them &quot;PostgresDB&quot; or &quot;ClickhouseSQL.&quot;<p>After reflecting on what makes them so good, I realized what the secret was to them. They are a two-syllable name that is derived from combining two unrelated one-syllable words together (e.g., Post + Gres, Click + House). Each individual word has its own meaning. It is only when you put them together does it mean the database.<p>Given this, I henceforth contend that the best way to name a DBMS is to combine two one-syllable words.&quot;<p>Noise + Page<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~pavlo&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;on-naming-a-database-management-system.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~pavlo&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;on-naming-a-datab...</a>')
