The body responsible is called RTUK and recently got regulatory powers over internet broadcasting too. It infamously fines TV channels that are not friendly enough to Erdogan at the smallest mistake and turning blind eye on pro-Erdogan channels. This is because, the fines need to go through the committee in which Erdogan holds the majority.<p>To what extent you might ask? Well, there’s a talk show host on the TV who got destroyed for having a guest who said “let’s save the kids” when talking about governments dealings with the Kurds and there’s a TV channel who got a slap on the wrist after a public outcry for hosting commentators asking people to  keep arms at home and identify potential targets among their neighbours who might be Erdogan’s political rivals.<p>The double standards are off the charts. Youtube is probably becoming Erdogan’s double standards enforcer.Everything is going to be legal, of course.<p>If youtube doesn’t behave, more fines will come. The government would usually turn a blind eye to some practices in the industry and will slap fines to those who are not in line. Turkey has strong as GDPR personal information protection laws, probably a land mine field for ad-agencies and that’s how they will get their fines I would guess.')
