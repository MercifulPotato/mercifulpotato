I’m pro competence. I’m certainly not pro some of the nonsense that the various state BJP governments pull, including the past beef related hysteria.<p>Modi himself is not pro that nonsense as he has mentioned more than once. However, to govern he does need to create a big tent. Beef ban vs 15% of Indian women legally treated as chattel.

I think if he actually had freedom to act rather than being a puppet he would have done really well. But frankly, in terms of how the country did it’s not even close.
