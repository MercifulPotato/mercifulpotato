It&#x27;s got about a 180m elevation change between the start&#x2F;finish&#x2F;pit straight and the top of the mountain. Back when they were allowed to race motorcycles there, old 2 stroke racebikes were notorious for seizing at the top of the hill if they&#x27;d been jetted down at the bottom and hadn&#x27;t been set &quot;rich enough&quot; to allow for the altitude change. Many many riders crashed and said &quot;It was running really strong, til it locked up on me and spat me down the road...&quot;<p>(No apologies at all for my off topic response to pedantry...)')
