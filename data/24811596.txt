I think this is true for all sorts of aspects on the UX of financial related institutions. Not just banks, but anything you use money on.<p>My <i>mortgage</i> is paid through something that frankly looks like a scam site. You connect to it with an odd domain. When you login, it hops all over the place changing domains and forwarding you repeatedly. The UI is old, odd, and breaks with modern and <i>safe</i> UX patterns, like password managers <i>(can&#x27;t paste)</i>. When you finally land on the site to enter your payment information, it no longer matches the domain you went to.<p>I don&#x27;t think a single one of my online payment hubs for standard bills like mortgage, utilities, loans, etc don&#x27;t at least have one glaring pitfall that helps to introduce confusion to uninformed customers. Hell, i consider myself reasonably informed and i <i>still</i> fear i&#x27;m logging into a poorly thought out phishing attempt every time i pay my bills.<p>We&#x27;ve given very little consistent information to the average person about how to safely interact with the web.
