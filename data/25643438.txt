For an issue no average consumer is actually frustrated about. Why are we still debating why those consumers don&#x27;t care about ECC? How is it different from hot swappable RAM for the average Joe? They&#x27;ll upgrade or expand their RAM more often than they&#x27;ll get frustrated about the effect of bitflips. So why not have hot swappable memory? Because as much as I&#x27;d love hot swappable anything, regular consumers neither care about it nor want to pay for it.')
