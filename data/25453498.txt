I never was as big a Trekkie as I was a Star Wars fan, so I didn&#x27;t really see it with JJ&#x27;s Star Trek. I actually liked his first movie.<p>And then came Star Wars. I kind of could accept his remake of Episode 4, but after that, man they made me like the prequels so much more. Not that the movies itself were bad, they just totally ignored the fact that 6 other movies already existed, not even speaking about all the legends stuff. He could have easily used ships, characters and locations from Legends, all the designs were there. Using them would have had the same effect on new viewers while eing <i>great</i> for oldtimers like myself. He didn&#x27;t, everything had to be his, and bigger and faster and with  more bang.<p>That it can be done differently was shown by Feloni.')
