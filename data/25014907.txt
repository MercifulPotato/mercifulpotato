Item(by='creata', descendants=None, kids=[25016935], score=None, time=1604755182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014526, text='&gt; science only pays lip service to the scientific method…  I&#x27;m happy to accept that most scientists are acting in good faith.<p>Square these two sentences, because you can&#x27;t <i>accidentally</i> &quot;only pay lip service to the scientific method&quot;. Are you or aren&#x27;t you claiming that scientists feign their rigor?<p>&gt; If someone, in person, testifies to their personal experience, that it had an impact on their life, you would ignore that?<p>I would not ignore that. But what works for someone does not necessarily work for anyone else, or even for that same person but under different circumstances. That&#x27;s why we need statistics and rigor in methods.<p>&gt; If you take the word of &#x27;science&#x27; over an individual&#x27;s open expression<p>I do not. Contrary to what you say, both are often biased, both are often tools used to promote corporate and other agendas — especially anecdotes on social media sites (including HN!) by god-knows-who — and both are often wrong. But unlike your average anecdote-offerer, scientists test whether their results generalize at all, and take <i>many</i> measures to mitigate bias. Anecdotes are important, but at most, the truth they give you is &quot;I did this and my situation improved&quot;. Actual research tends to say a lot more than that.<p>&gt; And, be honest, you don&#x27;t even need them to provide evidence for you to accept whatever they state.<p>I suggest that you stop such insinuation.')
