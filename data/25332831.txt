Cycles are still needed to copy new data into sprite and VRAM which typically has to be done during vertical blank, esp. on older consoles.<p>16-bit platforms like SNES and Genesis&#x2F;MegaDrive had a large enough VRAM to hold a background with enough area that you might be able to get away with reloading data into VRAM &quot;between rooms&quot;.<p>NES has enough VRAM for 2 screens - either horizontal or vertical (it could do 4 screens if the catridge had extra VRAM on board which was rare) and VRAM can&#x27;t be updated except during vblank.  The game engine has to spend time copying new data ahead of the visible screen, and also must spend some cycles each frame letting a DMA process copy 256 bytes of data describing sprite positions to the video chip&#x27;s object RAM.<p>Not as bad as the Commodore 64 where the scroll registers shift only up to 8 pixels and an engine has to recopy potentially a full 1k of screen and 1k of color RAM to move things (barring things like VSP which could corrupt RAM on certain C64&#x27;s) - or the Atari 2600 that had no video RAM at all and required programming the video chip per scanline right before the TV is drawing it.')
