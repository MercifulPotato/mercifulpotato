Divorcing that operational, get-your-hands-dirty aspect from your business closes off insights that arise from the ongoing software-eats-the-world wave still building up steam around the world.<p>The more you cram together the people networks, culture, knowledge, tooling and practices of how to create all this stuff into a single ecosystem, the more they start making Burke-like <i>Connections</i>. Thinking you can Jira-innovate your way to dominance on an ever-narrowing technology stack is architecture astronaut&#x27;ing on a strategic corporate scale.<p>If Amazon had outsourced their IT operations to an IBM, would their internal culture still have <i>de novo</i> evolved the nascent devops principles back then into AWS?<p>It isn&#x27;t what Intel gives up now by selling this business that will hurt their innovation. It is the options that suddenly get a lot more expensive to investigate in the future for future innovation. Technology innovation is evolution: extremely messy, more dead ends than successful adaptations, enormously energy-intensive from lots of majority-repetition, and highly organic. You can certainly optimize around the edges to make it slightly less jagged-edge, but innovation sparks at the tiny interstices, usually not at the top.')
