It does make the data file much more readable, and it makes it possible to grep for text without having to worry about regex to skip through tags, but IMO the convenience is outweighed by the fact that there is no way to do mass search and replace (that is, using external tools) without totally messing up the formatting.<p>IMO the best approach is inline makeup but for the text editor to have the ability to hide tags.
