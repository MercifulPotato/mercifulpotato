It was a basic test of responsibility, similar to the 501-karma downvote requirement on HN.  Holding land wasn&#x27;t that hard, but it did indicate a baseline.<p>Unless you&#x27;re thinking of only allowing certain political or moral viewpoints to vote? That sounds fairly dystopian, no matter what one believes.<p>Edit: we used to have something else like that - a certain subset of the population only got 3&#x2F;5 of a whole vote. But I really doubt that&#x27;s what you want.')
