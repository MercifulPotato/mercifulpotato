Part of it is because of night time flight restrictions at any airport near a population center (which are generally the airports that could support flights at odd hours). For example, Heathrow is severely restricted between 23:30 and 6:00. Frankfurt is restricted between 23:00 and 5:00.<p>The other part of it is that the distances involve are relatively short. London to Paris is 1.5h. London to Berlin 2h. Even London to Moscow is less than 4.5h.<p>Itâ€™s almost impossible to have an actual overnight journey like you can have flying from New York to San Francisco.')
