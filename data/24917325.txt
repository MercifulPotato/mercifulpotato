E.g. in Switzerland, it&#x27;s illegal for your healthcare to be paid by the company, and also it&#x27;s obligatory to have healthcare insurance (probably the country pays for it if you&#x27;re poor). That way, you establish a thriving and competitive health insurance market, forcefully eliminate all the benefits corporations get that are unavailable to individuals, and also align interests (because individuals will be in the middle of money flow, they&#x27;ll have a vested interest in getting fairly- and transparently-priced health services). This would solve most of the problems US healthcare system has, while not triggering any anti-big-government sentiments.')
