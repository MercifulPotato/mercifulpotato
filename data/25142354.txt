Depends on who you count, but let&#x27;s say around ~30 devs.<p>Recently we basically did just this, and it&#x27;s been a great success. We haven&#x27;t fully migrated and still use AWS for prod, but have seen substantial savings already.<p>We spent $2k on servers, Dell r720s.  We bought a UPS and mount, and racked them in our office.  I installed OpenShift 4 on it, which is Red Hat&#x27;s Kubernetes offering with a nice web GUI, and setup a few terabytes of NFS to automatically provision storage.<p>To be fair, installing OpenShift for the first time took a while, around 3 weeks.  Since then it&#x27;s been smooth.  We still use AWS, but our usage has gone down dramatically. We are still only migrating dev and test environments, leaving prod in AWS (we don&#x27;t want to be responsible for uptime SLAs, and clients pay prod hosting costs).  Some of these projects are CPU heavy, machine learning and computer vision projects too.  They&#x27;re not just simple web-apps. I&#x27;m not privy to our entire AWS budget, but I know that one project which we migrated saved over $500&#x2F;mo.<p>After installation, maintenance has taken barely any time. Around 10-20% of my time is dedicated to OpenShift cluster maintenance.  The rest I do normal project work.  I often go weeks without having to touch anything, and the most common task I do is onboard new users.  We&#x27;ve had 2 outages in over 6mo, one was an expiring cert and one was an airflow issue on the rack. I&#x27;ve learnt a lot and am certainly not an expert.  These were the firs rack servers I&#x27;d ever worked with personally, although I had been researching used models for home use for a while (shoutout to &#x2F;r&#x2F;Homelab).<p>In fact, I had such success doing this that I personally bought a Dell r720 and have used it to selfhost a bunch of stuff at home. A co-worker of mine hosts his self hosted lab on AWS.  Things like Plex, private photo storage, a few other toys, etc.  He says he pays $300&#x2F;mo, which seems insane to me, but I guess people streaming 4K plex adds up.  The used r720 server I bought was $1,500CAD and has way more horsepower than he&#x27;s paying for. (There are also electricity costs I haven&#x27;t factored in here, as I&#x27;m trying to control for other changes in my power bill.  Might be $100&#x2F;mo at most.)')
