Item(by='les_diabolique', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609359904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='I created a vinyl auction aggregator from eBay called collectorsfrenzy.com in 2008 which I ran till 2018.<p>At the time, there was another website Popsike (still running today) that accomplished the same task, but they only updated the listings pulled from eBay every few months whereas my service pulled the listings as soon as they completed.<p>My failure was that I ran everything from my cable modem and off of my own hardware. By the time cloud services were affordable, my database was around 60gigs, and I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would be able to transfer the data easily. Eventually, my hardware bit the dust and I just didn&#x27;t have the motivation to get everything back up and running. I had always considered to transition to a vinyl marketplace but work&#x2F;family ended up delaying that indefinitely.')
