America, or at least its coastal big cities, leads the world in identity leftism. That is, the kind of leftism that finds its base in gays, transgenders, criminals, and other social “losers” (as opposed to economic losers) and their sympathizers.

They despise crass, vulgar, manly working men.<p>It’s obviously more complicated than this, but that’s the 5000 foot view.')
