I don&#x27;t think I have celiac but I have issues with histamine. Went on Keto and probiotics (Bacillus subtilis being in the mix doing the trick for me). I was very lethargic and I couldn&#x27;t drink alcohol, no alcohol free beer either and certain foods wouldn&#x27;t work either. Eating left over lasagna 2 days in a row? Migraine! The kind where you just wanna throw up.<p>With the probiotics and keto I can tolerate a few beers though I just don&#x27;t do it any longer because it still throws my digestive system off if I have too much. But alcohol in geberal is no longer a problem. No migraines (sure if I just drink too much I get a hangover like everyone else but I no longer get a whole day migraine from having one 333ml bottle of alcohol free beer).<p>I no longer do keto (did the real 20g of carbs max per day for over a half year). Doctor checked for ketones and I was definitely in ketosis and all of my blood markers that were off went into normal. Except for total cholesterol but even that improved. I mean get this I was on the max dose of statins before keto without any significant improvement. With keto, (e.g. smoked salmon with mayonnaise and a boiled egg makes a meal) even my cholesterol improved and I didn&#x27;t even take any statins any longer.<p>Our regular western diet is just totally effed up.<p>We use spelt flower for everything now and I can eat that and I looooove my home made pulled pork. It&#x27;s quite easy to keep up keto when there&#x27;s no sugar in the house I find but since the family still craves it, I sneak in way too much of it into my diet. But I still try to keep carbs to a max of ~75g.<p>And I can tell you, being able to have a nice scotch again without regretting it for the next two days is awesome!')
