Sure, there will be canned solutions for _some_ things - maybe even for cat detection, because it&#x27;s fun so why not.<p>But, a library that uses AI to optimize the production of your business&#x27; flux capacitors? Ain&#x27;t gonna happen, you need to build that yourself. To have a library&#x2F;product that solves problems using AI, you need a &quot;language&quot; to describe the problem (like you can e.g. use SQL to describe any data query you may have). But describing problems is notoriously hard - accurately &amp; precisely describing the problem is very often just as hard as solving it.')
