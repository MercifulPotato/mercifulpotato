They abandon objective measures of complexity and instead judge it based on the limits of their own mental capacity. If they can understand it (and they built it), then they think anyone can. They get bored and start doing things the most &quot;clever&quot; way.<p>This is why engineering leadership is crucial. You need an architect who&#x27;s been burned by convoluted code before, who can push for objective measures of code quality and simplicity and (true) modularity (not just DRY-style thoughtless consolidation).<p>But we&#x27;ve seen a race to the bottom lately. Everyone is trying to do more with only junior developers, or senior developers who code like junior developers (just 3x faster and more convoluted).<p>And if you&#x27;re at a startup, congratulations, your coworkers have all worked at other startups previously, where the determining factor as to wether the company succeeded or not was mostly on the business side (product&#x2F;market fit) and they never got to see an unchecked engineering team slowly cripple a company from the inside.')
