We shouldn&#x27;t abolish cash tho.<p>Just because something can be used for &quot;bad&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t exist. The internet also could be considered an enabler for sites like Silk Road, but its not gona get shut down for that reason.<p>So... the follow up question is, &quot;Are there any good use cases?&quot;<p>Yes, the biggest that comes to mind is it allows people who may be doing nothing wrong a payment system that cant be stoped. For example, someone of X religion could still make purchases in a society where religious freedom isn&#x27;t allowed by its governing body.<p>May not be a concern for you today, but having the option for it is 100% I will support.')
