(sic.)<p>Yes, I did. I provided you with this solution: &quot;simply invest that money in better security to begin with&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to simply do the right thing.&quot; is not a solution.<p>I never said that. But what I did say <i>is</i> indeed a solution.<p>&gt; What I propose is a set of policies and incentives that archive what you want.<p>Well, it certainly makes incentives, but probably not the ones you had in mind. For instance it incentivizes middlemen to scrape off valuable resources that <i>could</i> have been used to secure the actual data. At best this lowers the profit margin left over for the hospital to improve the security, but it&#x27;s way worse than that. Instead the middleman actually incentivizes hackers to crack into the very system the middleman &quot;insures,&quot; exactly because huge insurance payouts are involved.<p>Perhaps the hackers could fake a mental disorder and get committed at the hospital, which would make it far easier to get insight into how the data security system works, and then plant a backdoor or leak that way. This means the hacker would both get money from blackmail <i>and</i> money from insurance payouts (win-win for him), making the incentives from the insurance scam absurdly bad. But perhaps that was the goal all along?<p>Meanwhile the owner is already disincentivized from securing the system further, because he can claim that he already did enough to secure it, while what he <i>actually</i> means is that he insured it... Whatever he paid for, was certainly not free! The only one incentivized to look into the matter, is the insurance company itself, because they&#x27;re the ones who stand to lose the most money if the system fails. And even they don&#x27;t want to waste money on a matter they might not even understand themselves. Meanwile their biggest incentive  isn&#x27;t to secure the data, but to not pay money to the patients. And perhaps the easiest way to avoid that, is to hire a PR consultant instead of fixing the data system.<p>Certainly the <i>least</i> of their worries are the patients, who are the real losers here, from being trapped in a game of exploitation for profit, and who quite possibly have to pay a much higher fee for the services of said institution because of it. Luckily, Finland is a welfare state, so that extra cost probably won&#x27;t be billed individual patients (depending on how this privately owned hospital operates), but instead it will most likely be forwarded to the taxpayers, which – while spreading the cost on more hands – is still extremely bad.<p>Overall, introducing an insurance scheme only adds another problem, without fixing the initial one, because how would you rate the probability of the system failing? That&#x27;s what sets the insurance fee, after all. Thus, for the insurance companys part, it&#x27;s far better to overbill, which would just result in increasing cost, without much benefit to anyone.')
