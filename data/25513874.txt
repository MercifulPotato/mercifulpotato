It is just some academic theory which was accepted with no evidence and with no common sense. &quot;Privilege&quot; is a combination of many factors so even isolating it to skin colour as if it sums up everything about a person is just plain stupid. Not to mention that it all comes out of some American internal issue which doesn&#x27;t apply to many other &quot;whites&quot; around the world. Even the concept of white is different in different parts of the world. Can American leaves us alone with this idiocy and keep it to themselves?')
