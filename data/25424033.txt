I really appreciate this article for that, and I hope we see more content like this.<p>However, I would note a couple of things:<p>- As the author acknowledges, the Ryzen CPU is last gen.  The current generation of Ryzen CPUs are about 20% faster gen-over-gen.<p>- The memory configuration used with that Ryzen CPU is not optimal.  I believe DDR4-3600 is recommended, and does have a measurable impact on performance.<p>That said, the M1 is still quite impressive.  However the Ryzen 5 5600X (or the upcoming Ryzen 7 5800U for laptops) is a solid choice for a developer workstation.<p>EDIT: I would also add, the limitation of 16GB RAM max is a deal breaker for me (as MacOS, but that&#x27;s a different story).')
