You can&#x27;t make all your moves at once, that would play the hand, but little by little chip away at it and slowly boil the frog.<p>Whether it&#x27;s evidence of something being amiss, or a red flag that there&#x27;s substance to the conspiracies, matters not to me. This whole ordeal has proven that the US* and its tech masters are no better than their Chinese counterparts when it comes to propaganda and censorship.<p>Whether they go the next step further and try to &quot;re-educate&quot; their opponents, as some have pondered on social media, is something we&#x27;ll soon see play out in the new year.<p>Conspiracy or not, stolen election or not, the thirst and exercise of information (and disinformation) control is very, very real.<p>*I have no doubt that the effectiveness of this tech weaponry will be studied and emulated throughout the Western world in the coming years.')
