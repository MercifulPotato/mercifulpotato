We could&#x27;ve been reaping the benefits of and&#x2F;or living the dystopia of that <i>today</i>, or even 10 years ago, were the decision made to actually barcode everyone. But we didn&#x27;t, and what&#x27;s likely to happen is we&#x27;ll push the biometrics recognition technologies to such high level, the machines will no longer need the barcodes. Then the dystopia will happen anyway.<p>Note the irony here: what people don&#x27;t want is the dystopia, but what&#x27;s stopping it now is that they find <i>barcoding people</i> creepy. They won&#x27;t notice the AI tech until it&#x27;s too late.<p>On a broader note, this pattern of rounding a square peg to fit if we can&#x27;t square the round hole - it&#x27;s what we do. All the time, everywhere. For instance, designing a reliable all-terrain vehicle is something that technologically escapes now even to this day, but thousands of years ago our ancestors figured out that if they flatten and pave the terrain, then a simple wheel would do.')
