Most do not do that, so if they want to customize, they spend time modifying and working around the default views. This has an effect of constraining the look. The difficulty emulating controller-like behavior means that adding multiple pieces of content to a view takes extra work.<p>As for the content architecture, Wordpress cpt are limited in their ability to relate to others and to define flexible custom fields (even with ACF.) It’s possible to hack together something like what a more flexible CMS or application framework can do, but it’s fragile and takes a lot of boilerplate, which, similar to template customization, steers the developer towards a similar architecture to other sites.<p>For these reasons, increased development and maintenance cost make it unlikely that an attempt to develop something truly customized on Wordpress will be successful.')
