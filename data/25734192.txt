The crowd was armed to the teeth with guns, pipebombs, and ziptie handcuffs. They constructed a gallows. They coordinated with police sympathizers to gain access to the building, while one GOP congresswoman live-tweeted the known whereabouts of Nancy Pelosi.<p>They were planning to murder political opposition and violently overthrow a fair democratic election to appoint their leader instead.<p>If not for the plan devolving into a disorganized mob, and a quick thinking capitol officer who lead rioters away from the chamber where House Reps had been evacuated, rioters may have claimed many more lives.<p>Kudos for Amazon, Apple, Google, and all other tech companies for deplatforming violent neo-fascists and their enablers.')
