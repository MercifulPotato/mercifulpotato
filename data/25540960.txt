Another term for &#x27;strategic bombing&#x27; is &#x27;terror bombing&#x27;.<p>&gt; <i>One of the strategies of war is to demoralize the enemy so that peace or surrender becomes preferable to continuing the conflict. Strategic bombing has been used to this end. The phrase &quot;terror bombing&quot; entered the English lexicon towards the end of World War II and many strategic bombing campaigns and individual raids have been described as terror bombing by commentators and historians. Because the term has pejorative connotations, some, including the Allies of World War II, have preferred to use euphemisms such as &quot;will to resist&quot; and &quot;morale bombings&quot;.[1][2]</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strategic_bombing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strategic_bombing</a>')
