Sometimes we spent hours doing this again and again until all dependencies were finally resolved.<p>I worked there for almost a year, did many cool gigs and learned a lot. But my most valuable contribution came when at some point, tired of that unpredictable torture that were the deploys, started researching into solutions. I set up a pypi proxy into one of our spare office machines and routed all my daily package installs through that. Then I copied that entire proxy content into the production machine before every deploy, and voila, no more surprises.<p>I left this job a few weeks later, but have heard that this solution was very useful for many devs that joined the team afterwards.')
