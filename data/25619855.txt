I haven&#x27;t ever driven somewhere with them, but I suspect all I&#x27;d be thinking about was the speed limit, resulting in very dangerous driving.  With all my focus on making to correct average I&#x27;d fail to properly track other drivers and potential hazards.<p>I&#x27;m much happier with a flow of traffic enforcement.  Ticket those who speed excessively beyond what traffic is generally flowing and let the posted limit be more of a guideline.')
