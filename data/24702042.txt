Not merely a necessary evil.<p>- good compensation and perks.<p>- good working environment.<p>- great, talented colleagues.<p>- bonus: looks great on your resume and opens doors to potential future opportunities.<p>I would say most jobs at most well known tech companies (say, FAANG and others) would qualify...and most are gatekeeped by leetcode. I&#x27;m guessing you would not consider these to be good companies?')
