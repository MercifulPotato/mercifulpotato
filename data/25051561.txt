Or not I guess as it means I won&#x27;t be buying anything today<p>I think this was the fastest way to get something out quickly and cover as many SKUs as possible.<p>We&#x27;ll need to wait for the next&#x2F;larger SKU models to get out of the 16B &#x2F; 2TB &#x2F; 2-port limitations. Maybe they should call those devices the Macbook Pro Max.<p>I wonder how many more SKUs will be needed. Obviously they are going to minimize them, but will they be able to cover Macbook Pro 16&quot;, iMac, iMac Pro and Mac Pro with only one (unlikely) or two (likely) more SKUs?')
