You can only react to it.<p>Look around you.  Right here on HN, we discuss politics.  We&#x27;re doing it right now.  Yet... no violence.  And the reason is moderation.  The moderators remove violent commenters and the community shuns them.  Clearly HN&#x2F;dang have been able to &quot;prevent violent rhetoric&quot;.  It works.<p>And Facebook and Twitter are doing OK right now.  Both were very late to the game, but are engaged in a heroic effort right now to clean up their communities.  In fact it was something of a left-Twitter running gag over the past week to giggle at conservatives complaining about their follower count suddenly dropping.<p>But Parler did no such thing.  So outside forces had to apply the moderation.')
