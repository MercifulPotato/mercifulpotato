A couple of times he has seen a black bear wander through his back yard, and he occasionally sees a wolf stalking some deer in his back yard.<p>He doesn&#x27;t have a dog, but some of his neighbors sometimes have their dogs cower up to their owners during walks because they smell wolves.  Supposedly some people have seen wolves stalking their dogs, but I haven&#x27;t heard of dogs being killed by wolves in the area.<p>It&#x27;s mostly safe for adults, but I wouldn&#x27;t let a kid run around alone in my dad&#x27;s yard, mostly for fear of the rapidly flowing small river, but also due to wolves and bears.')
