Not all puritans were Calvinist but if you&#x27;re mentioning predestination, it kind of bears to reason that that group were.<p>I kind of get what you&#x27;re saying...but if its based in Puritanism, it&#x27;s probably a perverted form of it<p>I actually attribute the origins to the New Age movement (rooted and perverted from Hinduism) and the power of positive thinking that resulted of it during the 70s. Essentially if you believe in something hard enough then it can become true')
