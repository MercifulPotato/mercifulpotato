Now I have to check if I am eligible for some sort of fast track scheme like &quot;For example the UK is currently recruiting many doctors and nurses and people of those professions will have it significantly _easier_ to move to the UK than others.&quot; It&#x27;s very likely that I do not know all the special exemptions for immigrants in the UK. I will have to consult an immigration expert so that I can maximize my chances of being accepted. Then there is the obvious problem of not being accepted. If I&#x27;m not a nurse or doctor I will have a much harder time. There is also the small but impactful risk of being forced to return to my home country even after I have immigrated. Visa programs can change in the blink of an eye and throw off a decade of planning.<p>It feels to me that you are just pointing at survivorship bias. Yeah sure your relatives were the few ones that immigrated without any help but what about all those that were shown the door?')
