I agree with the implied premise that decisions are more likely to be good ones if they look good from more angles.<p>There is much ink spilled in apologia of the current system around how the needs and experiences of those in cities are very different than those of people in rural communities, and the system needs to avoid being blind to either.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s entirely misguided but it smells a bit of special pleading; there are other ways we can slice the electorate that would likely lead to comparable (or larger) differences in needs and experiences, and we don&#x27;t change the weights in light of that.')
