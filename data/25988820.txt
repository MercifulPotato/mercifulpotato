Unfortunately that same slipperiness makes it challenging for people trying to speak clearly. While &quot;the West&quot; has often been loosely aligned with human rights (some defending&#x2F;embracing them, some merely claiming them as magic words) they certainly have their problems.<p>Your argument seems to be do the following: substitute an inferior term into rgbrenner&#x27;s argument, and then complaining that your chosen term is inferior.<p>rgbrenner:&gt; The sides aren&#x27;t US and China, they&#x27;re X and anti-X<p>you:&gt; You say the sides are Y and anti-X, but Y isn&#x27;t X<p>[0]: Do we mean America? America + Western Europe? Are we including Canada? How about Mexico? All colonial powers? Does Eastern Europe count? How about Australia? Or even Japan? You might have a particular definition in mind, but it&#x27;s likely other people have different understandings.')
