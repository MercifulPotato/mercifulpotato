If you own BTC, then you have non-mainstream sources for pricing and news.  If you don&#x27;t own BTC, then what is there to read about?<p>The mainstream news rarely reports on commodity prices.  When they do, it&#x27;s because the price is tangentially relevant to a more important story.<p>So, congratulations I suppose.  Bitcoin has matured enough to be granted the same status that the news gives to oil, cranberries and soybeans.  It will be written about only when the price impacts a large number of consumers.')
