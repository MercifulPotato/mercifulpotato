For example, I had 2 24&quot; external monitors (full-hd, not 4k), and a 13&quot; thinkpad (chromebook, booted into linux). Obviously, the respective DPI&#x27;s were way off.<p>Just a quick calculation in a repl, then called xrandr with the right scaling number, and presto, I had them exactly the same.<p>Then, with precise lining up of the displays, it was basically one seamless &quot;sheet of paper&quot;. If I had a long web page or pdf spanning the displays (the laptop was directly under the monitors), then scrolling through it was quite &quot;trippy&quot;.<p>I think because this was now a unified display where the bottom 1&#x2F;3 was tilted differently to the top 2&#x2F;3&#x27;rds (think of a curved ultrawide, but in portrait mode)<p>Honestly, it really was that simple.')
