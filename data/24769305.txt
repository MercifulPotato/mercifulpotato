And the opposite is just copying the behavior of Windows 95-2000 (XP would already group taskbar buttons by default although it still couldn&#x27;t &quot;pin&quot; them and required separate launcher buttons).<p>And, by the way, MacOS doesn&#x27;t group all the windows by default, some get a separate icon when launched (at least they did some years ago, I don&#x27;t know about the recent versions).<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t use MacOS because I don&#x27;t like MacOS, and the last thing I want is MacOS-like Linux.<p>Fortunately, there are many different WMs&#x2F;DEs on Linux and you don&#x27;t have to use KDE (or its default set-up) either. You can either tweak it, or choose a different WM&#x2F;DE or write your own (I would totally do so if I had more spare time).')
