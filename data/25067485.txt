I&#x27;m male, and replace my home server fans with blessedly quiet Noctuas, and the 24&#x2F;7 servers are usually passively-cooled Atoms, or running on repurposed OpenWrt SOHO routers.<p>BTW, although severs-at-home techies seem to be disproportionately male right now, maybe it doesn&#x27;t hurt to mention that servers are equal-opportunity.  For example, I know at least a few women with servers at home.  One even used to have one of the fridge-sized Cray supercomputers at home, just because.  Another one, when I saw a K8s-at-home post a few days ago, she was the first person who came to mind to send it to, since she&#x27;s the most enthusiastic, besides being a recognized technical expert on some related enterprise architecture.  It feels a bit silly to articulate examples, but seems that people (and kids, especially), subconsciously pick up on signals about what we are supposed to do, and those signals can be misleading.')
