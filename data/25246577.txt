What do they mean by &quot;3D engine implemented in DNA code&quot;?<p>&gt; Synthesize the oligonucleotides from the cube3d.dna file.<p>OK, so you get a long list of oligonucleotides ordered and shipped. Sounds prohibitively expensive, I guess this is a thought experiment or simulation exercise?<p>&gt; Arrange the test tubes as shown in the diagram below.<p>OK, Get a microplate with 384 wells (== test tubes).<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t forget to provide the initial concentrations according to the table below.<p>Dump an oligonucleotide solution into each well? According to what table? There is no &quot;table below&quot;. Which oligonucleotide in which well?<p>&gt; Use a pipette to encode the position (row and column) of each tube to start the computation.<p>A pipette is used to dispense fluid.
