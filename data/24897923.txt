That&#x27;s how far behind Canada is.<p>Wow, ok. I assumed it was the father since the ADA was discussed in congress back in the 80&#x27;s.<p>&gt; Not sure what you mean by &quot;killing the aerospace sector&quot;<p>Well, he went from writing a check to Lockheed to writing a check to Boeing.<p>But I&#x27;m talking about the Bombardier CSeries. It failed to get mainstream media coverage. It reached production and had healthy sales numbers. It was Bombardier&#x27;s second clean sheet design (after the Global) to reach market and had the potential to be stretched to seat counts comparable to smaller 737 and A319.<p>President Trump levied tariffs on it and that&#x27;s what prompted a takeover by Airbus (for 1$!). What did the Trudeau government do meanwhile to protect it -and by extension Canada&#x27;s aerospace sector? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s crazy how he basically bowed down immediately.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airwaysmag.com&#x2F;industry&#x2F;commerce-department-sides-boeing-cseries-tariff&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airwaysmag.com&#x2F;industry&#x2F;commerce-department-sides-bo...</a>')
