In practice, how you use this is you use a native API (Vulkan), give it your generated SPIR-V program, and it &quot;runs it&quot; using its own semantics. This is a combination of a userspace API talking to a kernel driver, and the kernel driver using a combination of IN&#x2F;OUT instructions (unlikely) and memory-mapped I&#x2F;O (much more likely) to talk to the GPU.<p>The actual details of the communication is documented by some IHVs, either through PDFs or source code. Normally, the CPU doesn&#x27;t wait for programs to complete, but instead, the GPU driver has a list of tasks to run (a &quot;command buffer&quot;) that it itself can schedule across many different pieces of hardware, and a combination of the driver and GPU itself determine scheduling, execution, and so on. Note that there&#x27;s still a lot of work for the driver to do, including managing the device&#x27;s memory (textures, buffers, so on), compiling any programs into machine language (similar to a JIT), and coordinating multiple different programs trying to use the GPU.')
