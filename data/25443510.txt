Google is a Processor under GDPR &amp; Service Provider under CCPA, meaning that the data &quot;belongs&quot; to the site owner and Google has no legal rights to use it for their own purposes.<p>BUT<p>A key feature of Google Analytics is integration with the rest of the Google ecosystem, including Google Ads (formerly AdWords) and Display &amp; Video (formerly DoubleClick). It is extremely easy to <i>connect</i> GA data with Google&#x27;s data. Configurations that give Google legal access to the data are easy and common. (If you remarket using GA, Google is not just a service provider.)<p>From a GDPR perspective using Google Analytics is still problematic because of Schrems II. <i>Any</i> data transfer to a US-controlled entity is troublesome, because the EU has declared that US does not adequately safeguard user data (the main sticking point is the lack of accountability of law enforcement &amp; intelligence agencies to request access to the data). But that&#x27;s about the US, not about Google specifically.')
