Probably too much for some older people too. I also agree that there are some horrible implications from this technology - even though I&#x27;m generally more techno-optimist, it&#x27;s harder when trying to think through how my children will interact with the internet.<p>One tip I&#x27;ve read regarding the spiel your daughter has heard from both parents and teachers, is that it&#x27;s also important to let your child know she can come to you if she does make a mistake in this regard. Apparently some predators will, if they can get naked pictures or something like it in the first place, use that as leverage to exploit the child further. It&#x27;s good to let your child know not to share naked pictures, but I think it also needs to be clear that if they do they can still get help from their parents.')
