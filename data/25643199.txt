I didn’t mean theories such as for example string theory, that has little predictive power at the moment, but has current theories as special cases and holds the promise of explaining things that current theories cannot. &#x2F;EDIT<p>Physicists are “stuck” with existing theories not because they like them, but because they work so well it’s hard to invent something that even works equally well (not to mention something that works better). There a lot of smart that are brave in thinking and propose wild explanations. Yet, in most cases they don’t stand up the test of time.<p>Einstein couldn’t deal with randomness of Quantum Mechanics, put forward a hidden variable theory and it was (and still is) seriously considered, but he (and many others) weren’t able to put forward better-working theory. We stick to QM despite its weirdness&#x2F;randomness because it works extremely well, not because we like it or think things must be this way and require no further study&#x2F;“it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model“.')
