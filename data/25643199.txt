There a lot of smart that are brave in thinking and propose wild explanations. Yet, in most cases they don’t stand up the test of time.<p>Einstein couldn’t deal with randomness of Quantum Mechanics, put forward a hidden variable theory and it was (and still is) seriously considered, but he (and many others) weren’t able to put forward better-working theory. We stick to QM despite its weirdness&#x2F;randomness because it works extremely well, not because we like it or think things must be this way and require no further study&#x2F;“it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model“.')
