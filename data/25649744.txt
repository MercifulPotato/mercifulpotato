Based on experience and a cursory google search, it seems like Shopify isn&#x27;t a great choice for SaaS products. On top of the website&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;payment&#x2F;analytics services Shopify provides, I&#x27;d love to get subscriptions, cohort analytics, API docs hosting, signup&#x2F;cancel webhooks, and an endpoint to query a customer&#x27;s subscription level.<p>I realize that I could bundle together a few services to get these features, but it would be nice if they were all in one place. Do you know of any products that could do this? Thanks!')
