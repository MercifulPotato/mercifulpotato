KA is even trying to fill this gap. They&#x27;ve added interactive visualizations for some topics.<p>I&#x27;d say the same is true for proofs. Simply reading a proof isn&#x27;t the best if you want to understand&#x2F;retain it. If you can &quot;re-invent&quot; the proof step by step (or in some contexts you might be able to translate steps between geometric and algebraic representations), then you have probably internalized it sufficiently.')
