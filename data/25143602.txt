I migrated it over time from createClass to classes to functional components, from JavaScript (w PropTypes) to Flow to TypeScript, from webpack to RCA, from flux to redux. I feel that in these comparisons what tends to be missing is what options each framework present when your code base reaches a size when the current structure becomes a burden. React fairly easily allowed gradual improvements, adding typing without needing a massive rewrite, codemods, RCA, etc.<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve looked at Vue, I can&#x27;t help but get the feeling that you&#x27;re likely stuck with what you started with. When I look at a Vue component vs it&#x27;s TypeScript equivalent, I can&#x27;t say I see a trivial upgrade path.')
