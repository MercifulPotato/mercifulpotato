So it&#x27;s not really an existential problem, because there is a quite reasonable option available for the club to avoid non-existence.<p>In which case, I think we&#x27;re back to this being more on the, if-not-reliatory, at least coercive side; the club owner is trying to coerce them to help him stay open as a strip club, but he could just as well be a different kind of club and stay open.')
