There were 22 different unique favicon&#x2F;icon requests, which I presume speaks to the wide variety of devices and operating systems out there. For example, the standard favicon.ico, but then also so many different variations of files like: apple-touch-icon-57x57.png, apple-touch-icon-114x114.png, touch-icon-iphone.png, apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png<p>- 3 different bot scripts kicking in.\n I noticed a ton of requests within a few hours that were scraping the site<p>Obviously the context around the submission is key to the stats and descriptions above (eg. time of day, period of week, what other submissions there were, how widely the submission appeals to the HN audience, etc), but I thought it may be useful to read a follow up on what a front-page position led to.<p>If anyone has any questions on other stats, let me know and Iâ€™ll do my best to get them.\nThanks for reading, and for the enjoyable (and panicky) Friday &amp; Saturday')
