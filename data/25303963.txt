Though I otherwise wanted to work at a couple of them.<p>After consulting levels.fyi, however, I&#x27;ve revised my opinion: if an employer is willing to pay a higher-level software engineer 2x the total comp they&#x27;d make most other places... whatever interview process they want suddenly becomes a rich and honored cultural tradition, to be treasured, and approached with the utmost reverence and humility. :)<p>That said, for people who&#x27;ve frittered away their discretionary time on things like open source, hobbies, family, etc., rather than drilling for FAANG interviews, the well-known &quot;test prep&quot; commitment for Leetcode-oriented companies is a barrier to even applying there.')
