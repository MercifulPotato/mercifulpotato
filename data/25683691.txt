Yet this isn&#x27;t going to have the same problem as gun control, for example, how easily can people obtain nuclear material?<p>And terrorists?  Sure, but an explosive truck is probably easier than one of these.  And if sales are controlled, then they won&#x27;t have a domestic army of them.<p>In terms of hacking?  100% agree.  It&#x27;s why I find Tesla&#x27;s OTA updates to be, frankly, insane.  Full control of things like brake firmware has been demonstrated, with an OTA fix to brakes in the past.<p>This means that, along with autonomous modes, you could perhaps manage to (especially with an inside man), force-push updates, regardless of driver permissions, to all Teslas out there.  And set them to run into everyone they find, just run over as many people as possible.<p>So there is tonnes of risk, and anyone thinking &quot;Oh, they&#x27;ll secure thing $x&quot; is, IMO, a damned fool.  Hack, after hack, after hack, after hack, proves this to be absurd.<p>We literally cannot lock down <i>anything</i>.  Anything.  Not CIA infrastructure, not any corporate infrastructure, not government infrastructure, not health care, <i>nothing</i>.<p>So I agree, 100%, robots with guns = horrid, just from that one angle.  But I contend that they are cheap, and effective, so you can bet governments will use them.<p>The link?<p>Your reference to chemical weapons.  I see the concern, yet I&#x27;m more concerned about genetically engineered death.  And training people from (for example) China on how to do this, seems beyond absurd.<p>The future is biotech created death I think.<p>Another example, genetically engineered animals, designed to kill as well.  How about mosquitoes, pre-loaded with viral payloads?  What about bacteria which infects well water, and is literally impossible to ever get rid of, once in the wild?  How about a fungus, which destroys wheat, which primarily the west eats, yet the east doesn&#x27;t (rice)?<p>How about gut flora&#x2F;fauna, which when fed (eg, when you eat), releases a mind altering substance?  A poor fellow was infected with yeast, which made him drunk every time he ate, so imagine a genetically engineered set of bacteria which releases a mild hallucinogenic?  One that makes it impossible to concentrate?<p>How will you cure this, if your scientists can&#x27;t think straight?  Or worse, what if it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac?  Let&#x27;s try to solve a problem, when you can&#x27;t keep your hands off of yourself.<p>I can think of so many endless horrors, and most of them biotech related.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;china-canada-universities-research-waterloo-military-technology-1.5723846" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;china-canada-universities-r...</a>')
