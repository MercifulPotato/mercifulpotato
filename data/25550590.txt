Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609072434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549983, text='&gt; Depends how long the cursor is alive.<p>The cursor is never invalidated. You can always get a valid response from any cursor, whether the resource exists or was already deleted. That&#x27;s the whole point of using a cursor.<p>Perhaps your confusion lies in assuming that a cursor&#x27;s life cycle is tied to a specific object. It isn&#x27;t. A cursor means &quot;get me whatever resources would immediately follow this resource&quot;. It matters nothing if the cursor exists or not. When you run the query, you will get exactly the resource which would follow the cursor. That&#x27;s by design.')
