Item(by='citizenpaul', descendants=None, kids=[25241300, 25240426], score=None, time=1606587011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238653, text='&gt;I&#x27;m not getting a knock off.<p>That is what has done it for me.  Amazon has zero control over their inventory.  I&#x27;ve gotten burned too many times at this point.  Amazon is now a last resort or obscure items only retailer for me. That or I use it to find an item then buy it from the manufacture direct, funny how that has reversed from the old days.<p>I&#x27;ve even gotten unrequested refunds from amazon with a note about how the product I got was counterfeit.  That&#x27;s great and all but I needed the actual product not a refund and waste of time.  Once you reach a livable income your time is worth much,more than saving a couple of dollars.')
