That&#x27;s compared to 95-97% in other developed countries because there are always some people who fall through cracks, like (say) a Canadian who doesn&#x27;t get a new provincial health care card after moving, or a German who neglects to buy into a new sickness fund after changing careers. The only such systems with actual 100% (or as close to it as possible) coverage is something like the UK NHS, which does not have a requirement to show a membership card (because, well, there isn&#x27;t one) to receive treatment.<p>PS - Obamacare did not greatly expand coverage. 85% of Americans had medical insurance pre-Obamacare.<p>There are things I&#x27;d certainly improve about the US system—decoupling primary healthcare coverage from employment, for one—but the way people online ~~lie~~ exaggerate it&#x27;s not surprising that so many non-Americans believe that every American is one hangnail away from bankruptcy.<p>&gt;People should not die or go bankrupt due to not having insurance.<p>Only 4% of US bankruptcies are because of medical bills (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;post-partisan&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;26&#x2F;the-truth-about-medical-bankruptcies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;post-partisan&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2018&#x2F;0...</a>). A tipoff that <i>[insert large percentage here]</i> of bankruptcies aren&#x27;t actually because of medical costs is that only 6% of bankruptcies by those without health insurance are because of that cause. The biggest cause of bankruptcies is lack of income, which health insurance doesn&#x27;t affect.')
