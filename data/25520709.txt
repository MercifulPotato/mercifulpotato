If they are someone we want we&#x27;ll generally beat their ask as well to get them where they should reasonably be. Then usually there are two years of substantial pay increases. My own experience, these tend to be great folks to have on team if you can give them 3 years of nice growth.<p>If they are too high I&#x27;m usually upfront that at that rate they&#x27;d be flat compensation wise for a number of years or that the amount is simply too high relative to skill for position and our needs.<p>It used to be market was so tight, that if you found a great person you could go 2x what the planned budget was. Not sure if all orgs have that flex so that makes it a bit unusual.')
