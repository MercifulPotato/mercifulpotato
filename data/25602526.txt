Whenever I join a company or new industry or make an investment or make a prediction, it does the exact opposite of what I anticipated because of some insane global event that has nothing to do with me.<p>For example, I was working in a bootstrapped tech startup in online education industry which was delivering real value (really great product). But didn&#x27;t really go anywhere... Then I learned that the lack of success in the education sector is probably because the entire global monetary system is a scam and so, unlike in the last thousands of years, real economic value stopped mattering as soon as I entered the workforce (what are the odds of that!?).<p>So I learned from this and got into an extremely hyped-up blockchain project, then right after I joined, the CEO decided to cut back on marketing and focus on development, price crashed... (what are the odds?)<p>So I quit and started a crypto project related to travel industry, COVID19 happens... ITO fails... WTF???<p>Seriously, the government should just give me free money. I don&#x27;t care about pride or self-fulfillment or whatever nonsense emotion some completely useless job is supposed to bring to my shitty life. Just give me free money so that I don&#x27;t have to deal with any of this shit. I don&#x27;t need any fancy bling, I just want unlimited time off from having to deal with our insane economy.\nToo bad I can&#x27;t charge companies to NOT invest in them and to stay away from their employees.')
