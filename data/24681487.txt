Item(by='aw1621107', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601838530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679294, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t agricultural irrigation the largest source of groundwater depletion in places where it&#x27;s an issue?<p>&gt; I believe basically all water here in Iowa is pulled from groundwater wells. I&#x27;ve never heard of it being something anyone was worried, but we also don&#x27;t irrigate fields like they do in the Western states.<p>Those are good points; I should have qualified my comment with &quot;depending on location and local groundwater conditions&quot;. Evidently wells do work for at least some urban areas, but whether it&#x27;s a viable option for all, I don&#x27;t know.')
