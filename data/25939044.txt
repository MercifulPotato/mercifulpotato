That goes for black people, LGBT people, women, Asians, Jews, heck even white people often refer to themselves or another white person they are close with using a slur. There is actually evidence that people who refer to one another using slurs that would otherwise be offensive do so to strengthen social bonds with each other and there&#x27;s some interesting game theory for why this is the case.<p>It&#x27;s also quite common among comedians and other entertainers to make fun of their own ethnicity using slurs or use slurs in various performances.<p>You personally may not find it appropriate and that&#x27;s a subjective point of view that you are entitled to have, but consider whether you have a good rational justification for it or whether you are exercising too much caution to the point that you are getting offended on behalf of others even when those others are not themselves offended.')
