Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25746801], score=None, time=1610454631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745831, text='&gt; This is just pure speculation.<p>It is the pigeonhole principle. The M2 has gone up by ~25% [0] and population has gone up by about 0.6%. At a given moment someone must control around 25% more dollars, and probably more assuming a quite dis-equal distribution of the new money. Unless the US is bailing out foreigners, I suppose. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a winning strategy if they want to drive up monetary velocity though.<p>Probably shareholders are the winners here, if I were going to speculate. It is a bit silly and it doesn&#x27;t help anyone.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;M2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;M2</a>')
