If someone used that term here in the same way that WSB people do, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;d both wish that dang would remove that post and ban the poster for a bit to cool off.<p>This doesn&#x27;t address the larger question of whether or not we have a right to enforce our completely subjective standards <i>globally</i> on other communities which we don&#x27;t belong to. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t want some outsider deciding that me and my friends weren&#x27;t allowed to talk to eachother anymore if we decided to start using the term towards each other privately in jest.')
