I am happy using Gmail for now, I just want my own copy of all of my emails that I can search and read - offline if necessary.<p>I tried to use Nextcloud&#x27;s email app to backup my gmail, but after sending it up I realized that it is just an alternate interface to access email on Google&#x27;s server, not a proper backup solution. (It only supports IMAP, not POP3.)<p>If I can&#x27;t find a better solution, I may just set up Thunderbird and put it and POP3 mode, but I&#x27;d really prefer something that could sit on a server and run automatically without me having to touch it.<p>(For what it&#x27;s worth, I ended up keeping my Nextcloud server set up because I found that I really like the notes app. I also have it doing a daily backup of my contacts from my phone and it&#x27;s replaced Dropbox for small file storage. I already had my photos backing up to a Plex instance on the same server, or else I would probably be using the photo backup feature as well. )')
