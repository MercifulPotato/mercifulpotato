They generally aren&#x27;t just subjective preferences. My thoughts on the first few:<p><i>Lowercase preprocessor constants.</i> Doing this contradicts an established convention in C and C++, even used by the standard libraries. You simply shouldn&#x27;t deviate from this convention, all you will do is introduce confusion. It&#x27;s hard to think of a good reason to ever do this.<p><i>Preprocessor over scopes.</i> This generally confuses and complicates things, but makes sense in rare circumstances. <i>BOOST_SCOPE_EXIT</i> does something like this, for instance.<p><i>Including source files</i> (from a header file). Yep, that&#x27;s a bad idea. I don&#x27;t see why template specializations would be an exception.<p><i>Unnamed #if 0 branches.</i> This doesn&#x27;t strike me as obviously terrible. Using meaningful indentation would help here. Introducing a macro constant strikes me as introducing a new kind of complexity, given that the goal is just to comment out code. If the goal isn&#x27;t to just comment out code, but to do &#x27;conditional compilation&#x27;, then that&#x27;s different.<p><i>Standalone header files.</i> Yes, a header file should include all the other headers it needs. Doing otherwise is sloppy, and no-one will thank you for wasting their time having to fix your headers.')
