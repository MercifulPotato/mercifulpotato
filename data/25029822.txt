While I do think in this case Biden should use it to reverse what Trump did with it, I&#x27;d feel better if most of this extra-congressional stuff wasn&#x27;t possible at all. Beyond obviously just giving one person too much power - which can be abused for personal gain (as we&#x27;ve seen) - it really amplifies the policy-churn you get each time the administration changes. And both parties share responsibility for the steady escalation we&#x27;ve seen.')
