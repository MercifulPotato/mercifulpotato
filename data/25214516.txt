Or if it&#x27;s a site I <i>need</i> to use, then I&#x27;ll try again later and see if I either get let in without being asked to jump through hoops, or get a reCaptcha Buster can solve.<p>I simply refuse to waste my time and drive up my blood pressure by doing unpaid training work for Google&#x27;s AI, in order to visit some crappy website. I really wish more people would start boycotting any site which uses reCaptcha [or its derivatives], so we could get rid of this blight on the internet.<p>I&#x27;ve spotted this new hCaptcha junk show up recently on a couple of  sites I used to frequent. I don&#x27;t visit those sites any more. So well done webmasters.  Apparently annoying the shit out of visitors to your site tends to drive them away. Who&#x27;da thunk it?!')
