I am very proud of the fact that none of my designs needed to be modified once the metal was cut, and it all passed test and certification without any problems.<p>Software development, on the other hand, lends itself very well to iterative development. You don&#x27;t have problems like sinking a new forging die costing half a million bucks, so  work really diligently to not need to scrap a die. Keep making mistakes like that, and Boeing will move you to a position where you get to design ash trays.<p>D is very much an iteratively developed product.')
