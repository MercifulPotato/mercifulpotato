One of the original complaints in the thread was about government-provided healthcare and education. Government schools &amp; hospitals exist, but they aren&#x27;t exactly known for their quality apart from a few niche ones like IITs, IIMs, AIIMs. So is the issue that lack of funding is preventing these public services from being effective?
