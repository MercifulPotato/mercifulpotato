Item(by='gwillen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601781670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674183, text='Regarding problem 2: It&#x27;s hard to know what exactly you&#x27;re seeing, but be aware that the output of &quot;git log&quot; is only pretending to be linear; it&#x27;s really a tree&#x2F;graph. (&quot;git log --graph&quot; can help, but the output can also be annoying to parse.) So when you see multiple copies of a commit &quot;in a row&quot;, chances are that they are really present on different branches which were later merged. If they have the same commit ID, I would probably call this just a display quirk -- there&#x27;s really only one &quot;copy&quot; in truth, but for some reason the history is confusing &quot;git log&quot;. But if they have different commit IDs, that means (as far as I know) that someone has done a &quot;git rebase&quot; or a &quot;git cherry-pick&quot;, which you didn&#x27;t mention in your description.')
