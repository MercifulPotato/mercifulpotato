Item(by='boogies', descendants=None, kids=[25308255, 25308138], score=None, time=1607116293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307290, text='I believe governments can and do outlaw using mobile phones or taking hands off the wheel while driving. 24 hour shifts at the hospital may be justified AFAIK by potentially saving more lives than they risk losing — I would hope there are precautions in place to minimize those risks (such as housing immediately adjacent to the hospital — IIRC this was the case for Ben Carson when he worked long shifts at Johns Hopkins). Similarly, I’m not opposed to medical marijuana use, which I think may alleviate more pain and suffering than it causes — but I don’t think the same is true for recreational use, I think that may trade human lives for shallow fleeting pleasure, and cannot be practically risk-mitigated by outlawing exclusively before driving, only completely or not all, for the testing reasons I mentioned in my first post.')
