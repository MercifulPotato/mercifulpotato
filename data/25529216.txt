I got an M1 air, even though I normally don&#x27;t jump on 1st gen products, partly out of COVID boredom I suppose.  I thought I would use it along side my 2017 15&quot; MBP at least until things caught up on the software side, but I have barely touched the pro since I got it.  The screen is smaller, and the speakers are not quite as good, but it&#x27;s so snappy, light and quiet that it more than makes up for it.<p>There are still some rough edges: for serious development a lot of things are not quite there yet: e.g. last time I checked, there&#x27;s no native release for NodeJS, and home-brew is still hit-or-miss.  A lot of things work with Rosetta, but it surely takes more tweaking and trial and error to get things running than normal.  But I&#x27;ve been programming mostly in Rust lately, and that works flawlessly on nightly, so I haven&#x27;t really thought about compatibility since I was kicking the tires the second day I had it.  YMMV depending on which tools you use.<p>All in all, I think this is the most I have really had fun using a laptop since I got my first MBA in 2012 or so.  It was so light to travel with, and powerful enough for everything I needed, so it pretty quickly replaced my other laptop for pretty much everything.')
