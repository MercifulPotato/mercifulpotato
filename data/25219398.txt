Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606393793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219351, text='&gt;&gt;but if I had a choice of going to a UK hospital for free, or paying a grand to know my daughter will be perfectly cared for<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s a binary choice, either free care of good care. My own experience with the NHS has been stellar, the standard of care I have received(and still receive) is incredible. Everyone is very friendly and I get all my meds and treatment for free. My father has fought cancer for 9 years, during that time he had multiple operations and years of Glivec supplied to him free of charge, the only complaint he&#x27;s ever had was that they would only reimburse him for 2nd class train ticket when going to the hospital for an operation, even though driving was more expensive.<p>But the thing is - if I or him ever wanted to(for some reason) to go private, that&#x27;s still an option. Private insurance with private doctors and hospitals is also available. In US you don&#x27;t really have any option other than going private.')
