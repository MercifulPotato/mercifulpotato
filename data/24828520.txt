It shows you have &quot;something&quot; and it also shows that you are the &quot;owner&quot; of the idea.<p>I did one preliminary software patent application and I also found that it greatly helped me focus and &quot;crystallize&quot; what is the big idea here.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like writing documentation but focusing on the core ideas. A patent should not only disclose the technical details of how it works but also explain why it is useful, why it is better than existing approaches.<p>That is a good way to evaluate the worthiness of the project. Why this, over software that already exist. A project is often useful even if it is not patentable. But writing or even thinking about writing a preliminary patent-application helps put it in context.')
