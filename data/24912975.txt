This needs to be as close to the cores&#x2F;cache as possible, a good order of magnitude faster than we run our present networking stuff, and probably an area where there will be a significant pace of development ie a software defined solution would be nice.<p>So, a software defined north bridge, in essence. And an FPGA is pretty much the only thing we have right now that could do the job.')
