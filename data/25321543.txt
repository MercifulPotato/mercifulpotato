Item(by='SulphurCrested', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607235376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319539, text='I ran across this paper on the subject a couple of months ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigcis.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;Goodwin_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigcis.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;Goodwin_paper.pdf</a><p>As you&#x27;d expect for the failure of such a large company, it wasn&#x27;t just one thing that went wrong. Among the reasons were: a too-rapid expansion into the commercial area, leading to huge redundancy costs when that had to be scaled back; management flailing about with competing projects; failures to exploit the PC and Unix markets; and selling off profitable arms to finance unprofitable ones.<p>As an example of the flailing, they cancelled their PRISM project for a new RISC architecture and OS (the immediate result of which was Cutler and others leaving for Microsoft), yet developed RISC later with Alpha. But they&#x27;d also been doing that kind of thing through the successful years. The last PDP-10 was cancelled when there was still a market for them, to the extent that two other companies made money by supplying PDP-10â€“compatibles that DEC wouldn&#x27;t. I recall a DECUS conference from around the VMS 4.0 era in which we were told the cluster lock manager + RDB was going to eventually replace the FILES-11 file system; the lock manager was delivered, but RDB eventually sold off.<p>One anecdote from the linked paper is particularly sad. John Sculley, of Apple, met with Olsen in 1991 to talk about using Alpha in Macs, when those were still 68k-based. But Olsen wanted to concentrate on VAX and wouldn&#x27;t do it, so Apple went with PowerPC instead. The anecdote is referenced as being in an email from Sculley to the paper&#x27;s author.')
