I would not wish it on anyone. It will seem fine (and actually it will seem better - faster and easier to manage) while your project is small.<p>In a few years when you need to make some major changes you will see why it was a bad idea, and it will be too late. Have fun modifying hundreds or thousands of sprocs when you need to make a large-scale change to the structure of your data, because SQL won&#x27;t compose. Have fun modifying dozens of sprocs for each change in business logic, because SQL won&#x27;t compose. I guarantee you will have mountains of duplicated code because SQL won&#x27;t compose.')
