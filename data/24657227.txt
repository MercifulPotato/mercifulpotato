A documentary has less control over what happens in front of the camera, but the whole workflow behind the camera is still completely under the directors&#x27; control.<p>With regards to Van Gogh, seeing how he likes to make his paintings three dimensional (if you ever had a chance to see his paintings in person) in additional to his sculptural works, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he became a 3D graphics or VR artist had he lived in modern times.')
