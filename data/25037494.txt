Also, the risk of corruption remains for decades as you have a huge pot of money which many are fighting to get a piece of with little transparency.<p>No one actually considers the figures put out by IL&#x2F;NJ&#x2F;CT&#x2F;Chicago and other distressed governments as accurate, and if they had to abide by the rules that non taxpayer funded entities have to, their debt would easily be 30%+ higher than stated (based on an assumption of a 1% change in discount rate moving liabilities ~15%).<p>I agree that politicians can also hide debt by not properly accounting for infrastructure and long term maintenance costs, and that is also a big problem.')
