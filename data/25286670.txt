Easy to notice.<p>In the Pentium it didn&#x27;t run in the blink of an eye.<p>This way of benchmarking performance, with human wall clock time, makes performance problems add up: They add up faster, the faster your development machine is.<p>I guess a good benchmarck would be number of cycles run; but if the software runs fast enough it&#x27;s hard to justify working more time on it unless there a business need to do it faster (like you&#x27;re billed by milisecond, by intruction run like in a blockchain, or it is part of the core layer of your product and performance matters to capture market share).')
