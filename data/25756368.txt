Item(by='cocktailpeanuts', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610498818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25756040, text='&gt; unexpectedly to me suddenly puts the Hyper protocol&#x27;s ecosystem possibly ahead of IPFS in user-friendliness and fun-factor at this moment<p>Actually it&#x27;s been ahead of the IPFS community for a long time even when IPFS was all the hype. IPFS kind of stopped meaningful developments when they started doing ICO and focused on Filecoin. I know the founders of the DAT community have been very skeptical of ICOs and instead quietly focused on actually building the system and the community. Also the fact that this exists without any money incentive by default makes it a superior decentralized technology IMO.')
