Remember how everyone says that C is fast because undefined behavior means that C does not have to encode the semantics of a particular architecture to be fast and therefore is the fastest on every architecture. Things like bitshifting have subtle differences between architectures and therefore have to be undefined behavior to be fast everywhere.<p>In Javascript it&#x27;s the opposite. It cannot have any undefined behavior because it is untrusted code that has to be executed inside a sandbox and not infect the user&#x27;s computer. But people wanted Javascript to be faster so they simply took the behavior of the fastest and most common architecture that Javascript was used on and just put them into the Javascript specs. That architecture was x86 and to our surprise: ARM is not x86. This means if you want fast Javascript on ARM, it has to adopt x86 rounding semantics. Compared to the unbounded costs of undefined behavior it&#x27;s a microscopic price to pay.')
