Old people who would otherwise have died from another reason could die from Covid19 instead.<p>Or imagine testing everybody for the common cold, and if somebody dies with the common cold virus, they would be counted as a &quot;common cold death&quot;. Then you would see a lot of deaths &quot;from the common cold&quot;, without any actual change in death rates.')
