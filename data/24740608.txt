It helps to clarify the problem.  Searle makes two conclusions. 1) computers have no understanding of meaning or semantics and 2) human minds are not computational information processing systems.<p>Most modern criticism of these two conclusions point out that Seale&#x27;s argument relies on strong intuition about what understanding and meaning means and he can&#x27;t clarify them satisfactorily.<p>Chinese room being conscious is counter-intuitive. Today most philosophers of consciousness are more aware how easy it is to make &#x27;slips in reasoning&#x27; when dealing with the counter-intuitiveness of the consciousness arguments.')
