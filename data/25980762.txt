But I feel like this particular article&#x2F;research may need to be performed in a more multivariate manner to be truly useful, although it does highlight the directions these explorations might take.<p>For example, consider this:<p>&gt; Studies in the Netherlands and Sweden which look at vocational-education reforms that increased the general content in the vocational track find no benefits of additional general content on labour-market outcomes (Oosterbeek and Webbink 2007, Hall 2016).<p>OK, so if general content doesn’t add value to labour-market outcomes what can we say about the general content requirements that permeate about universities? They too are likely not useful.<p>But to discuss university education more precisely we would need to break it down from monolithic characterizations like “here are the university outcomes” to a per-degree basis. For example, is it that general education is valuable or simply that university degrees like computer science are valuable despite the deadweight of general education requirements?<p>Another point that needs dedicated exploration:<p>&gt; In Norway, Bertrand et al. (2019) find that a similar reform also increased selection into the vocational track and thereby led to improved earnings for those induced into vocational education.<p>This makes sense - you try to make the vocational education more comprehensive or challenging, and you end up getting a more selective stream of students who would be more successful no matter how they were educated or certified. So isn’t that also true of universities? They’re simply the beneficiaries of a competitive system that gives them access to the highest performers, which then makes it look like a university education has value when it is really just the result of a selection advantage.')
