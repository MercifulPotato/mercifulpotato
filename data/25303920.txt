But it doesn&#x27;t make sense to penalize the 99% of employees who are responsible and honest.<p>this just sounds like a shitty situation all around. it really sucks to suspect someone &#x2F; be suspected of something that can&#x27;t be conclusively proven one way or the other. if you can be fired for being sick too often at convenient times, you don&#x27;t really have unlimited sick leave in practice.')
