Taking advantage of human psychology to manipulate people has been a problem in the field for a long time (e.g. gambling machines, advertising, dark patterns, screen addiction) so IMO it&#x27;s a bit irresponsible not to at least warn students that they&#x27;re likely going to be asked to do some morally questionable things.')
