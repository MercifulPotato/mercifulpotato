And #2 is too shaming. We&#x27;ve found over the years that <i>under</i>punishing people (relative to what they expect) is more effective. There&#x27;s a nice user report about that somewhere in the current thread. (edit: actually several now, which is pretty cool)<p>#3 I think is a good suggestion though. We should have some means whereby users can exalt something good, not just flag something bad. The challenge is to make it different enough from the upvoting system so it didn&#x27;t just turn into a variation of the same mechanism.')
