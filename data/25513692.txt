I think I&#x27;ve heard something to this effect elsewhere. Why is that?  Wouldn&#x27;t a tertiary digit (0, 1, 2) be more efficient? An a quaternary digit (0, 1, 2, 3) be even more so? At some point noise would make it difficult to distinguish between the states, but I would think that it would be most efficient to use a digit that has a certain number of states with relationship to the noise floor. (More noise, fewer digits; in the case of no noise, analog would be most efficient. Although I guess by this argument, no noise would imply infinite capacity, which either means that there&#x27;s a problem with my argument or it is a reason why noise must exist) Am I missing something?')
