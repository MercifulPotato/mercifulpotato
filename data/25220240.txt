How would you teach different feelings and emotions?<p>I find one of the fundamental ones is pain. It&#x27;s not an emotion, but it&#x27;s not that easy to classify what is actually painful and what isn&#x27;t. Holding a phone in my hand isn&#x27;t painful, but at some point I managed to do it so much that it did become painful. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the pain, but I know that I am apprehensive of holding a phone in my hand for extended periods of time.<p>Another one is stress. People might not know they are stressed, but they are. They just can&#x27;t recognize what stress is.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that a lot of things aren&#x27;t taught explicitly. We don&#x27;t even know how to teach some of that, because we don&#x27;t have a good classification system for the feeling&#x2F;emotion.')
