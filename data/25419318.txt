My anecdotal napkin math would say like 10% of buildings are designed with proper ventilation, blending of outdoor&#x2F;indoor air, etc... and the rest are just boxes that are slowly killing us.</i><p>First off, you do not want buildings to &quot;breathe&quot; through air leakage. It is desirable for a &#x27;seal tight and vent right&#x27;:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CIcrXut_EFA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CIcrXut_EFA</a><p>There are standards for the amount buildings should exchange the air, e.g., ANSI&#x2F;ASHRAE Standard 62.1:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_changes_per_hour" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_changes_per_hour</a><p>Also, air temperature is only one component of feeling comfortable in a room. How warm&#x2F;cool the walls are, and having good double- (or triple-) pane windows also contributes:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mean_radiant_temperature" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mean_radiant_temperature</a><p>While you no doubt have insulation in your external wall cavities, the wooden stud has a very low value (R-1&#x2F;inch) and so introduces thermal bridging:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greenbuildingadvisor.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;what-is-thermal-bridging" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greenbuildingadvisor.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;what-is-thermal...</a><p>Modern building codes in colder climate zones mandate a layer of exterior insulation to deal with this bridging.<p>&gt; <i>I try to keep my CO2 ppm below 800 foor good measure.
