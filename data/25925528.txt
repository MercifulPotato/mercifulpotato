Shuffle the list of participants.<p>2. Put the front half of the list into one half of the trial, and the back half of the list into the other half.<p>Generalizing this to more than two groups is straightforward. This algorithm is mentioned sidethread, by sterlind, with the (meaningless) modification of splitting the list even-and-odd instead of front-and-back. As I mentioned there, you can only do this if the list of participants is fixed before the beginning of the study, which is not in general the case.')
