And that window manager is terrible and slow. I can&#x27;t even alt-tab between windows. The old &quot;Visual SmallTalk Enterprise 3.1&quot; from 95 leverages all window handling to the OS and is quick and snappy. It also has a native look if that is your thing. This contributes a lot to the developer experience: shortcuts and code completion are quick and snappy, you can easily deal with the separate windows, etc. In Pharo everything is so slow compared to this and not very developer friendly. Maybe someone can show me what I have been doing wrong but this is my main gist.')
