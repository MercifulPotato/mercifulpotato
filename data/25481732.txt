I came home to discover the neighbor was fabricating furniture in his backyard (both of our houses have a large backyard). He would work until midnight sometimes, with no acoustic treatment on his improvised factory. I went by his house and talk to him. Explained that I was also working at home and the noise was too much. Long story short, I had to call city hall to resolve the situation. This is the same ahole I mentioned.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty reasonable guy. I can put myself in others shoes. But when I notice that people don&#x27;t retribute, I tend to act.
