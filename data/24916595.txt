Judging by posts on HN, I 100% agree. But judging by the number of users and the amount of verified mathematics and code, I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>Maybe things have changed recently, but I believe that systems based on simple type theory (HOL and Isabelle) and systems based on set theory (Mizar, Metamath) have much larger repositories of verified mathematics and verified programs than those based on dependent type theories.')
