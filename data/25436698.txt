The scope of knowledge one gets from &quot;few years EE&quot; in America would count for just few percents of expertise needed to run manufacturing commercially.<p>Just one thing that I think sinks half of them: near zero supply chain expertise. I&#x27;d say you absolutely cannot do any manufacturing in serious commercial volumes without at least 10 engineers hired just to do supply chain management full time.<p>If you are small manufacturer, or OEM, hunting for parts, and components, studying, and testing them, spamming Alibaba, and spending time on the phone with suppliers would be easily taking more than a half of your engineering manpower.')
