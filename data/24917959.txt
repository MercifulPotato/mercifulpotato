Think of how many times the plays of Shakespeare have been remade and reinterpreted. His works represent a share heritage that generations of artists have freely borrowed from.<p>And Shakespeare did the same thing! Hamlet is based on a 13th century legend of Amleth. Should a high school production of Hamlet in 2022 be required to pay royalties to the 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus?<p>&gt; Markets don&#x27;t always work, but here&#x27;s a place where they&#x27;ve worked exceptionally well.<p>I agree but I don&#x27;t see why a reasonable fixed term, such as 25 years, wouldn&#x27;t work as well and allow the cultural well to refill. Think of how liberating it would be to be able to, for example, freely sample music from 1993 or earlier. And every year we all get more!')
