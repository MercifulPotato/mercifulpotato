You put $140 at least 6 month in a new cryptocurrency deposit. In exchange, you get paid every tuesday during this time, you also get sent a red visa card and a premium Spotify account (you never have to pirate again!). Plus, if you&#x27;re referred, you and your referrer will get $25 dollars free.<p>Now, when I asked where did that money come from, the guy on Twitch told me &quot;it&#x27;s like a bank, the money comes from you&quot;. The difference here is, of course, this gives you much, much higher returns than a bank while a bank can actually invest your money, and this &quot;entity&quot; cannot. Also the interface of some of these &quot;investment&quot; agencies look like a game, I guess to be more attractive [1].<p>In the end, the idea is always the same: crypto will only go up. So far that&#x27;s been the case, though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EjI5hTcU0AAnUO0.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EjI5hTcU0AAnUO0.png</a>')
