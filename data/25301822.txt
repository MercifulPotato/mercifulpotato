There are dragons in it. There is magic in it. There are mystical people and what appears to be spirits and ghosts and witches.<p>People get badly wounded and yet no one dies of a bacterial infection. There are buildings constructed in ways that our physics wouldnâ€™t support with the assumed materials and tolerances of the assumed period.<p>There are undead - in fact they are introduced in the prologue of the first book. There is a massive ice wall made by humans in an area that is, as described in the books in permanent winter but yet inhabited by people. And giants. And a few days ride to places that have warm summers. And oh yeah, the seasons last years instead of months and are irregular and unpredictable in length.<p>But yes, the lands the fictional Dothraki people roamed in should be similar to our grasslands in terms of climate and appropriate garb.')
