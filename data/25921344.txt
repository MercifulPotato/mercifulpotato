It&#x27;s the low skill jobs that are disappearing. Most dating apps are garbage because they are basically a competitive esports game except with the pretense that they are there to help you. They are not the real world. Don&#x27;t fall for that garbage.<p>Women can&#x27;t vet men over the internet so it basically boils down to how good you look in a picture.<p>&gt;My dad was able to go to a steel mill and make huge amounts of money plus overtime and insanely good benefits. Housing was extremely affordable.<p>It&#x27;s because inflation was still doing okay back then. Inflation eats away at capital unless it is invested productively and by productively I mean primarily by gainfully employing people and providing value.<p>For the average worker that is very good because they do not have much savings and even if they did their savings grow much slower than the savings of the rich. Once everyone is employed the cat and mouse game begins. Workers can go for the best paying employer and that drives their salaries upwards. Higher salaries reduce the relative value of assets because you have to pay people more for the same work but the value of your assets does not increase fast enough to catch up.<p>With deflation you don&#x27;t have to do anything to increase the value of your assets. You just wait and watch wealth inequality grow.<p>A quick solution is to simply increase capital gains taxes and reduce dividends taxes. Deflation gains will be taxed more. Productive income will be taxed less.')
