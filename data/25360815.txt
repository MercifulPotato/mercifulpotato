But I don&#x27;t believe that it should trap people in debt situations that then hamstring their ability to use that education in a creative, and entrepreneurial way.<p>We have to move everybody that is stuck now past the sticking point, and then, as you pointed out, find ways to eliminate people from getting stuck in the first place.<p>I kept it cheap by going to community college and transferring to a state school. Let&#x27;s get that more normalized because I paid the same amount for my first two years of college what I then paid for <i>one quarter</i> at the university.<p>There are better ways of doing things, and there are institutions in place to facilitate a better way. We just have to move past this and tweak the system a bit.')
