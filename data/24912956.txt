Based on this study, we can learn Vitamin D seems to be involved, and there is an obvious causal mechanism that one can hypothesize might exist, even if not proven. Even if there’s only a 10% chance that vitamin D supplementation could be helpful, knowing it as a possibility could be useful to many, and justify action even if uncertain about the causality.')
