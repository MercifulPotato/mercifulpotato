Ditto tiling GPUs and the few other things I&#x27;ve seen called out.<p>Heck the XBox 360 used UMA[1] and the PS3 didn&#x27;t[2]. It really didn&#x27;t play into the systems performance directly(other than you might do some crazy tricks like store audio data in VRAM and stream it back). With UMA you can get into cases where heavy CPU reads can impact other parts of the system because the memory controller is shared.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Xbox_360_technical_specifications#Memory_and_system_bandwidth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Xbox_360_technical_specificati...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PlayStation_3_technical_specifications#Central_processing_unit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PlayStation_3_technical_specif...</a>')
