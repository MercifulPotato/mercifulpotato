There&#x27;s strong, partisan resistance to the idea of the government &quot;supporting people.&quot;  Lockdowns are in fact destructive without significant simultaneous individual-level welfare, but if that kind of welfare is offensive and unthinkable to you, then lockdowns will just seem like needless economic destruction that needs to be fraught tooth and nail.
