This is becoming problematic! Can RL save the day?<p>Our goal is to foster research in RL around this problem, and to establish a benchmark showing the progress of RL against other (currently better!) methods.<p>We are hoping for an “AlphaGo moment”, where reinforcement learning will take over. Planning train schedules actually has many similarities with the game of Go!<p>We provide strong baselines and &quot;getting started&quot; guides to help you hit the ground running, even if you&#x27;re just starting with RL. For example you can run this Colab notebook to train a DQN policy that you can then submit straight to the leaderboard: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatland.aicrowd.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;rl.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatland.aicrowd.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;rl.html</a>')
