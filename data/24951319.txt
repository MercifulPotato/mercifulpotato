They&#x27;ve been in peace for 40 years now because of Turkish intervention. Cyprus war ended 46 years ago.<p>&quot;in peace&quot; about as much as the Korean peninsula is at peace. Turkey is <i>illegally</i> occupying Northern Cyprus, and that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not at war with the actual Cyprus, but you can&#x27;t pretend everything is even remotely fine.<p>Turks were brutally removed from most of the lands they brutally installed and settled themselves on. Population exchanges like after the Greco-Turkish war should have been done with all neighbors to avoid such nastiness in the future.')
