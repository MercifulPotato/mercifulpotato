Some teachers are better at adding value for less intelligent pupils, some better at pushing the more gifted, some best for the hardworking, some best for the ill-motivated ... take your pick. It can even come down to relatively inane factors like one teacher&#x27;s diction being too difficult for some to follow but fine for others.<p>Re your 2nd question: bus factor. And the same answer as the first - that you can have different definitions of best depending on the pupil.')
