Be it metalwork, mountain biking, computing, drones or any other hobby regularly discussed online.<p>The reality is you can make do with in so many different ways that if you can&#x27;t afford the best you can still have oodles of fun on cheaper equipment. Half the fun is learning all this &quot;expertise&quot; the internet has on your own.<p>Can&#x27;t afford a Bridgeport mill? Buy something cheaper and work around the edge cases. Can&#x27;t afford a full suspension bike? Get a hardtail and have tonnes of fun.<p>Someone is always quick to add in the caveats, but guess what, a new rider doesn&#x27;t give a shit that he can&#x27;t send 8ft drops on his hard tail. There are hours of fun on the bike ahead, none of it sending 8ft drops. The new hobby machinist isn&#x27;t bothered that they can&#x27;t mill titanium, they are just stoked to be getting started.')
