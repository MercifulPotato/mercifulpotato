The same can&#x27;t be said for stocks, real estate, or anything else available on equity markets. Couple that with the fact that bitcoin has no &#x27;intrinsic value&#x27; and therefore isn&#x27;t capped at the top or bottom, and you&#x27;ve got an asset that:<p>1) May survive inflation intact.\n2) Cannot really be overpriced (or underpriced) since it is not tied to anything except itself.<p>This makes for a pretty juicy opportunity for those who don&#x27;t want to invest in assets the fed has been propping up. Of course there are downsides. The lack of intrinsic value means there is no real price cap at the top... or the bottom. Hence volatility. It can also simply be banned from being purchased with fiat currency.')
