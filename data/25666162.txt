That will depend on more than just R0 - we still don&#x27;t know if the vaccines (any of them) prevent transference, and the emergence of new variants with higher R0 values but identical infection mechanisms (which most people would agree is the same virus) may also complicate this quite a bit.<p>So sure, maybe I should have dialed it back to &quot;it&#x27;s entirely possible that the entire human race will be exposed to SARS-COV-2, though if we are lucky that probably won&#x27;t happen&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think that changes my fundamental point that the crisis for a pandemic like this is not in personal health - &quot;Am I going to die?&quot; - but in the public health - &quot;can my society&#x27;s health care systems still function?&quot;')
