It&#x27;s just illegal to share them.<p>So how was I infringing copyright by downloading something from a public website where copyright holder left the content publicly accessible to anyone?<p>I&#x27;ll give you that it may or may not be against ToS of the distribution service, but that&#x27;s all. But it&#x27;s not a distribution service causing the ruckus around youtube-dl, but the copyright holder, so that&#x27;s kinda beside the point.')
