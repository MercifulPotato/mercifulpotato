I joined Mozilla just after Eich had left, but had I been there at the time I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to work for him. I wouldn&#x27;t want the proceeds of my work to earn him money, allowing him to donate money seeking to reduce LGBT rights.<p>If enough of his employees feel the same way, and there is enough negative press from others (who are also just democratically expressing their opinions), then clearly his position as CEO was untenable.<p>To equate that to destroying someone&#x27;s livelihood based on their political beliefs is exactly the sort of mental gymnastics which keeps me coming back to this site.')
