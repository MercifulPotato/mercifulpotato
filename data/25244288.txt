In practice, I have to thank my parents for supporting me until I was in my 30s. Otherwise, I would have had to get a job - I still got part-time jobs, but I&#x27;m not sure I would have gotten my degree if I had had to work full time.<p>2 - See 1.<p>3 - I saved from my part-time jobs enough for the one-way flight plus 3 months, which I spent almost entirely in my first month (I didn&#x27;t account for the 3 months rent deposit). My parents helped me until my PhD student paperwork was done, at which point I made enough to sustain myself.<p>4. I think you are reading mmaunder&#x27;s comment as &quot;the US is the best country in the world&quot;, which is not the case (that would be, I don&#x27;t know, Sweden maybe?). What they are arguing, instead, is that being &quot;okay&quot; in the US is miles ahead of being &quot;okay&quot; in half the world. Could the US do better? Sure, for all the reasons that you mention (plus medical debt). But you may be so used to what people consider normal in the US (drinking water, money that doesn&#x27;t lose its value week to week, not being shot by someone trying to steal your cell phone) that you don&#x27;t see the good parts anymore.')
