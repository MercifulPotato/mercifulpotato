In the US, COVID has killed a quarter-million, which is just under 0.1%, so an increase of under 10%. You&#x27;ll barely see a 10% increase on a noisy chart.<p>In practice, that&#x27;s a 50% increase some months, and a 1% increase others. So it looks underwhelming. But it isn&#x27;t the same people.<p>But it&#x27;s definitely not just people who would have died anyway. We&#x27;re also at just under 1 in 30 people infected. If everyone caught COVID, you&#x27;d naively see 30x as many deaths, or 7.5 million dead.<p>Practically, not everyone would catch COVID, and by demographics, I suspect fewer would die, so we&#x27;d be talking maybe 2-3 million excess deaths if we let it burn. And probably another few million with long-term disability.')
