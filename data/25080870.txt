Do people really believe there is &quot;evil&quot; motivations in Apple? How about Tesla and its control over your vehicle? Windows also phones home frequently and has advertising built-in.<p>I get that many in the hacker crowd don&#x27;t like this, so the obvious solution is, don&#x27;t buy those products.<p>But for everyone else, it&#x27;s not this big downer of a problem. This is the only time this has happened to me personally, and probably to most, and the way it affected the machines has been pointed out by many to be a bug that will likely get patched. Will it still phone home to Apple? Probably. But if there is an outage, it will not likely cause problems like this in the future. And personally I don&#x27;t care if my machine phones home to Apple. Life is too short and I get too many other benefits from using a mac to care about this.<p>People are confusing their own individual preferences for the technology they wish to own with the larger motivations of the masses.')
