I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.<p>Often they include background regarding what he wrote, or why, or who he wrote it for, where it was first published, and what not.<p>For novels that don&#x27;t get as much acclaim as the BotNS, or FHoC, I highly recommend the Soldier series.  More wonderful mystery hidden in plain sight.')
