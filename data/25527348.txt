It can be understood as an  architypal &quot;power and wealth corrupts&quot; narrative. But our appreciation of art benefits from an understanding of its context and the history of the genre&#x2F;medium. Citizen Kane may be more meaningful to you if you are aware of Hearst and the related social history in the same way that Wagner&#x27;s music is wonderful in its own terms, but possibly richer and more meaningful when you understand the philosophy, social context, theology, and mythology he was engaging with as well as the composers he was influenced by and their thinking.<p>All art is produced in a specific historical moment.')
