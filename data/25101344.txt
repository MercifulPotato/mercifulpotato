I still occassionaly read some people I follow on Twitter, but I rarely comment and never read notifications.<p>I also entirely stopped using Reddit for the same reason. IMHO it&#x27;s even more toxic than Twitter.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started about Facebook. What is it about politics that takes relatively sane friendly people who you&#x27;ve known for years and transforms them into raging psychopaths? When my own sister found out I didn&#x27;t think Trump was a literal Nazi, she then proceeded to call me a racist, with all her douchebag &quot;online friends&quot; cheering her on. And before Facebook, we used to get along really well. But now it&#x27;s like Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.')
