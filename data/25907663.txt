It&#x27;s a lot easier to create a nifty demo of something than it is to build something at scale. I got suckered by the Lilly drone and managed to get a refund before things started to go south and that was my last &quot;Ooops&quot;.<p>The biggest problem with this (and many tech preorders&#x2F; Kickstarters) is that by the time they iron out all the production bugs and software issues, the product is obsolete. Even if the product ships in a timely fashion and isn&#x27;t obsolete at launch, often you can just order it or a competing product for the same as the pre-order cost or often less.<p>For board games and some other non-tech products, pre-ordering makes sense because the product is often unique and not available outside pre-order. For tech stuff, stay well clear.')
