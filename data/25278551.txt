But it&#x27;s base factors. Kind of like basic survival situations. You need shelter, water and food. If you dont have that, you&#x27;re chances of long term survival and&#x2F;or happiness are close to zero. If you&#x27;re under constant threat of physical harm, liable to get gravely sick and poor as a church mouse, your not going to have a good time either. It&#x27;s easier to have a strong family, good friends and fulfilling hobbies and interests when the base 3 are at least stable, slightly leaning towards good. And of course I&#x27;m speaking generally, there are always exceptions, but to pretend exceptions are the norm isn&#x27;t healthy either.')
