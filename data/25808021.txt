Same with engineering.  As for 3d rendering, video editing, compositing though, there&#x27;s some scope for Mac to reclaim lost market share.<p>&gt; it’s easier for them to use Apple’s frameworks than play games with the CPU<p>The things I&#x27;m talking about are broader than what their accelerated libraries support.  Matrix operations are ubiquitous across heavy-weight computation, including stress analysis, physics simulation, machine learning, video and sound processing, compression, ray-tracing.. why would Apple limit their market?  There&#x27;s a whole host of 3rd party applications that would be augmented with this co-processor.  And it should be trivial to add a compiler intrinsic that compiles to some bitcode primitive that can ensure it works across all devices and OS&#x27;s... or just provide a mechanism to detect the extension.<p>&gt; And I’m sure Adobe will give it serious consideration - and then reject it, since it would get their apps rejected from the app stores and harm their relationship with Apple.<p>This is bad for Apple.  And bad for the consumer.  Final Cut Pro isn&#x27;t the only tool that video professionals need to use, and you can bet FCP will be using the coprocessor directly under the hood.')
