So only the poor ones will get treated badly.<p>Alcoholic gambler is a pretty nice approximation for life in general. For the individual, life is a very complicated gamble where you have no hope of understanding every single bet. The only difference is in complexity.<p>The poor alcoholic gambler fails at the most basic bets, the average poor human still fails but he is faced with far more complicated bets like choosing a college, degree, job, etc. STEM degrees might be an obvious way to avoid poverty, but not everyone makes it through one or even gets the chance to go to college at all. Even after they finish, the tuition debt can turn a good bet into a bad one very quickly.')
