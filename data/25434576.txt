There is certainly a thing where engineers like to think of themselves as smart, intelligent self-made men who justifiably earned their high salaries in contrast to, say, some dumb humanities major who&#x27;s now making coffees.<p>Often it&#x27;s a libertarian flavor, particularly here in the startup community where the cliche of the self-made-person looms large.  Libertarians have some overlap with liberal positions in some areas (personal freedoms in general, drugs specifically) but disagreements in others (government regulation and spending, etc).<p>In practice though most libertarians today can generally be characterized as conservatives who want freedom in the areas that affect them personally.  They want to smoke weed, or get gay married, so those things are good, but they&#x27;re conservative in most other areas.')
