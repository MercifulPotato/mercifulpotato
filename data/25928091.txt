Surely the point of most research is to uncover new facts? And what is &quot;reference material&quot; if not other research - research that you&#x27;re using as a foundation for your own?<p>It&#x27;s fair to question things, especially if they don&#x27;t make sense to you and even if acknowledged authorities are behind them. However, (1) something that you may question is not necessarily something I may question, and (2) questioning may be a waste of time.<p>If a paper that says mixing red and blue paint makes green paint has a thousand citations, perhaps you don&#x27;t need to question it because others already have. If you can&#x27;t reproduce it, the simplest thing to do is ask an expert who says it is possible to do it.')
