I know the people who work on those blog posts, and I tried to contribute one myself.<p>To my knowledge, employees absolutely do work on those; articles are edited and go through several rounds of review, but they aren&#x27;t ghost written.  Even the ones written by the management team seem entirely congruous with their level of product knowledge.<p>There are external people (usually former Herokai) who contribute to the Heroku blog; their names &#x2F; positions are listed on the byline of the article.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t see the point of having a non-employee writing the canonical description of a new feature; they wouldn&#x27;t have the context necessary to do the best job.')
