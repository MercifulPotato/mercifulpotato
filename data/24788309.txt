This allows the clipboard to hold rich objects and not just text-based contents. Things like tables, images, rich text, contacts... and even files, or folders of files!<p>This allows for a much more rich (and empowering!) way to share data than currently done on popular mobile platforms.<p>This was already implemented back in Windows 95 or something. It&#x27;s really old tech. Not sure how well this concept is implemented (or at all) on other desktop operating systems though, so it might not be a &quot;universal&quot; desktop solution for everyone.<p>That said it can clearly be done better than mobile, because on Windows it has already been so for two and half decades.')
