A classification algorithm flagged a video showing the inside of someone&#x27;s body as not suitable for children. You could argue either that the algorithm made a mistake, or that the algorithm worked as expected and you disagree with youtube&#x27;s policy on what is adult content.<p>&gt; Are we already in an Orwellian Dystopia?<p>No, youtube aren&#x27;t a government and they aren&#x27;t forcing you to do anything, it would be weird if they were obliged to show any video that you upload regardless of the content. At worst, they&#x27;re possibly giving you a bad user experience and poor customer service.')
