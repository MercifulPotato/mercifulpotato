Â¿It&#x27;s only about new (and better) ways to develop software or can also be &#x27;cool&#x27; to interfere in the evolution of the programming language that you plan to use for the next years ?\nI &#x27;m not against to use Rust or any other programming language, open source project or technology.  I mean, the companies love open source projects because they can produce their self flavor as a product (search engine, linux distro, containers and orchestration technologies, etc.) when they wish that, without worries about uncomfortable dependencies.<p>AWS loves Rust in the same way than Facebook loved PHP.')
