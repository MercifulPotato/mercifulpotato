Connection times can be, for a vast majority of users, measured in tens of milliseconds, giving us a pretty good budget for processing and rendering while still appearing to be &quot;instantaneous&quot; (100ms) or &quot;fluid&quot; (1s). Even the worst case connection times (satellite &amp; mobile) are still measurable using hundreds of milliseconds.<p>The worst ranked countries still average in excess of 1.5 Mbps transmission rates - more than enough for compressed text.<p>And, given how <i>unresponsive</i> so many &quot;top 100&quot; SSA pages are (such as blogs that take whole seconds to display their initial content), I can&#x27;t agree that doing that processing on the server would actually be less interactive or responsive.<p>Even the test application from this article can load from scratch in under a second, most of that time being the DNS resolution and the server processing for serving the page.')
