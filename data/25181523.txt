Any of the cloud-provided orchestration tools (Cloudformation, Openstack Heat etc.) are great only for the most basic tasks; using them to provision complex infrastructure is just begging for a world of hurt.<p>That being said. I think terraform could do better. I use terraform a lot, and yet I agree with the authors complaints that the syntax can be super  confusing, is not documented very well, and the providers have their own idiosyncrasies. The last one isn&#x27;t strictly an issue with terraform, its with the provider implementation. But... if terraform aims to be the Swiss army knife of infrastructure provisioning, I think criticism that its hard to standardize even within the same provider is fair.')
