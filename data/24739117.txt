Programmers hate them. \nYou want to be able to reason about your code<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    fact: a == b   \n    fact: f(x) is p deterministic pure function. \n    So I figure f(a) == f(b)\n</code></pre>\nWell, maybe... Javascript (obviously) and Python are amongst the programming languages where the above reasoning is not true. (there are exceptions).')
