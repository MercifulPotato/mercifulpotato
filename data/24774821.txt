Occasionally this is done in storytelling so as not to give away the identity of a character. Or more commonly, I use the word &quot;they&quot; when talking about someone I know to someone else whose gender is irrelevant. For example, I might say to my dad that I will be going out with a friend who happens to be a girl but I&#x27;ll use &quot;they&quot; because I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with the inevitable reaction from him that I&#x27;m seeing a new girlfriend. I realise that without the word &quot;they&quot;, I would have other options but I wonder if you take this particular usage into account when you talk about defaulting to &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;?')
