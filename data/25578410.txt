Calculating someone’s net worth in this way is not considering these things on which money is being spent. In the most non-judge mental way possible, I would love to see some deeper analysis here. Two different households could have the same income, but one could save more (at the expense of missing out on a lot of things that increase quality of life) and another could save less. I don’t at all think badly of the family who saves less, but it is a valid factor to consider in an objective analysis of income inequality’s effect on households.')
