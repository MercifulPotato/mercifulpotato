I felt like I could reach that standard myself but couldn&#x27;t really get others to go there -- some people had no standard for quality at all,  others wanted an hourly rate I couldn&#x27;t afford for what they produced and thought my piecework rate was too low.  Maybe half of it was intrinsic to the situation,  maybe half of it was my not being good at hiring&#x2F;managing and not trying for longer.')
