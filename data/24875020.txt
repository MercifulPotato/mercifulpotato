A &quot;remastered&quot; version is released 5-10 years after the original with updated graphics and some bug fixes, maybe even some updates to take advantage of what became standard in the genre afterwards.  It doesn&#x27;t always go well though, I was just reading today about Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning on Steam (am update of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning from 2012) where people are complaining that while they did make it look somewhat better, and they did add a few useful enhancements to the looting system, not only did they not fix previously well known game breaking bugs, but they introduced <i>new</i> ones in addition.[1]  The reviews were saying the original was better (and still great), but alas, it&#x27;s no longer for sale (on Steam at least) because of the re-release.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that based on some of the material on the page, there&#x27;s an upcoming addition&#x2F;DLC coming out, so if played well, this strategy could be very lucrative for a team that&#x27;s design and content creation oriented and skilled, while not having to worry as much about the technical aspects of designing the game and engine.  There&#x27;s something to be said for this.  There&#x27;s a reason Fallout: New Vegas is considered by many to be the better Fallout 3 game.  There&#x27;s a much more cohesive story line to it, and more interesting content in general, and I have to imagine not having to worry as much about getting the engine right freed the studio that made New Vegas (Obsidian, which is not the studio that made Fallout 3 and the engine which was Bethesda) to focus on that.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1041720&#x2F;Kingdoms_of_Amalur_ReReckoning&#x2F;#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1041720&#x2F;Kingdoms_of_Amalu...</a>')
