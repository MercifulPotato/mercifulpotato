If you don&#x27;t care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you&#x27;d be destroying along the way.<p>The idea that this is going to make any meaningful impact on JP MORGAN is ridiculous and I suspect the person who wrote it is aware it&#x27;s ridiculous. They are just out to screw people so they can make a quick dishonest buck.<p>Just like the real Wall Street, &#x2F;r&#x2F;WallStreetBets is full of horrible scumbags.')
