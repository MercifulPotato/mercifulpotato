I know for a fact that isn&#x27;t true as I work closely with several Polish women (residing in Poland). Perhaps they are not representative of others, but I doubt very much Poland is free from misogyny and that women don&#x27;t care either way. The idea that 90% of the world doesn&#x27;t care about something that affects 50% of the population is a reach.<p>And the idea that nobody cares about xenophobia also seems unlikely. It&#x27;s a less diverse country, sure, but the debate around migrants in Poland have been public and at times quite emotive. Maybe it&#x27;s all smoke no fire, but it when Jaroslaw Kaczynski helped the PiS rise to power while denigrating migrants throughout, you can&#x27;t help but be doubtful that xenophobia isn&#x27;t meaningful to some of those smaller pockets of non-native Poles in your country.<p>EDIT: I do not know if these concerns are merited within the context of the game itself. I have not played Cyberpunk 2077. I only take issue with your belief that misogyny and xenophobia are of no concern to people in central or eastern Europe. It sounds like an opinion of someone without such cares personally, not someone who can attest that such cares are unwarranted.')
