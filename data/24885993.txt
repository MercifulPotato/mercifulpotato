I can both see this comma&#x2F;dot problem be missed in development and can also imagine such a payment go through, as a few digit amount times one hundred still gives an amount that people can have in their bank accounts. Users clicking through confirmation dialogs and dismissing wrong information as &#x27;computer problems&#x27; is not an unheard-of problem either.<p>This is really inviting trouble - without good reason? - as a payment &#x27;API&#x27; having to deal with how a number was displayed to a user seems out of scope for it.')
