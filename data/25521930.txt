Maybe it&#x27;s because it was over hyped and other people didn&#x27;t already have a system in place to compare to or something?<p>I really tried to like Notion but I found it just slowed me down -- as in actually delayed what I was doing with lag and silly things like trying to be clever as you say, not just the learning curve<p>I&#x27;m now trying out Obsidian(1) with a plain old directory of md files, but YMMV I never needed the table&#x2F;db stuff so I dunno if Obsidian has that sort of thing or an equivalent. The directory is mounted from my NAS using its Tailscale(2) IP so it&#x27;s in theory accessible everywhere, but of course I&#x27;ve not been able to test that much this year<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;</a><p>(2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;</a><p>e: I should note I use this for bigger notes.
