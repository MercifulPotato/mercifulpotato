Never punish a behaviour you want more of.<p>PS the tax deduction thing is envious garbage - you can only deduct the amount of tax on the dollars you donate (ie your top marginal tax rate). So you have to lose a LOT more than you &quot;gain&quot; through deduction. You don&#x27;t come out ahead.<p>And you should never have been taxed because you didn&#x27;t keep the dollar.')
