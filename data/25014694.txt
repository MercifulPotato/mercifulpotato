The job required very specific tech skills. When I told the recruiter I had no intention of moving to Exeter, he said glumly &quot;that&#x27;s what everyone says, but the client is dead set against remote&quot;. Nothing against Exeter, I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a nice place to visit, but I kind of wondered what galaxy-brain thinking was going on there.')
