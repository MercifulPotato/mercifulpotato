For example, it would cost next to nothing to capture pictures of all mail in ballot envelopes, and keep them for a few years. It would not cost much to release all voting data (both time series and totals) for free for statistical analysis in a uniform, machine readable format. Such data currently costs substantial amounts of money, and one of the most credible election integrity investigations (and the only one that yielded robust statistical evidence as far as I know) had to spend quarter of a million dollars to acquire it for several states. It would not cost much to capture the counting with a 4K webcam for future inspection and keep videos for a few years. It would not cost much to have uniform ballot mailing and arrival deadlines across states. It is also technically possible in 2020 to have voting systems that are not easily defeated after 1 minute intrusion by someone with the right tooling and a modicum of training. We have people on this site easily capable of designing such systems, as well as easily defeating the systems in use today. A lot of people (nearly all democrats) were interested in such things during Bush years, and demonstrated how easily hackable voting machines and systems are, only to promptly lose all interest and declare that everything is impenetrable the moment Obama was elected. Videos of their exposes are still on YouTube for everyone to see. For the record: I voted for Obama both times.')
