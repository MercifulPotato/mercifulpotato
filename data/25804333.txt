Formally speaking you&#x27;d have to specify a computational model to be able to talk about complexity (there is no such thing as &#x27;complexity&#x27; but only &#x27;complexity respective to a model&#x27;; e.g. you can change the big-O complexity on Turing machines by using more tapes).<p>The computational model of a book like CLRS is &quot;arithmetic is O(1), but we&#x27;re not going to abuse that bug&quot;.')
