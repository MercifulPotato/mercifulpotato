The NYT simply reported on the documents that the administration used to justify that war.<p>The &quot;fake&quot; dossier actually existed, as did its contents.  What got leaked was an unfinished internal draft that was never meant to be released. Buzzfeed was the company that published the dossier; the NYT simply reported on the dossier <i>after</i> it became a big issue. Given the nature of the allegations, multiple agencies in the U.S. attempted to verify the allegations. They were able to corroborate some but not all of the allegations in the dossier, as discussed in the Mueller Report.')
