Maybe that&#x27;s why Kyle&#x27;s video is at the bottom and not mentioned in the article.<p>I feel like a big issue holding back small pod transport is the fact that vehicles are generally all designed for many passengers and 3000 pounds.  And I think a big part of that is safety.  The likelihood of death for a really small single passenger vehicle is just much greater with all of these massive cars on the road (generally with only one occupant).<p>In my mind there is room (especially in places like Texas) for new types of smart cities.  And you can build them from the outset with autonomous single-passenger small pods in mind.  In my scenario the regular vehicles would need to be parked away in a commuter hub and the transportation in the city would be fully automated.  This will save a lot of energy with very small single passenger vehicles as compared to the 5+ passenger vehicles normally taken by individuals around town.  And in this city there is no danger of the small pods running into a larger vehicle driven by a human since it&#x27;s not permitted.<p>I am actually thinking some of these companies may be doing a redesign where the shared space of the pool cars are broken up into little airtight compartments.  Personally I would prefer that even if there wasn&#x27;t a pandemic.')
