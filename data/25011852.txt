It’s small and has a nice linen case, so it looks like a book when on the shelf and not in use. I subscribe to a $4 tier for instant ink (50 pages a month with a 1 month rollover), and I love it. The main thing that pushed me over the edge was that you can also print unlimited 5x7 photos printed from your mobile device as part of the deal, and having recently acquired a baby we thought it would be nice to actually print sie photos for ourselves and relatives.<p>They obviously screwed up by doing a freemium model on a physical product, but the paid tiers combined with the Tango aren’t such a raw deal for people who don’t want a printer taking up dedicated space in their apartments, and it saves the hassle of keeping track of ink levels and ordering cartridges, or going to the library in the cases where printing something made sense.<p>This is insanely (maybe even criminally?) hyperbolic:<p>&gt; The right-to-repair criminals like Apple, John Deere and Medtronic. Tesla and GM, Juicero and Keurig – companies that are not merely content with waging war on customers, but also on competitors who offer those customers shelter.<p>Lots of consumers just have different priorities when it comes to trade offs. Doctorow positions himself as a champion of consumers, but he’d really like to reduce our range of options if he could.')
