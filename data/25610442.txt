Salsa, Swing, Ballroom. I can jump around at a club to pop&#x2F;house&#x2F;techno&#x2F;etc... but once I have to follow specific steps with a partner I have a huge hurdle.<p>I tried taking salsa classes once. Was going to 4 classes a week. The instructor told me it would be a year before I&#x27;d be able to lead. Of course that was one instructor&#x27;s opinion. I stopped after 4 weeks and feeling like I was making zero progress. It was not fun to feel like I was in everyone else&#x27;s way not being able to keep up or not being able to transition from one move to the next. Also not really a fan of salsa.<p>I&#x27;ve taken maybe 10 swing dance classes as well but zero progress. Bad teachers maybe.')
