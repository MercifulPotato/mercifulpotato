This was supposedly fix by Project Treble, but until now Google prevented this.<p>So with this, OEMs no longer require support from SoC vendor and ODM to manage to upgrade to a newer Android version. They can keep the drivers provided originally by the SoC vendor and ODM, and &quot;simply&quot; upgrade only Android framework.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25351189" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25351189</a> for the complaint this is addressing')
