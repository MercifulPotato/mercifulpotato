How do you decide? I&#x27;m just a bit older than you (36 currently) and haven&#x27;t figured it out yet.<p>Like, if I think the politics somewhere are a dumpster fire, or to use your analogy, growing crops in a salted field, how do I pick the battles I&#x27;ll fight, vs. the ones where it&#x27;s best to let go?<p>Offhand, I tend to think it&#x27;s worth fighting for when the thing is very important to you personally, it&#x27;s something only you can do (whether by dint of identity, skills, whatever), or the benefits are large. Probably not worth it when you don&#x27;t have the patience (might take ten years but you only want to put in 5), the other side is too entrenched, or the upside isn&#x27;t worth it. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.')
