Where I live, the standard is water radiators for old installations and new. The last 20-30 years or so each radiator has a thermostat. (Bimetal, no electronics.)<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>Somewhere there is a reservoir and something to heat the water. It can be anything, and indeed most older homes have been converted a few times already but nothing changed in the water system itsef. (For a house to have started with a wood furnace, then oil, then electric, then municipial heating or solar or whatever, is completely normal.)<p>The water either circulates by convection (very old systems), or with a pump. If the pump fails, convection typically still works, just less flow.')
