That being said, if you are working in the technology field, you are more likely to work with individuals who actively learned engineering but passively learned writing.<p>Alternative example: early on in my career, I was a software developer for a PR agency and then a news organization after that. At these organizations, solid writing and editing is drilled just as much as good code review or test coverage is taught in engineering organizations. Their lunch-and-learn sessions aren&#x27;t about new JavaScript frameworks; they analyze how a particular piece of text was created and find ways to improve it.<p>My single largest &quot;level-up&quot; in this domain was when I started reading more on character creation in fiction. It forced me to think about how I&#x27;m telling stories, which then meant I had to think about how I constructed paragraphs, which then... you get the idea. Some great books I read:<p>- Robert McKee&#x27;s &quot;Story,&quot; which analyzes how great screenwriting is constructed. You will view action movies in a totally different way after this.<p>- Corbett&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Character,&quot; which focuses on how characters are created<p>- Roman&#x2F;Raphaelson&#x27;s business writing book, which was recommended by PR legend David Ogilvy<p>- the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff manuals (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jcs.mil&#x2F;Library&#x2F;CJCS-Manuals&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jcs.mil&#x2F;Library&#x2F;CJCS-Manuals&#x2F;</a>). These are <i>rigidly</i> structured texts with strange language that forced me to consider writing for a different audience than I normally would (military officers versus tech engineers)')
