Coroutines are used in both and implement structured concurrency exactly like Loom does. It&#x27;s not a little bit similarish and vaguely related: it maps 1 to 1 conceptually; well at least for the stuff that Loom actually implements.<p>Rust indeed would deserve a mention as well but it follows a somewhat different approach to the same problem. But Kotlin is somewhat special here as Oracle is bleeding users to specifically Kotlin.')
