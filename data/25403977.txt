Speed is what turns minor accidents into major ones, especially for people who aren&#x27;t themselves in cars[1] so while it&#x27;s true that for avoiding vehicular collisions the most important factor is going around the same speed as the rest of the vehicles there&#x27;s still a significant difference in injury&#x2F;death rates for anything which isn&#x27;t a protected highway. As a parent, I think about this a lot when I see people going 45+ MPH (&gt;80% death rate) in the 20mph zone in front of the closest playground where a kid was killed a while back by someone who couldn&#x27;t stop in time. An aggravating factor here is that drivers now are often quite distracted by touchscreen controls and phones so the window for slowing down to avoid hitting someone is even less favorable.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;one.nhtsa.gov&#x2F;people&#x2F;injury&#x2F;research&#x2F;pub&#x2F;hs809012.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;one.nhtsa.gov&#x2F;people&#x2F;injury&#x2F;research&#x2F;pub&#x2F;hs809012.ht...</a>')
