The quality can be really excellent now, and I think we have moved from the &quot;Tech Demo&quot; stage to Early Nintendo Stage, where there were only 4 or 5 great games but they were all worthy of obsessing over and iterating on.<p>Beat Saber I think could sustain the Oculus Quest at this point on its own.<p>When Half Lyfe starts running natively on the Quest we will probably see another explosion.<p>And if they get Mind Craft running on Quest there will be millions of kids playing VR for hours every day.')
