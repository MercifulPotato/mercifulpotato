Well, &quot;fatal&quot; needs to be defined. If an HTTP handler throws an exception, is that fatal for the whole webserver?<p>Java seems crazy about this. Exceptions seems like it&#x27;s being treated as just another return value. And that leads to a mess.<p>But C++? What parts of the C++ standard library have unreasonable exceptions used for errors? (there may be some, I just can&#x27;t think of any)<p>And note that you have to throw (no pun intended) away large parts of the language if you remove exceptions. E.g. you can&#x27;t have constructors without exceptions. How else would you signify &quot;those arguments you gave to the constructor are no bueno&quot;.<p>Go doesn&#x27;t have constructors, so it&#x27;s consistent with what it says.<p>Also see my comment here, about how common or not, discouraged or not, the mere <i>existence</i> of exceptions in a language changes how you must write code to not have it be buggy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25275580" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25275580</a><p>Yes, in C++ &#x27;goto&#x27; is a code smell. It&#x27;s not in C (greatly used for error handling), but C++ has RAII so `goto` should be rare outside of &quot;clever&quot; code (where &quot;clever&quot; is rarely good).<p>The mere fact that C++ doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;finally&#x27;, and Java does, tells you a lot about how exceptions and RAII differs. If you write a macro for &quot;finally&quot; in C++ then you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>Pretty much all of my `catch` clauses are in main() (or the root of an event handler), to pretty print the error and&#x2F;or log to central service, or in a top level event like HTTP handler. `catch` should be about as common in C++ as `rescue` is in Go.<p>In Java it&#x27;s fucking everywhere.')
