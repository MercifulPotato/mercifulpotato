Maybe having a Twitter account is a privilege, and not a right, and that privilege is correctly granted on the precondition that one will not use the platform to act like an asshole.<p>Then again maybe we shouldn&#x27;t elect assholes President to begin with, but that&#x27;s also neither here nor there.<p>&gt;When one side, in a major public-opinion-influencing service can ban a whole side of the political spectrum though, and even the sitting president, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>Except the &quot;whole side&quot; of the Republican, conservative, or even pro-Trump spectrum <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> been banned.
