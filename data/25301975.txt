Can you point to where they announced the study on April 6th or before? Or did the decide to look at Jena only after the data was available?\nHow is that not a post-hoc hypothesis?<p>Of course, both general hypotheses of masks and prayer predate Covid19.<p>&gt; It does not, however, invalidate this study.\nNo. The study contributes a single data point in favor of masks, but is not very convincing (in that the authors did not look deep into contradictions and alternative explanations) and of course not conclusive as the bad title makes it appear.')
