What can be accurately said is that children seldom have severe disease and often asymptomatic or have unremarkable symptoms, making the extent of Covid among children hard to measure (in general, asymptomatic people have their cases discovered and tracked at a dramatically lower rate than people with serious symptoms).<p>There was a nice Spiegel article summary a while ago <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiegel.de&#x2F;international&#x2F;world&#x2F;new-on-the-covid-19-front-lines-children-may-be-driving-the-pandemic-after-all-a-95e4c0e7-2ea0-479b-ac27-d17f07d147a5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiegel.de&#x2F;international&#x2F;world&#x2F;new-on-the-covid-...</a><p>There has been overall very poor data gathering (testing, contact tracing, symptom tracking, ...) among children in most parts of the world, and in particular in the USA. All other age groups are tested and tracked at much higher frequency.<p>Due to the combination of this lack of solid research plus extreme political&#x2F;social pressure, many people have argued (some based more or less on wishful thinking &#x2F; confirmation bias, others disingenuously) that kids are not a spread risk and should therefore be allowed to mingle.<p>In many places where this has been tried, it was followed by notable outbreaks in schools (which then spread to the broader community), leading to schools shutting back down. In analyses of the effects of various public health interventions, school closures had one of the largest effects on the reproductive number of the epidemic.')
