It featured a 3.2 GHz PowerPC Tri-Core Xenon CPU [1].<p>It was also Microsoft&#x27;s highest selling console ever [2]. Note that the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 each individually outsold it though. As a result, Microsoft has never outsold Sony with an x86 PC-like console, despite trying multiple times.<p>Ironically, recent PlayStation consoles have been x86. Maybe Microsoft kind of won in the end? It still doesn&#x27;t run Windows through, so maybe Microsoft was right from the start?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Xbox_360" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Xbox_360</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_best-selling_game_consoles#Home_game_consoles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_best-selling_game_cons...</a>')
