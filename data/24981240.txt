It can help narrow the search space, but you can not draw conclusions from it, because what comes out of a simulation depends on what you put it.<p>And if you knew what needs to be put in, you would not need the simulation in the first place.<p>Note that a simulation is not the same as a model. A model is tested and refined based on real world data, until the model returns the same results.')
