I do.<p>Bill Clinton has legitimate accusations of sexual assault hanging out there against him - just like Trump.<p>Why did Democrats (and others) &#x27;forgive him&#x27;? And &#x27;look the other way&#x27;?<p>How was the Democrat Brand not &#x27;destroyed forever&#x27; by a &#x27;Serial Abuser in Chief&#x27; in Office?<p>Democrats (and others) forgave him, because they think it was not so bad, that ultimately he was a good person, the act was ostensibly consensual, the Republicans were making to much of it - etc etc..<p>Some people simply don&#x27;t see a 55 year married old man, banging a 22 year old intern in a prestigious office as hugely relevant. Others do.<p>I think most Donald Trump supporters believe that he &#x27;Loves America&#x27; that he&#x27;s a &#x27;Business Genius&#x27; who just &#x27;Speaks Plainly&#x27; and sometimes says aggressive things, but that it doesn&#x27;t mean much.<p>I personally don&#x27;t think any of those things are true, but it&#x27;s not hard to see how people watching Fox News might be &#x27;believers&#x27;.<p>To some people &#x27;they are sending us their rapists&#x27; is like an inappropriate Chines accent or an off colour joke - inappropriate and little bit offensive, but not existentially so.<p>&quot;I guess what a lot of us are struggling with is how anyone cannot see these truths for themselves in Trump. &quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think they do see &#x27;Traditional Conservative&#x27; in him - I think they see mostly something else and that&#x27;s my point.<p>If the GOP base wanted a &#x27;Traditional Conservative&#x27; there are a dozen other, more obvious choices.<p>But it&#x27;s all moot: Trump really isn&#x27;t much of a &#x27;Conservative&#x27; in any way, it&#x27;s a &#x27;Bully Nationalist&#x27; which unfortunately 1&#x2F;2 of Republicans will vote for because they want to, the rest will vote reluctantly.<p>Both traditional Conservatism and &#x27;American Socialism&#x27; (i.e. Centre Left) are not &#x27;dead&#x27; - they are everywhere but it&#x27;s that populism is having it&#x27;s time, and supported in the press.<p>The Intersectionalist Reactionaries on the Left are very close to taking over the Democratic party, much as Trump &#x27;barn stormed&#x27; the GOP.')
