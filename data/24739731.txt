That&#x27;s a statement of fact, and that colors the argument he&#x27;s making.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by putting &quot;boss&quot; in quotation marks, but at the big company (1000+ engineers) I work for, my direct manager does not &quot;boss me around&quot; (if that&#x27;s the sense you meant it), and the four more levels of management above him certainly don&#x27;t. I have the freedom to propose and pursue new ideas, I&#x27;m regularly learning new things, and I set my own goals - with active feedback and input from my manager as to whether they make sense and what I should prioritize. I&#x27;d expect no more and no less from the relationship between a startup-accelerator participant and a seed investor. And in both cases, the boss&#x2F;investor profits from the employee&#x2F;founder doing good work.<p>What&#x27;s different is the risk model. If my ideas don&#x27;t pan out, my management (well, my employer as a whole, but my management is accountable for how they choose to use headcount and salary budget) is still on the hook for paying me big-tech wages, until they decide my ideas are so bad that it&#x27;s not worth keeping me employed. If the founder&#x27;s ideas don&#x27;t pan out, pg is only out a couple thousand dollars. (At the time, YC was paying $17K.)<p>So, yes, pg earns his profit from investment and action, and that&#x27;s precisely what&#x27;s being pointed out here as a potential conflict of interest.<p>(If pg&#x27;s actual point, reading the article more closely, is &quot;Google&#x27;s organizational structure does not give you that freedom and will not help you grow as an engineer,&quot; well, that&#x27;s one of the many reasons I declined a Google offer. But Google is not every big engineering firm.)')
