Item(by='kken', descendants=None, kids=[25614364, 25613722], score=None, time=1609603159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612223, text='Ok, just to make sure I understand this correctly.<p>- This is basically a commercial smartwach (the Colmi P8) that is based on a well documented SOC, the nordic nRF52832<p>- The open source version comes with an enclosure that is not glued shut, so that it is easy to access testpoints on the pcb.<p>- Development is done by accessing the nRF51 SWD interface with pogo pins or similar. The programming interface can be a standard SWD interface such as an STLink clone<p>Ok, sounds easy enough. It should be possible to just buy one of those smartwatches and crack them open? But OTOH the developer version is not much more expensive.<p>The main question is now: What software to run on it, that goes beyond a few experiments? Is there any kind of open source smartwatch OS that would run on this?<p>Edit: Corrected typo, of course I meant SWD interface, not SWM. (SWM or rather SWIM is for STM8)')
