Full lock down, through-window visits after approval for an appointment where they take your temperature etc, limited to once per week. Covid has encouraged a bit of giving-understanding, but for the most part it has just exacerbated the existing bad incentives and draconian top-down policy regimes. None of these places welcome oversight, for the reasons spelled out by the article.<p>FWIW a close relative with multiple comorbidities got Covid from a hospital, likely when they decided it was prudent to cycle three different roommates through their room in as many days.

Never got any calls from contact tracing either. Thankfully my relative ended up beating it.')
