I have experience with Vue, and the transition did take a bit of time but for now I prefer Svelte.<p>Svelte feels closer to the bare JS, and I&#x27;m learning a lot of what used to be abstracted on Vue. The community resources and related open-source packages are certainly not as comprehensive as React or Vue, but I think it&#x27;s coming along.<p>Excited for svelte-kit to be released and will transition my project to it.')
