Item(by='ajsnigrutin', descendants=None, kids=[25166784], score=None, time=1605917070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166424, text='&gt; Some people&#x27;s inability to be able to view boobs on FB is not on the same level as LGBT rights.<p>Why?<p>Isn&#x27;t seeing boobs a lot more natural than anything lgbt? I mean, pretty much a 100% of people have boobs, 50% of those have the ones we&#x27;re not allowed to see, and if you count all the lgbt people, you get what.. 10% of the population? 20%? Definitely less than the number of people with boobs.<p>Yes, i know it&#x27;s a stupid example, and there are historic reasons for promoting lgbt rights... but we&#x27;re currently in a state, where one person (or a relatively small group of people) with their own set of beliefs, can decide that an 8-9yo drag queen is ok (Lactatia), a 6 year old can be a star of really creepy beauty pageants (honey boo boo), but one visible, female nipple is bad (sometimes even very bad: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_sh...</a> )<p>Who decides what is ok and what is not? Laws surely don&#x27;t. Yes, facebook is a private company, but it should be treated as having a monopoly position, especially after buying instagram and whatsapp. Having a company with so much power (having so many eyes watching them, that they can manipulate) is not a good thing, especially if they can arbitrary censor stuff they arbitrarily don&#x27;t like.')
