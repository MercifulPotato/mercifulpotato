Item(by='IggleSniggle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607791414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398410, text='I think I&#x27;m probably at a similar stage with regards to vim usage. I have mixed feelings about it, but it seems that VSCode has spread itself into my consciousness in the way that I had hoped vim would. With VSCode, I know how to quickly select a word, jump the selection to a multiselect, and rapidly selection by words or lines that I wish to edit simultaneously, all without touching the mouse. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where selecting or jumping a word with alt-arrow is reflexive instead of `w`, where `ctrl-D` and `alt-down` are more reflexive than the more composable alternatives in vim. This ALL was supposed to be vim! Damn you VSCode!<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be bothered by this except I compose Unix tools quite a bit, so it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m maintaining two separate working environments. If I had just started with vim (or emacs) from the get-go, then these two worlds would eventually meet. I&#x27;ve even got my own handful of extensions to send things from VSCode to the integrated terminal and back as a sort of poor substitute for the things that emacs and vim have been doing for decades. I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;m an idiot.')
