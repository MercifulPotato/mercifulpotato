(Contemporary British hate speech laws not being created until well after the war.) Yet unlike almost all of continental Europe, any nascent fascist movements in the US or UK remained extreme fringe groups that never gained any political traction.<p>The historical record is pretty clear. At best hate speech laws, do nothing to disarm extremist groups. America&#x27;s 250 year history of free speech absolutism, with virtually no extremist groups gaining widespread traction is evidence of this. At worse hate speech laws are a dangerous single-point of failure for liberal democracy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;policy-report&#x2F;mayjune-2015&#x2F;war-free-expression" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;policy-report&#x2F;mayjune-2015&#x2F;war-free-exp...</a>')
