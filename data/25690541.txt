A pyramid scheme keeps paying out profits to the chumps right up to the point when it doesn&#x27;t.<p>The argument here isn&#x27;t that Tether has no cash on hand, it&#x27;s that if enough people pull out, they hit the the bottom of the non 1:1 reserve and everyone else left holding will zero out. If you have 1 kg of gold and start selling papers giving people claim to that 1kg of gold, nothing will prevent you from seeling 1000 claims, making it seem like you&#x27;re holding a ton of gold for people when looking at the market cap, but if 2 people come and ask you for their 1kg of gold and you don&#x27;t have enough of the cash you got seeling claims on hand and an oppotunity to buy gold quickly, then from one day to the next 999 claims are worthless.<p>This is of cause not a big risk in the industry normally because markets are regulated and those who hold gold or other assets backing claims go through audits.<p>Naturally Tether can&#x27;t go through an honest audit because even though they might be holding enough cash to cover a decent amount of the market, it would expose them for lying over time, which would still hurt their business tremendously.')
