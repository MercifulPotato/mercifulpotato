(AFAIK apps that use the Cocoa API automatically does these.) However there really isn’t any POSIX API that allows handling these kind of situations — and to do these now you need to do all of these nitty-gritty things that SQLite does.<p>In fact, I think that the reason why SQLite needs all of these nitty-gritty details that does everything is because of an insufficient abstraction. If the file APIs were better and didn’t require everyone to consider whether you have to call fsync or not, SQLite wouldn’t have needed any of these. But well POSIX have flied and here we are.')
