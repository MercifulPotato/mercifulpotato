This means that the existence of error handling is checked at compile time. Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean your error handling is _good_, but I think that&#x27;s beyond any language design to enforce.<p>But the Rust system is entirely built around a generic Result type, where both the non-error result (an int, string, struct, etc.) _and_ the error type itself are both generic.')
