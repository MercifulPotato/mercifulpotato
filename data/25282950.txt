Managers usually want to do things &quot;their way&quot; but I think the mechanics of Sprints are well enough understood to just go by the process and enjoy it.<p>On the other hand I think it&#x27;s good to have a manager to talk to, also someone that deals with conflicts at work and someone who is able to reverse toxic dynamics. No way this can be automated in foreseeable future and neither do I see that &quot;self-organized teams&quot; find any way to solve this. Also dealing with product requirements is hard to automate.')
