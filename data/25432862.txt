There&#x27;s a second Python script that regenerates the videos daily, using FFMPEG. A simple cronjob restarts the services if anything crashes.<p>From there, rsync mirrors the files to a DigitalOcean VM running Apache.<p>The frontend is vanilla HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. No jQuery or other magic. The JS periodically changes the img href attribute to force an image reload, so if you leave the page up, it&#x27;ll slowly change as the day passes.<p>Video page is similar - the javascript snippets load different .webm videos. (As an aside, cross-browser compatibility for embedded videos is challenging. webm had the best support when I built this, but it&#x27;s far from universal.)')
