For example, they&#x27;ve avoided ordering redundant scans in order to minimize my radiation exposure. I think I&#x27;m pretty lucky to have access to UCSF, and doubly so since I arbitrarily switched to a PPO insurance plan this year before I knew I had any problems. I&#x27;m feeling especially appreciative because my failed atrioventricular nerves started working again today! Apparently they&#x27;ve been giving me the right drugs.<p>While I&#x27;m reflecting on how lucky I am to live somewhere with great health care, here&#x27;s a shameless plug for the company I work for, Zipline International. We&#x27;re building a scalable platform for delivering life saving medical supplies to hard to reach places that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have access, based on really cool&#x2F;boring because they&#x27;re so reliable UAVs. We&#x27;re definitely hiring on the embedded team, and I&#x27;m sure on all the other software teams as well. Our internal metrics are getting pretty mind blowing to follow, in terms of deliveries per day&#x2F;cumulative distance flown per day&#x2F;literal lives saved per day. I guarantee there&#x27;s plenty of fun projects to work on!')
