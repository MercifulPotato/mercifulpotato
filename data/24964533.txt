Here, the authors think of the economy as a &quot;pie&quot; created by &quot;factors&quot; that gets &quot;divided up&quot;. What naturally follows is that if some get a bigger &quot;slice&quot; than others, it is inherently unfair.<p>But a free market economy is not a pie. It&#x27;s a collection of people that create wealth. Some create more wealth than others. Bob creating more wealth than Fred does not mean that Bob took it from Fred.
