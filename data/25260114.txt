Bunch of teething and hardware  failure&#x2F;DOA issues and arbitrary limitations with near zero engagement from Apple.<p>Nothing like the original Intel transition program, I&#x27;m willing to  bet they&#x27;re going to give credit instead of hardware for the exchange this time around too. It&#x27;s an entirely different company now.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t NEED to subsidize or keep developers happy anymore. They&#x27;ve already won us and the marketshare. SE, vertical integration, leapfrog CPU and battery life..  They don&#x27;t have any competitor, so why waste money investing in the ecosystem? We&#x27;re going to build for them anyway.')
