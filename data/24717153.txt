Me and my classmates grew up watching American (and Japanese) high school movies, but the stereotypes never stuck.<p>Bullying exists, but the bullies were often the ones who did well in class. Bullies are those who pick on easy prey weaker than them, and those who got isolated into the &quot;dumb classes&quot; were easily bullied. Move up in university and boarding school, and bullying became a lot more extreme, heavily controlled by the ones with good grades.<p>The kids with bad grades tended to have less willpower, come from poorer families, smoked and had less stamina, dressed poorly and couldn&#x27;t afford tuition. They had a lot of discrimination stacked against them, and were easily oppressed by the &quot;nerds&quot;.<p>I would categorize myself as a nerd in that I didn&#x27;t bother with how I looked or dressed, or that I had bad handwriting. But that attitude lent me a more regal reputation in school; similar to punk or &quot;bad boy&quot; instead.')
