How can a machine be indifferent to human influences? How do we know it&#x27;s not biased? Does it discriminate? It&#x27;s a not a human, it can&#x27;t &quot;think&quot; like one, it&#x27;s not capable of rational and fluid thought and argument. It&#x27;s a dumb machine feeding off data, unless you give it all the data it&#x27;s bound to be inaccurate at some point.<p>AI is given too much credit for a little bit of intelligence (if you can call it that, I think that&#x27;s how we perceive it), however as society changes so the AI has to. Does AI understand brexit yet? Does it influence policy decisions? Can it understand how people will react? Can it help during a pandemic? Can it talk and negotiate?<p>Brexit was dumb and so is the UK.')
