Item(by='hn_user82179', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607195949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316485, text='I would agree, but I&#x27;ve also been a passenger with drivers who insist on using their phone (and won&#x27;t let me text for them) and watched the car veer back and forth, where they&#x27;d correct just after the car had crossed the lane line. I don&#x27;t ride with those people more than once, but these were people who are otherwise intelligent, educated, kind humans.<p>The problem with trusting humans to use their own judgement is that it is very self-focused: &quot;Am I going to die in an accident?&quot;, not, &quot;Could I hurt or kill someone else&quot;? Given how many people (at least in the US) refuse to wear masks for the health of those around them right now, I don&#x27;t think those people would also be concerned about hitting others.<p>FWIW, I think it&#x27;s possible to safely use your phone at a stoplight (I frequently do), but I saw my friend release the brake and start rolling and <i>then</i> look up from his phone, because he had seen it was green in his peripheral vision. That is <i>not</i> safe, and I think scenarios like this happen more than we realize.')
