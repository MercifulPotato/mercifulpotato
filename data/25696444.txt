Item(by='csnover', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610163480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694769, text='&gt; But your point makes it clear why Section 230 is not important to protect the Internet<p>Iâ€™ve only given evidence that businesses not privy to the Section 230 liability shield are doing exactly the same thing that you claim would be prevented by repealing Section 230, and therefore repeal will not solve the problem.<p>It is a fallacy to extend this to say that Section 230 is not important to protect the internet <i>in general</i>, as the internet is about far more than companies putting profit over public safety. The absence of the liability shield will absolutely cause <i>other</i> chilling effects. See my reply to a sibling reply for more detail, with evidence to support this position.[0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25695770" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25695770</a>')
