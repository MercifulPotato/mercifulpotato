Had that exact situation in a startup I joined. It was annoying and it ruined my passion for the project, because the outcome of that &quot;one&quot; discussion shaped the project for two years.<p>Guy (formerly a friend) got hired 2 months after me, decided that the backend I&#x27;m working on had no architecture, so forced me to discuss architectures with him (he had never designed, developed or worked on web applications before) for two months, in the end filled with animosity, until we settled on an architecture he proposed (because he befriended the CEO better than I did). It frustrates me, whenever I think about how 2 years of problem solving were wasted on a futile architecture that we had to completely rewrite into something more akin to what I initially worked on.')
