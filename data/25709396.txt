Hell, the fact that these companies are likely actually just doing all this because it&#x27;s better for their bottom line makes me actually _less_ trusting of them.<p>Hate speech is definitely an issue, but I want the government, who are democratically elected and (should) serve the people, to take care of it.<p>Anti-monopoly efforts are nice, but the required scale of them seems incredibly unrealistic for anything that isn&#x27;t far off into the future.\nEspecially because it seems likely that for internet companies other countries would simply step in (unless you put up some china like internet firewall...).')
