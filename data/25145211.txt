That said, I think they&#x27;ve taken an untenable position.<p>Book publishing rights are usually sold as a contingent right, kind of like an option, where the publisher is allowed to print the book so long as they pay out royalties. It would be very convenient for Disney to be able to separate the right and the obligation, but that would be similar to purchasing the right to a subscription service from a bankrupt company, and deciding that one did not have to pay for it, because that obligation was left to the defunct organization.')
