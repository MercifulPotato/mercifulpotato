It’s a problem that was considered in the design of both 10G ethernet and PCIe which both use similar mechanisms.<p>Generally a key defence is the maximum packet size (you can’t keep your evil stream aligned with the scrambler) along with the huge pattern length (for PCIe g1&#x2F;2 and USB3, 10GE and PCIe g3 works differently) which means that the amount of data you’d have to send is just too large.')
