Most native speaks have little knowledge of the grammar and syntax beyond intuitive. They have forgotten most of what they&#x27;ve been taught at school, plus, they could speak quite well before going to school and being taught grammar in the first place. We acquire language by osmosis, not by studying, and even less so by studying the syntax.')
