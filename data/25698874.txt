Forcing everyone to use a phone number makes it so much harder to have a partially anonymous way to communicate.<p>I can&#x27;t help but feel this was intentional to prevent use by those wishing to remain anonymous. I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ll ever actually do this.<p>If they could have they would have done so already imo. Perhaps they are fighting whatever restrictions force them to do this. We can only hope.<p>My belief is that various governments prevent Signal from allowing anonymous registrations and will continue to prevent them from allowing it.<p>I expect that what they will allow is something like &quot;you can now register with a gmail account&quot;. That is the same restriction since you need a phone number to register for a gmail account these days.')
