So those drives can function as a backend for eg. a RocksDB substitute with a minimal software frontend.<p>But a full SQL database engine on the SSD would fall under the umbrella of <i>computational storage</i>, and so far everyone with the resources to put any of that into production has datasets that don&#x27;t fit on a single drive. So there&#x27;s less utility in having the drive speaking proper SQL, but a lot of active research into how to usefully offload some of the DB work onto compute resources that reside on the SSD itself.<p>(Also, <i>microcontroller</i> is a bit odd to use to refer to the main controller chip inside a SSD, especially a high-end enterprise SSD. It gives a completely misleading indication of scale.)')
