It&#x27;s not like when heroin becomes legal  everyone will start to take it. And even if somehow a kid obtains heroin from a legal source they&#x27;ll know dosage strength and doctors will know what to do. If you buy from a dealer you can&#x27;t know what exactly it is. Many deaths were caused by accidental overdose when dealer added cheap Chinese fentanyl to make it &quot;stronger&quot; but was too lazy to mix it properly. When you buy legal alcohol you can be sure you won&#x27;t get methanol poisoning or ingest hand sanitizer.')
