I definitely think you would have benefited from finding a cheaper datacenter, or moving your profit margins elsewhere.<p>Honestly seems really interesting sans that tidbit, would be interesting to have unlimited 100mbps but gigabit at $5&#x2F;TB or something like that. But $40 just to fill the drive is a bit much, and with being hard disk with only 4GB of RAM I&#x27;d think backups are what this is targeting, and not something with a lot of activity.<p>Looks like a hobby project so it&#x27;s no big deal, just giving my opinion.')
