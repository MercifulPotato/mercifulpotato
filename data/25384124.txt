Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607681415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369117, text='&gt; It&#x27;s hard enough to convince people that it&#x27;s worth their time to add their real voice to the cacophony of voices being recorded on election day. To risk imprisonment to add a couple more voices makes no sense.<p>But the voter fraud being alleged now isn&#x27;t one or two ballots. It&#x27;s ballot harvesting here, and lost SD cards there, voting machines not properly recognizing votes, and poll watchers not being allowed near tables. In any of these cases thousands of votes could have been altered, added, or removed.<p>We need to take this seriously, investigate, show that the fraud (which is inevitable at some level) didn&#x27;t change the election (hopefully), and tighten up the rules for next time.<p>Stuff that should be bipartisan. 1) Voting machines suck, even when they only count. 2) Recounts can&#x27;t be on the same machines as the first count. 3) Counts must stop unless poll watchers are able to watch. 4) Poll watchers should have to make a positive assertion that they could see, and did watch, or the votes should get recounted. 5) All disputed votes, either the ID or the vote marking, should be kept separate and recounts should involve reexamining the entire vote.')
