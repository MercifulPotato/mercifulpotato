How do you know if some block provider&#x27;s hashing algorithm terminates? How does your blockchain become trustless if hashing involves arbitrary code execution?<p>2) An essential property of hashing algorithm is uniform distribution. Future block hashes depend on past block hashes. In PoW this implies compute difficulty scales dynamically. If a block provider gets to choose their hashing algorithm arbitrarily, they could pick a non-uniform hashing algorithm that is easy for themselves and hard for others. In PoS this often affects who gets picked as the next block provider; having control over the hashing function in either case means you can pick yourself again.<p>If your claim is to let market forces pick the most trusted hashing algorithms, why not just settle on a fixed-but-extensible list of hashing algorithms that are known to work well today?<p>Making governance a part of the protocol is all the hype.<p>But there has to exist a protocol with boundaries.<p>Otherwise, your blockchain is just the internet.<p>You can download my block now.')
