(Virtually all amateur matches.) If you are horrible (or blatantly biased) at calling lines, your opponent can call the tournament referee, and you may end up with a line judge. But that takes time, and only happens <i>after</i> you aggravate your opponent. If you wait until a key moment to make a bad call in your favor, your opponent won&#x27;t be able to reverse it, even if they call the referee and get a third party to call the lines for the rest of the match.<p>This is a particularly big issue in competitive junior tennis, unfortunately.')
