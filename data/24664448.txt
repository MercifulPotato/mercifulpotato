Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[24665236, 24664627], score=None, time=1601657178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663910, text='The fact the money is fungible should not be allowed to obscure the fact that money (the form in which capital is moved around) is a complex social agreement that exists only because of a highly evolved and history-dependent set of rules. Talking about money as &quot;your property&quot; typically bypasses the real nature of money, and encourages people to uncritically buy into a conservative&#x2F;libertarian perspective that plays with people&#x27;s sense of fairness to the interest of only those in positions of existing wealth and power.<p>The fact that one can &quot;move capital&quot; to other countries <i>at all</i> is not some law of nature, but a deliberate political choice. Had the choice been made in some other direction (such as taxing currency conversions), a totally different pathway would emerge. The fact that one choice appears to involve &quot;removing&quot; constraints and the other appears to involve &quot;adding&quot; constraints makes it appear as though one of them is somehow closer to the natural order or things. But the very existence of money at all is not part of the natural order of things, and the preference for choices that avoid constraints just favors the status quo over change.')
