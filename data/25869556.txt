Looking at wikipedia, the company was formed in 1993, has a revenue of $3.4 billion, and 13400 employees. By IT sector standards, that&#x27;s decent but far from spectacular.<p>Partly due to releasing all their code as OSS, they have poor pricing power over their primary product (support and services (RHEL)) as that&#x27;s a commodified market with a bunch of competitors who are happy to take their business (offering support for CentOS or other RHEL rebuilds) if they charge too much, or customers might just decide they have the in-house knowledge to support themselves.')
