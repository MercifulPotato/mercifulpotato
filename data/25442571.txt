That is they place orders in the market that form the bid&#x2F;ask spread. So I&#x27;ll be an HFT and market make quoting $90 bid, $100 ask for S&amp;P500. This means if you were to buy 1 lot and sell 1 lot it&#x27;d cost you $10 (you bought at 100 and sold again at 90). The reason I have a spread between bid and ask is because I&#x27;m taking a risk that someone will take me up on the offer, the market will move against me and I&#x27;ll lose money. Now, I install a much faster connection to the exchange, which means I can respond to market events faster, and so if the market moves against me I can move my position or cancel my orders or I can buy a hedge much quicker. So the risk of losing money is lower, so now I can quote $94 bid, $96 ask. By quoting tighter I can beat my competitors and more people will trade against me. So now you can buy 1 lot, sell 1 lot and it&#x27;ll cost you $2.<p>So the better these HFT firms are, the less it costs you to get in and out of the positions you want.')
