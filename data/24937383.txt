You bought yourself a $500, $1000, or $1500 cert based on the level of liability insurance you needed if someone &quot;broke the encryption&quot;.  The extra money does help pay for extra betting by the issuing authority, theoretically.<p>The thing is, just charging extra money would probably work for the most part, even if it isn&#x27;t all that fair.  Also, how do I set myself up as the authority you need to pay $$$$$ to for a certificate?  That seems like a pretty sweet market to be in. ;)')
