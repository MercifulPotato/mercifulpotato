Evangelical Christians are a subset of Christians that are widely known to be a key voting block for the republican party.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anti-semetic to criticize Israel. The thing NOT to do is imply that Israel (or the Jews) operate the US like a puppet state. The idea that jews secretly control the peoples of the world is a trope from nazi propaganda and so it is important to carefully state criticisms so as to not imply that.<p>If the US really were a puppet state, it would be fair to say, but in reality it is rather the reverse. It can be difficult to see that because we do not talk about US imperialism and the neo-colonial goals of the US state security apparatus. As I stated in another comment, Israel lobbies the US for favors and often they are granted because our governments wish to maintain a security relationship. It can be sometimes difficult to thread that needle, but it is possible to do in good faith. The Israel  lobby does attack people who make criticisms in good faith though... which is permitted because if people saw Israel as an apartheid state, the US would be pressured to terminate our security relationship.<p>In summary, this is a complex issue. To be honest, Israel&#x27;s apartheid behavior and militarism is giving fuel to hate by muddying the waters so much. If they would quit that shit, it would make life a lot easier for every honest person trying to talk about these issues.')
