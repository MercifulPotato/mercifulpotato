The investment is not high for 2TB, since I’ve been using pCloud for 3 years already, it paid for itself anyway. At the beginning I had some concerns losing my data in case of bankrupt of the company. But here I am – 3 years later, and so far, I’m happy with their services. And to be honest, in these uncertain times we live, I’d rather take the chance and try something new and useful than asking all the time “what if”.')
