These are people who build the economy, generate IP, and create jobs in the long run. Not only that, but these people who have spent 4+ years in the US university education system are extremely well-adapted to life in the US and will thrive at making the US a better place.<p>(Yes there&#x27;s OPT, but it&#x27;s not long enough and doesn&#x27;t provide a path to permanent residency.)')
