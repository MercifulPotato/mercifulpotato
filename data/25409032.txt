This is really cool.<p>I think part of the problem with just swinging to the absolute other end is, unless you&#x27;re just interested in psychology, reading the &quot;other side&quot; is only of real value if you&#x27;re reading <i>quality</i>, or at least good arguments made in good faith.<p>At the extremes there seems to be a much higher tendency for the authors themselves to be deep in the echo chambers of their respective ideologies, as well as a higher likelyhood that its target audience is more forgiving of poor content as long as it hits close enough to the mark. Blindly selecting content by a strict point of view would seem to result in lower value overall.<p>Not to say there isn&#x27;t good reading out there in the extremes, but the level of chaff to sort through to find a decent seed is just too damn high.<p>The value is ultimately in finding good content and not just an opposing point of view. Whenever I can find both at the same time, those are the real keepers.')
