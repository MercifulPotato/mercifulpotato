Item(by='rhizome', descendants=None, kids=[24975379], score=None, time=1604353903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972826, text='My Dad used to like telling a story about how when BART first opened, none of the trains had overhead bars because the trains were supposed to run so often nobody was going to have to stand.<p>It&#x27;s kind of wild that that wasted space for MUNI underground is not a bigger complaint in the main. My fantasy is that the last 20 years of tunnel computerization for MUNI was going to result in multiple trains per station, or hooking multiple lines together at the entrance of the tunnel (IIRC they did this with the Boeing trains until the Meltdown and Bredas) in order to utilize the whole station length.<p>Or shrink and simplify the MUNI parts, there&#x27;s no (apparent to a rube like me) reason MUNI stations have to be the same length as BART stations. Make &#x27;em a single block long with NYC style foyers: attendant, turnstiles, ticket machines. No flowers, no coffee, no Jehovah&#x27;s Witness tables.')
