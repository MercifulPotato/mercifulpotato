They have to develop new encryption circumvention technology for this one surveillance which weakens encryption for everyone using the encryption technology.<p>Its exactly like if you were to force the creator of PGP to build a backdoored version of PGP with the right windows signatures or something. You could just say, &quot;it will only be for new emails for the specific mailbox, as the rest are already encrypted&quot;, but then you are missing the point entirely.<p>BTW germany is currently in the process of shoving a new law though the EU which will effectively destroy all encrypted services in europe (by means of forcing backdoors&#x2F;secondary keys). Just for context.')
