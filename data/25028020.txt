Guns are very controlled in that country, you can only own a 22LR or a 38 revolver. Gun deaths are still right on par with the US. And of those quoted 39k deaths, 13k of the were homicide, with suicide taking the majority.<p>&gt; At some point you&#x27;ve got to look at that situation and think &quot;Is the fun of making things go pop worth it?&quot;<p>So again, you are taking your opinion and projecting it onto others. You may think removing guns solves gun crimes. Mexico stands blatantly against that. You may think violence stops when guns disappear, then you see knife and other brutal attacks. You are stating you don&#x27;t need them, so nobody else does. The second you the victim of some violent crime, or lose a family member you&#x27;ll change your tune, as you see tons of democrats doing now.')
