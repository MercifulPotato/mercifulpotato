The US has higher pay than both, but it&#x27;s only about 30% and you have more cost out of pocket, especially healthcare.<p>Much of the energy in London in the past 20-30 years is driven by EU nationals. A lot of multinationals and tech companies are based in the south-east to access this talent pool. Many companies have whole teams based in London serving the respective European markets (French speaking, Germans speaking, Italian speaking, etc.). This will change in the next decade or so.')
