And maybe also a higher tolerance for firing engineers who are not working out early.<p>As it is, I&#x27;m not surprised companies are reluctant to bet on the potential of untrained engineers, _and_ the chance that they&#x27;ll stick around long enough to make the investment worthwhile.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of inexperienced, uncredentialed engineers out there who would take a low-paying job with a significant chance of getting fired in 3 months. I was one of them. The alternative is to not get hired at all.')
