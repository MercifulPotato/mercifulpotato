This is unacceptable to someone in her amazing position and to be honest sounds like she is a narcissist. I think Google couldn&#x27;t wait to get rid of her (cannot blame them, she wanted to sue the company a year prior, also &quot;represented&quot; the company really bad on social media) and her email with demands was their opportunity. I don&#x27;t think she would survive in any company. She is better off starting her own company or going to academia. I don&#x27;t feel bad for her, I&#x27;m sure she already got multiple offers. Not from FB that&#x27;s for sure though :)')
