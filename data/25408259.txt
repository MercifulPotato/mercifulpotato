I’m not convinced that all semantics of “and” can be derived from set operations.<p>1) not every clause is a predicate and applying logical operators to a non-predicate makes very little sense to me.<p>2) I don’t see how ordering, time, and causation can be inferred, if you treat each clause as a predicate.<p>“I punched Bob and apologized” has a different meaning than “I apologized, and punched Bob.”<p>The AND as used in logics simply doesn’t embody this usage.<p>—-<p>It was a sloppy wording of mine to say that AND just join clauses together. I meant to say that it joins clauses together, and the relations between the clauses are not necessarily set union. Of course it can’t embody all relations, but more than set unions.')
