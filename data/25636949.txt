According to the linked Passmark page[0]:<p>&gt; This graph showing AMD and Intel market share is made up of thousands of PerformanceTest benchmark results and is updated daily.<p>&gt; This graph counts the baselines submitted to us during these time period and therefore is representative of CPUs in use rather than CPUs purchased.<p>Since this is a benchmarking site, enthusiasts are probably overrepresented. I&#x27;m positive that there are more Intel CPUs being used in desktops than AMD.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;market_share.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;market_share.html</a>')
