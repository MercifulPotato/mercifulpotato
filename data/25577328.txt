Teslas are mechanically sound, the paint and panel gaps seem to be the biggest complaint.<p>&gt; The Ford mach e is the latest one.<p>Is the build quality different than what&#x27;s in their current car and truck lines?  Ford interiors have always been utter garbage IMO.  There&#x27;s nothing like plugging a USB cable into a USB port and then trying to unplug it and the whole interior trim panel comes off instead.  And the squeaks and creaks...<p>We could compare to Fiat Chrysler who is &quot;Highest in Initial Quality&quot; by JD Powers.  The chrome starts to rub of the interior finishes inside 18 months.  The paint oxidizes on the exterior in roughly the same time.')
