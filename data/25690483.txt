Users will expect it to work (unless the docs point out it is unreliable).<p>It can&#x27;t work reliably if the coefficients of the polynomial consist of floats. At least not in general. This point is a more fundamental one than your example.<p>Also, regarding your particular example: When solving cubics using the cubic formula, it is often the case that you will end up computing with complex numbers even if the result ends up real. If you introduce floats into this, it&#x27;s impossible to guarantee that the imaginary parts will cancel out completely. Instead, they may cancel up to 10^-21 or something like that, which is precisely what happens in your example.')
