It occasionally blips and I have some reconnection logic for that but overall it&#x27;s been fine for indoor use. I have a DIY smart lock and DIY smart thermostat (that literally sit over the real lock and real thermostat -- I rent my apartment so I can&#x27;t change those out) running off a TinyPICO each and they&#x27;ve been doing fine as far as the Wi-Fi connection goes. They just run a HTTP server on my LAN and I can set the lock and thermostat states with a simple REST API. (I can&#x27;t stand the complexities around interfacing with Google Home and Alexa ...)<p>I also used a TinyPICO&#x27;s BLE interface to connect a phone with a motor driver for a mini telepresence robot [0] though a TinyPICO was probably overkill for this use case. My thinking was really just future-proofing it in case I wanted to add more stuff to the robot.<p>BTW the Wi-Fi only seems to support 2.4 GHz. No 5Ghz.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;robot-tethys" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;robot-tethys</a>')
