I wonder how it&#x27;s now when stock rised 4x in the last 4 years (probably will rise more with next relief). They have some DB online with such info.\nI&#x27;m of opinion that work is no longer profitable (and I have top non-exec salary).<p>I&#x27;m not from US but IMO federal wage is stupid but on state lvl I would urge you to implement it. I&#x27;m from Poland and I think that keeping our own currency was good for staying competitive. If we had federal EU minimum wage we would be in ruin. Actually EU mandated minimum wage recently but it&#x27;s defined as 50% of average salary which we have in our country already. Gemany has min at 41% or something like that for example.')
