If you don&#x27;t print much, you can get a HP printer for $30.<p>The cheapest Brother laser printer is $100 + ink.<p>At $1&#x2F;mo, it&#x27;s going to 6 years (thanks Ansil) for the price to work out in favor of the Brother.<p>And to the people saying brothers last forever: they don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve owned 3. When the drum wears out, the printer is trash because brother charges almost the cost of the printer for a replacement. That $100 brother has a drum that costs $89 and lasts for 12000 pages. So 12000 pages is the life of that printer.<p>Edit: Re: ink drying out. HP doesn&#x27;t consider printer cleaning and maintenance pages in their page count. So you can actually clean the printer regularly so the ink doesnt dry out, and they&#x27;ll keep sending you new cartridges.')
