You cannot sign a contract if you are a child. You can’t give up your right to basic work safety standards. The government does not allow people to enter into fundamentally abusive or exploitative agreements.  I’m all for voting with your money when it comes to quality. When it comes to basic rights to privacy for you and those around you, this is not a free market issue, it is a rights issue. The police are overstepping and it should not be allowed.')
