There is always going to be an Elite class in society. Why not let them stay there? Why do we have to play coy about the whole thing on how they are intrinsically evil when in fact they&#x27;re often the ones with some of the most heavy of burdens. I do think that it&#x27;s worth some concessions that they do get to have more luxuries in life due to that, but who cares, they were going to get them anyway. At least they&#x27;re at the forefront for everybody to be aware of and seeing their activities.<p>I&#x27;m 100% also behind this because they aren&#x27;t complete jaded &quot;rags to riches&quot; people. This is one reason why I think in the US we have such a huge issue with selfishness in general. If you worked for what you earned, it is yours. Therefore, it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s mindset to be selfish&#x2F;greedy. Whereas if you had an Elite class handle things such as this, you can rest assured everything they do isn&#x27;t solely for their self interest. They don&#x27;t do things just for money. If their morals are somewhat sound in reasoning, I can&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d overlook the cost of things much like we do in the US over literally everything.')
