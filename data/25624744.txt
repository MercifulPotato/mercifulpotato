Use the new ZGC garbage collector.<p>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions\n-XX:+UseZGC<p>2. If you&#x27;re using ZGC, it is fucking imperative you do not use compressed pointers. It will totally hose your system and you&#x27;ll see unbelievable RAM thrashing (800mb to 16gb and back again within a few hundred milliseconds in one smallish project I have [and thats on a 5950x]). That is to say, after enabling ZGC, ensure you do NOT have the following configuration line:<p>-XX:+UseCompressedOops<p>I&#x27;ve been using ZGC for a few days and I have to say it&#x27;s been fucking great. Before I&#x27;d get really long hangs due to GC; or eventually the editor would grind to a halt (after like 8 hours of usage). I&#x27;ve had the editor open for at least 48 hours now and it&#x27;s just as fast as it was when I originally opened it.')
