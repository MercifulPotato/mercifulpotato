Zack Maril here.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this research for over two years now. I got started working on it after I read everybody on Hacker News talking about how they kept getting blocked when they were crawling websites[0][1]. This has been a huge part of my life these past few years and it wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the Hacker News community, so, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.<p>If you would like to read more about this research, please check out Knuckleheads&#x27; Club[2]. I&#x27;ve published a lot of what I have so far there and plan on publishing more soon. You&#x27;re all invited to join the club and I&#x27;ll be checking this thread all day and responding to folks as best I can.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9612345" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9612345</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17941804" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17941804</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;knuckleheads.club" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;knuckleheads.club</a>')
