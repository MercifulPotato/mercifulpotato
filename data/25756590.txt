Item(by='mtlynch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610500021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753193, text='I&#x27;ve never used Parler, but I find it strange that most of the discussion around it is based on characterizations of the platform without evidence, so I was interested to see an article with actual evidence.<p>But the evidence in this article didn&#x27;t seem to match the claims. To prove that Parler banned people with different political views, they show a screenshot of CEO John Matze posting this message:<p>&gt;<i>To all the ANTIFA supporters who have been spinning up Parler accounts... next time you should leave your chat server private... Im pretty sad you guys kicked me out... PS. Your VPNs can&#x27;t save you</i><p>The article author treats that as evidence that Matze indiscriminately kicked out people who identify as part of Antifa. I think it&#x27;s hard to tell from that screenshot alone, but my reading of the quote is that Matze found a public chat server where Antifa members were conspiring to create Parler accounts strictly for the sake of disrupting the platform. I don&#x27;t view this as political censorship.<p>The article also paints Matze as hypocritical for banning Parler users who disrupt conversations by spamming porn or pictures of feces. That doesn&#x27;t seem hypocritical to me, either. You can be welcoming to alternative viewpoints while still enforcing rules that encourage constructive discussion.')
