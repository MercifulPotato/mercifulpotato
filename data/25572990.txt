A significant portion of the issue comes down to the amount of manufacturing that has gone overseas, and with a lot of those at the top having tax havens and&#x2F;or being incorporated out of the US, the use of financial gains taxes would do very little to curb the tide.<p>And despite the increased cost in a lot of things, I think a trade war with China is largely inevitable.  As to the increased costs, maybe it would actually get people to think about what they&#x27;re doing, and other points of concern like Right To Repair legislation.  The fact that we buy so many things in our day to day lives that don&#x27;t even make it 5 years is fucking ridiculous.')
