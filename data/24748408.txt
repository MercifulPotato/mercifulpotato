These are still sum types.<p>C-style enums are sugar for defining an integer type alias and a bunch of constants without creating any new types or scope.<p>Rust enums, even with an assigned value, define a new type that can only be one of the defined values. So this type is not an integer and cannot have a bit pattern that isn&#x27;t explicitly defined.')
