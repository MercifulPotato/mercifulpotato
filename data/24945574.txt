Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604083802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944255, text='&gt; I would argue that the number of gatekeepers to nationwide mainstream dialog is much higher than 3 or 4 individuals. I think the number is too small, but 3 or 4 seems to me to be an incredibly hyperbolic number of individuals to name as gatekeepers to the entire marketplace of ideas.  If you think only 3 or 4 people control the entire marketplace of ideas for &quot;reputable members of society&quot;, then you should be able to exhaustively name them. Who are these 3 or 4 people that control all of reputable society?<p>Hence the italicized portion from my prior comment: &quot;So that takes the pool of people deciding from hundreds of millions (in the USA) down to like 3 or 4 individuals (<i>depending on how final decision making power is distributed</i>)&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s try to minimize not acknowledging uncertainty qualifiers that are literally written within comments please.<p>Since we seem to be now in the mode of hyper-dissection of assertions, hyperbole, etc, and I <i>may have</i> committed the sin of being off by a couple hundred people, what would this same level of scrutiny come up with when taken to your claim:<p>&gt;&gt; But if <i>all reputable members of society</i> decide not to associate with an idea...it&#x27;s losing in the marketplace.<p>Which of these two numbers would be larger in your estimation?<p>([All members of society] - [People who control a major publishing platform])<p>([People who control a major publishing platform] - [4])<p>...where [All adult members of society - USA] = ~250 million<p>...where [Twitter Users - USA] = ~68 million<p>...where [Facebook Users - USA] = ~235 million<p>...where [YouTube Users - USA] = ~126 million<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demographics_of_the_United_States#Population" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demographics_of_the_United_Sta...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;242606&#x2F;number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;242606&#x2F;number-of-active-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;408971&#x2F;number-of-us-facebook-users&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;408971&#x2F;number-of-us-face...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;296227&#x2F;us-youtube-reach-age-gender&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;296227&#x2F;us-youtube-reach-...</a><p>&gt; It&#x27;s almost like there&#x27;s a monopoly concern I raised, and that the power is concentrated in too few hands.<p>I would say it&#x27;s exactly that, and also other things.  I don&#x27;t consider myself in disagreement on that point.<p>&gt; I did advocate for treating this as an anti-monopoly issue instead of a free speech issue after all!<p>It is literally both, so I think we should treat it as both.<p>I wonder though...might the problem be not so much my math, but more so that I happen to hold an unacceptable opinion on the matter of censorship, in general?  Based on voting patterns on anti-censorship comments (most of which contain no mathematics), I&#x27;m leaning towards the latter.  Considering the way the wind is blowing on such matters, maybe people like me should start toeing the party line around here, lest the very topic of conversation pays a personal visit to our doorstep.')
