V-0 like that filament means it will extinguish itself within a maximum of 10 seconds after the ignition source is removed.<p>Regular filament acts more like an accelerant, put a flame near it and it burns quite vigorously, and for a long time. Meaning anything near it that can burn will likely catch fire too.')
