Really, that&#x27;s the only issue with it and we&#x27;ve determined that it&#x27;s not software. It just lasts much, much less than it did a year ago. So I tried to get the battery replaced as I was willing to pay Apple for it. An Apple tech hooked it up and got a battery health report and basically came back and said, the battery wasn&#x27;t degraded enough to qualify for the battery replacement service ($99). So my only option is, full device replacement ($375-ish).<p>I was told that the battery has to qualify for battery replacement on some devices. That&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t replace batteries on an iPad Pro - they always replace the entire device so unless you quality for the battery program, your only option is device replacement. Which they will do if I want but at a much greater cost. That&#x27;s almost 1&#x2F;2 the cost of what I originally paid for it.<p>I was told this directly by an Apple store employee this week. He said he literally can&#x27;t select the battery replacement option unless he can prove that it is the battery and without the health report saying so, he doesn&#x27;t know any way he could.')
