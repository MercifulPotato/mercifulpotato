One thing that I find as more theaters have a bar out front where you can order a cocktail or a big 20oz draft beer is that I can&#x27;t enjoy such things because I&#x27;ll inevitably have to get up to hit the bathroom at some point during the movie.<p>At home, we can pause for bathroom breaks, snacks, etc. once or twice during a movie without too much interruption but with zero missing of scenes or annoying people as you squeeze back and forth down the rows when you need to get up.')
