The protocol and client haven&#x27;t been developed to where they can work reliably in a real P2P scenario. IPFS only appears to work because most requests go strait to one of the big gateways which already has the content cached.<p>Development of IPFS slowed to a crawl when most of Protocol Labs switched to working on Filecoin.
