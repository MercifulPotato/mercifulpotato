Item(by='donmcronald', descendants=None, kids=[25382591], score=None, time=1607654742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380072, text='Except you&#x27;ll have the Volkswagon silo, the Ford silo, the GM silo, etc. and they&#x27;ll all start engaging in monopolistic behavior for servicing because they have a monopoly over repairing your specific brand of car.  Call it a tacit collusion monopoly and throw in the sunk cost of a car to make it even worse.  If everyone in the market behaves the same, there&#x27;s no benefit to selling your car and getting another because the service costs won&#x27;t change.<p>The best example of this that demonstrates what you&#x27;d end up with is the cost of key fob programming.  The actual cost of the hardware is trivial but a dealership will charge you $250-500 to program a new one because they have a monopoly on programming the fobs for their brand.  Those things should cost $50 max IMO.<p>The scary thing is the vehicle industry is moving this way for everything and if nothing changes it&#x27;s eventually going to become extremely difficult &#x2F; expensive to own a vehicle that&#x27;s not under warranty.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they start serializing parts and then sell service plans that increase in price as your car ages.  You&#x27;ll pay forever.')
