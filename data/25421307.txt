However, Apple seems to be going in the direction of having many many hardware accelerators builtin to their SoC and integrated into their software ecosystem. I assume that if Google and Amazon were to build their own chips, they&#x27;d do the same. Those accelerators will not be intercompatible, and we&#x27;ll have a dozen different vendored drivers, like how GPUs work.')
