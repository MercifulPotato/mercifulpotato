Item(by='hundchenkatze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611693451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25918984, text='The way mine is configured allows me to get to top sites in 3 taps if I&#x27;m already looking at a site.<p>You can disable &quot;Scroll to hide toolbar&quot; in Customize to remove step 1. Steps 2 and 3 are still required but moving the address bar to the bottom keeps your taps closer together (The plus actually ends up right over the boxed number so you can double tap pretty quickly). You can also get rid of step 4 by disabling &quot;Show search engines&quot; in search settings. Now when you tap (+) the address&#x2F;search bar will still be focused but the top sites are still accessible.')
