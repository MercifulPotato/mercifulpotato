E2EE is between two devices, a receiver and a sender.<p>I don&#x27;t get it. Does that mean if I have PGP installed on my desktop, and I also have a VNC server installed on it, it&#x27;s no longer E2E? That seems like an arbitrary distinction to me. If you extend this further, you could also argue that being able to print out the message, or even have a second person look at the screen breaks E2E. I think the main point of E2E is that unauthorized third parties (including service providers) can&#x27;t read the message, not that only two devices can read the message.')
