I used Ubuntu desktop as a daily driver for a few years. After a year or so of use boot filled up and the whole thing wouldn&#x27;t update any more. Finding a resolution to that was a pain in the ass. Turns out I should have done something other than accept the defaults when installing the OS, or known to clear out un-needed kernels from boot periodically.<p>At another point during an upgrade from one LTS edition to another, the DWM was switched out but something happened during the transition and the logon screen booted up to the old, unusable DWM&#x2F;interface. Had to boot at a different runlevel and point the boot config at the correct DWM.<p>These are the kind of issues which keep Linux on the desktop limited to enthusiasts only. I have worked professionally with Linux for many years, but at home I just want shit that runs itself. I can recover from these kinds of problems but that&#x27;s my leisure time shot to shit for the evening and that&#x27;s a very different equation to fixing issues on the clock (or in leisure time where I&#x27;m specifically electing to tackle something tech-related e.g. in the homelab).<p>Then I discovered my ageing Windows 7 licenses on the machines would still upgrade to Win10 just fine and that was the end of Linux on the desktop for me for a while.')
