If you can only push through one of the two politically it&#x27;s not clear to me an ICE ban is the right choice.<p>In ten years at the current rate of progress, EVs will be well past their tipping point economically and sales will crater anyway. If you add substantial carbon tax on the fuel, they&#x27;re done.<p>And a carbon tax will help with all sorts of other emissions, transportation being only about 10%.<p>A new car sales ban does help car companies see the writing on the wall, but in the EU the direction is crystal clear anyway.<p>I feel like pointing at a graph of carbon in the atmosphere is an unfair response to the parent comment, who isn&#x27;t denying the problem and is just talking tactics.')
