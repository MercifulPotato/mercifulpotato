What a disgracefully unprofessional reaction. And what an awful person to have to try to work with.<p>Imagine you land a well-paid cushy job at one of the best employers in the world, with the explicit task of recruiting other members of your race to also enjoy that prestigious privilege to the exclusion of others (not to mention the social prestige you gain with that power), imagine being informed that you intimidate coworkers and blaming them, imagine being told that you&#x27;re difficult to understand and becoming irate rather than considering improvement, imagine being put on performance improvement plans and having your generous pay reduced and managing to blame racism rather than even considering you may have some shortcomings, and imagine after they&#x27;ve put up with this behaviour for years before finally having enough, you go and unleash a highly damaging expletive-laden rant on social media. I can&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t want to hear about &#x27;white privilege&#x27; ever again.')
