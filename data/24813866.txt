Even if you subscribe to the philosophy that multi-million royalties -&gt; success, there&#x27;s no contradiction.  The only way that would be a contradiction is if the marketing team is the one that &quot;landed&quot; that deal.  (And that deal isn&#x27;t even new.  Mozilla and Google have had similar deals forever.)')
