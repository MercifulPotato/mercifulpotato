So far I was using Tachyons (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tachyons.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tachyons.io&#x2F;</a>) and elm-ui (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elm-ui.netlify.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elm-ui.netlify.app&#x2F;</a>). Is there a chance that Tailwind would be better for small &#x2F; medium sized projects than these? Based on your comment it looks like. The only problem with Tailwind just by looking at the default settings was its size. I was reading somewhere that you can greatly reduce that. Your second point sounds pretty good (almost like a discriminated union for CSS)')
