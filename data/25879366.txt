You <i>can</i> drive from Austin to Big Bend NP in an electric car.  I didn&#x27;t know you could now buy a Tesla with a 400m range.<p>Of course that longer range Model S costs $65K, not $48K. And you have to drive 55mph, with the heater off to get that range.  Which, in West Texas, is 30 mph under the posted speed limit for many roads. And (I apologize for moving the goal posts) when most people get to Big Bend they don&#x27;t want to turn around at the entrance and go back to the closest charger -- they want to drive around and see things and maybe vist Terlingua or Alpine or Ft Davis. Maybe they want to spend several days in the area but that&#x27;s not an option in an EV.  Thats probably why I&#x27;ve never seen one in Big Bend.<p>I drive out there often from Austin.   I drive a 2004 Sienna which I bought for about $4000.  The $61K I save by not buying a Tesla would buy me 700,000 miles in my ICE.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evstationslocal.com&#x2F;states&#x2F;texas&#x2F;79834&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evstationslocal.com&#x2F;states&#x2F;texas&#x2F;79834&#x2F;</a>')
