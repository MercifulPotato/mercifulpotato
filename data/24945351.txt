But let&#x27;s look at the case.<p>A woman in question has a reasonably common belief that offends you and I think is not in accord with the facts.  She is open about her belief, but also has apparently made an attempt to be polite in personal interactions with others.  (See paragraph 41 for example.)<p>Despite the ruling coming down against her, I read this and think that she has a right to have and express that opinion.  That when we suppress the expression of opinions like this, they don&#x27;t go away.  Instead they become stronger.<p>Some of her opinions I agree with, and some not.<p>Here is an example where I disagree.  I don&#x27;t think that female only spaces should exclude transwomen.  I also don&#x27;t think that my opinion on that should matter because such spaces should exclude me.  However based on the fact that most women do not agree with her, they such spaces will include them.  Hooray.  She is free to make her own space that excludes though, and anyone who wants can join her.  That&#x27;s called free association.<p>Here is an example where I agree with her.  People born male have a significant biological advantage in many sports.  This is historically the reason why we separated men and women for sports such as tennis and running.  As a result, trans and intersex women have a significant advantage in the same sports.  See Caster Semenya for a famous example.  I do not think it is at all unreasonable to ban people who retain that advantage from participating as women in such sports.<p>Now let&#x27;s compare her belief to one that is more obviously protected.<p>I&#x27;m an atheist and believe in science.  I have worked with fundamentalist Christians who honestly believe that the world is 6000 years old, and that I&#x27;m going to Hell.  And have told me such in as many words.  As you can guess, I didn&#x27;t enjoy it.  But we were able to maintain cordial relations in the workplace, and I wouldn&#x27;t ask them to be fired for expressing an opinion that they honestly held.  Despite my opinions about their opinion.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m for free speech.  Whether or not people agree with me, or I with them.')
