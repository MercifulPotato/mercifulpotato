My 83 year old Mom with multiple issues views those tools as something only an old lady needs, and so rejects them. She can use Facebook with the same level of skill as it takes to make and receive the phone calls that the social internet supplanted.<p>Right now, &quot;elderly&quot; is largely people who were born before most people owned televisions, and technological solutions aren&#x27;t always greeted with a &quot;yay, more!&quot; attitude. I&#x27;m sure a lot of prewar and boomer people stopped wanting to learn yet another piece of &quot;modern tech&quot; somewhere between TiVo and smart phones.')
