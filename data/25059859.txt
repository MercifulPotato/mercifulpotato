There are also several series of &quot;problem books&quot; out there, that are nothing but hundreds and hundreds of problems (and solutions) for a given subject. They tend to have titles like &quot;The Humongous Book of Calculus Problems&quot; or &quot;The Humongous Book of Algebra Problems&quot;, or &quot;1001 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra&quot;, etc.<p>I also buy cheap used copies of older editions of various text-books to supplement the video stuff. When you don&#x27;t have to worry about using the latest version because it&#x27;s required for a class, you can find some really cheap deals.')
