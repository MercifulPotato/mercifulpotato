If you increase everyone else&#x27;s risk by racing, you are being a selfish prick.<p>There is no way to wave this away with &quot;it&#x27;s ok to take risk for fun&quot; or &quot;risk is inherent to live&quot;. You are talking about risking other people&#x27;s lives for a thrill, that you could easily get differently, without risking the live of bystanders! You can literally race the lemons 500 with an investment of 500 bucks!')
