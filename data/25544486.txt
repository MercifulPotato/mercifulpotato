Item(by='parsimo2010', descendants=None, kids=[25544776], score=None, time=1609000899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544393, text='Well in that case, my edit is inaccurate but the main comment stands.  I won&#x27;t fix the edit so that people won&#x27;t get confused by your comment.<p>But I will rant that the article&#x2F;blog doesn&#x27;t have a publishing date at the top or bottom of the article, nor the URL.  Plus, they don&#x27;t seem to define a firm end date, they usually just referred to the present.  So I&#x27;m not ashamed by not realizing the article was from 2018, because apparently the only way to pick that out is by noticing their stock chart cuts off in 2018 and they have no mention of current events.')
