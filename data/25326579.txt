It works fine under Windows WSL2 currently, see:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;sysadmin&#x2F;podman-windows-wsl2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;sysadmin&#x2F;podman-windows-wsl2</a><p>The Podman team is working on it but it&#x27;s not quite there yet.  Podman now has an API so at a minimum the whole opaque VM thing should be usable here soon.  podman-machine and boot2podman already work for some people, although they didn&#x27;t work for me.<p>I have a dream of using a lightweight Fedora Core OS VM on Mac&#x2F;Windows for running the containers with a podman-remote client seamlessly driving it from the Mac user space.  Once podman-remote is working, that&#x27;s my next plan ;-)<p>A self plug here, I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye open for all of these things and will blog about once I get it reliably working.  I&#x27;ll be submitting it to the Red Hat developer blog but I cross publish everything I write to medium as well in case you want to look for it:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;</a>  I&#x27;m also starting to tweet when I blog (I&#x27;m finally getting serious about it now haha)  @Freedom_Ben on twitter.')
