I get more done and have more free time to work on unplanned projects&#x2F;spikes exploring new tech or rethinking old problems that could be solved better.<p>&gt; I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of shifting those costs to me.<p>If your employer doesn&#x27;t pay for these things (I&#x27;m assuming no one has gotten elec&#x2F;heat, but I do get my internet bill paid for) you can deduct these on your taxes as a portion of your home if you have a side business like a saas or app or some consulting and reduce your taxible profits.  Take a the wasted commute time and put it towards a LLC for yourself :)<p>&gt; Hell, I miss BART in all its loud and smelly glory.<p>Who misses the single most time sink in our lives??  If yuo need &quot;alone time&quot; why not go for a walk, jog, or bike ride?  Mental and physical health all in one go vs a sedentary ride to a sedentary job<p>The rest of the stuff is either personal preference or where you chose to live')
