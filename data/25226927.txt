This would mean all workers approve what their companies are doing. There are many warehouse workers at Amazon who hate several aspects of  their company. Nevertheless, they still work there as they need to feed their families. That&#x27;s one point.<p>Second, Facebook is not a tobacco or gun manufacturing company. Their main business is advertising, and they made several grave errors on the way, and they continue to do certain wrong things, but as much as you can hate them you can&#x27;t morally equate any communication platform with planned genocide. It&#x27;s shifting responsibility from actual people who commit attrocities to a platform that makes it easier for them to communicate. Yes, FB is easier to blame, but this approach misses the main point.')
