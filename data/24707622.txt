(Maybe spent 4 or 5 hours total, distributed in several months. I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm him or anything).<p>I found that pico-8 is an excellent platform for doing this kind of collaborative thing. I can do the programming (for now) and draw basic sprites (for now). He&#x27;s the art director, and provides game design ideas. It&#x27;s fun, although he gets frustrated when I am &quot;writing&quot; too much time. But I think the idea that &quot;games are made out of letters and graphics&quot; is already permeating into him. I would love to teach him the programming part, but I will wait for him to express some interest on it first (after he learns how to read). If he prefers the graphics (or doing something else) that&#x27;s fine too.')
