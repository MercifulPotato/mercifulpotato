Item(by='tartoran', descendants=None, kids=[24791779], score=None, time=1602781572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790606, text='No, Yelp was extorting a friend&#x27;s small food business. He had lots of 5 star reviews, but only a handful of bad reviews (supposedly made up) were showing up on the main page. Yelp contacted him at some point and offered to fix the reviews if he signed some kind of contract with them that amounted to around $2000 of monthly advertising on their site. He told them on the phone he couldn&#x27;t afford that, he was a small business guy. Couple of days later 2 corporate guys in suits came down to his business, uninvited, to talk business which of course still didn&#x27;t make sense, nothing had changed and he could not afford that type of money. He ran some numbers in his head and asked if they could send him business instead and make a cut, but their offer wasn&#x27;t guaranteeing any new business, just crappy advertising on yelp. The bad reviews not only stayed on but started to multiply he turned yelp&#x27;s offer down. Yelp is not anybody&#x27;s friend and their business model is very unhealthy. I&#x27;m not surprised others review companies such as glassdoor resort to similar tactics. These are proconsumer in the beginning stages then they get corrupted.')
