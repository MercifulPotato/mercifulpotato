Voter ID requirements have quantifiable effects on the amount of voter fraud that is committed.<p>Looking at any half-decent estimates of the size of those effects will show that you&#x27;re drawing a false equivalence. There simply is no quantitative argument in support of voter ID requirements, because the kind of fraud they defend against is already practically non-existent and definitely not prevalent enough to sway the outcome of elections.<p>Analyzing voter ID as a voter suppression technique shows it easily has more harmful impact on election integrity than its notional benefits of preventing the kind of fraud that doesn&#x27;t really happen to begin with. And this is why any calls for the institution of voter ID requirements in the US should not be taken at face value.<p>Your comment would have made a much stronger argument if you hadn&#x27;t tossed in such an obvious, tired and deeply flawed talking point.')
