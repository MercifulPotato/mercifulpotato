I have a few set up:<p>- Play a chime&#x2F;alert over my Sonos system if a door gets left open for longer than a minute (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;labzilla.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;homeassistant-door-chime" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;labzilla.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;homeassistant-door-chime</a>).<p>- Turn off my window air conditioners when I leave my apartment for more than 15 minutes, and turn them back on again when I&#x27;m within a block of my apartment (or if it gets above 80 degrees).<p>- Automatically turn on lights when I come home.<p>- Play a chime&#x2F;alert over the Sonos when laundry is finished (I use a SmartThings button to trigger a timer; one tap = 30 minutes wash, double tap = 45 minute dry.)<p>I also have a few cron jobs to move automatic backup files from my colo server to my NAS at home. I use healthchecks.io to automatically alert me if the job fails to run.')
