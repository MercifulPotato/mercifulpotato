I don&#x27;t think finance is really moving to SV. The weather is great, lots of great, important companies, and the investing climate is insane, but &quot;finance&quot; as it is in NYC is more global in nature. I think SF will continue to rise as a peer to NYC but I&#x27;m not sure I force anything supplanting NYC as the finance capital. Proximity to trading platforms, and a quick flight to Europe, for example, are some of the unsung benefits.')
