Item(by='Joeri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605351973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25091316, text='I love my T460p, which is a lot like that T440, but a macbook it is not. There are no good macbook pro level screens to be had on those older thinkpads, the trackpad is abysmal, and the machine as a whole is cumbersome to carry around. Also, those 4th gen cpu’s in the T440p are getting long in the tooth, new machines are a lot more snappy (especially single core). On the plus side you have a nice selection of ports (but no thunderbolt) and the best laptop keyboard in the industry, and of course the repairability factor. I’d say that if you’re optimizing for developer comfort, other and newer laptops are better, but getting an older thinkpad is a bit like getting an older car for day to day usage, it is something for enthusiasts or people on a budget who are handy.<p>The pinebook is somewhat underpowered, if someone is considering a macbook and looking at linux alternatives then a system76 laptop or dell xps developer edition is more up their alley budget-wise and will be a far better experience to actually use.<p>I think as a community we sort of have to come to terms with the notion that repairability is dead. All modern laptops are basically mostly unrepairable, and when they break the old one gets recycled to component metals and you have to get a new one. On the plus side, they break less often. Repairable laptops in turn are just not as nice to use, so they will keep losing in the market. I only see this changing through regulation that forces a right to repair, but if that means thin and lights like a macbook air can no longer be sold, is that really better?')
