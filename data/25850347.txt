CS (same time as the much more accomplished Bryan Cantrill), the department had a good relationship with Sun, so students got to play with cool R&amp;D stuff, like Self and Oak (Java).<p>As I&#x27;ve mentioned before on HN, the research around Self did a few neat things we use today, and is worth looking at:<p>* JIT compilation and runtime optimization,<p>* prototype-based object model (and not just this, which we then saw in JS, but Self did this when OO was hot and it seemed everyone thought class-instance was the way to go, and only recently has mainstream PL been moving away from class-instance), and<p>* the direct-manipulation morphs world, which seemed to go back to some of the promise of the PARC Smalltalk work (before UI thinking turned &quot;and here&#x27;s some examples of the kinds of interactive graphical objects we could have&quot; to &quot;these is the set of approved standard business form GUI widgets by which all shall abide&quot;).<p>Those are the ones that I noticed and recall, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were more.<p>If you want to play with morphs worlds today, besides what&#x27;s in Self, I think Squeak has seen a lot of activity.  In any case, it&#x27;s also worth at least reading some of the seminal research papers around Self.<p>BTW, the text aliasing in the screenshots didn&#x27;t look that sharp on a CRT. :)')
