You can&#x27;t break up tech companies; we&#x27;ve been through this before with Microsoft.<p>What happens is, congress breaks up a big tech company then the people who started said big tech company invest large sums of money into the next generation of tech companies and effectively control them.  The next set of boy geniuses get to be the face of these new companies for recreating ideas that the big monopolists weren&#x27;t allowed to finish because they were broken up.<p>See Microsoft and Facebook; Mark Zuckerberg is the &quot;boy genius&quot; who recreated an idea that wasn&#x27;t allowed to be completed by Microsoft.<p>See Bill Gates starting Microsoft recreating a bunch of ideas that weren&#x27;t allowed to be completed by Xerox.')
