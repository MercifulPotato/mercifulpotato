One day, we might be able to observe that empirically, in the same way we can examine source code versions of computer software in order to make informed statements about the aetiology of forked code.  Today, we can&#x27;t do that.<p>We can only guess at the origins of people&#x27;s thoughts, and when the thoughts come from our own selves, no advantage or insight is conferred.  That is considered in the Scientific American essay I linked to above.  Do you have any constructive criticism to offer about that essay?<p>Einstein noted the limitations of this ontological discussion as well, in the   preface clause of his remarks to Besso &quot;In so far as I can be aware, the immediate influence of D Hume on me was greater.&quot;<p>My point is that Einstein&#x27;s awareness, like your own and my own awareness of where our own thoughts come from, is slim.  That&#x27;s an entirely different thing to wanting to associate ourselves and our ideas with great figures in history.  On that point, Einstein and I both know that great minds think alike.')
