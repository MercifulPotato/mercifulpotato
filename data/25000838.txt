Now we are approaching the space exploration era (hopefully) again. With SpaceX ambitious plans for reaching Mars as soon as 2024 (even lets say 2028 with all the delays) a new challenge will come.<p>Radio signals take about 3-5 seconds for a round trip between Earth and Moon. Much less for ISS. But with Mars it will be a matter of 6-44 minutes with a fairly &quot;bad signal&quot;. And communications with other human beings (and of course getting access to the vast amount of knowledge) is fairly crucial for a modern human.<p>So, what do you think will be a future of a &quot;long-delay&quot; communications? &quot;Old-school&quot; minimal bandwidth protocols? Using a pre-compiled local knowledge bases? Data compressing algorithms with huge dictionaries? Hope for entangled particles use for communication?<p>And how it can change our experience of communications as well?')
