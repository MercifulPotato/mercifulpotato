You don&#x27;t have to worry about certain classes of errors, because they just can&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s the same with garbage collection, you can stop worrying about managing memory, for the most part.<p>However, if you can&#x27;t do your job without these helpers at all, that&#x27;s going to be a problem. At some point, there will be something that your garbage collector can not clean up for you. There will be state that is going to be mutated, whether you like it or not. Your brain should be prepared for that.')
