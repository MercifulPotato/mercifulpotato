We had a tool called `just` that integrated with the existing Java infrastructure, including Node version and dependency management, but it was a bit of a hack that predictably became a core part of the foundation.<p>Worse, onboarding took longer than it needed to, because every new hire had to learn the alternate &quot;just&quot; universe. I can&#x27;t begin to count how much time was wasted because people subconsciously fell back to the &quot;normal&quot; npm or Yarn commands they were used to, mysteriously putting their project into a bad state, costing them and support engineers valuable time.<p>We&#x27;ve been able to replace that legacy infrastructure with Volta and Yarn, and working on JavaScript projects finally feels like a first class citizen.<p>What I appreciate about Volta is two things:<p>1. It treats the _entire_ toolchain (including npm or Yarn) as important, not just the Node version.<p>2. It&#x27;s fast. Like, really fast. Tools like nvm never previously felt slow to me, but now that I&#x27;ve used Volta for the better part of a year, going back feels like they&#x27;re running in molasses.')
