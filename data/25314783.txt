Even a modest telescope can provide you views of the solar system as well as deep sky objects that can take your breath away. If I could, a couple suggestions that can enhance your enjoyment of your scope as you become familiar with it and the sky.<p>First, keep a log of each viewing session. Note time and date, location, sky conditions, what you viewed. If you&#x27;re so inclined, make sketches of what you see. Its nice, later on, to have a record of what you&#x27;ve look at and how it may have changed when you go back to it.<p>Second, find a local astronomy club you feel comfortable with. Most people will go out of their way to help a newbie. Attend any star parties that they may hold. They&#x27;re great ways to see how others work and to see what other types of scopes can do. You will also learn how to better use what you have.<p>In any case, enjoy your scope. They can be great fun and they really bring home how wonderous the skies are.')
