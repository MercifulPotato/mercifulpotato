My best friend had directed a film called Where the Day Takes You about homeless kids in Hollywood.<p>A Harvard lawyer I knew added me to her non profit and asked me to produce a documentary about homeless teenagers in Colorado.<p>I wanted to call it STATE OF NEGLECT and push for an efficient form of social programs ran by the state. My infinitely educated friend, she was a project attorney, had no concept of filmmaking or project management. She tried to put a bad director with no technical production in charge with me.<p>Harvard lawyer was scared Comcast wouldn’t give us $25 million so she asked me to sanitize the criticism towards state foster programs. Months later, her foundation closed.<p>In Where the Day Takes You, it was Will Smith’s movie. Tom Cruise’s partner Paula was my best friend’s agent at the time. This and the CIA is how I know about the UFO scientology religion by Kit and Hal.<p>Of course, Hacker News shadowbanned me for this comment on my other account. Even though I work with the Office of Director of National Intelligence and JASON Group. My friend is currently the Chair of the Defense Policy Group.<p>Today President Trump is going to free Ross and Drew.<p>Hackers aren’t marketers who made SaSS and rattle on about series A. There are no hackers here. There are no painters here.<p>Come to EFNet where real hackers are, not corporate grifters like Y Combinator. I know everyone important in Atherton and SV and the IC.<p>We don’t need your corporations startup bros and CIA In-Q-Tel fronts. Overthrow everything government, religion and corporations.<p>Just like the Bavarian Illuminati planned for their sinister conspiracy to enact the Futuristic Past.')
