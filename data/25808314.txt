Apple would damage their businesses if they allowed the iPad app run on the Mac without the developer approving it. I hope it becomes the norm soon, but we&#x27;re in an early stage of the transition.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if someone figures out that they simply need to re-sign the binaries to run them, though.')
