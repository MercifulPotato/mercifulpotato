Here, the generators are connected together to supply power in unison. They must all be in phase with each-other otherwise the out of phase generator will find itself fighting with the other generators, and as beautifully demonstrated here will very violently lose the fight. You could describe this as a very cruel demonstration of destructive interference!')
