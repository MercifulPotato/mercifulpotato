Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[25596571], score=None, time=1609434061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593128, text='&gt;When your only opportunity for food at ~9pm in a rural&#x2F;suburban environment is fast food â€” that changes the way you view your day, becoming a defacto framework that permeates everything.<p>I pretty strongly disagree with this. Most people make meals at home which aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;just a turkey sandwich.&quot; I don&#x27;t even live in a particularly rural area (about 40 miles west of Boston) and I don&#x27;t really have great meal options at 5pm much less 9pm. There are a few good pizza places, a Five Guys, some chain steak places, etc. but other than the odd pizza takeout I don&#x27;t really eat out.<p>If I lived in a city? I&#x27;d probably go out or get takeout more regularly but I&#x27;d still cook most days.')
