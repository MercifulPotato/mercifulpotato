My experience is that if I miss a dose I&#x27;ll find myself, hours later, with my brain catastrophically grinding gears and in tears from a panic attack. This isn&#x27;t from addiction, this is because I&#x27;ve actually adjusted to having a brain chemistry that isn&#x27;t broken. I was just as much a wreck before I was medicated, I just didn&#x27;t know and had a lot of really unhealthy self-medication techniques.<p>I&#x27;m well near the highest dose on my medication (Vyvanse) and I still have many of the pros and cons of ADHD. I don&#x27;t need to play chicken with my brain chemicals to exercise the unique heaven and hell that&#x27;s in there.')
