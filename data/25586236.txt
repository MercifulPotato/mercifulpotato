And the same thing with &quot;Circumstantial Evidence&quot;, somehow in common english language has come to mean not very good evidence.  Guess what, eye witness accounts of the accused murderer at the scene is circumstantial evidence, but damn if its not pretty devastating evidence coupled with the bloody clothes!')
