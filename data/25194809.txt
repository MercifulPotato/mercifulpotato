We&#x27;ll have to wait and see if they actually have the evidence &#x2F; wherewithal to see this one through rather than just settling out of court for a slap on the wrist.</i><p>Which raises the question, why did it happen this time?<p>My best guess is that the Santa Clara DA did the math, said, &quot;I&#x27;m in a liberal part of a liberal state where people overwhelmingly support BLM and distrust the police.  How can I best generate some positive publicity for myself?&quot;<p>The concealed permits mess has been well-known for ages.  So it wasn&#x27;t a question of the DA having just learned about it and becoming shocked.  And going to the Feds wouldn&#x27;t have helped much since they don&#x27;t care too much (else they would have acted ages ago).  The question is why the DA decided to make an issue of it.')
