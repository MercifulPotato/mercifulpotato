It introduces no more error than already exists when we use human judgment to spot and catch suspects by random luck using beat cops. This is better because it narrows down the search for suspects and uses limited staff efficiently, leading to an overall safer society. All this fear mongering about false positives is irrelevant because there is a human in the loop.<p>&gt; And you are assuming that all people have ID on them. Or are even here legally.<p>Sorry but almost everyone does have ID on them at all times. It is unreasonable to design our society for those who don’t. As for those here illegally - well perhaps they shouldn’t be here illegally. Again, we shouldn’t design our society that is based on laws around them.<p>&gt; If a single person is incorrectly identified by a system design to catch warrants, the system has failed beyond redemption.<p>I disagree. Any large scale and complex system will be imperfect. Your argument is basically “letting perfect be the enemy of good”.')
