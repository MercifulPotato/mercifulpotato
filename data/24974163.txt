Oversized stations are even more problematic when you consider that the MTA wants to build all of these by mining rather than using cut-and-cover, because cut-and-cover has too much disruption to surface tenants. And mining is far more expensive than cut-and-cover...&quot;<p>Your response:<p>&quot;... It is ALWAYS cheaper to build capacity now than to retrofit later, even inflation adjusted. ...&quot;<p>The implication of your response is that on a 100-year timeline, the way that the modern stations are apparently being built (by mining) is cheaper than building them by the way the parent commenter says (cut-and-cover).<p>I was just curious why it&#x27;s &quot;always&quot; cheaper. Is &quot;mine and build big&quot; the cheaper method only when there&#x27;s a ton of density on top like Hudson Yards, or is it also the case in places with less surface density?')
