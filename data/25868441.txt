I knew Alexander&#x27;s real name when the story broke a few months ago, and I flagged posts here that used it, because again: what would be the point? But in a profile of Alexander in the NYT? With his name so obviously available? Why would the NYT be obligated to pretend they didn&#x27;t know what his name was, or to collaborate with Alexander on how best to portray him? They&#x27;re reporting <i>on</i> Alexander, not <i>for</i> him.')
