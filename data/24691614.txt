You have provided a long list of reasons not to drive.  It&#x27;s the law and a moral requirement that you don&#x27;t go out and kill other people or yourself due to incapacitation.<p>People drive with varying levels of alertness, yes.  But if there is a reasonable, foreseeable chance you might FALL ASLEEP, then no, of course you ABSOLUTELY should not be driving and I&#x27;m sad but not surprised that this needs to be pointed out.')
