This is quite simply a truth, especially with regards to the USA.<p>If you&#x27;re not from the USA, we have this absolutely fucking unfathomable obesity epidemic going on. It doesn&#x27;t get talked about very much. 95%+ of the time, weight regulation is one of the simplest things we know of. Calories in and calories out.<p>Anyways, nobody really gives a fuck about that and will die on the hill of stating it&#x27;s incorrect. They will then go on to buy the newest ONE PILL DOCTORS DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT TO LOSE YOUR FAT OVERNIGHT for $19.95(x # payments) year after year, new pill doctors don&#x27;t want you to know about after new pill doctors don&#x27;t want you to know about, and still be obese, wondering why they specifically can&#x27;t lose weight - science must just be against them.<p>Ranting about US citizens obesity aside, the tl:dr - Wim Hof most definitely isn&#x27;t some ridiculously revolutionary thing, but for many it&#x27;s damn helpful towards their life, but it also takes time and effort to do, which many people aren&#x27;t disciplined enough to stick to. Also, you have to read. Believe it or not, large amount of people don&#x27;t like reading lmao.')
