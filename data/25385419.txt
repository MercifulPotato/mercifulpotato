Absurd.<p>We are talking about the most valuable company in the world, and the M1 release was covered enthusiastically the world over. The notion that it&#x27;s US-only is absolutely preposterous.<p>Apple is a significant player in mobile in the entirety of the West. Canada, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands. And it&#x27;s PC saturation is virtually the same in Canada and Europe as the US. Even in European media it is incredibly common to see Apple devices (phones and PCs) as the placeholders.<p>Apple even has 20% of the mobile marketshare in <i>China</i>. That&#x27;s incredible. It has 60%+ in Japan.<p>The corporation buying a fleet of low-end PCs for seat warmers aren&#x27;t going to buy Apple (nor are they buying Surface Pros. They&#x27;re buying the junkiest HP or Dell they can get). But there are as many &quot;artsy&quot; people, or people who care about the experience, in other rich countries as well.')
