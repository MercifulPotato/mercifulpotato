Item(by='dataflow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611896286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954102, text='&gt; Do you really expect the common person to point out if the app made followed the fundamentals of UI&#x2F;UX design?<p>What? No. I expect them to say &quot;it looked like my GME orders were submitted, but I don&#x27;t see them going through&quot;, or things like that, if such problems existed. You don&#x27;t need to be a UX expert to review a poor UX. But when the store asks you &quot;is this app good at trading stocks&quot; and you say &quot;no it&#x27;s awful, and I&#x27;m also not saying this app isn&#x27;t good at trading stocks&quot;, you&#x27;re not answering the question they&#x27;re asking.')
