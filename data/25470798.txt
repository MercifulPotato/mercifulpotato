I assume you&#x27;d want a pandemic deadly enough for that convinces a majority of the populace that it&#x27;s a serious event (to encourage downstream change to better prepare for a worse pandemic), while at the same time not causing people to drop like flies. As you stated, anything less severe would be taken less seriously. To have something to be taken more serious, it has to be more deadly.<p>Despite the denialism we currently have, it <i>seems</i> to have made the world recognize the importance of preparation.')
