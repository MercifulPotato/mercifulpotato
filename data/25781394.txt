So, just satisfy major usecase.<p>Say you come to hacker news and open top five links in a new tab, after visiting all 5 websites, you wouldn&#x27;t want to close the homepage and the previous 4 websites. You usually want to close just the 5 websites you opened and not the hacker news page. So, user just have to right click on hackernews tab and choose &quot;close tabs to the right&quot;.<p>I also want &#x27;close tabs to the left&#x27; it would be useful, when you open 20 links and read through 15 of the links, you don&#x27;t want those websites you visited to hog you memory, here &quot;close tabs to the left&quot; would be helpful.')
