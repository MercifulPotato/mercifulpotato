Item(by='nemothekid', descendants=None, kids=[25718053], score=None, time=1610261105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710760, text='&gt;<i>Man you deleted the part about the leftist straw man lol!!</i><p>I deleted it because I didn&#x27;t want to muddy my argument - I had a feeling you would focus on my critique of the video and avoid addressing my actual argument (which you did). I stand my critique of the video being a strawman, but ultimately I think it is irrelevant to the argument I was making.<p>Unfortunately, whenever I make this argument free speech &quot;absolutists&quot; are unable to answer or resort to circular arguments. If you do still standby your original statement, I hope you will consider the implications of such a statement which imply you are also willing to defend child pornographers from censorship.')
