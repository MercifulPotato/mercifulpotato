You can&#x27;t let one group write the HTML and one group write the CSS (with the pipedream being the designers writing the CSS). The only way to make complex designs is to modify both as you develop. They&#x27;re too intertwined and CSS alone isn&#x27;t powerful enough to do everything you want.<p>Keep your actual data like blog post content, blog post meta data, images etc. separated but it&#x27;s 1) not practically possible and 2) there&#x27;s no significant benefits to keeping your CSS and HTML separate besides sticking to dogmatism &quot;best practices&quot; that haven&#x27;t panned out.')
