This isn&#x27;t relevant to the discussion.<p>&gt; The common sense idea deals with the probability of someone (already born) being of a certain citizenship given their parents&#x27; location.<p>That would be &quot;ius soli&quot;. As opposed to &quot;ius sanguinis&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also not a &quot;probability&quot;. These are principles which are formally enshrined in nationality laws and very much determine travel, migration and national security policies in different nations. Including the United States.<p>These are not &quot;common sense&quot; either.<p>These are laws which come with a long historical pedigree which includes identity politics, economic policies, moral and ideological values, and so on.<p>They are also very much subject to change through the dominant politics of the day.<p>&gt; Not allegiance, citizenship. Different, but similar concept again.<p>I&#x27;m not willing to engage in a semantic discussion.')
