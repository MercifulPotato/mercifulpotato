PPO plans don&#x27;t have such a requirement.<p>So please don&#x27;t call other people willfully blind when you yourself make broad factually incorrect statements. Pot please meet kettle.<p>edit: Also my statements about Germany are based on comments Germans have made on hacker news regarding their own health plans.
