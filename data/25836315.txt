The lesson for would-be companies formed around open source is pretty stark: if your stuff is any good, then assume the clould vendors will offer it.  If they do, it&#x27;s going to be <i>really hard</i> for you to compete with a separate commercial offering.<p>Not only has the cloud vendor already gone through the hoops of getting an enterprise agreement in place.  They&#x27;re also big, and recognised, and know how to deal with Procurement.  And Risk. And Compliance. And Legal.<p>Not saying I like that situation.
