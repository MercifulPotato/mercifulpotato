All other containers on that instance eventually also restarted and got migrated to another EC2 instance which also got IOPS depleted soon enough.<p>And the cycle continues. The issue was there was no proper monitoring set up and getting a timeout from Docker isn&#x27;t very helpful error message.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve made sure to build in checks to prevent bouncing all services on a machine at once and spreading out applications that use disk across machines instead of binpacking.')
