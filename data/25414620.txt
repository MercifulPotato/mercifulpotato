Why commute?<p>Just move that 20-30 further from city&#x2F;town to a few acres and have your office in a room in said house. And now you &#x27;commute&#x27; to town when you want town things, which is probably far less than daily for most.<p>This is what I did anyway, and personally its been a great choice.')
