Now that the processor for the Apple Watch is on another device, it may show up somewhere else.  Since this is wall powered, I don&#x27;t think that bodes well for my hope that they release an Apple Watch that is smaller or has longer battery life (smaller often means smaller battery).<p>It seems like they always bring a new SoC in under their last commoditized SoC.
