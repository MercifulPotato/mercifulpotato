By saying it contains such things you are assigning a sinister motive to the comment without requiring evidence, because it&#x27;s a &quot;dog-whistle&quot;, so we have to trust you that &#x27;liberal&#x27; is being used as an epithet, or that using  &#x27;ordinary citizens&#x27; to distinguish the homeless is something sinister.<p>&gt; governing institution that interns individuals based on being different, or not morially aligned, of not thinking the correct thoughts<p>You are talking about what? apartheid? communist regimes?<p>Homeless people aren&#x27;t being treated differently for &quot;not thinking the correct thoughts&quot;, or &quot;not being morally aligned&quot;. They are treated differently from ordinary people, but if any ordinary person did the same they would be treated that way too. Being treated differently based on behaviour is not necessarily wrong.')
