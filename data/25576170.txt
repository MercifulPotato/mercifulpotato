List the particular actions she took that did such things. I don&#x27;t think there are any.<p>The closest you can get, I feel, is that Domingos and perhaps some anonymous others felt that her list of people who she wished to educate and discuss with was going to be used to attack them. This never actually happened though. Domingos claimed that the list would be used in such a way, and then it was deleted.<p>I could just as easily claim that Domingos created a culture of fear by making hyperbolistic claims about the things that Anandkumar would do.')
