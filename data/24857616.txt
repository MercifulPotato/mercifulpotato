They are clarifying that payments (including ransom ones) to an entity on sanctioned list is illegal.<p>How does this translate to the rest of ransom requests seen in society is beyond me.<p>Are we setting up a precog unit to classify all people and entities in the world as sanctioned&#x2F;non-sanctioned?')
