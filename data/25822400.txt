Remember, though, we are talking about First Amendment protected speech for most of these people.<p>You may say that no one <i>needs</i> to be able to communicate online, and as long as someone can use the postal service then they haven&#x27;t been silenced, but by that logic you could say that a regime which locks up its political opponents hasn&#x27;t really &quot;silenced&quot; them as long as they are still allowed to write letters.')
