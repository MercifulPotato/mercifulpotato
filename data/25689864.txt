Whenever I see people salivate at stories like this, waiting for the juicy details to get leaked, my heart dies a little.  It&#x27;s as if no one has any empathy or understanding that privacy is a necessary thing for society to function.  It&#x27;s almost never fair to judge a person based on their private life or private conversations.
