I assume he&#x27;ll need to pay taxes on that, a 20% long-term capital gains tax.  Brings it down to about $3M. Being generous and giving him 3.5% return (real return) a year in fixed income, that&#x27;s only $105,000 a year in income, which he&#x27;ll need to pay taxes on as well.  He&#x27;ll net out around $85k a year.')
