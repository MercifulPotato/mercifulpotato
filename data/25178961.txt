Item(by='alphakappa', descendants=None, kids=[25179390, 25180805, 25179881], score=None, time=1606064534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178487, text='Instead of downvoting the parent (who is asking a legitimate question) or getting snarky, maybe the commenters can actually explain how such a donation makes a significant difference to an industry that operates with much larger numbers.<p>It would be educational to hear from someone who understands this industry (as opposed to speculation) about the economics of such donations. Does this move the needle for a company as large as Moderna? Since this donation was made to Vanderbilt, does it enable multiple streams of research that gets licensed by Moderna? Does it enable the company to try out avenues that they wouldn&#x27;t have done in the absence of the funding? What does this level of money actually purchase? (grants to individual researchers, equipment etc)')
