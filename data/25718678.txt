I think the following applies just as much to cast iron as to the wood he is talking about:<p><pre><code>  So, when I choose a finish, I ignore the industry-standard scratch and adhesion tests. Instead, I separate finishes into two buckets:\n\n  1.   Finishes that look incredible immediately but look like crap in 20 years (the short-run finishes) vs. finishes that look incredible when worn&#x2F;abused (the long-run finishes).\n\n  2.   Finishes that want me dead vs. finishes that I can apply while buck naked.\n</code></pre>\nBasically I would equate Polyurethane with Teflon, and furniture oil with cooking oil.<p>Teflon will be great to cook on initially. As soon as it gets damaged, it will be hard to fix without stripping and redoing everything.<p>Oil will take more maintenance over time, but if it starts looking bad, you just put a bit more on. That&#x27;s exactly how you should treat cast iron as well.<p>The trouble people run into is they try to use oil to create a teflon surface. That&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.lostartpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;rip-the-anarchists-finishing-manual&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.lostartpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;rip-the-anarchists-...</a>')
