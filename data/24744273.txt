I think you may be conflating writing and publishing. Just because you’ve written something doesn’t mean that you have to publish that thing.<p>Writing has far-reaching effects on how you think and communicate. Lots of people believe their thoughts are well organized and that they’re capable of communicating them. But then they sit down to write those thoughts out and they can’t get anywhere.<p>Writing, as a practice, helps you begin to make sense of all the disjointed ideas in your head. It helps you make connections between things you otherwise may not have noticed. And it helps you <i>improve</i> those ideas and connections because you can review and edit them later.<p>Think of it like exercising: just because you life weights, doesn’t mean you have to start wearing sleeveless t-shirts.')
