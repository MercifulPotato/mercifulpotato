After alt-right extremists were booted off reddit, they found a new home there. The site was bombarded by &#x2F;pol&#x2F; chan culture, and after that nobody else of other political persuasions really wanted to join. Kind of like that &quot;paradox of intolerance&quot; meme. Free speech platforms usually end up becoming extremist platforms.<p>I remember going on voat a couple years ago and the front page was filled with anti-Semitic and white nationalist propaganda, and racial slurs were everywhere. Even non-political subverses had an alt-right tinge. It was truly the culture that dominated the site.')
