That alone is gonna make them an incredible amount of money. This isn&#x27;t ever going to change.\n- Pandemic housing boom. People are buying at unprecedented rates. This is money leaving cities. This is a generation of global-minded, young internet-savvy buyers. AirBNB wins here.\n- Economic recession &#x2F; unemployment. Everyone who _does_ own a home and finds themselves in financial trouble is going to consider renting a room. It&#x27;s an obvious move and I think the job market will have at-risk homeowners considering this move en masse.')
