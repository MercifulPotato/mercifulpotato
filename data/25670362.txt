The client is good, feature set is good, the stickers are amusing (if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing), the feature set is complete and everything is polished. Telegram is, I think, going to be one of the easier sells if you&#x27;re trying to convince non-technical users to switch from WhatsApp or FB Messenger.<p>The privacy, security, and governance story is not great though. If you care about such things, I think Signal wins hands down. And the UX is fine, just not quite as good as Telegram in my view.<p>(A third option not in your poll that might be worth evaluating is Wickr. I haven&#x27;t used it personally, but I&#x27;ve seen it come up in these sorts of discussions.)')
