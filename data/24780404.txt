I&#x27;m seeing if I can do something, but I am seeing a good variety of sales across packages. I might just leave it for today, come back to it later.<p>For pricing: I&#x27;m aiming to optimize for reach over revenue for this one. I&#x27;d like to keep the book affordable, and give people a good deal. But by people paying, I&#x27;m hoping to target those who will actually read it, over just download numbers. I especially would not want to overcharge as resume advice is... a subjective field, and no one can guarantee results (maybe some gurus say they can, but I don&#x27;t want to be that guru).<p>Originally, the whole book was supposed to be two pages in the next book I&#x27;m (still) writing on growing as a software engineer, in the job search section [1]. I just hope the other parts won&#x27;t expand as much as this one has :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;</a>')
