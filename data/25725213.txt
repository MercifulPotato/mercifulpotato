This is ludicrous, Trump was elected due to numerous factors, it&#x27;d be hard to place Snowden in even the top 10. immigration, trade, feckless GOP, crowded primary field, biased dem primary, weak dem candidate, I could make massive list more important than Snowden. All trump&#x27;s supporters would say about Snowden is that he&#x27;s a traitor, they&#x27;d understand or care little about what he leaked.<p>Maybe this is a HN bubble, the vast majority of Americans wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you what Snowden even specifically leaked...or rather, the journalists leaked on his and our behalf.<p>Trump is not the leader of the free world any longer. He&#x27;s clearly on the way out, and he invited violence while the door was closing. Even the weakened GOP must admit he is a wannabe dictator, and his rhetoric led to 5 deaths, nevermind untold thousands to pandemic.<p>So no, I think there is not much slippery slope implication to deplatforming insane people like Trump, Alex Jones, KKK members, Nazis, terrorists, etc. Why should these people retain the privilege of posting harmful and murderous content on a company&#x27;s website? Where in the constitution is tweeting an enshrined right?')
