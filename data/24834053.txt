Here&#x27;s what I wear:<p>Volcom, Men&#x27;s Frickin Modern Fit Stretch Chino Pant, Charcoal Heather.  They look dressy.  They are 40% synthetic so sweat&#x2F;rain dries quickly.  They&#x27;re a bit stretchy which is comfortable.  I own 4 pairs and have washed each one about 75 times.  The color has faded a bit, but evenly.  There is little visible wear.  TCO ~$0.75 per wear.  Wear with a simple brown leather belt.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Volcom-Frickin-Modern-Stretch-Chino&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07GL2TMBF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Volcom-Frickin-Modern-Stretch-Chino&#x2F;d...</a><p>Banana Republic Factory, Standard Fit Non-Iron Shirt, Sky Blue.  This is a standard Banana Republic shirt, but made with more durable cloth.  I own 4 of them and have washed each one about 75 times.  They all still look great.  TCO is &lt;$0.50&#x2F;wear.  Check with 2 fashionable friends before going with a non-sky-blue color.  I usually wear a thick dark gray merino long-sleeved &quot;base layer&quot; undershirt or a thin cream-colored merino undershirt.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bananarepublicfactory.gapfactory.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;product.do?pid=533974011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bananarepublicfactory.gapfactory.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;product....</a><p>Uniqlo, Extra Fine Merino Crew Neck Long-sleeve Sweater, Dark Gray.  I own 4 of these sweaters, purchased over 2.5-1 year ago.  I can&#x27;t tell which ones are newer or older because they all look great.  They are warm, soft, extremely durable, dry quickly, and don&#x27;t hold any body odors.  I wear each one about 10 times between washes.  I wash them in a front-loading washer on delicate warm cycle with standard fragrance-free detergent and hang on a normal hangar to dry.  TCO is &lt;$0.25&#x2F;wear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uniqlo.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;men-extra-fine-merino-crew-neck-long-sleeve-sweater-429066.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uniqlo.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;men-extra-fine-merino-crew-neck...</a><p>Uniqlo, Cashmere Crew Neck Long-sleeve Sweater, Dark Grey.  Compared to the merino one, this sweater is also durable, twice as warm, twice as soft, three times the price, and a bit shorter in the waist.  Uniqlo&#x27;s product is special in the industry.  It&#x27;s a $200 sweater for $100.  $100 cashmere sweaters from other companies will pill after 5 wears and look terrible.  Uniqlo&#x27;s is durable.  I&#x27;ve worn mine about 30 times, washed it twice, and it still looks new.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uniqlo.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;men-cashmere-crew-neck-long-sleeve-sweater-429075.html?dwvar_429075_color=COL08" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uniqlo.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;men-cashmere-crew-neck-long-sle...</a><p>Patagonia, Men&#x27;s Torrentshell 3L Jacket, Andes Blue.  This is good for wind and light rain.  It rolls up into about 1L of volume.  I&#x27;ve worn it nearly every day for 3 years, walking about 1 hour a day and riding in carshare.  The waist tension cord channel fabric has worn through in the back.  The jacket still looks fine and functions well.  TCO ~$0.20&#x2F;wear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patagonia.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;mens-torrentshell-3l-rain-jacket&#x2F;85240.html?dwvar_85240_color=ANDB&amp;cgid=root" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patagonia.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;mens-torrentshell-3l-rain-...</a><p>Crazy Cool, Men&#x27;s Seamless Boxer Briefs Underwear, Camouflage.  Underwear can be fashionable.  These have no interior seams to rub against male equipment.  If you have a belly crease, the wasteband will start to roll after 5 wears, but it&#x27;s not too tight.  They can smell if you sweat repeatedly.  They dry quickly.  The legs ride up.  I expect final TCO to be ~$0.20&#x2F;wear or lower.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.walmart.com&#x2F;ip&#x2F;Crazy-Cool-Men-s-Camouflage-Seamless-Boxer-Briefs-Underwear-6-Pack-M-L&#x2F;756048282" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.walmart.com&#x2F;ip&#x2F;Crazy-Cool-Men-s-Camouflage-Seaml...</a><p>Woolly Clothing, Merino Wool Long Drop Boxer Brief, Everyday Weight, Charcoal.  Extremely expensive and extremely comfortable.  Wearing these and using a bidet will solve all body odor issues below the belt.  The &quot;long drop&quot; version doesn&#x27;t ride up your legs.  The company had fabric durability problems but solved them.  These wear out by getting holes on the seat after about 50 wears.  If you have a belly crease, the waistband will get a crease after 15 wears and can roll and become tight and uncomfortable.  TCO ~$0.55&#x2F;wear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Woolly-Clothing-Merino-Boxer-Brief&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01GKJFGR6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Woolly-Clothing-Merino-Boxer-Brief&#x2F;dp...</a><p>Columbia, Men&#x27;s Newton Ridge Plus Ii Waterproof Hiking Boot Shoe, Cordovan&#x2F;Squash.  These are roomy in the toes and flat inside (no &quot;arch support&quot;).  The interior fabric and tread wear out after about 750 miles of walking.  TCO ~$0.10&#x2F;mile.  If they wear out within a year, ship them to Columbia and they send you a $96 gift card.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Columbia-Newton-Waterproof-Hiking-Cordovan&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00KWK8AC8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Columbia-Newton-Waterproof-Hiking-Cor...</a><p>Nike, Men&#x27;s Revolution 4 Running Shoe, Black&#x2F;White&#x2F;Anthracite.  These are flat inside (no &quot;arch support&quot;).  I put these in the washer every 6 months to whiten them up.  To wash, remove the laces and inserts, put the shoes and everything into a mesh bag, and wash them on a delicate warm cycle.  The tread lasts a long time.  The inserts and interior fabric fail around 750 miles.  TCO ~$0.10&#x2F;mile.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;NIKE-Revolution-Running-White-Anthracite-Regular&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B06XKG11YZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;NIKE-Revolution-Running-White-Anthrac...</a><p>Darn Tough, Vermont Men&#x27;s Merino Wool Boot Full Cushion Sock (Style 1405), Charcoal.  These are the best warm socks.  I wear them all day every day, even at home.  I walk 1,000 miles a year and go through about 6 pairs a year.  TCO ~$0.13&#x2F;mile.  Darn Tough makes many variations of socks so be sure to get the full cushion version.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01ENQYZIE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01ENQYZIE</a><p>O&#x27;Neill, Loaded 2.0 Hybrid Shorts, Heather Black.  Comfortable and quick-drying.  With a collared shirt tucked in and a belt, you&#x27;ll look &quot;loaded&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;ONeill-Loaded-Hybrid-Shorts-Heather&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07M7KM4M5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;ONeill-Loaded-Hybrid-Shorts-Heather&#x2F;d...</a><p>Minus33, Merino Wool 703 Algonquin Men&#x27;s Lightweight Short Sleeve Crew, Dark Gray Heather.  Super-quick drying, nearly eliminating body odor.  Extremely durable fabric and stitching.  They keep their shape.  They don&#x27;t fade.  I own four, purchased 4-6 years ago.  I have probably worn the oldest one 100 times.  I cannot tell which one is the oldest.  They all look fine.  TCO ~$0.50&#x2F;wear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B000R7E1LU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B000R7E1LU</a><p>Tortuga, Outbreaker Daypack.  Chest strap.  Understated logo.  Comfortable even when full and heavy (2L drinks, 13&quot; Macbook Pro, charger, headphones, sweater, jacket, lunch, snacks, &amp; workout clothes.  Water-resistant zipper stops being water resistant after about 1,000 zip&#x2F;unzip cycles.  Stitching around top handle fails after about 1,000 miles.

I take them out immediately after the dry cycle finishes and hang them up.  I never iron.  All wool skips the dryer, going straight from washer to a hanger or clothes-pin rack.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mamaslaundrytalk.com&#x2F;the-proper-way-to-hang-dress-shirts-in-your-closet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mamaslaundrytalk.com&#x2F;the-proper-way-to-hang-dres...</a><p>For drying socks and underwear on the bathroom door:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Whitmor-Clip-Drip-Hanger-Hanging&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0001E839U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Whitmor-Clip-Drip-Hanger-Hanging&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Over-Fitting-Sized-Doors-Unjumbly&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01MAWLU1L" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Over-Fitting-Sized-Doors-Unjumbly&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a><p>For drying sweaters and shirts:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;JEFEE-Garment-Clothes-Storage-Fashionable&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07SN3GYH9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;JEFEE-Garment-Clothes-Storage-Fashion...</a><p>If you use a top-loading washer with an &quot;agitator&quot;, double or triple the TCO numbers.
