That&#x27;s the 101 for anyone with a modicum of professionalism. I am sure there are great recruiters around like there are plenty of needles in haystacks.</i><p>Ah, sorry about that, I didn&#x27;t mean to conflate the two quite so directly. I also didn&#x27;t make it clear that I was ghosted by the hiring manager after the recruiter handed me off to them. The recruiter wasn&#x27;t supposed to even be involved from that point forward, but they followed up anyway. However, you can ignore the anecdote as an unnecessary distraction if you like.<p>Anyway, sure, recruiters get a bad rap, in the same way as used-car salespeople do. I wasn&#x27;t really arguing that the reputation the profession has is entirely undeserved. I was just saying that good and even great recruiters do actually exist. For many of the working-environment reasons you&#x27;ve mentioned, they often don&#x27;t stay in the role of recruiting ICs, or even for relatively senior roles. They have better opportunities in recruiting-adjacent fields like executive search services, life-coaching, and so on.')
