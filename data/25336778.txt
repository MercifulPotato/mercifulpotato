Everything was warped.<p>Thinner non-stick pans also warp really easily.<p>Thicker pots and pans take longer to heat up, sometimes a lot longer. e.g. My 1.5q pot can take over 10 minutes to boil water. Making hard boiled eggs is annoying, to say the least.<p>(I&#x27;m using gas, and one of my back burners is too weak to even boil water in my thick 3 layer pots...)')
