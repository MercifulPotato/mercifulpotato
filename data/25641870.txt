Getting people to use Telegram instead of SMS or other random chat apps can be difficult but getting them to switch to Signal is basically a &quot;not going to happen&quot; until Signal ups their usability. Even people I&#x27;ve gotten to try out Signal all abandoned it. At least with Telegram, they stuck with it and still use it to this day. It&#x27;d honestly probably be easier to get Telegram to adopt Signal&#x27;s protocol than it would be to get users to adopt [current] Signal.')
