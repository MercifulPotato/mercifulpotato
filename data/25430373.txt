The issue is 1) from most end users&#x27; perspectives, they have no idea if it&#x27;s actually running locally or talking to a server, or how to verify it, or probably what that difference even means in the first place, so a skeptical user won&#x27;t necessarily gain that much additional peace of mind, and 2) hypothetically a compromise could still result in the local data being siphoned off by an attacker. The latter&#x27;s still a risk for regular desktop applications, but a bit less so (since you can get a signed binary).<p>The homomorphic encryption approach probably isn&#x27;t worth the effort. There&#x27;s always going to be a trade-off between doing something useful and sufficiently&#x2F;securely obfuscating&#x2F;anonymizing the data. So I&#x27;d recommend the local approach, with a prominent explanation of how you don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t see any of the data.')
