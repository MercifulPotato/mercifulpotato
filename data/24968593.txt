Late 20th century leftists brought identity politics into fashion, but it was the right that really took it and ran with it with Bush&#x27;s politics of the &quot;base&quot; and then Trump&#x27;s identity politics.<p>A deeper example would be &quot;culture jamming&quot; and the maybe-ironic prankster&#x2F;trickster political style. That came out of the 60s&#x2F;70s left with stuff like the Church of the Subgenius, and stuff like alternate reality gaming (ARGs) pioneered in the 90s. The intellectual basis for it ultimately comes from postmodernism. The right is now weaponizing this style and implementing it at scale with Qanon.<p>Edit since it won&#x27;t let me reply:<p>I&#x27;d define identity politics as the idea that your biology or cultural background places you in a group that should define your ideas and political affinities.')
