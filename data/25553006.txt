Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609093108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552764, text='Again: you could make the same argument against the fire department (“don’t rely on the government, learn fire suppression yourself”) or dangerous pharmaceuticals (“the peer-reviewed articles are out there, you just need to learn how to read them”), or protection against assault and theft, or protection against dangerous wild animals, etc etc. In general your argument is “proving” way too much and doesn’t say anything useful.<p>Nobody is disputing that the government can be corrupt, and at its best will be incapable of protecting everyone from everything. And if you are sincerely anarchist then that’s more of an ideological dispute beyond the scope of this comment.<p>But I suspect that you actually support regulation around food and medicine, since “a fatal case of salmonella is a small price to pay to make sure we don’t rely on the government” isn’t actually a good argument. And, unlike people who are ignorant about computer technology, you probably have empathy and understanding for people who are ignorant about whether the ground beef they are purchasing is actually safe to eat. You would not be sympathetic to a libertarian food safety specialist came in and said “well I can tell that the ground beef is unsafe, why not teach everyone my skills so they can defend themselves?”<p>The idea that the government can protect people when it comes to health, medicine, transportation, and personal property...  but NOT when it comes to privacy, is just not coherent.')
