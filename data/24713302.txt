Item(by='yourapostasy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602108237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24711391, text='Durability in a class of products has a tendency to correlate with the realms of quality I personally care about in my experience. YMMV of course. My selection attributes are invariably different from yours.<p>Personally, I assign a higher &quot;durability&quot; to a product if it is easily repairable. Parts and schematics&#x2F;instructions are readily available, at reasonable cost for generations. Ideally seven generations or engineering blueprints released once parts are discontinued. If necessary, I can Ship of Theseus-repair such products over time, which I&#x27;m okay with as long as the time between repairs is roughly about the time for less-durable products to break into irreparable junk (without an extensive fabrication shop, which I&#x27;m oh-so-ever-slowly building up but could never justify the cost of on that repair capability basis alone).<p>Most products I select on this durability basis tend to have been in the market for a long time and have a lot of thought refined into their design over that time. I suspect durability raising the cost means the manufacturer has to compete on other axes like usability, functionality, listening and incorporating customer field&#x2F;operational experience, and overall value by marketing uses it can be put to. Functionality tends to take a hit, especially with commercial-grade gear (compare a commercial restaurant microwave to a consumer model), so I go in with that expectation; sometimes more features is just more fiddly bits to break.<p>Mostly I do this because I&#x27;m utterly fascinated by the shape of design decisions that stand the test of time, and I&#x27;m compensated sufficiently to pay for it. Partly I do this because our species faces an energy cliff within an absurdly brief blink of geologic time, and I wish we could keep increasing amounts of stuff out of landfills.')
