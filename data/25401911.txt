Each is a slightly different image (each has a slightly different centre of projection, in the jargon).  If your pinhole is infinitely small, you get an infinitely-weak shot of a single one of those images.  As you enlarge the pinhole, you get a larger collection of images, all added together, so you get more total light, but a bit of blurriness (because the images you&#x27;re adding are all just a touch different).')
