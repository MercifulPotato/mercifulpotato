Matt argues this might lead to regular folks (as opposed to politicians) getting blackmailed, but:<p>1) it seems unlikely this cryptographic proof is needed (he acknowledges this criticism in the post), and<p>2) what seems more likely to me is that politicians would intentionally _not_ opt in to any alternate solution and use that deniability for their own advantage. (Also as an alternate he proposes GPG, which I know Matt knows is laughable).')
