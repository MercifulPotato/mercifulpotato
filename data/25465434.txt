Item(by='hulitu', descendants=None, kids=[25465583], score=None, time=1608284329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465184, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t get the folks who expect, exactly from this studio, to have perfect bug-less game on Day-1. I mean, how far detached from reality and clueless about games in general must you be?<p>50 years ago the quality of the code was much better. I expect some things from SW that I buy: 1. To run on normal HW (i.e. home PC or laptop dedicated mainly to web browsing and watching movies) or on the target HW \n2. To have a usable interface ( Hello MS, Apple, Google - do you listen ?)\n3. To be bug free or at least the main anoying bugs to be fixed. (Hello MS, Google - do you listen ?)(yes i paid for my Android phone)<p>&gt;There are very few studios who can produce such quality prior to release (ie last Zelda), but I guess they are not under such pressure to release on many platforms in parallel just before christmas.<p>I&#x27;m impressed. So you are saying that a lot of &quot;studios&quot; produce crap and this is ok because other do it.<p>&gt; It will be an amazing game once the patches progresses, and if you are tolerant I am sure it already is.<p>That&#x27;s what they said about MS Windows too and look what it became of it.<p>&gt; I would expect decent in 2 months, great in 6 months, awesome in 1-2 years (unofficial patches&#x2F;modding including). Just like many other open world games.<p>See MS Windows.<p>&gt; Personally, I&#x27;ll wait for those 2 months at least, also due to getting better&#x2F;smoother performance out of my current PC rig. I have no doubt its a game I will enjoy tremendously, again and again, it fits my preferred style very much.<p>Until one day when you had enough of its bugs, you smash the keyboard and the mouse in despair and you uninstall it.')
