In context, it clearly means that the Democrats never vote the way he wants them to, not that the Democrats shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to vote. (Note he then goes on to talk about whether the weak Republicans will vote the way he wants them to.)<p>I&#x27;m not aware that the demonstrators were toting guns.<p>Really, give it up.  If you want to argue that Trump incited violence in this speech, you need to find another quote from it in which he does.  The one above is absolutely not incitement, as is completely clear to anyone who is not blinded by partisan rage.<p>By the way, your country could do with less partisan rage right now.')
