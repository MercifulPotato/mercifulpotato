The idea is to engineer parts to survive the mission and maybe go a bit further if you aren&#x27;t at a point of diminishing returns in regards to cost. If it costs $1000 for a 10% gain in life of part, maybe go for it. $1M for 10%? Maybe not. Additionally, gamma radiation can do some weird things to materials and can effect things differently depending on dose rate. Lubricants can increase in viscosity and acidity under gamma. Radiation effects on spacecraft was not as big of a deal back then. Missions were short and electronics weren&#x27;t small enough to have noticeable radiation effects.')
