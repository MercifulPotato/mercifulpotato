(how many people? of what skills? how long? what to build? for how much?)<p>4) Do the work. Projects could be anywhere from weeks to years.<p>5) Long time goes bye.<p>6) Done.<p>There&#x27;s two ways to handle the billing and making money aspect.<p>First option. Bill per time. You basically promise to have X people of various skillset working on the project for some period of time. They&#x27;re each billed $$$ per day so it&#x27;s simple math.<p>Second option, harder to manage. Bill per project. You basically promise to deliver a bunch of features or some result that&#x27;s agreed upon at the start. This one is tricky because you have to define everything at the beginning and clients usually don&#x27;t know what they want and change their mind.<p>Now, who wants to have a longer blog post about the difference between contracting and tech companies?')
