After cancer, it gets really difficult to &quot;reintegrate&quot; with society. Most conversations sound absolutely pointless, I felt like there was less grip surface between the concept of me and almost everyone. The depressions after cancer are commonplace, and mine were strong, too. The difference in depression recurrence and intensity after a single 3g dose of psilocybe cubensis was spectacular. After a couple of months I started on psilocybin micro doses and, so far, along with hormone replacement therapy (I lost a testicle to cancer), I&#x27;m finally feeling OK. Much better than OK. :D')
