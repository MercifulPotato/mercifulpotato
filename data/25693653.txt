They were just talking amongst themselves, showing each other what they wanted to hear, and validating their own beliefs in a downwards spiral towards eventual extremism.<p>Isn&#x27;t the exact opposite true as well then? If one side is siloed, by definition the other side must be in an opposite silo. You&#x27;ve taken it upon yourself to define that your side is in the &quot;public debate&quot; and therefore somehow isn&#x27;t just &quot;talking amongst themselves&quot;. Don&#x27;t you see the issue here? Left Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;Facebook absolutely exists, and they are not meaningfully conversing with the other side.<p>And, if anything, having a sitting president on your side should by definition mean that you are &quot;part of the public debate&quot;, since everyone at least hears the president&#x27;s words (and especially Trump&#x27;s).')
