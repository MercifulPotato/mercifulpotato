Item(by='sudosysgen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605554162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114293, text='&gt;Turchin blames an ‘over-production of elites’ for impending unrest, yet it is not so much that all college grads aspire to elite positions but rather seek the higher wages and nicer lifestyle that a college degree bestows. And as long as the college wage premium keep widening, we should expect more college grads and higher tuition costs. If the premium was to suddenly contract, then college enrolment would fall and there would be fewer production of these elites.<p>This seems like a bit of a strawman to me. College graduates aren&#x27;t the elite in that sense, college grass are just skilled labourers, the vast majority of them don&#x27;t have any expectation of power that characterizes the elites in the elite overproduction theory. The elites in that sense are politicians, the managerial class, the executive class, lawyers and so on.<p>Indeed, there is no reason why a country where everyone has a biochemistry degree would suffer from an issue where everyone feels like they are owed significant political(economic too, in a sense) power, but overproducing politicians, executives, and managers, could lead to those issues.<p>Also, even if competitors to the US didn&#x27;t have imperial ambitions, it doesn&#x27;t follow that they wouldn&#x27;t act against the imperial ambitions of America.<p>The author also says that revolutions are generally against two groups in a homogenous ethnic supergroup, and gives the example of Iran. This is, of course, absurd - Iran is an insanely multiethnic country by world standards with dozens of ethnic groups. And yet, the Iranian revolution still pushed through, because the issues were such that the camps were able to form despite ethnic differences amongst them. This goes directly against the point.')
