That clip helps add more context, for sure.<p>I don&#x27;t have much to add, but I&#x27;ll state that I adore Papert&#x27;s vision, and that even those who disagree about &quot;what we should do on Monday&quot; should keep an eye on the vision. If it does not directly inform what steps to take in the short term, at least it should have an indirect influence. By a similar token, tearing everything down and trying to rebuilding it from scratch carefully is famously tempting and notoriously ineffective for software systems. Even with software it&#x27;s hard to make that claim flat out, and I shouldn&#x27;t dare try to draw an analogy to social systems, since, you know, revolutions happen and for good reason. But I am glad there are at least some people (though maybe there are relatively too many) with an eye toward incrementalism.<p>There are many similar ideas to Papert&#x27;s and Kay&#x27;s that could perhaps be organized under a theme of being visionary or radical or in stark contrast to the status quo. Coming to mind are: A Mathematician&#x27;s Lament by Paul Lockhart [1] (2002) or much more narrowly Ten Lessons I Wish I Had Learned Before Teaching Differential Equations by Gian-Carlo Rota [2] (1997).<p>I&#x27;m also reminded of some work by Felienne that questions the idea that computer programming in particular is not amenable to traditional instruction. This idea is popular with this era&#x27;s programmers (perhaps because for the most part, at least up until recently, programmers do not learn from school) [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maa.org&#x2F;external_archive&#x2F;devlin&#x2F;devlin_03_08.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maa.org&#x2F;external_archive&#x2F;devlin&#x2F;devlin_03_08.htm...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.williams.edu&#x2F;Mathematics&#x2F;lg5&#x2F;Rota.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.williams.edu&#x2F;Mathematics&#x2F;lg5&#x2F;Rota.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.felienne.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;6150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.felienne.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;6150</a>')
