Maybe it isn&#x27;t, i&#x27;m not sure, but this is what i&#x27;ve been lead to think.<p>And sociology have predictive value, can we agree on that? Putting plots&#x2F;columns in front of emergency exit (or just small exits) do help the human flow. We can predict and manipulate panic spread, social contagion, how people evacuate[0]...<p>So i suppose sociology is one of the exception you&#x27;re talking about, but, realistically, isn&#x27;t that just because sociological studies and applications have more founding, are easier to recruit for, and have less ethics constraint than other psychologies studies?<p>It&#x27;s nothing like economics.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1098&#x2F;rsif.2016.0414" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1098&#x2F;rsif.201...</a>')
