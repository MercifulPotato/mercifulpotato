I often find myself searching through the tree of possibilities running --help on every single level just to do something simple. Especially if what I&#x27;m trying to do may exist in disparate sub commands. With a web interface there&#x27;d likely be some kind of nested menu or dropdowns that offer more of a sense of the overall arrangement at a glance.<p>I&#x27;m always happy to have access to the CLI to be able to script things, but if it&#x27;s the only interface to a service with many features it can be awfully cumbersome.<p>Sometimes with these deeply nested do-it-all CLIs I feel like I&#x27;m playing a text adventure trying to navigate a maze, constantly typing &#x2F;look and &#x2F;examine. Often these tools have so many sub commands that a man page is not helpful if it exists at all.<p><pre><code>  &gt; cloud-tool --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool instances --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool instances attach-storage --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool instances attach-storage disk --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool storage --help\n  ... \n  &gt; cloud-tool disks --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool disks provision --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool disks provision --size 200gb --name new-disk\n  Your session has expired please log in again.\n  &gt; cloud-tool --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool auth --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool auth login\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool storage provision --size 200gb --name new-disk\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool instances attach-storage --help\n  ...\n  &gt; cloud-tool instances attach-storage disk --name new-disk</code></pre>')
