The T-series having the nipple also helped you use it in tighter spaces closer to your body without sticking your elbows out which helps in tight seated spaces (which is the big reason I care about body size vs screen size), but those tall bezels were dreadful.  Still I was just stunned by Apples seeming lack of competitiveness in the 13-14&quot; space, and their 15&quot; laptops weren&#x27;t good until the 16&quot; came out which was a fine laptop compared to the competition but the thermals really disappointed me and it felt like some of the hardware they put in it went to waste.  The 16&quot; was the first laptop since 2015 I would honestly say was arguably the best on the market of that type, before that the laptops were just crap.<p>&gt;Look, itâ€™s obvious you have a bias against Apple<p>I have a bias against bad products like the 2016-2019 era macbooks which were dreadful.  When Apple was making good laptops before then, I was a fan.  After they started making good laptops again, I was a fan.  When Apple was in the dark ages, I went to the store and gave their laptops an honest shot but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy such garbage even though I was a fan of MacOS.  Do I have to believe Apple has made the best laptops from a hardware perspective every single year to not be bias against them with no regard to what their competition is doing?  There is not a single product in their lineup I do not consider arguably the best on the market these days, I&#x27;ve been in rooms where I was on of two mac users in a room of 30, my god I&#x27;m SO biased against Apple because I hate heavy slow computers with defective keyboards and dubious pricing.')
