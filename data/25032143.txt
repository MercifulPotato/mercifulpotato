I was trying to convey that it&#x27;s always easier to rant than to actually contribute to improving things.<p>Mind you, the post does not just say &quot;dont&#x27;t roll your own&quot;. It essentially says &quot;don&#x27;t use RSA no matter which implementation&quot;. And the argument for that is not very strong. It&#x27;s an arbitrary selection of what could go wrong. In which libraries does it? Maybe for the major implementations this is all just cold coffee and they don&#x27;t have those issues. But then I go and use one of them, and since the author just wrote a random rant, they pull the next trick out the sleeve and claim the next thing this implementation got wrong. It&#x27;s easy to be in that position. It&#x27;s harder to compile a complete list so that I can go and see that my framework does not violate any of those issues, so it can be trusted just as much as his favorite ECC framework. But yeah that would not just take work but would risk being criticized for being incomplete, so just easier to publish a rant instead.')
