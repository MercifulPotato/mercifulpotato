I think it&#x27;s a better investment than a TV. The only difference is that you apparently don&#x27;t want them.<p>For some reason people will scrutinize the price of something they don&#x27;t want while being blind to how much they spend on all the things they do want.<p>e.g. we don&#x27;t have to go very far back in time to have tallied up $500 you&#x27;ve spent in your life on unneeded food that gave you seconds of pleasure only to be shat out hours later, yet you&#x27;re disgusted how someone else might choose to spend their $500, and on something like a tech gadget. It&#x27;s a very weird judgemental reflex and quite a bit obnoxious to see.')
