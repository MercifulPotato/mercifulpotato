They are all touching (kind of) and constantly moving around. There is a bit of space between the molecules, the inter-molecular space, which is a vacuum. Keep in mind that the molecules aren&#x27;t really touching since they aren&#x27;t built from rigid spheres but have electron clouds. The water molecules repel each other if they get too close, but also attract each other via hydrogen bonds, so they are about 0.3 nm apart. (Compare to 3 nm semiconductor process node.)<p>A cell is similar (since it is 60% water), but with many other types of molecules as well.')
