We’ve already seen in a dozen cities what happens if there are thawed vaccines that day: use them.<p>The rest doesn&#x27;t seem <i>different enough</i> from whats happening everywhere to really warrant Farley’s PR campaign here to prevent his resignation. <i>Everywhere</i> has bungled scheduling errors or vaccines logistics leaving extra thawed vaccines that need to be used that day irregardless of the order.<p>I was shocked reading this article but stepping back I just cant get behind this, my pitch fork is put away. I bet the CEO wasn&#x27;t even wrong about the irrelevant best practice that was cited in this article.<p>Testing is different than vaccinations. The article doesn&#x27;t distinguish that well except for “ahh theyre a for-profit company now omg oh noes.” A medical company with no actual contract with the municipality making money? How is that even a footnote. Their insurance reimbursal plan had to pivot who gives a fuck.<p>Like I said its just not different <i>enough</i>. Figure out what their logistical problems are and fix them. The end.<p>This honestly reads like Farley’s PR agent trying to prevent his forced resignation. My PR agent would typically make articles not seem to be about me by mentioning me&#x2F;my organizations deep in the listicle or at the end of the article, and we would put a competitor at the top of the listicle to deflect the idea it was advertising to begin with, and then use the coincidence of being mentioned in the same article together to open a dialogue. We didnt actually care about engagement or the clout of being in a particular publication, it was all backdoor ploys. The commonality here is that the city is “competing” with this organization and confusing everyone, within a week of one logistical issue. This reads like that to me.<p>This isn&#x27;t worth our attention.')
