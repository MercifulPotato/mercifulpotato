Sometimes (surprisingly often I think) people should not do the work they are being requested to do.  Just because one&#x27;s boss (and one&#x27;s paycheck) depends on following a set of instructions, if it goes against one&#x27;s conscience, what is the point?<p>I mean, someone wrote these &#x27;track and trace&#x27; apps.  This is to say, they are explicitly enabling the government to track every single move of its citizens.  Is that ok?  Not to me.  They should have resigned rather than play their part in increasing governmental control.<p>Unfortunately, technologists are building the dystopia of tomorrow.  &#x27;Smart&#x27; cities, anything that encourages use of a &#x27;smart&#x27; phone, more data in the hands of FAANG, etc, etc.<p>smart == spy<p>If you are under the panopticon, you are not you any longer.  You respond to please others, not yourself.  You are in fact a slave.<p>Anything that enforces the hierarchical system, making it ever more restrictive, has blood on their hands in my view.  We are designing a future that is less free, less accepting, more rigid.  No one wants it.  But all those doing the work, are selling out their fellows and even their own future rights, for a paycheck today.')
