As it turns out, neither the ASCII nul character nor its Unicode equivalent have the semantic meaning &quot;end of stream&quot;. ASCII does have control characters for &quot;end of stream&quot;, in fact multiple: 0x03 End Of Text, 0x04 End Of Transmission, and 0x17 End Transmission Block. But 0x00 was never intended to be an end marker of any kind.<p>It&#x27;s really only the C standard that (ab)uses NUL as an end-of-string marker. So yes, after consideration, I&#x27;m starting to agree with you. U+0000 is a valid character and should be allowed in text fields.')
