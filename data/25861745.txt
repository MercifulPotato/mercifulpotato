But it’s expected that this syntax is <i>checked in and maintained</i> in the source, with all the requisite \nconstraints and dependencies. It’s unportable to other languages, unreadable without the docs, and non-standard. It&#x27;s also another runtime dependency that will need periodic security updates applied (I hope :-D). Meanwhile, there is a standard, built-in cross-language syntax for expressing these things (and great tools like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regexr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regexr.com&#x2F;</a> for reference).<p>Maybe this makes sense in one-off scripts, but I don&#x27;t see it adding value where the code is intended to be a source of truth.')
