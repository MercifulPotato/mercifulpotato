Numbers I’ve read before were in the 16-20:1 range  but can’t find any decent study sources at the moment.<p>Hope that helps.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0301421516307066" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S030142151...</a>')
