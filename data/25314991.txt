Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25315236, 25315437], score=None, time=1607180338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25314340, text='&gt; Eliminating 230 doesnâ€™t eliminate free speech, it eliminates centralized socialization.<p>How is it any less eliminative for decentralized services? If you have a private moderated forum (e.g. HN), or even a small one with only 5000 users, that&#x27;s still more than enough to attract spam and trolls. So the small forum operator deletes the spam and the trolling.<p>If that makes them responsible for everything everybody says on that forum, first of all, they&#x27;re screwed. People will post some liability-inducing material while the forum operator is on vacation and they&#x27;ll get thrown in jail for hosting it. Small forum operators don&#x27;t have the resources or the risk tolerance to put up with that, so they&#x27;ll fold, and leave the huge centralized ones to pick up their user base.<p>Worse, to avoid the liability the ones that remain will over-censor. We already see this with the DMCA. Even transparently fraudulent takedowns are typically executed anyway because it&#x27;s not worth the risk if you&#x27;re wrong or the resources of proving you&#x27;re right. Web forums aren&#x27;t courts; they aren&#x27;t a valid entity to be making complex lawful speech determinations in an accurate way, and they won&#x27;t, so instead they&#x27;ll do something despicable.<p>But you also can&#x27;t use forums that don&#x27;t moderate at all, because they&#x27;re immediately overrun with spam and trolls.<p>The actual problem with these centralized entities is not that they do moderation. It&#x27;s that they&#x27;re centralized. Break them up.')
