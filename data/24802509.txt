Popular OS projects have provided incredible value to the industry.  It&#x27;s only fair  that some of that value trickles down.  Sometimes it does (sponsorships, job offers, etc.), but oftentimes it doesn&#x27;t.  Obviously there&#x27;s no rule enforcing that creators get their fair share, and nature of open source means there could never be such a rule.  A blessing and a curse, I suppose.')
