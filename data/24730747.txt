I will check that list again (which should be linked on LINMOBapps already), there seem to be some games (and maybe more) that I have not added to my list (mostly because I just don&#x27;t care about games).<p>What I meant with &quot;state&quot; is stuff like: Does it crash? Is it &quot;feature complete&quot;? Most rating systems (including the one on MGLapps&#x2F;LINMOBapps) seem to look at &quot;does this fit the screen&quot; more than these aspects, and it is virtually impossible to fit this all into one score.')
