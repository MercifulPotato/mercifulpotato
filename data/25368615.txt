Consider only Thailand&#x27;s example as something to think about.<p>&quot;Disentangling&quot; isn&#x27;t about throwing things away and being left with nothing, it - I think - is about reevaluating what you have and what you would like through the careful consideration of the colonial legacy. The people with power in a society, even if they are not themselves &quot;colonists&quot; are often served well by the status quo, so a detached examination of these things is often challenging.<p>I think the waves and waves of &quot;colonialism&quot; are not really relevant to the discussion, the &quot;modern&quot; system of colonialism is a distinct thing, worthy of consideration in isolation and there might very well be some good to come of thinking about it. For me, I am a Canadian so I think of these things in terms of the indigenous peoples of Canada, who have had a lot of success in reclaiming something of an independent identity within Canada but still inside the larger social context. It is not a straightforward thing and it is more important to some people than to others, but it is interesting and has value nonetheless.')
