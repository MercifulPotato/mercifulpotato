I assume the big players have something in place for the domain name part, but there&#x27;s much more to it when you&#x27;re transferring an entire service (accounts, documentation, etc). If you&#x27;re going to pay $5k for a website, spending a $100 fee to make sure everything goes smoothly is probably reasonable.')
