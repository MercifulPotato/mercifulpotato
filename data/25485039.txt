Arm64 is a very good modern ISA.  RISC-V is good too.  Comparison with RISC-V must account for the much broader purpose of RISC-V, but just to focus on a few points (I&#x27;m not an Arm64 expert though):<p>* RISC-V (RV64GC) have simpler instructions than Arm64.  It&#x27;s possible it would have a slight frequency advantage given the same implementation resources, but Arm64 might need slight fewer instructions.  Notably, Arm64 have more addressing modes.  Fusion and cracking makes this mostly a wash, but implementing a RV64 cores is a lot easier than an Arm64 (I speculate).<p>* Arm64 has load pairs and store pairs; this is a significant advantage.<p>* RISC-V has no flags and conditional branches directly compares operands.  This look like a significant advantage in the code I have looked at and is easier to implement (no flag renaming etc.)')
