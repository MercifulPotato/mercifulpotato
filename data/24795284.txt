Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[24801793], score=None, time=1602802555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24794868, text='&quot;Religion only exists because we yearn the feeling of community &quot;<p>No, community is only part of it, and frankly, that we lived in communities beforehand is not relevant.<p>Religion is the &#x27;foundational philosophy concerning nature of who we are&#x27; that transcends most other subjects - i.e. it&#x27;s metaphysics at it&#x27;s core.<p>The &#x27;community&#x27; part arises only in the same way secular civic and legal issues arise in our own communities.<p>The misunderstanding is partly evident in your comment about &#x27;very religious people&#x27;.<p>You&#x27;re conflating &#x27;people who say they are hardcore believers in XYZ&#x27; with necessarily &#x27;very religious&#x27; people.<p>Fred Rogers - a trained priest, started &#x27;Mr Rogers Neighbourhood&#x27; and did that for 50 years to help communicate more intelligent ideals to children. He didn&#x27;t mention the word &#x27;God&#x27; a single time on air, you wouldn&#x27;t know directly that he was &#x27;deeply religious&#x27;.<p>Fred was not &#x27;anti science&#x27; or someone we might normally conflate with &#x27;hyper religious&#x27;.<p>As I indicated, Barack Obama is religious. He literally worked for the Church for a few years at the start of his career. One might argue his whole career was a bit missionary. Certainly Jimmy Cater&#x27;s life - and Presidency - was that.<p>They&#x27;re also not what we would consider &#x27;super religious&#x27; bent on &#x27;magical thinking&#x27; - but Fred Rogers, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama are who I would think of for example when contemplating who are &#x27;the most religious people&#x27;.<p>So in a way, the nature of the comment implies a kind of &#x27;straw man&#x27; - plucking out those with the most specific and material orthodox &#x27;beliefs&#x27; about a system, the kind for whom the parables are meant to be understood more literally because maybe they&#x27;re not so capable of the more enlightened bits - and having them representative of &#x27;the most religious&#x27; - which is a little unfair. The plebes are going to be prone to &#x27;magical thinking&#x27; no matter what happens.<p>&#x27;Scientific materialism&#x27; as it applies to the nature of life etc. is a constant stream &#x27;magical thinking&#x27; - the dissonance between &#x27;physics&#x27; and &#x27;morality&#x27; is a chasm completely too wide for anyone to seem to cross with sound thinking.<p>And finally - every modern politicized subject, even those adhered to by &#x27;intelligent people&#x27; is chock full of &#x27;magical thinking&#x27;.')
