Just click the 3 vertical dots under a thumbnail:<p>&quot;Not Interested&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t recommend channel.&quot;<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no way to tell youtube what I like.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a scenario where there&#x27;s a feasible way to &quot;tell&quot; YouTube exactly what recommended videos you want other than what it&#x27;s doing now unless the content creators themselves were all on board to properly title &amp; tag their videos. Bigger channels use clickbaity titles (eg. &quot;I was shook when I heard this&quot;). And smaller channels don&#x27;t know how to utilize keywords.<p>I personally have never had an issue with YouTube recommendations, especially after using the above method to filter out things I don&#x27;t want to see.')
