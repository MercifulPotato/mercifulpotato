It&#x27;s very plausible and could still happen today to anyone not aware that a PC laptop might be sold with something other than what they&#x27;re used to. It&#x27;s really a story about how crappy Dell was, first putting a &#x27;Recommended&#x27; tag on an enthusiast configuration, then support tricking the consumer to keep at it until it was too late to RMA. On top of all that, it makes both Linux and Dell offering a Linux configuration seem bad and that&#x27;s the worst part from my perspective.')
