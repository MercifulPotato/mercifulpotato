Even in startups it&#x27;s hard to say &quot;this is my time&quot; and this is &quot;company time&quot; especially with remote work becoming more common.<p>I&#x27;ve always taken the approach of not apologizing when I&#x27;m &quot;not available&quot; on days I requested off or when it&#x27;s late at night.  If I have significant equity, I&#x27;ll care.  But if I&#x27;m just salaried or at a BigCorp you can fuck off if it&#x27;s after 10pm.  I never understood why I knew co-workers at Amazon who would pull all nighters on weekends to &quot;fix issues&quot;.  Basically, I don&#x27;t want to work for a company that rewards that kind of thing - time is worth too much.  Hustle is worth it when you know how much skin you have in the game and can benefit from it more than your employer.')
