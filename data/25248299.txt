Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606685707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25247891, text='&gt; Roblox provides way, way more value than the App Store does, and they don&#x27;t have hardware to sell to make a profit on.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you are measuring that value or what you are comparing it to.<p>Before the App Store, iPhone developers were stuck with web apps and jailbreaking (both of which still exist of course.)<p>Suppose iOS supported sideloading and multiple app stores? Would anything change?<p>Well, Android supports sideloading and multiple app stores, but Google can still command comparable royalties to Apple&#x27;s.<p>In all three cases - Roblox, iOS, Android - the platform developer is providing a great deal of value (by creating the platform) and is trying to monetize it via commissions. Arguably iOS and Android provide much more value than Roblox since those platforms aren&#x27;t restricted to running Roblox games.<p>This isn&#x27;t a new model; Nintendo makes money on hardware sales (the Switch is basically customized tablet&#x2F;phone hardware with some nice controllers) but still acts as a platform licensor and takes commissions for eShop sales.<p>It&#x27;s probably not a coincidence either that most of the apps in the App Store are games.')
