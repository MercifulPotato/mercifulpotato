But maybe because my setup was a bit demanding, rPi4 couldn&#x27;t handle it well. (home-assistant, adguard home, nextcloud, plex, *arr apps, and many more on docker)<p>I just had to switch to a SFF desktop PC with Ubuntu on it and never looked back. For toying around rPis can be fun but in real life applications, they were getting extremely hot. Had to add extra fans etc.<p>I still use my rPi4s, one of them connected to my 3D printer with Octoprint installed on it, but that&#x27;s it.')
