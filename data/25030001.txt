Do you carry the pihole around with you?<p>Do you have a firewall running on your phone to block or redirect DNS requests? Since hardcoding and bypassing the one in network settings is extremely easy and done by default by even some Google apps. DNS leaking VPN is trivial.<p>What logs are you talking about? Blokada can use the same upstream DNS as your pihole so the logs are exactly the same if any exists.<p>Without a firewall and a VPN (both on the phone) you are not secure. With a VPN and a custom DNS service with blocklists you have an identical setup as one who uses Blokada, but without an external service.')
