NYC&#x27;s per capita budget is about 2&#x2F;3 of SF&#x27;s; there may be economies of scale and other non-linear contributors at play with NYC&#x27;s 10x larger population, or maybe SF is just less efficient.<p>edit: NYC&#x27;s MTA is funded separately, including huge state contributions, so this is a terrible comparison. Let this comment be a reminder of the difficulty in comparing municipal budgets.')
