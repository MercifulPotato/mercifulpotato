If it wobbled the computer would crash. I held mine on with blu-tack - lots of it. Every now and again I&#x27;d have to take it off and clean the contacts by rubbing the oxide layer off with an India rubber. It used to run quite hot too.<p>Despite the problems, the RAM pack was the best upgrade I had!')
