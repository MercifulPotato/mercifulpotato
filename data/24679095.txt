We were a PC&#x2F;MSFT home (as was most of Europe). Didn&#x27;t dabble with Linux until the late 90s, when I painfully installed SuSE. It was a hard time trying to get all your random devices getting to work on Linux back then. Let me tell you, it was a moment of bliss when ubuntu first came out. Aside of building and deploying docker files, I haven&#x27;t played much with Linux in the last decade. The mac has the perfect blend of a great GUI with a Linux-y terminal and compiler tools.')
