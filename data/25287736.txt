That said, it&#x27;s not for nothing because while this is was a combination of a lot of mistakes, everyone else gets to learn from these mistakes.  Other countries could simply cut emissions by replacing coal with gas, cheaply.  Now they can switch to renewables at a much better price too since they&#x27;ve waited while Germany did a lot of the learning the hard way.')
