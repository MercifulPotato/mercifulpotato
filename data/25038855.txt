Some like the MFC-L3770CDW I purchased have higher running costs than you would expect, for example. I knew this when I bought it, deciding that my low print volumes made it worth higher running costs vs the lower upfront cost (if I have a massive job itâ€™s cheaper to send it to a print shop anyway without getting into the real $$$ printers, and otherwise I print tax documents annually and occasionally print a few pages every month. I use the ADF to scan documents on a weekly basis however, so the cheap upfront cost for a auto duplexing scanner is a huge win).')
