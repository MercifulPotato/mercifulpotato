It is absolutely a radical break for me from all other WM&#x27;s since tiling allows me to work in deep focus many desktops, 1 desktop per activity&#x2F;task and my focus always on one thing not many.<p>Also wanting not to miss out on the future I moved to sway in parallel. I am literally in sway 90% of the time. The only difference is if I have to use video &#x2F; webRTC screensharing or similar (usually in the browser), in which case sway will not work. This is why I maintain a dual system of both i3&#x2F;sway.<p>Also I trust i3 to be more stable for when I am standing in front of a crowd or have to connect my system to a variety of different external beamers, monitors etc.<p>It sounds nuts to &quot;maintain&quot; 2 WM&#x27;s but my configuration and workflow never deviates no matter which system I use even across upgrades of i3&#x2F;sway.<p>When I plug in a new freshly installed machine I just fetch my dotfiles and have both i3&#x2F;sway in exactly the same way as I&#x27;m used to ... It&#x27;s incredibly easy keeping both around if one has to (or wants to). Bonus of sway is also that it has gaps support (which is cool on bigger screens, less important on laptops).<p>edit: both sway &#x2F; i3 gave me no problems at all running them under restrictive environments such as LD_PRELOAD=libhardened_malloc.so (from GrapheneOS) and also work with under firejail without problems. I&#x27;ll stop since it&#x27;s anyway clear I am a big fan of both :)')
