BetaList [1] does a good job at it (with the term &quot;beta&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s also not bad IMO if you represent yourself as a direct PH competitor. I&#x27;ve done plenty of research on successful user acquisition channels [2] and seen a lot of look-alike companies and their only difference was they were successful at utilizing different acquisition channels.
