I appreciate the question.<p>The quick and fuzzy answer is: whatever the community wants it to be :)<p>My current view follows. In a nutshell:<p>* The Agora is meant to be a <i>goal-oriented</i> social network specializing in <i>problem solving</i>.<p>* The first goal of the Agora is to build itself.<p>*  The second goal of the Agora is whatever you (the community) want it to be.<p>*  The Agora seeks to complement and enrich the internet and existing social networks instead of &quot;taking over&quot;.<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flancia.org&#x2F;agora" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flancia.org&#x2F;agora</a>:<p>&quot;You can think of the Agora as a convention based social network; an optional, user-controlled annotation layer that can be applied over any internet platform which supports user-generated content.<p>I think one of the best possible uses for such a network would be to use it to pro-socially maintain a distributed knowledge graph tailored specifically to the goal of solving problems: those of its users and society at large.<p>Its users, as a cooperative group, could by default take a naive but rational approach to problem solving:<p><pre><code>      For each problem in the set P of all problems:\n          Describe it as thoroughly as possible.\n          Maintain a set of known or argued possible solutions, S(P).\n      For each solution in S(P):\n          Describe it as thoroughly as possible.\n          Maintain a set of resources (people, time, attention, money) needed to implement it, R(S).\n</code></pre>\nIndividual users could also declare their views on the state of the world explicitly: they define which subsets of P, S and R they agree with, in the sense that they believe they are feasible, true, interesting.<p>Users that agree on their defined subsets can then efficiently collaborate on solutions as they become available by pooling of resources.<p>We apply some good old recursivity and seed the Agora with the problem of how to build itself. That is, how to build a system that allows participating users and entities to collaborate optimally in the face of adversity (such as biases, irrationality and even actual ill intent)1.<p>The Agora should be built on a federated protocol to limit the harmfulness of diasporas. Groups might temporarily diverge in their views enough to want to run separate Agoras, but different Agoras should be able to cooperate on problems and solutions for which there is enough ideological alignment, and eventually merge.&quot;')
