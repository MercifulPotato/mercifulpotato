Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=[25665536], score=None, time=1609957099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658907, text='&gt;They also have to go to school for 10 years before theyâ€™re even allowed in the job market.<p>Not to mention that during that time they are accruing loans in insane amounts (we are talking about $200-300k) and get worked in insane shifts (24-36 hour shifts are not unheard of during residency rotations).<p>Oh, and they don&#x27;t get paid at all until they start residency rotations which is AFTER 4 years of med school, and their pay during residency is on the order of $30k-50k for what effectively amounts to 80-100 hours a week. Mind you, that&#x27;s on top of the fact that in the US, you only enter a med school after you already got a college degree. So you enter a med school at the age of 23.<p>I have respect for the doctors, but I definitely do not envy their position. Their real work doesn&#x27;t even start until their 30s, at which point they are already really deep in student loan debt. Of course it is manageable, since they get paid handsomely. But their work-life balance and the entire process where you start your &quot;real work&quot; after the age of 30 with $200-300k in loans, at that point, isn&#x27;t something that a lot of people consider when they think &quot;those doctors are having it nice.&quot;<p>It isn&#x27;t even a second thought to me that I would much much rather study for interviews every single time i switch a job as a software engineer than deal with what doctors deal. And that&#x27;s not even mentioning that studying for a typical software dev interview is absolutely nothing compared to the studying that med school students have to do in order to pass their board exams.')
