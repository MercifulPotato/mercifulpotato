Shaking something inside the station won&#x27;t change its orbit a bit. It&#x27;s because to change orbit you need to change the speed you are going with. And that&#x27;s just not something you can do by vibrating a mass.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that vibrations are all safe. They can break stuff on-board, or mess up experiments. If you do it exactly right (wrong?) it can even change the attitude of the station. (after all the reaction wheels and Control moment gyroscopes look kind of like washing machine&#x27;s drum if you squint enough.)')
