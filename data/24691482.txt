At the most basic level it&#x27;s one table with key = the url blob and value = the url target. There&#x27;s already several hits for &#x27;open source url shortener&#x27; in the top results there&#x27;s one with MIT and one with GPLv2, and several others that don&#x27;t specify their license.<p>This one is neat because the author chose to restrict to the qr code &quot;alphanumeric&quot; character set that includes a couple symbols to reduce bits per character in the encoding. Now that you&#x27;re aware of that, you could certainly do that yourself or modify another shortener to do it.')
