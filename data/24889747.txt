Windows is using it since Vista. When done right, gradients mentioned in other comments are free, GPUs have hardware to interpolate values (such as colors) across vertices of triangle, for free. Many other effects are either free or very cheap.<p>Engineering-wise it&#x27;s really hard.<p>Microsoft reworked GPU driver model introducing WDDM. They invented a new user-facing API for that, introducing Direct3D 10. They did that in close collaboration with all 3 GPU vendors. They made user-mode components like desktop compositor itself, dwm.exe, and higher-level libraries to benefit from all that stuff. Initially they were optional things like WPF, Direct2D, DirectWrite, then with Win8 they introduced WinRT later rebranded to UWP. That one is no longer optional and is the only practical way to render &quot;hello world, GUI edition&quot; in modern Windows (possible to do with DirectWrite or legacy GDI but neither of them is practical).<p>The problem &quot;render nice high-resolution graphics, fast&quot; affects everything, the entire stack. Modern Linux has decent kernel infrastructure (DRM&#x2F;KMS), but even so, remaining challenges are hard. Linux has less luck with user-facing GPU APIs (Vulkan is not yet universally available, neither is GLES3+ or OpenGL 4.3+). For some GPUs, quality of drivers is less than ideal. OS maintainers oppose stabilizing kernel ABI for drivers. There&#x27;s no high level GPU-centric graphics libraries, I tried once with moderate success <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;Vrmac" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;Vrmac</a> but that only supports one specific Debian Linux on one specific computer which happens to support GLES 3.1, and some important features are missing e.g. no gradient brushes or stroked pens.<p>I don&#x27;t see any large party interested in making that happen. At least not for desktop Linux. Valve started to do relevant things when they thought Windows 10 is going to kill their Steam business model, then it became apparent Microsoft won&#x27;t make Win10 into an iOS-style walled garden, and they no longer have much motivation.')
