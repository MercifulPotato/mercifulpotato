You can read any trump tweet and watch any conspiracy video you like, no one is keeping you from it - not the platforms and not the state. The only thing that is being done is putting a notice <i>beside</i> the tweets and videos.<p>&gt; <i>You do realize that the right-wing, muslims, chinese, russians, etc also have &quot;fact-checkers&quot; right?<p>You just think that &quot;fact-checkers&quot; are correct because you agree with their politics&#x2F;agenda.</i><p>So you&#x27;re saying there is no objective truth and every opinion has equal authority? If I say the moon is made out of cheese and you say, no it isn&#x27;t, we have proof, can I accuse you of censorship?<p>&gt; <i>There are lots of ways to &quot;fact-check&quot; and spin the issue on both sides. This is true for every controversial issue from lgbt to climate change.</i><p>This is extremely vague. Please give a concrete example.<p>&gt; <i>Fact checking, just like news, is great for uncontroversial subjects. But for important controversial topics, it&#x27;s pretty much propaganda.</i><p>So what should we do instead then? How should we then reach a conclusion on controversial issues if fact checking is not an option?<p>&gt; <i>People like you are proof of why censorship is terrible and why we need free speech. Your bias clouds your judgment on facts&#x2F;reality. I&#x27;m pro-choice btw. </i><p>Which bias exactly?')
