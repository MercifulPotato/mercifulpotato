Using a camera to record a performance is an act of copying and is subject to copyright law. Generally, if the performers and&#x2F;or the owner of the copyright don&#x27;t give you permission to record the show, you don&#x27;t have the right to do so. (Note that taking pictures or recording short clips is <i>usually</i> but not always regarded as fair use. Recording an entire performance without permission is rarely treated as fair use.)<p>However, recording the performance is also an act of creation, resulting in a derivative work that has its own copyright, but one which is useless without a copyright license to the underlying performance.')
