Docker adds prerouting and masquerade changes. They don&#x27;t show up in the default iptables rule list (iptables -L). If you don&#x27;t know about it creating the other tables it adds, and how to list them explicitly, you won&#x27;t see these rules added. Docker binds to the public interface by default, rather than to much-safer private&#x2F;localhost defaults. If you have an iptables INPUT DENY rule, it doesn&#x27;t come into play at all, and that&#x27;s certainly untuitive for people who aren&#x27;t iptables experts. For example, if you&#x27;re using ufw (which most non-power-users rely on) and have it set to DENY by default, that won&#x27;t protect you from the example you provided. The way Docker works is simply wrong. It should not mess with iptables at all. It does so because that makes it &quot;easier&quot; for novice users, but that ease of use is a real security risk.')
