I do not need a cli: ide and compiler though...<p>My iPad pro is fast enough to do my dev work but I cannot run the tools to do dev.<p>Your comment is a bit weird as you know very well what people here mean: iPad is generally seen as something you cannot produce things on. I do not agree with that: unlike others here, I type as fast on the keyboard of the pro (not the new one: not tried that) as on my MacBook and Lenovo. But it just misses the applications as they are forbidden. My wife is a writer and she needs nothing else. The only thing I am saying is that for me the walled gardens and particular not compiling restrictions make it a bitter sweet device: I love it but I cannot do my work on it.')
