I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re exactly the same, but the last two are in the same range, and actually the first one was way worse.<p>&quot;Unusual&quot;, sure.  &quot;Worst in half-a-century&quot;, maybe, although some might argue HIV did more damage (albeit over a longer time period).  &quot;Unprecedented&quot; means, &quot;Never before seen, done, or experienced; without precedent&quot;.  While every pandemic is different in some way, this is not &#x27;unprecedented&#x27;.')
