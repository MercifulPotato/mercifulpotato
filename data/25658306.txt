Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609945259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657037, text='&gt; At that rate I am guessing the network doesn&#x27;t have to deal with rain or snow or customer issues cause obviously the budget for all that is not required because how can it even exist?<p>There is no such issue that ISPs are unable to solve with the infrastructure they have deployed at least for now. Keep in mind that what I am saying is anecdotal but I have a strong feeling it is the same for most Indians. In fact it was worse off earlier when they charged exorbitant rates but failed to deliver proper connectivity. Now things have improved multi-fold! Connectivity issues are now only evident when you travel to remote areas of the country. Earlier we had connectivity issues in the City&#x2F;Town limits.<p>You are forgetting that it is at a scale of multiple hundreds of millions and potentially billions of customers that these ISPs are charging cents from. Every single day. That with value added services, which they charge extra, would mean they make a fortune!<p>Cost of labour is cheap in India. Land area being small is an added bonus as that would mean lesser cable laying work and lesser infrastructure. And since we skipped a generation of DSL&#x2F;ADSL lines and jumped straight into 4G and Fiber we won&#x27;t be facing much of the same issues that first World countries are facing today. Fixing network issues would be easier than say USA (you can fit 3 Indias (3.287 million square kms) in one USA (9.834 million square kms)).')
