The best is if there are reviews that show a mask cut open and you can see whether it has the required number and type of layers.<p>I’m not too worried about unsafe materials, but if you don’t feel comfortable with it, don’t order them. The safest thing you can do is buy masks from a pharmacy in person if they are available.')
