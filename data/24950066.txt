I do not get stopped by cops, nor do they slow down to check. Random men don&#x27;t stop their cars pretending to be concerned for a woman walking around by themselves at night.<p>If someone does, I don&#x27;t feel I need to be suspicious of most folks that offer help.<p>I don&#x27;t have to worry about going broke due to health care, nor if I get sick and have to miss work.<p>Yeah, sure, people are still idiots and can be self-centered little turds. I&#x27;m no exception. But culture makes a difference. The way society treats different groups - like armed white supremacist militias - differs. Approaches to policing and prisons and rights differ. All this makes a difference in the way folks in that society treats others.<p>If everyone were truly the same, culture shock wouldn&#x27;t be a thing.<p>I&#x27;d also like to state that Europe is a big place, with a wide variety of cultures and laws and customs. Living in Greece is going to be different than the Netherlands, which are both different from Norway.<p>Edit: For clarifacation, am American, and have lived in Norway for some years.')
