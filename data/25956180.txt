The transition was rough, but I never want to go back. Tabs are grouped automatically (you can of course drag&#x2F;drop them), everything is in trees and branches you can close them as groups and subgroups, reload, favorite a tree, restore a tree, move to new window and so on and so on. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.')
