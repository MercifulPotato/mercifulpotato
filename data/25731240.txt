Why is it that it&#x27;s cheaper to buy new than repair old? In part, it&#x27;s because the cost of disposal has been shifted away, rather than being incorporated into the price of the replacement.<p>Having the manufacturer pay a tax in advance does put pressure on the consumer, because that tax has to be incorporated into the product pricing.<p>&gt; Moreover, anything that involves an &quot;assessment&quot; is bound to be gamed by the manufactures. See e.g. the recent VW car emission scandal.<p>I agree it&#x27;s a challenge. I wonder if there&#x27;s some way to close the loop - so that manufacturers who game the system to achieve an artificially low disposal price end up making up the shortfall when the fake price isn&#x27;t achieved.')
