All observers will agree on it.<p><i>&gt; You&#x27;re traveling outward at a velocity of .95c.</i><p>Relative to what?<p>Outside the horizon, velocities, such as the escape velocity you mention, are usually meant as velocities relative to static observers--observers who are maintaining the same altitude above the horizon.<p>But below the horizon, <i>there are no static observers</i>. It is <i>impossible</i> to maintain a constant &quot;altitude&quot; (which here just means the surface area of the 2-sphere at your location, centered on the hole) even for an instant. So &quot;velocity&quot; relative to a static observer has no meaning inside the horizon.<p><i>&gt; That&#x27;s lower than the escape velocity (which is &gt; c), so you&#x27;re going to fall back in before you actually get to the external observer.</i><p>No, that&#x27;s not what happens. Relativity is not Newtonian physics.<p>The event horizon is not a place in space. It is an outgoing null surface: a surface formed by radially outgoing light rays. Spacetime around the black hole is curved in such a way that this particular outgoing null surface has a constant surface area: in other words, even though there is a full 2-sphere&#x27;s worth of radially outgoing light rays at the horizon, the surface area of the 2-sphere formed by those light rays is <i>constant</i>--the 2-sphere does not expand, as you would expect a radially outgoing spherical wave front to do, because of the curvature of spacetime.<p>If you are just a little bit inside the horizon, you are on a slightly smaller 2-sphere, and on that 2-sphere, even radially outgoing light rays cannot stay in the same place, much less expand; they <i>contract</i>--that spherical wave front, even though it is radially outgoing, <i>decreases</i> in area with time, i.e., it is falling. So you, having to move slower than light, will fall even more. You can&#x27;t move outward at all; you can&#x27;t even stop moving inward. (The fact that there are no static observers inside the horizon is a consequence of this.) That is true no matter how hard you accelerate, since no amount of acceleration will let you move faster than light.')
