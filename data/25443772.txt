(FWIW, I don&#x27;t feel the same way about concerts or VIP tickets).<p>This may not be a great explanation, but there&#x27;s an element of &quot;dance, monkey, dance!&quot; when someone pays money to a streamer to say their message.  The streamer will usually read the message (barring ToS).<p>It&#x27;s similar to how tipping at Cold Stone Creamery (an ice cream chain in the US) means the staff have to sing a short song for you.  There might be fun intentions involved but if the people who you are giving money to aren&#x27;t really into it, it feels wrong.')
