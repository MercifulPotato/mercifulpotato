Municipalities have reduced responsibility. All the important services are funded directly from central governments. \nSo you don&#x27;t get problems like underfunded schools and such. Municipalities get pocket money also from the central government and are only in charge of less important infrastructure and service.<p>There is no property tax, but we have capital gains taxes based on transfers of assets.')
