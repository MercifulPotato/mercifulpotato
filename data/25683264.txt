It&#x27;s true that in Tokyo you can live far from the center of Tokyo and still have a lively neighborhood around the station, and reliable train to commute to the inner-Yamanote area. You still suffer if you need to commute because the trains are packed at peak time (station staff literally pushing people in so the doors can close).<p>In Paris however, you either live in Paris itself (roughly the size of the Yamanote line) but it&#x27;s crazy expensive especially if you have kids and need a bigger appartment, or you live in the suburbs that are mostly just housing and train (RER &amp; Transilien) is unreliable.<p>If you want to live in the &quot;15-minutes neighborhood&quot; with everything, but can&#x27;t afford to live inside Paris or down town of a big metropolis, you need to move to a middle-size city but then getting a job in your area is more difficult.')
