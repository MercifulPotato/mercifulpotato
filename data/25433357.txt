I find the desktop app pretty good.<p>I see people complaining about it being slow, but that&#x27;s not been my experience.<p>My main complaint with the desktop app is that I really want it to sync message history with the phone app. If you, for example, don&#x27;t use your laptop for a while, you&#x27;ll have to re-authorize it and it won&#x27;t have any messages from when it was off. I realize all of that is a trade-off for their security design, but having access to all my messages and being able to search them is important to me.')
