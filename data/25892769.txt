Itâ€™s been amazing to see the change.<p>I am in the process of buying a few acres of land further south of this area, in Buckley, WA.<p>I hope to build a garage&#x2F;shop on the property, have space for my amateur radio hobby, and a few years from now, build a modest home. I would then sell my current home here in Kirkland.<p>Yet no one knows what tomorrow will bring. So I have no idea of how any of this will actually unfold.')
