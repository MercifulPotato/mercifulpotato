I cannot say if they too monetize the data that opens up to them for grabs.<p>It took legislation and years of preparation to enforce APIs and interoperability onto European banks (yes, I can now use bank A&#x27;s app to view my account balance in bank B, while maintaining control over what kind of access I&#x27;m giving). Can&#x27;t see it happening in the US, though, although the demand for such APIs is clearly there, given that companies like Plaid and Yodlee prosper.')
