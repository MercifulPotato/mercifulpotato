Thanks for flagging :) My guess is that it was definitely inspired by Lunch Money as the founders here have reached out to me before about liking my branding.<p>I did not use any stock illustrations for our logoâ€“ the idea was thought up by me and subsequently digitally illustrated by me also. I&#x27;ve had my logo&#x2F;branding both partly and fully copied time and time again, and while  seeing this is a bit annoying, I&#x27;d chalk it up to &quot;heavy inspiration&quot; over out-right copying. That being said, Leave Me Alone is doing great stuff in a different space and I am rooting for their success.')
