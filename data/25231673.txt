Didn’t mean to just wanted to share something different than everyone else I guess.<p>I have an unconventional approach. I just don’t work on ideas that I don’t find interesting or am not passionate about. Passion is the only thing that makes it easy to work through the hard parts to see the idea through, so I stopped trying to lie to myself about HAVING to work ideas. I change my mind a lot, but literally dream about my projects sometimes and will turn and try those ideas out sometimes. I’m not going to take over the world, or work well with others this way, but I absolutely love it and maybe I’ll be able to finish something soon and be able to sell it! If not whatever I’m an experienced software developer I can go find work')
