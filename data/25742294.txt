These are the top 3 ways ppl make money (or lose money):<p>1) buying cheap far out of money, near expiry naked puts or calls (gambling)<p>2) selling cheap far out of money, near expiry puts or calls (taking out a loan from the mob to pay yourself a salary)<p>3) a combination of the above but with varying expiration date and strike price (limited risk, low payout, essentially grinding)<p>Different market conditions have different strategies, you can make money in any type of market whether it trades flat, bull or bear.<p>Probably the most popular method is people selling essentially insurance to gamblers from #1. There&#x27;s just no way that the market can crash overnight right?<p>You have to be lucky every time and the market needs to be lucky only once to end your trading career.<p>Looking back, I think buying stocks or index is really best for passive investors.
