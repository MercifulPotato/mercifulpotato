For example, in a language supporting private&#x2F;protected&#x2F;public properties and methods, you should always default to private, as that’s most limited and easiest to reason about. Then make it more public as necessary. Same goes for const vs. let - const is more limited, it’s a better default choice, only use let if you actually need to re-assign it. Using const means there’s one less thing for readers of the code to worry about, it’s a variable that CAN’T be reassigned, the same way you don’t have to worry about a private method being called externally.<p>This is, essentially, the “principle of least power.”')
