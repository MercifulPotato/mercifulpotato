And so the question is, did the GPLv3 improve or degrade adoption of copyleft licensing?<p>To quote from Star Wars, &quot;The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.&quot;<p>Like it or not, companies fund the vast majority of open source software development, not hobbists, and when the FSF tried to &quot;tighten its grip&quot; by making a license which moved the balance of benefits more towards free software users, and away from the companies which funded the work, things didn&#x27;t go well for them.    And so what the FSF has found is that the the goals of the free software manifesto has been, more and more, slipping through its fingers.<p>Unless you can make non-free software illegal across all countries, at the end of the day, you need to find a balance where all stakeholders are comfortable with the result so that users, developers, and company freely and happily choose to use free software.   This is a negotiation, and if there is more value that can be gained by signing onto the free software ecosystem, then perhaps the balance can be shifted a bit more towards the free software goals.   But until you can, given that most open source developers do like food with their meals, a successful open source strategist has to be grounded in the economic and business realities.   Just raising your right hand in a fist and shouting, &quot;power to the people&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; is generally not going to get you very far.')
