Climate change also disrupts food systems and will cause civil war and mass migrations. Millions will need to migrate just from coastal flooding, which I&#x27;d imagine will cause plenty of geopolitical strife and ultimately lead to many deaths.<p>&quot;Existential threat&quot; in my mind means humanity itself is threatened. The species will likely survive but millions if not billions will die due to climate change.')
