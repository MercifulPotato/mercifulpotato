The overall number of extreme weather events rised significantly (chart at page 15).<p>2. Tornadoes, which were extremely rare in Italy, now have 10s of occurrences per year (chart at page 40).<p>3. Both droughts and floodings are more common (charts at page 44 for droughts, page 34 for floodings).<p>4. Average temperatures in the major Italian cities raised considerably in the last 10 years with Rome reaching a shocking +3.6Â°C (Charts at page 55).<p>Happy to help translating other bits, but those are the numbers that got my attention. The remainder of the report is about how Italy should prepare for these new circumstances. Extremely interesting, but hard to translate succinctly.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legambiente.it&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;Rapporto-cittaclima-2020.pdf')
