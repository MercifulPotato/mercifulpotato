Item(by='arshbot', descendants=None, kids=[25413025], score=None, time=1607889665, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409390, text='&gt; doesn&#x27;t say much for democracy does it? Hundreds of millions of indians living without electricity, indoor plumbing and in abject poverty.<p>Wow what a cherry picked example. I guess being a &quot;democracy&quot; should just magically solve a millennia of colonialism and thousands of years of rigid class hierarchy? And even if it absolutely should, the wealth gap in india is at an all time low due to Reservation policies.<p>&gt; Sure, but the article is talking about riots and attacks. And it&#x27;s a taiwanese company they are rioting against. The irony.<p>Yes, they haven&#x27;t been paid for months. In india the workers don&#x27;t take that sitting down.<p>&gt; &quot;China&#x27;s policies of suppression&quot;. China&#x27;s policies were copied from japan, korea, singapore, etc who in turned copied from the US. Parrots parroting.<p>Interesting, I never saw nets along the company housing in japan&#x2F;us preventing workers from killing themselves, nor have I heard of american workers sneaking letters in products begging for help.<p>Also, I love how you&#x27;re equating humans rights with &quot;virtue signalling&quot;. Spoken exactly like a privelaged fool who doesn&#x27;t understand the value of right, yet deems them unworthy for others.')
