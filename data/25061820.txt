If the heater is kept below 140f, the water is not safe to drink. There&#x27;s also a question of various soft metals in the tank itself as well as any connecting plumbing that may leech into the water. That&#x27;s not a concern in a life or death situation, but you generally shouldn&#x27;t drink hot water from your tap.<p>All in all, you&#x27;re probably better off with iodine tablets or some sort of filter.')
