I doubt Apple spent more money than Intel on building chipsets.<p>I&#x27;m guessing what happened is that Apple offered Intel engineers a decent package and salary to leave and work for them instead. I&#x27;m also guessing that Intel were not willing to offer the same salary or better.<p>Hopefully Intel will learn a lesson.')
