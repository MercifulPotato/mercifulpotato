Sometimes I find it is just too thin and needs to be wound too many times.\nIn these cases I find that a bit of caulk covered afterwards in tape works best.\nThere is also a product like a thread covered in teflon (looks kinda like dental floss) but I never tried it because it was too expensive. Maybe as a professional it saves time.<p>Also I found that the direction you wind the tape matters. It is easier if the female&#x2F;receptacle&#x2F;socket part that needs to be screwed does not go against the end of the tape but in the same direction.')
