But yeah I walked into a Papa John&#x27;s pizza and half the employees were wearing no masks and the other half were wearing &quot;chin diapers&quot; when I visited last month.<p>I live in Kansas and mask compliance here is actually really high in all the places I go shopping, which someone on the coasts might not expect. People just don&#x27;t want to cause trouble, even if they disagree with the restrictions. My 82 year old grandmother has said as much, she has made a decision that the mental health toll isn&#x27;t worth it, and she&#x27;ll risk exposure to go grocery shopping, but doesn&#x27;t want to cause trouble so wears her mask.')
