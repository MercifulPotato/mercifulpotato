The fact that you view people as &quot;employed&quot; or &quot;unemployed&quot; speaks so much how damaged you are. I don&#x27;t want to be &quot;employed&quot;, I want to be a person who can work when I want instead of being forced to be a stable worker who predictably clocks in half of my time every week. Gig work moves us in this direction and is therefore a good thing. Americans instead want to force even more people to go full time and get tied down to a job, isn&#x27;t that the horrible dystopia we all want to avoid?<p>&gt; dependent on gig work because of institutional failure on several fronts within California in particular.<p>Those aren&#x27;t most drivers though, and hurting most drivers just so that you can take the last lifeline of these poor drivers you speak of away since it doesn&#x27;t meet some arbitrary standards you think these people should have makes you a horrible person imo. Also, Prop 22 actually ensures gig workers gets health benefits and minimum wage, so I am not sure why you are against it except you wanting to force people to tie themselves to a company via employment contract.')
