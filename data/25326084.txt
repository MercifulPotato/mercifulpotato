This avoids having to know any of the underlying details of setting up the Kubernetes cluster.  Everything you do in terms of interacting with the cluster on Minikube will be the same as on your production managed Kubernetes.<p>All you really need to learn is some basics around Kubernetes terminology, the kubectl command line utility, and then some of the YAML config syntax for setting up application deployments and probably an ingress into the cluster.  You can also add helm into the mix if you&#x27;d like to take advantage of pre-built packages that you can install to your cluster.  For example SSL certificate management or a webserver ingress like nginx-ingress.')
