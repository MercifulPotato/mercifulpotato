This was the only way I survived. I learned that you don&#x27;t have to be a &#x27;numbers person&#x27; at all to be good at math. You just have to understand what&#x27;s going on under the hood, and this may require lots of questions and outside help. But most importantly, you just have to practice<p>I agree with all of this and it&#x27;s how I got through extensive math. I&#x27;m not a &quot;natural&quot; at math and I&#x27;m not sure that really exists or possibly very people that are. I made sure to get to the office hours and I was surprised that there was almost no one there most of the time. I figured the cost of tuition is best justified by using as many hours of one-on-one time with an expert in the subject to better understand it yourself.<p>And to your last point about practice, I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough. I would do the same problem sets over and over until I had them down. And it wasn&#x27;t just memorizing the steps but rather getting to the point of being able to recognize the pattern. This made math &quot;easy&quot; at that point which is a weird phenomenon. Something that seemed so confusing and impossible suddenly becomes &quot;easy&quot;. And then you can move on to the next step.<p>I understand rote learning is not popular because it is painful. But I do believe &quot;drilling it in&quot; over and over gets the job done. But it takes the will and the effort. It&#x27;s been a long time but I think I could still solve most the math I took back then.')
