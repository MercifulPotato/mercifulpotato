Feels cluttered and not at-a-glance readable.<p>&gt; sig {params(name: String, id: String).returns(Integer)}<p>My ruby isn&#x27;t quite good enough to parse the language constructs that make up that line, but it&#x27;s not pretty. I guess....sig is a class method which takes a block....and params is a class method (Added to BasicObject or something, perhaps?) to which you can pass any number of keyword params, and which returns an object that has a return method, to which you can pass any object type. I guess I don&#x27;t know why you need to call sig at all, as opposed to just params( args ).returns( type ). I also have no idea how the sig call gets associated with the method that follows it.<p>I just wonder if there was a cleaner way to phrase this that&#x27;s still syntactically viable.')
