It had already once a complete reset, but still, I have a lot of trouble. Special since the new BIOS update about a month ago, it crashes once or twice a day again.<p>In theorie Win10 looks nice. I tryed to upgrade one of my notebooks at home from Win7 to Win10. Privacy is one thing, but CandyCrush and things like that, was a totaly show stopper for me. I mean, I even have the Pro licences, but so much bloat ..\nSo since the, I&#x27;m Linux only at home. I will never upgrade to Win 10.')
