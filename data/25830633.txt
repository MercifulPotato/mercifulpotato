Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=[25830689], score=None, time=1611037861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829641, text='Disclaimer : I am not American, and could care less for your politics.<p>&gt; Can you point to a place where he specifically encouraged trespassing or violence in a way that is more egregious than the ways in which various Congresspeople encouraged violence in Kenosha or Minneapolis?<p>This seems like a weird statement to me. Does it matter what other Congresspeople said or not said? I had a quick read of the speech you linked. Its clear that the whole speech is priming the crowd that their vote has been stolen, and that they need to go their and fight for their votes.<p>&gt; Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down.<p>&gt; Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.<p>&gt; Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.<p>&gt; I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.<p>This bit right here is clearly indicating that the people need to walk to the Capitol, to &quot;confront&quot; the egregious assault, to show strength, to &quot;not going to be cheering so much for some of them&quot;. Granted yes, he also does state that they will be marching over &quot;peacefully&quot; and &quot;patriotically&quot; but spending paragraphs telling an audience that their votes are stolen, and they must fight those who stole their vote and then throwing in a few words about peacefully doesn&#x27;t absolve you when that mob does basically what you said.<p>Near the end :<p>&gt; And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.<p>&gt; So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try and give.<p>Again, clearly indicating that they need to go to the Capitol, to &quot;fight like hell&quot; and ensure that Republicans vote in a certain way. I think anyone reading between the lines can clearly see how a group of people who believe this man quite a bit would get an indication that they need to walk to and into the Capitol.')
