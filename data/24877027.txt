If all the HFCs currently in use were vented instead of collected and incinerated, it would produce as much greenhouse effect as all the CO2 we have added to the atmosphere.<p>Some of the CFCs and HFCs get collected, mostly at industrial sites. Car and residential mostly leaks.<p>At least xFCs don&#x27;t acidify oceans.')
