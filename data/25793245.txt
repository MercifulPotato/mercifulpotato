I do not think that.<p>I am sure several of these libraries are well-crafted, the developer(s) behind them might be excellent and have cared a great deal about performance and did their best to optimize every function. My point was more: people tend to pull in a lot more functionality&#x2F;features than they need, and the few things you do need, it is often better to write yourself (you may disagree again).<p>This will often give you the most optimized solution, and the one with the smallest binary.<p>In another HN thread, someone mentioned Unity and the size of the binary required just to display a pixel, a square, or whatever their example was--although their example was not an apple-for-apple comparison and not quite fair, the point still stands, that Unity is a general solution, and if your only requirement is drawing a pixel, of course Unity is not the correct solution.')
