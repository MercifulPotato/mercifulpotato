And not only because I have a long-running art project called This Like That.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure about using Mechanical Turk.  If the goal is to have unbiased opinions, is that a good place to source them?<p>I would assume MT participants are trying to complete tasks as fast as possible.  If I&#x27;m on MT and you ask me &quot;A or B?&quot; my incentive is to give you an immediate answer.  I have no incentive to align that answer with my actual opinion.<p>Also I wouldn&#x27;t expect MT to give me a particularly random sample.  I mean, if I&#x27;m wondering how my B2B SAAS logo is perceived, is an answer from MT going to overlap much with the opinions of my target audience?<p>It seems like a fun thing to try as a toy, like rolling dice only with humans.  I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;d use it for any question I really cared about.')
