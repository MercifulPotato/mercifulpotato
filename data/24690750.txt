I tried all kinds of chairs and discovered one thing. Nothing really works for me when spending much time in a chair. And even  though I am fit my back did not really like the way of life and started to hurt. Finally I&#x27;ve got myself rowing machine and in addition to a regular physical activities I also row for an hour every other day or two. This has worked wonders for me. My back feels fine now and I have no problems whatsoever sitting at the regular desk. Come summer I let it go and swim in the open water instead to the same result.')
