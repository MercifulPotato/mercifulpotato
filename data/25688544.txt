Silencing people doesn&#x27;t make them go away or give up,it makes them double down on their beliefs (whether based on conspiracy theories or not) and continue to escalate.  Good faith arguments and honest media are how we solve this problem, not by banning people we disagree with just to feel good on the inside.')
