It&#x27;s also worth keeping Hanlon&#x27;s Razor in mind (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hanlon%27s_razor</a>).<p>Regarding the &quot;trial by combat&quot; line - an article on Giulani&#x27;s speech (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-election-2020&#x2F;rudy-giuliani-dc-trump-rally-b1783428.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-electio...</a>) describes it like this:<p>&gt; While baselessly claiming that Democrats won elections because of fraud, Mr Giuliani bellowed to the crowd: “Who hides evidence? Criminals hide evidence, not honest people!”<p>&gt; He continued: “Over the next ten days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent, and if we&#x27;re wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we&#x27;re right, a lot of them will go to jail.”<p>&gt; Mr Giuliani then suddenly yelled: &quot;Let&#x27;s have trial by combat!&quot; to lacklustre cheers from the crowd.<p>To me this does not sound like a call to violence. It sounds like a bad joke or poorly-worded bluster or an attempt at hyperbole. Giuliani was quick to condemn the riot at the capitol, for what it&#x27;s worth (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RudyGiuliani&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347149858000556032" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RudyGiuliani&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347149858000556032</a>).')
