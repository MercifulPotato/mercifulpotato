Fabs are focusing on specifics that are still giving gain: lower power transistors, SRAM. Really high performance transistors like for amps have not gotten much smaller, DRAM has not gotten much smaller, analog has not gotten much smaller.<p>The capacitors and sense amplifiers in DRAM have not gotten smaller nearly as fast as any of the other features.<p>&gt; DRAM chips are integrated circuts that consist of individual transistors and capacitors for each bit, plus the wiring and logic to read, refresh, and write to those bits.<p>I know what a DRAM is...')
