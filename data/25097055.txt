There was a lot for me to get excited about since then:<p>* AMD64<p>* SMT<p>* Dual-core &#x2F; multicore<p>* On-chip integrated graphics that weren’t awful (low-end discrete graphics aren’t a thing anymore)<p>* Gigantic L3 and L4 caches (a side-effect of on-chip graphics)<p>* Turbo mode making a comeback (yes, I know Turbo Mode switches actually slowed down computers)<p>Judging by Apple’s direction, it’s looking like we’ll start seeing actual (ultra-fast) RAM on-chip too, with Optane that could mean we can finally move-away from block-addressed storage and have a massive flat memory-space for <i>everything</i> .')
