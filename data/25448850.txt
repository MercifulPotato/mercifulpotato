Item(by='gwerbret', descendants=None, kids=[25449043, 25449158, 25449245], score=None, time=1608153620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445493, text='This is a bit off-topic, and is probably a na√Øve question, so forgive me in advance for both.<p>I&#x27;ve always been under the impression that &quot;engineer&quot; was a protected professional title, just like &quot;medical doctor&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot;, at least in part because there are certain legal responsibilities that come with the title. It&#x27;s thus a little confusing to see the title being used, here on HN and elsewhere, by self-taught folks who have not gone through any formal education or professional accreditation. In fact, it seems that &quot;dev&quot; and &quot;engineer&quot; are used essentially interchangeably, only sometimes depending on whether the particular employment involves actual engineering.<p>Does this mean that &quot;engineer&quot; is no longer considered a protected title? Or are software engineering and development (in the real world) considered so similar as to be indistinguishable? I&#x27;m asking out of genuine curiosity.')
