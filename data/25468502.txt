Boring, repetitive combat, &quot;loot everything&quot; inventory management - lots of useless garbage available to collect, very unsatisfying and boring MMO-like crafting system.<p>But the difference is - W3 could always fall back on its incredible setting, story, music, and memorable characters that we met in previous games. And the main quest + DLC stories were quite good as well.')
