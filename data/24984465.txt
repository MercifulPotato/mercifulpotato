Also, skipping over phrases like, “Mort Sullivan&#x27;s Personal Opinion That...” helps a lot (that phrase, along with registering himself as an LLC is giving me strong sovcit vibes).<p>As to what actually started this, it looks like there was a landfill with alleged hazmat in it, but there wasn’t a lawsuit filed in time (under the Clean Water Act?
