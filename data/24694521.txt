The event is promoted through official channels (an all-hands meeting), is on our company calendar, and has food paid for by the company. AFAIK, only people-of-color are invited--the guest list is hidden.<p>I have moral concerns about this event in that it makes white people feel excluded and considered &quot;other&quot;. I&#x27;m sure there is more nuance to the situation, but I feel uncomfortable raising the issue given the current political climate.<p>Some additional context: my company has a black CEO and employs people-of-color at a rate above the US population averages.<p>What would you do if you were in my situation?')
