At $PreviousJob we wrote proprietary software but used open source software (for example Intel DPDK). If DPDK were to suddenly switch their licensing, we would never have the resources to maintain something like that long term.  So just because it _can_ be forked and &quot;taken over&quot; by another company doesn&#x27;t mean will. It most likely won&#x27;t.')
