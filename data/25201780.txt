Rather it is moving from Java or Python or Ruby or Perl to Rust.<p>You&#x27;d pretty much never make the move from Java -&gt; C++ because of the lack of safety.  But you may want to do it because of the other non-safety features.<p>That is where Rust is interesting and competitive.  It&#x27;s the performance and memory footprint of C++ with the memory safety of Java.')
