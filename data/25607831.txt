You are directly supporting an unethical business and generating at least as much revenue for them as the salary you take home. You have sold your soul, quite literally. You don&#x27;t believe this because questioning it would call into question your own self-image as an upstanding person, it&#x27;s a basic human bias that prevents you from confronting it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you aren&#x27;t an upstanding person in general. I am saying that you are doing something wrong, and bias prevents you from recognizing or admitting it, even to yourself. You <i>can&#x27;t</i> just quit, because quitting would be admitting that you&#x27;re wrong. And that&#x27;s hard to do!')
