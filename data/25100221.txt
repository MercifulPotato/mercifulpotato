Politely refuse, and offer private consultancy at $very_high_price, with alternative, to open a bug in the bug tracker, making explicit that there is no commitment.<p>Something important to keep in mind is also that by establishing ignoring as a policy, one will never learn to politely refuse.<p>I&#x27;m a maintaner as well, and I speak for personal experience.')
