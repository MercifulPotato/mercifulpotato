I screwed my first 2 years in college. My GPA is 2.7, but I got a way too colorful transcript( F, I, E.......nearly every symbol you can see on registrars page). I have plagiarism too. I realized my behaviors are really bad and decided to change. I improved my study habits and got a 4.0 for the first time. I really wanted to do well in school and get an job! Is there any advice? If I got a internship, is it even possible to go through the back ground check? I donâ€™t want to be homeless Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!')
