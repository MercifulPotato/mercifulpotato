It’s the same reason you should prefer disk UUIDs over &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda. For a long time sysadmins have used udev to pin eth0, eth1, etc. to specific network interfaces to solve this problem but it’s clunky.<p>systemd changed this in a very elegant way. The BIOS already assigns fixed names to network devices! If you use those you don’t have to query the device for its MAC to figure out its identity like we do with partuuids and diskuuids. The crazy names come from your vendor — nothing stops them from being eth0 eth1. Dell uses eno1 ens1 and enp0s1 depending on the kind of card.<p>Now by default network device names are fixed and if you want eth0 eth1 like you’re used to the process hasn’t changed.')
