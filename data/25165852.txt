We&#x27;re the weird ones who upgrade them and keep using them for 9 years, 3 SSDs, and 4 RAM bumps.<p>&gt; Their performance is okish<p>Nope - not even close to merely &#x27;okish&#x27;.  These first devices (which were clearly targeted as the cheapest, lowest-end devices Apple sells) outperform the vast majority of PCs (and Macs) sold today, and not just by a tiny bit.  Look at some of the reviews by developers - in many cases their existing Intel apps and games are running better under Rosetta emulation&#x2F;bridge&#x2F;whatever you want to call it then they did on native Intel Macs.  Compile times for a $999 MacBook Air beat a $6k+ iMac Pro by 30-40%.  Games getting better frame rates under Rosetta than they did on native intel boxes.<p>The list goes on - these chips are beasts, and this is only the beginning.  The high-performance versions of these will make people who bought 8&#x2F;10&#x2F;12 core iMac Pros recently weep.')
