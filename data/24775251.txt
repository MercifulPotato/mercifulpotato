They quote Jane Doe, the Mass coalition against sexual assault and domestic violence, to make it seem like they&#x27;re against the law.  If you go to Jane Doe&#x27;s website they say they aren&#x27;t against the law, that the quote wasn&#x27;t authorized, is out of context, and that they&#x27;re disgusted that somebody would use battered woman as pawns to further their unrelated political agenda.')
