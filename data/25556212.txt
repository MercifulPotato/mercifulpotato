(This has mostly gone away)<p>Older people might spend hours sitting on their stoop, and basically end up being a neighborhood watch.<p>Neighbors get to know each other, and are more likely to quickly identify someone being violent and call the police.<p>Overall, I would always choose a block with stoops over one without, everything else being more or less equal.')
