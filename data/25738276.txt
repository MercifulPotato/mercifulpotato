The course didn&#x27;t just focus on writing assembly for its own sake, but rather as a way to teach lower level concepts.<p>e.g. the entire concept of CPU registers, translating 1:1 between assembly and machine code, examining C compiler output, low-level debugging, disassembly, etc.<p>Day one of the course had us download and set up DOSBox, which was brilliant. DOSBox will run on a huge number of platforms and, as you and others suggest, locks you into a very well-known simpler 16-bit system that <i>can&#x27;t</i> ever change (the games it&#x27;s meant to emulate would stop working).')
