The Albany Mall, New York,[1] Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s monument to brutalism, probably comes closest. The Raj Path in New Delhi is similar, built huge on purpose to intimidate the populace.<p>Sheer size to impress has gone out of fashion, since building very large structures isn&#x27;t a big deal any more. Huge convention centers, air terminals, malls, and stadiums are normal now, and don&#x27;t impress people much.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;@42.6489482,-73.7611536,51.20615875a,0d,60.39003113y,31.55121449h,101.83203331t,0r" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;@42.6489482,-73.7611536,51.2061...</a>')
