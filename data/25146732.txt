Maybe that&#x27;s not the biggest deal in the world, but I still remember the last viscerally and we&#x27;re already a fifth of the way to the next one (not to mention the timestamp bug one coming up in a decade).<p>I disagree with the other comment&#x27;s suggestion that leap hours can be taken into consideration like DST. I see no reason why DST code (which is generally implemented as an extra timezone) could straightforwardly be adapted to handle a single permanent shift of time.')
