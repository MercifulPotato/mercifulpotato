An entire generation of modern computer users never had the opportunity, did they? You&#x27;d connect to the internet to download your email, then you disconnected (otherwise, you&#x27;d use up too much of your phone line and get a big phone bill).<p>The POP3 protocol still works. You can still get Mozilla Thunderbird and grab POP3-style emails from GMail or whatever. But people want IMAP instead, an always-connected model provides better idea of which emails were &quot;read&quot; or &quot;not read&quot;, for example.<p>Ex: You may download all emails on your Phone, but maybe Email#0 is never opened on your phone. If you used POP3, you don&#x27;t know if Email#0 was read or not, the protocol just assumed you read it. POP3 was more useful back then, when you only had one computer of any sort and didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping multiple devices in sync.<p>-------<p>How did forums work back then? Through USENET. A similar concept, where you&#x27;d download the messages, then disconnect from the internet as you read all the updates.<p>BBS machines however were online-only, and the start of real-time collaboration IIRC (not that I ever used BBS, but that&#x27;s my understanding of that old telnet technology). I don&#x27;t know the history: whether BBS or IRC came first (or which was popular first...)<p>The &quot;Killer App&quot; for the internet, AOL Email &#x2F; Juno Email &#x2F; etc. etc. was offline-first, by and large. At least, to me (a good ol&#x27; &quot;Eternal September&quot; user who joined the internet community well after 1993).<p>--------<p>Anyway, you&#x27;d read and write emails while offline. Then you&#x27;d hit &quot;send&quot;, which would boot up the modem, take over your phone line (woops, Mom&#x27;s talking on the phone. Sorry mom!!). Wait for Mom to get off the phone, THEN you connect to the internet...')
