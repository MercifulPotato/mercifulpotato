I&#x27;m playing at 1600p with a 3090 and a 10900k, so I think it&#x27;s valid to say I&#x27;m playing the &quot;best version&quot; of the game technically speaking.<p>The bugs are not why I requested (but was denied)_a refund, the writing is just truly terrible.<p>-<p>In the entire game there are about 6 dialog choices that matter. Every single other piece of dialog will result in little to no change in the course of a conversation.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly jarring because it means often times you choose option A, and the character pays lip service to option A and immediately starts spouting option B!<p>And from a higher level, the writing is some of the most lazy I&#x27;ve ever encountered.<p>Nothing is left to the imagination. The writers didn&#x27;t seem to have any concept of &quot;show don&#x27;t tell&quot;. The whole first act is constantly giving away it&#x27;s finale in the most insulting way. It almost makes you not want to finish it when you add in how little effort was put into making you care about how it ends...<p>The next act is just a terrible mess that I&#x27;m sad to see Keanu Reeves got involved in. You can tell he never got into this character because the entire time it feels like he&#x27;s reading a book while doing the voices for it...<p>There&#x27;s so little internal consistency in the story. I don&#x27;t want to start spoiling things, but it&#x27;s like the cast is just constantly being shuttled onto stage to do a jig and shuffled off.<p>I&#x27;m am 99% sure most players will get the same ending because there&#x27;s only one character any effort is put into fleshing out, and coincidentally, the &quot;life choice&quot; that they match is also the most fleshed out one... it wreaks of the idea this was a game with one titular timeline with a bunch of half-assed alternatives tacked on at the end.<p>And I really do mean the end, because of those 6 or so choices that matter in the game, almost all of them happen in the last 20 minutes of the game. The pacing is just so painfully bad, I couldn&#x27;t believe it as it was happening.<p>This is not a good RPG, this is not a good action game, it&#x27;s not a good anything.<p>It feels like CDPR worked on fun ideas for 7 years then tried to distill this disjointed mess into a game in the last 1 or 2.')
