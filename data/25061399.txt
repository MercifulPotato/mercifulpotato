If you want something aligned software maintainers first and foremost, you want a non-profit &#x2F; foundation that&#x27;s got priorities aligned with the larger community and not a for-profit entity that has to justify keeping the lights on.<p>Kinda silly headline, too. There are many package registries, but we only see two here that have business models interfering with distribution of software. Only one that&#x27;s really impeding the ability to host software elsewhere if you don&#x27;t like their business model.<p>Docker Hub&#x27;s rate limits seem unlikely to impact most usage of Docker, and people who&#x27;re pulling 200 images every six hours should either seek to set up their own registry to take the load off Docker Hub or throw some money to help shoulder the costs. Even if the user&#x27;s only grabbing Alpine images at 5MB per image, 200 in six hours starts to add up!<p>[1] Granted maintainers may do a lot of work in actually maintaining the software.')
