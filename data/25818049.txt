But, as part of the ongoing Redux docs rewrite, we now specifically recommend &quot;folder-by-feature&quot; instead [0], as well as using a single &quot;ducks&#x2F;slice&quot; file for all the Redux logic of a given feature.<p>Agreed that a couple top-level &quot;types&quot; folders may be useful for more generic&#x2F;reusable code.<p>I do have a small Next project set up at my day job, and it does seem like it encourages a &quot;folder-by-type&quot; approach based on the use of `&#x2F;pages`.  But, I set up a `&#x2F;features` folder alongside that, and have been filling it out accordingly.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;style-guide&#x2F;style-guide#structure-files-as-feature-folders-or-ducks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;style-guide&#x2F;style-guide#structure-files...</a>')
