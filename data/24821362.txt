That it&#x27;s a prepackaged setup for all users to avoid having these kinds of problems? It&#x27;s pointed out right at the beginning and then a longer description is linked to about how the writer <i>hit exactly this kind of problem because mac has different basic utilities and their sed worked differently</i>.<p>&gt; I really don&#x27;t see how having to get Docker going is alleviating any of the above headaches<p>Because it is a single thing to get working that then leaves all users of your tutorial on all major platforms dealing with the exact same environment. Have you ever tried to work with getting end users up to speed only to discover that one is using python2.7, another has anaconda but pip is pointing to the wrong place, pip3 is required for someone else and one user has mac so needs to install brew then replace every standard call to sort with gsort. Then dateutils appears as some conflicted dependency...<p>&gt; Setting up virtualization to run a process on my local machine which I can run without virtualization or containerization the very same way seems crazy to me<p>Then don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t have to. Go and setup an identical environment. For those that have docker this becomes a single command to run, and those that don&#x27;t can get setup quickly. If they&#x27;re heading into data science they&#x27;re likely to benefit from having at least a basic understanding of docker.<p>&gt;  It seems like an awful amount of complexity to push onto beginners for what is likely to be zero benefit and gives them only what they had at the start...<p>It doesn&#x27;t give zero benefit, it removes a whole bunch of differences in setup that are entirely irrelevant to the tutorial.<p>&gt; Docker offers most literally nothing but opaque complexity.<p>It offers a standard environment that puts all users in the same place.<p>&gt; but all them sweet utilities are already there save the weird csv too<p>No they are not, not on a mac and not on windows.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think the complexity of Docker is warranted for simply handling a CSV tool<p>What complexity? &#x27;docker run --rm -it X bash&#x27; is literally all I need to do.')
