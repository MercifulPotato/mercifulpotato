There is game theory in play as well as chess strategy.<p>&gt; There also is the possibility of simultaneous checkmate.<p>Yes, or even simultaneous king capture without checkmate(s) resulting in a draw.<p>Or you could adopt a quiddich-like rule and say that if the kings are simultaneously captured then the game is decided by the sum total of the remaining value of the pieces on each side.<p>&gt; Could a pawn move diagonally into a square being vacated by the piece standing there? Could two pawns simultaneously not take out each other (say by the simultaneous moves d4×e5 and e5×d4)?<p>I would say yes and yes.')
