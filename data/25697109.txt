We&#x27;re in a situation where stating that you&#x27;re not attending Biden&#x27;s inauguration is branded as &quot;inciting violence&quot;, and way too few reasonable people are speaking out about it.<p>The right screams bloody murder about it of course, but we don&#x27;t listen to them any more. They don&#x27;t listen to us lefties when we have reasonable things to say. We&#x27;re quickly decending into a non-functioning society, and both sides are to blame.')
