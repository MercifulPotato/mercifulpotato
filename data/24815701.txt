They literally own the Empire City Subway, the ostensibly vendor-neutral central conduit system that runs under every single street in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen.<p>For some &quot;mysterious&quot; reason, no one other than Verizon can ever get conduit space in the ECS.  Gee I wonder why that is.  At the same time, Verizon has no interest in using that space for fiber -- they&#x27;d rather leave hundred year old dead copper lines sit than admit competitors OR upgrade their own infrastructure<p>Fios isn&#x27;t failing to deploy to his building because it&#x27;s hard to negotiate with landlords -- they are failing to deploy because they do not believe the city will enforce the terms of their franchise.  It&#x27;s more profitable to wire a few high-density buildings, and leave everyone else to rot, assuming the city never fines them.  (That looks like a safe assumption from where I am sitting.)<p>Verizon has ample <i>capability</i> and they <i>choose</i> not to live up to their obligations.')
