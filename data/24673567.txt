It adds an abstraction layer and removes busywork for repetitive programming tasks. However, the utility will be for users acquainted with command line.  Users who know what a config file is, or data types, lists, and key-value relationships assumed by the YAML spec. Users will also have to know the different algorithms so they can populate the config. All of these things require technical knowledge.<p>All of the above things are what us technical users take for granted, so a claim to cater to non-technical users must be evaluated from their perspective.<p>I am not belittling your work - this is a good project, but currently targeting an audience too broad.')
