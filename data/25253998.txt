In order for anyone to DO that job, they have to be poor enough to accept trading in their time for money.<p>I&#x27;m super lucky, as I&#x27;m almost doing the same thing at my job as I&#x27;d be doing in my free time, but I still take money for it, because, after all, I&#x27;d be writing slightly more interesting (to me) code if it was my hobby. It&#x27;s just that my hobby won&#x27;t make me rich, because my hobby is not in trying to turn a profit on my hobby.')
