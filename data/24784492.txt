In any company, employees don&#x27;t get to capture any value. In Cisco, even if he turned his unit into a $50 billion business, he would be lucky to get $50 million and a promo to SVP. Even Google&#x27;s CEO gets &quot;only&quot; 200-400 mils and I suppose that a VP at Cisco is a much smaller role.')
