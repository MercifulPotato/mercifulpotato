Lazada also has it&#x27;s own set of problems for being a marketplace.<p>Majority of sellers on Lazada were just dropshipping from Chinese wholesalers. There is great profit incentive&#x2F;arbitrage because where Lazada is popular - there is great barriers of entry. South East Asia.<p>High Tariffs. \nHigh Customs&#x2F;Customs issues. \nPhysical customs inspection. \nHigh shipping times.<p>Then the last mile of fulfillment is the issue because of the consumer base being very spread out and not in city centers in South East Asia - bike courier is still most common way of delivery. Postal Mail does not work&#x2F;will not deliver.<p>Then there&#x27;s of course shrink&#x2F;fraud.<p>It&#x27;s fun conversation, it reminded me of ebay circa 2000&#x27;s. Great time to make a name for yourself.')
