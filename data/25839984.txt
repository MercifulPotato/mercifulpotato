And even worse if you need all your doors unlocked, you have to hit the unlock twice. It&#x27;s not a honk on my toyota, but it&#x27;s still super annoying for everyone. I end up having to walk to the driver&#x27;s side door and manually unlocking my car all the time. There isn&#x27;t a key hole on any other door.<p>This is the price we pay for 0 feedback avenues.')
