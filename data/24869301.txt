Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=[24869379], score=None, time=1603460208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24865762, text='I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d equate &quot;low status&quot; with &quot;working on something silly or insignificant&quot; (real or perceived). These things seem unrelated.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to be low status and working on something incredibly important. E.g., driving a lorry to collect rubbish and recycling: nobody thinks of that as a high status job but imagine what happens if people stop doing it, and see if you can then still convince yourself that it&#x27;s not an important job. It&#x27;s also possible to do such a job for your entire working life and never taste &quot;success&quot;. In fact, I would imagine that&#x27;s possibly the default case. This in turn suggests that &quot;low status&quot; is an incredibly poor predictor of success.<p>Also, look at how rife poverty is across the globe. Poor people tend to be &quot;low status&quot;, and many of them stay that way for their entire lives. Talking about their status as a &quot;predictor of success&quot; seems <i>incredibly</i> tone-deaf to me.<p>Overall this comment seems ridiculously ill thought out, to the point where I&#x27;m wondering how it&#x27;s ended up here on the front page. To the person who wrote it: please, for your own benefit as much as anybody else&#x27;s, step outside your bubble, because staying there is breaking your ability to think clearly.')
