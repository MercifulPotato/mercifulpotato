I don&#x27;t believe in conspiracy theories. I see no evidence that this election was tampered with or that Joe Biden&#x27;s win was anything but legitimate.<p>Almost every proclamation from the Republican Party and Donald Trump has no merit and will not hold up in court.<p>HOWEVER.<p>I, and many ones like me, have spent the last 4 years worrying that Russian interference would only increase in this election. We have observed the Republican party do NOTHING to protect the integrity of the US elections, and we could only assume they were doing so out of an express knowledge that any interference would be beneficial to them.<p>Just in OCTOBER, FBI officials said &quot;Russia’s hackers appeared to be preparing to sow chaos amid any uncertainty around election results&quot;, and the now fired Christopher C Krebs said &quot;Russian hackers recently obtained access “in a couple limited cases, to election jurisdiction, an election-related network,&quot; [1]<p>The universal expectation was that Russian interference would be to help Donald Trump because he has been much weaker on Russia than any president that ostensibly cares about freedom and democracy would be.<p>But Donald Trump lost. Does that mean that there was no electoral interference? Surely not. Surely, there was. The most likely explanation is that the sheer number of Biden voters overwhelmed any Russian meddling (if only because it was focused on the wrong states like Ohio and Florida which didn&#x27;t end up mattering).<p>But now, the tables have turned. &quot;Electoral interference&quot; is no longer the rallying cry of the Left to explain why Trump won. It&#x27;s now a rallying cry of the Right to explain why Trump lost.<p>Which means that now to protect democracy, reasonable-minded people find themselves proclaiming that the Election was the most secure in history and all discussion of fraud is a conspiracy theory.<p>This is deeply messed up and uncomfortable, and is the fault entirely of the post-truth Trump Cult that works backwards from the outcome they want to have rather than any reality.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;russia-election-interference-hacks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;russia-electi...</a>')
