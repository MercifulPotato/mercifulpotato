Sometimes they rely on something that takes me 2 hours on a friday, if I don&#x27;t do that, they&#x27;re stuck till monday. It&#x27;s just not acceptable in my line of work.<p>I&#x27;ve not really found a good solution.<p>I can get fridays off formally, but then you&#x27;re not just cutting your salary, you&#x27;re also cutting chances for promotions (which isn&#x27;t just a matter of pay, but also a matter of career development, personal development, keeping work interesting and dynamic, status&#x2F;ego). There&#x27;s a strong preference for employees with full-availability such that clients have one point of contact, instead of multiple parttimers across the week. And leadership positions are expected to always be working during regular working hours.')
