I would be healthier and wealthier for sure.<p>To any intelligent but lazy young man reading this, don’t delay improving your diligence. Seek counseling and coaching if you can. Don’t let your good grades, impressed teachers and peers, and fancy college acceptances convince you otherwise.<p>But avoid ADHD drugs.
