Skype, Zoom don&#x27;t run on &quot;the web&quot; as such; need dedicated apps even if those may be based on Electron.<p>Video (Youtube) only has left Flash-based playback behind like 3 or 4 years ago; the resulting DRM required for video playback hasn&#x27;t made purist happy, and resulted in a bitter controversy over TBL accepting interfaces to proprietary DRM into (proprietary) browsers.<p>Digitized information of our civilization being one search away hasn&#x27;t been my experience at all in the last five years or so, with ads and ad-heavy sites being shoved onto you all the time. Even if it were, there&#x27;s no strategy going forward to preserve that wealth for generations to come in times of monopolization.<p>As the first ever website demonstrates, the web originally was a means for easy self-publishing of digital text.
