People also have a habit of pushing women towards front end work, making the assumption that men are more &#x27;technical&#x27; than women. It can be difficult to watch men get all of the credit for your blood, sweat and tears. It&#x27;s especially bitter when they then say it&#x27;s a meritocracy and you feel like saying &#x27;what exactly did you contribute to this?&#x27;.<p>The concept of a meritocracy sounds nice on paper, but I think it ignores how humans work. The first issue is that I don&#x27;t think we are especially good at identifying the best unless it&#x27;s very easy to measure (sport for example). The second point is that it takes work to overcome your own biases and I think this feeds into how we evaluate &#x27;the best&#x27; more than we like to admit.')
