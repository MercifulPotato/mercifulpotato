It only resulted in lots of &quot;ubuntu broke pip&quot; posts rather than understanding why that happened. (the fact it&#x27;s not entirely separate from venvs didn&#x27;t help) But considering that issue, imagine what would happen for people running `apt install python` and not being able to run `python` or `virtualenv`. Most setup guides just wouldn&#x27;t apply to debian&#x2F;ubuntu and they can&#x27;t afford that.')
