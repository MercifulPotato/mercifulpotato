The benefit to those seeking affordable housing conditions is that this will reduce price pressures on highly-desirable locations by making other places also economically desirable (and moving housing demand around). The money spent on affordable housing will also go a lot further in those locations.<p>My selfish reasons for wanting this is that the Seattle area has become worse in many ways since Amazon became big - increased density has led to terrible traffic, crowded parks, impossible parking, neighborhoods that have lost their charm, changing politics, and other issues. Some may view those things as a positive, but I think most long-term residents of Seattle probably disagree.')
