Now when I see the dual screen setup with one in portrait mode, and one in landscape mode - it just looks to me like a poor solution to the problem of not having enough vertical AND horizontal resolution. For me, the square monitor solves it, but it may not be for everyone.<p>For those interested, the monitor in question is the Eizo FlexScan EV2730Q.')
