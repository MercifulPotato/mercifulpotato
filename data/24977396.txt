Because what you&#x27;d expect a forecast model to do typically is to get gradually more certain over time, so if it consistently behaved the way the 2016 forecast did, that would be a problem.<p>But, you&#x27;d also expect, in a large number of cycles, to have some where you get patterns where you <i>do</i> start getting runa of information that contradict the impact of prior information, and where you do have the kind of reverses seen in the 2016 cycle.<p>And, while we don&#x27;t have enough Presidential cycles to make firm descriptions of what a “typical” cycle would look like with Silver&#x27;s model, we do know that both 2012 and 2020 look a lot more like you&#x27;d expect a typical cycle in a forecast model to look.')
