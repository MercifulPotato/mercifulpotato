Then you do a bunch of scratch work to figure out what epsilon needs to be so that your proof works out in the end.<p>Another challenge with analysis is that inequalities are central, so fluency in their manipulation is absolutely critical. And naturally most students aren&#x27;t fluent with them by the time they take analysis, so they get bulldozed by Baby Rudin and learn to hate a pretty cool (and useful) branch of math')
