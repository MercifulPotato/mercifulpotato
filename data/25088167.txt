An AMD part with a edram probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>It seems to me that apple hasn&#x27;t proven anything yet, only that they are in the game. Lets revisit this conversation in a few years to see if they made the right decision from a technical rather than business perspective.<p>The business perspective seems clear, they have likely saved considerably on the processor vs paying a ransom to intel.<p>edit: for the downvoters, google Cezanne, because its likely due in very early 2021 and some of the parts are zen3. So apple has maybe 3 months before another set of 10-15W amd parts drop.')
