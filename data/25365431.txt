He was already declaring fraud weeks before the election because he knew exactly how it would pan out. People described exactly what he would do and he did it.\nHe declared he won on the election night before all votes were counted. It is so blatantly explicit that he is lying, gaslighting, and deceiving people that it amazes me how so many intelligent, educated people fall for this crap.')
