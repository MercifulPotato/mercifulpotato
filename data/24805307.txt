The media has since reported that somewhere south of 20% of asymptomatic carriers are contagious. The research cited in this study to back up the asymptomatic spreader claim are the following:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurosurveillance.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.2807&#x2F;1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurosurveillance.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.2807&#x2F;1560-7917.E...</a><p>Research estimating asymptomatic proportion using a statistical model.

The colleague tested positive despite being asymptomatic and thus the conclusion is the virus is spread while asymptomatic.<p>Maria van Kerkhove, infectious disease epidemiologist and the COVID-19 technical lead for the WHO has this to say:<p>&quot;From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual. It&#x27;s very rare.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;health&#x2F;who-covid-19-asymptomatic-spread-1.5604353" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;health&#x2F;who-covid-19-asymptomatic-spr...</a>')
