If there&#x27;s non-trivial ambiguity, there&#x27;s room for fraud, and people will likely enough exploit it.<p>Stupid example: What if only Republicans were allowed to count ballots, and the only result you got was a number of votes that they told you, and they threw away all of the records. It would be impossible to get evidence, but you wouldn&#x27;t need any evidence to rightfully distrust the result.<p>Purely electronic voting systems are analogous, though it differs in the details and degrees of things.')
