We have our current values, but to anachronistically apply these values to whole epochs long gone leads astray IMO.<p>Personal ethics is another matter, things like greed, dishonesty, callousness, betrayal between equals seem to be held in low regard whenever we choose to look.<p>There have been attempts to try and superimpose such personal ethics on grand epochs in history, but it requires a painful shoehorning of personal morals into some square holes where it doesn&#x27;t belong. It doesn&#x27;t hold up to serious scrutiny.')
