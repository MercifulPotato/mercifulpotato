It&#x27;s a completely separate language, has been from the beginning, and it&#x27;s been renamed Raku recently. Unlike with python, perl devs realized even 20 years ago people realized there was too much legacy perl 5 code for &#x27;replacement&#x27; to be practical. The result is that perl 5 is very backwards compatible, Raku is at the very least an interesting language worthy of some attention.<p>Compare this to Python 2&#x2F;3. It&#x27;s basically an incompatible fork that doesn&#x27;t add enough for many projects to consider upgrades, and adds the overhead of having to worry about two version. All it really accomplished was guarantee that &quot;Python 4&quot; will never, EVER be a thing.')
