After reading and participating in the endless HN hiring discussions, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve come to an understanding of why, at least in SF, interviews are done the way they are.<p>It seems to be a lowest-common-denominator approach that serves candidates and companies in different ways.<p>For the candidate, they can do one set of study (leetcode&#x2F;system design) and that effort is applicable at a wide range of companies.<p>For the company, they are finding the intersection of people who are at least intelligent enough to grok CS fundamentals (I know it&#x27;s just pattern matching after you&#x27;ve studied it), and willing to jump through enough hoops.<p>Hiring works a very different way outside FAANG leetcode style interviews. It&#x27;s mostly a chat between a couple devs about what you&#x27;ve worked on in the past and how applicable that experience is and trying to get a sense of where you&#x27;re at in your career and if you seem like you&#x27;d be good to work with. It&#x27;s a lot less standardized, so it can be very hit and miss sometimes as sometimes you get quizzed on knowledge of their particular stack. Often the study you do for one company isn&#x27;t necessarily translatable to another.')
