You&#x27;d have to be willfully ignorant to our political context to not be suspicious of any results. If Biden had lost, I know people who I garuntee would be citing result and polling descrepencies as proof of impropriety and foreign interference.<p>To your point, they&#x27;re both absurd. Trump should&#x27;ve been an adult, and conceded.<p>Responding to his legal dragnet by banning discussion of any descrepency it might uncover is just as toxic, and only validates the paranoia of his base.<p>Neither action is commensurate to any form of reconciliation. At this point, I don&#x27;t think there can be any, honestly.')
