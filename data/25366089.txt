I can just turn up at any polling place, tell them my name &amp; address, and they hand me the forms and mark me as having voted.<p>There is nothing stopping me doing this again at a different polling place on the same day, but it would trigger an investigation if my name was marked at multiple polling booths.<p>And yet, there is basically no electoral fraud at all. In each election, this happens less than 10 times nationally with a population of 25M ppl.<p>It turns out to be forgetful senior citizens more often than fraudulent voters.')
