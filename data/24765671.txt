The contents of theses productions are numerical, quantitaives stuff, so it look like the result of a pure intelligence. But if you take some distance with what is actually done with AI you can realize that AI is mostly the development of our current cultural environment. So AI is not ideology, but our current ideology let us see &quot;AI&quot; as a pure intelligence rather than a automated cultural production. What have to be questioned is why does AI produced stuff are seen as pure intelligence in our cultural context. What is called AI is &quot;just&quot; a cultural fact (but a fascinating one!).')
