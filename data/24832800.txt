At the time, I was seriously consider living there permanently and moving my business there. I really enjoyed the place but between family and personal goals it just wasn&#x27;t destined to be a permanent move the way I had hoped.<p>Interestingly (to me at least), I had gigabit internet in Umeå and I believe it only cost around 40 USD&#x2F;m at the time (2011-ish). I didn&#x27;t get gigabit again until I moved to Las Vegas and I&#x27;m currently paying around 3x that amount.<p>EDIT - Actually I have one big complaint. Trying to learn the language was impossible because every time I would attempt it people would notice I&#x27;m not a native speaker and <i>instantly</i> switch to English as if they had been waiting for that moment their entire lives. Lesson: Swedish people are an order of magnitude more considerate than the french folks I&#x27;ve met.')
