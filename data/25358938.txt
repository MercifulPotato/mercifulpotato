Perhaps consider not making sweeping generalizations about places that neither you nor anyone you know live.<p>Second, the many US States are far from perfect, as are the many EU member nations, but conditions in the US in general are hardly &quot;shitty.&quot;<p>Other&#x27;s have pointed out the extraordinary number of immigrants to the US -- there are more immigrants living in the US (40M) than citizens of Poland (38M)[1]. Those are normal people making intelligent, reasoned, self-interested decisions. They didn&#x27;t leave their homes behind for a downgrade.<p>But more to the point, generalizing &quot;conditions in the US&quot; is utter foolishness. The US is very much like the EU v0. In the same way that my time living Italy didn&#x27;t give me a great deal of insight into life in Belgium, a stay in New York City doesn&#x27;t tell you very much about life in Idaho, or almost any other place in the US. The states are highly autonomous by design, and life experiences vary widely between them.<p>Yes, New York and San Francisco in particular are having a hard time due to acute housing crises, and some other cities are dealing with housing issues to a lesser extent. Yes, healthcare here is a problem if you don&#x27;t have insurance.<p>But fortunately, the majority of the country is not SF or NY, and 92% of people have health insurance[2].<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;key-finding...</a>\n2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2020&#x2F;demo&#x2F;p60-271.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2020&#x2F;demo&#x2F;p60-27...</a>')
