As we extended a communication system of our brain to others!<p>Now; your statement if a set of stones can have conscience? Yes it can have; over the time if this system of stones will be observed; with some associated meaning to it states[arranged in circle or square]; someone can argue that it is aware!<p>You can look at universe as a set of rocks; the periodic movements; it&#x27;s aware!? maybe :)')
