Item(by='temintech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607800580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400647, text='Hello!<p>Temin is a tool I built for myself that acts as a virtual environment for sticky notes, graphics and virtual screens (running Chromium). Technically it&#x27;s two tools, as the HTML5-based drawing app is separate from the virtual environment. I use Temin mostly for big picture thinking, making stories and planning.<p>I built it when I was having trouble getting a grand vision of the future out of my head (standard &#x27;future of computing&#x27; fare). In the real world I kept running out wall space before I ran out of ideas, and for whatever reason all the digital tools I tried weren&#x27;t working for me.<p>I find adding&#x2F;exploring&#x2F;editing thoughts a pleasant experience in Temin. I&#x27;m not sure why, I have some pet theories that writing by hand in environments that are low on typeset words and clinically straight lines and boxes is a big part of it, but who knows. Outside of the articles that crop up on HN from time to time on the benefits of handwriting[0][1][2][3] I have nothing to back any of that up.<p>95% of the time I use a Microsoft Surface to input stuff into Temin and place the stuff I made using a desktop PC, but the I&#x2F;O you can use is pretty flexible. I developed it as a desktop app, but as Unity can export to WebGL I spent some time recently getting a browser based version semi-working. The desktop build is embarrassing, the WebGL build doubly so, but it kind of works.<p>Switching between FPS, CAD&#x2F;nolcip and pseudo-2D mouse mode isn&#x27;t very intuitive. In fact, the whole UI&#x2F;UX is bad.<p>Due 99% to my poor coding (the way the client and drawing app checks for updates is ridiculous) and 1% being on a $8 p&#x2F;m hosting plan if this post gets more than a little interest it&#x27;ll revert to a less feature rich version where you can&#x27;t add&#x2F;edit new sticky notes. Or maybe it&#x27;ll just fall over. Who knows, Temin is the first piece of software I&#x27;ve developed.<p>I&#x27;d like to see if there&#x27;s a market for Temin beyond myself and a couple of friends, but I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing so any thoughts would be appreciated.<p>I guess I&#x27;ll just start rooting around LinkedIn and Twitter next week and reach out to any organisations&#x2F;individuals who I think might be interested in it?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24519008" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24519008</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24714990" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24714990</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25031483" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25031483</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8760392" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8760392</a>')
