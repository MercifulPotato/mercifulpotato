If I watch 2-3 videos of any subject I start to see a flood of those recommendations.<p>It is absolutely useless to me, even more that I have some very non-overlapping hobbies that I jump around.<p>I tried curating my subscription list, at some point that worked but since YouTube dropped those from their recommendation algorithm my subs are just to check videos from channels I like, some weeks I will see the same videos on my recommendations that I have already watched.<p>It&#x27;s a mess, I can&#x27;t understand it as a SWE to be able to tailor it to my usage. By now, after trying for about a year or so, I completely gave up on &quot;training&quot; YT&#x27;s recommendation algorithm...<p>On the other hand, Spotify has always been really good for me, the trends of what is recommended doesn&#x27;t change so often if I don&#x27;t change my listening habits, when I do change it picks it up as a quiet signal and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me with recommendations for a genre I listened to <i>one day</i> out of the year. Also the Spotify&#x27;s Radio feature for a song&#x2F;track&#x2F;album&#x2F;artist works really well for the genres I listen to, when I&#x27;m tired of my playlists, or when I just want to discover new music, a starting a radio from a track, album or artist I like usually gives me very relevant content.')
