One might be to disable test builds of software distributed to users once the final version is released. Another might be if there is a serious bug or security vulnerability in a release to force users to either down grade to a known good version or upgrade to a fixed version. Yet another might be because a license agreement for a third party software library or component in an application expired and the developer is required to disable versions of their software containing the licences component. I’m sure there’s are others. None of these are any of Apple’s business and the developer might not want to reveal the reason to a Apple for liability, confidentiality or other reasons but Apple has offered this service to their developer customers and committed to an agreed process which HP says that HP followed.')
