Mentioning him can sound a bit pseudo as he&#x27;s become so popular and is such a popularizer of others&#x27; ideas, but  I believe the main tenet of <i>Homo Deus</i> is his own and comes very much from thinking about what you&#x27;re calling &quot;massive open online psychology.&quot; His notion is that trusting our technology more than trusting our own feelings will be the death of humanism, because in his view humanism is at heart about trusting one&#x27;s own individual feelings. The entire liberal can be seen as one aspect or outgrowth of humanism.')
