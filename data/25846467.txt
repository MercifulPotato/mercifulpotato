Apple&#x27;s made a big technical claim of the hardware acceleration of reference counting - another OS and toolchain optimizing around it to any extent would test their claims.<p>This both reads a little overly optimistic to me knowing how proprietary things are - but linux and foss software have history of running on all manner of platforms.
