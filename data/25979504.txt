The next day it dropped all the way down to $112.<p>Who bought on the trip up to $500 and who got hurt on the way down to $112?  There is no way to know without a forensic investigation of the transaction record.  I am sure the SEC will investigate, if anything to understand how to prevent this kind of a thing from happening again (or how to slow down the rate of change, if that makes sense).<p>I am of the opinion that this will end in disaster and tears for a large number of people.  I hope only a few bet their life savings on this after getting sucked into the emotion of the mob.')
