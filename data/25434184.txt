If you don&#x27;t put this stipulation you&#x27;ll end up with the privacy equivalent of the double-Irish. Where a smaller EU country either writes the weakest version of the law they can get away with, or just turns a blind eye to abuse, and uses that to attract companies like Facebook to move their &quot;HQ&quot; there.<p>&gt; I get the feeling although this law started with the right idea it is being used as an excuse for law enforcement to expand their reach, without actually helping people.<p>Not sure how this is an example of a regulator expanding their reach. If a regulator has the authority to regulate the housing in a city, why should they not be able to force companies that help people actively flout their regulation to turn over details on those flouters.<p>In the EU there&#x27;s a cross-border agreement to help police identify car owners for speeding tickets etc. Is that also an over reach?')
