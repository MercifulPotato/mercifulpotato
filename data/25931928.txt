But it wasn&#x27;t considered a separate letter until 1918 - so e.g. the standard alphabetic sorting ignored the distinction. For this reason, it wasn&#x27;t always used consistently, although it was still much more consistent than Ё. And even today, &quot;иод&quot; is still considered valid spelling; indeed, it&#x27;s the preferred one in scientific context.<p>This still shows up in some contexts - e.g. Й, like Ё, isn&#x27;t used in bullet lists; try it in Word - it&#x27;ll go from И straight to К.')
