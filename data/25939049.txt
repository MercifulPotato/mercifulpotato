Item(by='ttt0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611817515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938866, text='&gt; So the opposition of discord is a gang of wallstreet traders?<p>It was just in general, but even in this case, yes, there are two sides opposed to each other. One happens to be more influential, powerful and with more money behind it, and the underdog is the wallstreetbets people.<p>&gt; If people comply with basic norms of decency they will get back on those platforms.<p>I guess so, but if you have thousands of people in a single server, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to keep everyone calm, especially in situations such as this one, where large sums of money are involved. Also you&#x27;ll have bad actors who are trying to make it look bad on purpose so they get shut down. This is Discord and people actually use this kind of tactics there.<p>&gt; More and more words are being used under the banner of free speech.<p>Speaking strictly about the USA, this is just factually incorrect. Racism, homofobia etc. used to be fine not that long ago. And legally it&#x27;s still protected under the 1A. But then it became socially unacceptable and from that point more and more speech started to become &quot;not free&quot;. This year questioning the integrity of the elections became a fireable offense and as I found out today - anything offensive.<p>&gt; The biggest irony of all is that the perspective on this matter is largely shaped by your political philosophy and whether you profit from these changes.<p>Regarding the profits, for sure, I imagine. But politically this is an apolitical &quot;movement&quot;, you will find socialists, libertarians, nationalists and anything in between that support their efforts. I guess it really united people, in a way.')
