If you want to use JVM, probably clojure. Otherwise Scheme, Common Lisp and Racket. Scheme is rather minimalistic, Common Lisp is very functional and Racket is the most modern one I guess. I ended up with Common Lisp and I rather don&#x27;t look for change. SBCL is implementation I use and like it. Probably the best one and quite portable.<p>Emacs seems the best choice for Lisp, since it is scripted in Lisp and it&#x27;s best adapted to it probably. However when I started, I was already so used to vim that I kept going with it. Maybe not the best option, but it&#x27;s ok, maybe just a little bit more effort to automatize some stuff.<p>If you choose Common Lisp, this is probably the best book for start: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigamonkeys.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigamonkeys.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;</a> . Anyway be prepared, Lisp is not easy to grasp at first, but as soon you do, you will probably love it and appreciate way it is. :)')
