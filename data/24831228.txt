If you want to have a related conversation that is accessible to other users but not immediately visible, you have to create a channel.<p>The feature request has been made... in fact it&#x27;s been made multiple times and been deleted at least once <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.discord.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;community&#x2F;posts&#x2F;360031743291-Message-Threads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.discord.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;community&#x2F;posts&#x2F;3600317...</a><p>Slack handles this well, even at the free tier, with threads having a separate type of notification. In fact I&#x27;m on two communities that use slack... the limits on free slack (10,000 messages mainly) can be a feature for communities, hiding past messages.<p>I&#x27;d gladly pay for threads in discord. It gets even worse with private channels. Want to discuss something between three folks on a discord server that don&#x27;t have a shared role without adding another channel to someone&#x27;s list?<p>As it stands, this requires knowing someone&#x27;s username on discord (not what they are called on the server) to add permissions then navigating to edit a channel&#x27;s permissions, and setting two permissions for each discord user name so they can read and writ.  Alternatively, you can do it with the creation of a new role and channel and adding that role to folks, which is annoying if you use roles for communicating anything other than permission levels. And that&#x27;s if you have the permissions to do that.  On Slack you can let anybody thread a conversation.<p>It&#x27;s annoying, even as as discord owner. I&#x27;ve been contemplating writing a bot to handle it, but frankly it should be built in. And so should message threads.')
