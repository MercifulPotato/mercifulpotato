Item(by='shirakawasuna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602800919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793219, text='A large portion of liberals convince themselves that woke capitalist censorship isn&#x27;t really censorship and that it&#x27;s fighting &quot;the good fight&quot; so long as it&#x27;s hurting their enemies.<p>A large portion of conservatives convince themselves that the media has a left bias and therefore it&#x27;s reasonable to ingest even trashier garbage uncritically. Very similar position - so long as their media is confirming their biases &#x2F; hurting their enemies, they&#x27;re cool with it, even if it&#x27;s based on fiction.<p>We&#x27;re in desperate need of a nationwide media criticism education <i>and</i> the free time for average people to actually engage in it. We should all be aware of various journalists, publications&#x27; biases, the think tanks they cite as &quot;neutral&quot; (often Koch-backed, e.g.), etc. The problem with garbage &quot;news&quot; in social media is that it convinces people of nonsense.<p>That&#x27;s not really a problem of media outlets so much as a public that has no real response to it. Little familiarity with media criticism and no way to effectively push back outside of something like Twitter. Everyone tries to work within their extremely limited frameworks, many of which are systematically hampered by the forces that fund and profit from these camps.<p>The first steps to getting the boot off of our necks are (1) vastly improved public education with practical political courses that include media criticism, critically responding to statistical claims and graphs, and questionable forms of argument, and (2) a strong enough economic floor so that the average person can justify spending the time to actually pay attention to this stuff. If you&#x27;re worried about your next paycheck and avoiding the stress of bills and incoming financial woes, you&#x27;d rather watch some TV than spend several hours learning about why Bari Weiss kind of sucks.')
