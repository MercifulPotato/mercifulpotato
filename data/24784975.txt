Whole house pneumatic systems to run $800 dollar non-electric blenders.  Elevators that spend the sabbath atomically opening on each floor.  Automatic timers to complete forbidden circuits.  I would love to spend an hour or two with a rabbinical scholar.  Does walking in front of a motion senor complete a circuit?  Are you allowed to ask an AI to do something on the Shabbat?')
