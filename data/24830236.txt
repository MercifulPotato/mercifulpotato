I can select a token in both (or all three) files and then force the diff to align at that point. It makes  merges a whole lot easier. Sometimes, a single realign is all that&#x27;s needed for a file merge to sort itself out. Even when that&#x27;s not the case, it&#x27;s easier to reason about the changes.<p>Did I miss something? That is, is that feature available in other diff&#x2F;merge tools and I just haven&#x27;t seen it?')
