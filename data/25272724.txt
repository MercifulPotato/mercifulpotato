Their client feels cramped and stifling and their web version is not feature complete. Basic stuff like just linking to a document or wiki page or tab in Teams doesn’t work well so you end up with stuff like “Open the Foo team, look in the Bar channel and click the second link in the header to see the dashboard.” instead of just adding a link to it.<p>The integration and embedding of office&#x2F;powerbi&#x2F;etc is neat, but it forces it into a Teams frame.<p>For some reason, some things launch SharePoint with its own bag of shit for trying to make its own version of web sites.<p>I’m in a big org with Teams for almost a year. We have thousands of employees who aren’t as active as hundred person free slack open source projects. People aren’t using it to communicate much with each other.<p>They keep emailing, or texting or IMing. I get more Skype IMs a day than Teams. And do you know how horrible Skype is?<p>Because of this, I think it sucks as a superset of Slack. Sure, it nominally has all those features, but in practice they aren’t usable.<p>I hope that MS just keeps iterating and it eventually gets better. I think it’s better now than a year ago.')
