There have been other factors though that contribute to a more complex story:<p>- The availability of third party IP (Arm CPUs and originally Imagination GPUs) and manufacturing (Samsung and TSMC) that have allowed Apple to pick and mix to build its own SoCs.<p>- The fact that Arm has clearly been much more focused on power efficiency which might mean it has IP which Intel can&#x27;t access (speculating here but we have big.LITTLE).<p>- Possibly the most importantly, the the benefits that Apple gets from being able own the whole stack and design SoCs that precisely match its needs.<p>As a result I&#x27;m a bit sceptical about whether Intel would have got Apple&#x27;s mobile business long term given that market&#x27;s eventual structure: the advantages of Apple&#x27;s current approach are just too great.')
