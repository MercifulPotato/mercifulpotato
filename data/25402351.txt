Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=[25402510], score=None, time=1607811923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401760, text='&gt;  I consider RHEL and CentOS to be pretty equal, with CentOS lagging a bit behind. Now they will be pretty equal, with RHEL lagging a bit behind. Packages going to CentOS are packages that would have gone directly to RHEL previously.<p>There will be another small difference: the number of updates. Just for fun, I started a centos:8 image in podman, installed the package which switches it to centos streams, and ran an update (which by the way partially failed with an error message, IIRC it tried to change &#x2F;proc in a way podman doesn&#x27;t like). Then I looked at the version of one of the updated packages before and after the update (IIRC it was bash), and looked at its changelog. There were several releases between these two versions, and I would expect each one of them to appear separately as an update within CentOS Stream.<p>That is, packages that would have gone directly to RHEL previously will be going to CentOS, but not all packages going to CentOS will be going to RHEL; we will also be getting all the intermediate steps.')
