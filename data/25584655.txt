Item(by='dkobran', descendants=None, kids=[25585183], score=None, time=1609354142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583235, text='&gt; When a human kills someone with a car it is almost always in a way we can empathize<p>Nonsense. You can empathize with someone texting and killing someone?<p>This whole post reads like an attempt to appeal to people’s emotional attachment to human drivers coupled with  fearmongering about robots.<p>You are placing far too much emphasis one our ability to “read” other drivers intent and the impact this has on automobile accident fatalities. Many accidents occur without any chance to see the offending driver e.g. accidents at night, someone switching lanes when you are in their blind spot, a drunk driver suddenly doing something erratic, etc. Moreover, this so-called advantage of human drivers is statistically meaningless unless you believe that the number of deaths due to automobile accidents is at an acceptable level and that it cannot be improved with technology, in this case, AV. I certainly don’t believe that. In the not too distant future, I believe this position will be laughable. Through adoption of autonomous vehicles, many predict we will  drastically cut the number of fatalities. Will there be issues along the road? Most certainly. But as long as the overall number is falling by a significant amount, we simply  cannot justify our love affair with humans “being in control”. We’ve proven to be perennially distracted, we have terrible reaction times, we have extremely narrow vision, we panic in situations instead of remaining calm, etc. and yes, these faults do lead to the deaths of children. These are not theoretical deaths like the robot scare tactic examples, these are actual deaths from human drivers.')
