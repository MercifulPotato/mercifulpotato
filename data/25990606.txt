Founder of toffee.com here. We&#x27;re building a new platform for selling digital goods. Our goal is to help anyone sell a digital product, both via their own storefront as well as on a global marketplace, using a variety of P2P payment methods (including Stripe, PayPal, and bitcoin)<p>I&#x27;m looking for highly motivated back-end developers to help undertake a complete rewrite of the marketplace. The rewrite will be from scratch, based on the TALL stack (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire), with a TDD approach.<p>We&#x27;re currently in the middle of an equity crowdfunding campaign set to close on Feb 26th, and will be starting the rewrite as soon as the campaign is finalized.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, send an email to hello@toffee.com and we&#x27;ll take it from there.<p>PS: No agencies or dev shops please!')
