Gen X gets the least amount of flak compared to boomers, millennials and Gen Z, so that is interesting.<p>It’s not easy raising kids for sure, but it’s almost like you have to be callous to not understand what kinda rat race the working world can be, and how hyper competitive even the shittiest of jobs are.<p>Why are these values not being passed down?

Are Gen X so well off in middle management somewhere that their kids casually believe it’s aright to sack someone’s livelihood for their political beliefs?<p>Do we need to take Twitch and Phones away from these idiots and have them go work in the gig economy like a dog for a bit?')
