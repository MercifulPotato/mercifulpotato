Every few years we hear about the problems with huge centralized social platforms.<p><pre><code>  They mediate and moderate all our interactions\n  They control everyone&#x27;s data, identity and brand\n  They concentrate all the data in one place\n  They get hacked &#x2F; feed data to spies &#x2F; advertisers\n  They extract rents, brands pay to reach them\n  They track us across the Web\n  They can exert huge influence over our democracy\n</code></pre>\nAnd yet, we do not have viable alternatives to them, that would be good enough for people to switch to. I&#x27;m not talking about Matrix or Mastodon. It takes years to recreate a user experience that has all the features you would expect from these large platforms. At Qbix, we spent the last 10 years and reinvested $1MM of our revenues to do exactly this. It&#x27;s now ready.<p><i>For those of you who want to back a project to see this actually happen, instead of just talking about how nice it would be, you have an opportunity to do so. Watch the video at the URL below to understand why there is a lot of demand for open, popular platform like Wordpress but for hosting customizable, communities with third party plugins. Especially now in the wake of the lockdowns and social distancing, every organization is looking how to connect their members online.</i><p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Qbix&#x2F;Platform')
