I&#x27;ve played both genres, but it&#x27;s also the same deal for any mode that&#x27;s inherently competitive, such as league play in the older shooters like Quake, CounterStrike, Team Fortress Classic &amp; 2. Everyone says that they&#x27;re &quot;bad&quot; but a few say they&#x27;re &quot;good&quot;, either through sheer practice and results or hubris.<p>You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a lot about it that isn&#x27;t fun. One&#x27;s ability to enjoy fighting games and RTS games begins and ends with understanding a multitude of different mechanics and having the physical execution to make one&#x27;s plans a reality. People who play those genres have to practice daily to derive some decent enjoyment from the games in them, almost as if it&#x27;s a second job (maybe even a third depending on what you do for a living, i.e. the software developers of HN still have to carve out time to keep up with tech advances).<p>It&#x27;s worth it in the end in my opinion because of the people one meets in these communities. They&#x27;re usually very dedicated, most like to see more people be able to compete and are really helpful, and will participate in group events in real life (tournaments for both fighting and RTS games, locals for fighting games).')
