The two don&#x27;t have to be correlated. I suppose where money is not involved, you might say the the costs are the repercussions.<p>By traditional usage of the word dumping, donating use items doesn&#x27;t qualify. It&#x27;s not being done to gain a non-competetive economic advantage. It&#x27;s a semantic issue though: decide you want to construe the word a bit more abstractly and you can make it fit.<p>Lexical and semantic issue aside, freeing up local resources (people&#x27;s time) to focus on education and learning higher level skills seems a reasonable plan.

Of course in the context of foreign aid to a country, it presumes you don&#x27;t just air drop in supplies for basic needs and leave it at that. If you&#x27;re really interested in bootstrapping a population to a higher quality of life, you have to still ensure that learning etc. are available along with the capital infrastructure to create businesses and industries that utilize that learning.
