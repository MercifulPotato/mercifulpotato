We probably won&#x27;t see quite as dramatic an improvement over the next 3 years, but I&#x27;ll be stunned if AMD still has the performance lead at that point.<p>Apple&#x27;s a wildcard, but they aren&#x27;t going to sell their chips, and they represent a fairly small part of the PC market. No other non-x86 chips have made even a tiny dent in the PC market, and even in the datacenter, it&#x27;s still mostly x86.<p>The absolute worst I can imagine happening to Intel over the next decade is that they no longer define the CPU market. But that&#x27;s a long, long, way from dying, and will probably be good for the market and good for Intel in the long run.')
