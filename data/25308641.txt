Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607118818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304095, text='The plane will stall unless you push the stick differently or adjust the trim.  It&#x27;s something you can compensate for.  MCAS doesn&#x27;t even adjust the trim very fast!  It&#x27;s a hack but that&#x27;s mainly to avoid retraining, not because the design is inherently all that dangerous.<p>&gt; The experts who killed 300 people analyzed the mcas and also built it.<p>It could be fair to avoid all planes coming from those experts.  But if you don&#x27;t trust them to fix a single flaw, why in god&#x27;s name do you trust them to design an entirely new plane?  <i>This</i> is not a reason to push for a redesign.<p>&gt; No one will get on a plane covered in duck tape no matter how many experts analyzed it.<p>Ever heard of speed tape?<p>Most people will either get on the plane when it&#x27;s fixed, or they will never get on the plane.  They&#x27;re not going to care about the exact details.<p>&gt; Likely you went to google at some point and tried to find out what that fix was and likely you found nothing. That&#x27;s a red flag, a huge one.<p>Sure.  Red flag.  But a flag is far from conclusive.<p>&gt; At the very least this is something any wise man should know about before getting onto that plane.<p>I&#x27;m wise enough to not play armchair plane engineer when my life is on the line.  If I don&#x27;t trust the process, then I&#x27;ll wait for a certain number of flight hours instead.  I&#x27;m not going to depend on my own ability to analyze plane design.')
