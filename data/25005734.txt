Good thing is - you don&#x27;t need to be close to each other. You may as well have competitions remotely!<p>The best part of Arbiter is the fact that he makes it harder for stronger people to win. So let&#x27;s say your maximum amount of push ups per 1 set is 50 and your opponent can do 100. Without Arbiter you&#x27;d be doomed to fail, but Arbiter recognizes it and gonna give twice bigger sets to your opponent. This is his way to equalize the competitors. All sets start from 1 repitition for the weaker participant and increase progressively.<p>Is there a leaderboard? - Yes, the leaderboard is per channel and discipline agnostic. So you can score points for you channel&#x27;s leaderboard by having competitions in any disciplines.<p>Why it&#x27;s not in Slack&#x27;s App Directory? - Simply because in order to submit to it you need to have at least 2 active users and I struggle to find them. Most people can&#x27;t install my app to their workspaces because Admins tell them that my app is rather sketchy cuz it&#x27;s not in App Directory :(<p>Can it be used for free? - Yes! There&#x27;s just enough free competitions when you install the app. At some point it may ask for you to pay.<p>Where&#x27;s the server? - Code is in Amsterdam3 so I expect that if you&#x27;re from US or somewhere far from there it may be a lil bit slow. Currently I don&#x27;t have a multi-region set up!<p>I&#x27;d be glad to have any feedback from you guys, both on the functionality of the app if you try it, or advices on where to get my first users and what not!<p>Best regards,\nOleksandr Kazimirchuk')
