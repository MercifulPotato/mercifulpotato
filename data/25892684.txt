Where the smaller shops exist, they no longer have general purpose retail, but are specialty shops, services, restaurants, etc. Or they are run down and occupied by low rent businesses. Or they&#x27;ve gone massively upscale. You can get anything you want <i>except</i> the basic necessities for daily living.<p>Actually I wonder if a rise in restaurants has crowded out other forms of retail.<p>And then in new developments, it may be that housing is more profitable than small retail shops.<p>I admit that there are 3 supermarkets within walking distance of my house in a pedestrian friendly neighborhood. I can reach them on foot or bike in a few minutes. But they are <i>expensive</i> and have limited selection so we drive a few miles to a huge discount supermarket at the edge of town, every 2 or 3 weeks, and only get perishables at the nearby stores.')
