The reality is that many users will use whatever is put in front of them, i.e. how many people use the URL bar of their browser for searches, or use a search toolbar for a specific URL? Google knows this well, hence their paying to be the default search engine choice and paying an amount that no other engine can match.<p>Google&#x27;s knows they are the best in class when it comes to general search, but to be sure they have been aggressive in ensuring that no one else gets a look in.<p>The UK&#x27;s CMA report estimates that an entrant to the market would require around Â£20 billion of capital to be a credible alternative, as in, a proper crawling search engine, not a meta search engine like DuckDuckGo. That&#x27;s before paying the likes of Apple billions of dollars simply so that people will use &quot;what is there&quot;.<p>Having such a dominant position comes with responsibility, which is not solely Google&#x27;s. The social networks along with Google are essentially the gateways to the web and how they present that information is important- and essentially only one point of view. Having room for more competition, choices, algorithms surely is a good thing.')
