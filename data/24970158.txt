Yet we are only now getting to the point where EVs have the same range as ICE vehicles, even though the battery-&gt;motor conversion is something like 90% efficient.<p>Why is that?  Because the amount of energy that can be stored in batteries is MUCH lower than the amount of energy released from burning fuel.<p>Transport needs to carry all of it&#x27;s energy with it (or, have something like a 3rd rail to provide energy).<p>That&#x27;s the argument for biofuels in the future.  Not that you can&#x27;t replace 99% of transport with electricity, but rather some forms of transport require a lot of energy.<p>We are JUST getting to the point where batteries have enough density to power a prop plane for ~ 1hour worth of flight.<p>We are no where near the energy density where a cargo ship could sail from china to the US or for international flights.<p>One alternative to biofuels is hydrogen from something like electrolysis.<p>One thing I think we&#x27;ll both agree on.  Ethanol for cars&#x2F;trucks is a terrible idea.  EVs are the future there.')
