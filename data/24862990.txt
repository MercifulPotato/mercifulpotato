We have nearly ubiquitous cameras, and huge databases of images.  I think it&#x27;s essentially impossible to regulate that back to old expectations of anonymity.<p>Back in the old days, you could just go to the next town, take on a new name, and build a new life.  Or, you could sexually assault a woman while in high school, then become a Supreme Court Justice.  We may need to adjust our sense of what things are forgivable, since in the future none of us will be able to simply leave the past behind.<p>Edit: If it wasn&#x27;t obvious, that was sarcasm about the Supreme Court Justice. I think it&#x27;s a tragedy he was appointed, and was alluding to the idea that if that house party had cameras streaming to the public internet, it wouldn&#x27;t have happened.')
