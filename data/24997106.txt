Because the market was already huge, and we &quot;assumed&quot; people who used our competitors would use our product too. \nAnd when we were not able to sell, we thought It was because of lack of feature. The &quot;one more feature&quot; mentality was bad.<p>The surface area of products like Hubspot(our competition) is huge - and we tried to catch up with them in terms of feature and this was a mistake. We didn&#x27;t try to identify a niche.<p>I think this is one of those things that is easy in theory and hard to practice.<p>2: Agree that both are hard. I&#x27;m still happy with the pace which we shipped at. Looking back at it I think we were not shipping the right features.\nThere are a few reason for this:\n- We got a bit desperate at some point and started building features for single customers(which we thought would be useful to others, but was not). And this spiraled downwards and our product started doing things that we initially didn&#x27;t intend to. (Like email automation, push notifcations, website builder, form builder, inapp messaging, blogging platform, social media management etc)\n- At some point we blindly started copying features, without thinking why we need to build it. (I know this sounds really stupid now, hence the title)\n- We were young and we thought we could brut force(or hustle) our way out of every problem.<p>I hope that helps. Happy to explain more if you have questions :)')
