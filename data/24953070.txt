We can&#x27;t ethically do the experiments that would give conclusive results. Arguing about the details takes up energy that could be used to keep us safe in other ways. Wear them just in case. Do not let them be your only defense. Cover your eyes. Don&#x27;t talk to people up close when you&#x27;re wearing a mask if you can help it. Breathe through your nose. Don&#x27;t shout at each other about god knows what like the dumb ladies in the laundromat standing on either side of me the other day, putting me in their microbial crossfire.')
