It also allows you to get the details about your screenshot and the device you’ve used.<p>Visit my website for more details.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toolbax.com<p>I manage many web projects and I give feedback for UI problems all the time. Taking a screenshot, giving it a name and creating a Trello card with details (URL, screen resolution etc.) take a lot of time, right? This extension does all of them for me and hopefully will do the same for you too!<p>The trial version allows you to take 30 screenshots but please feel free to contact me and I’ll be more than happy to upgrade your limit! I look forward to getting any feedback from you!')
