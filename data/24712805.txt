Item(by='martin_a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602105181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710175, text='Thank you very much for the helpful insight. From &quot;the outside&quot; Mozilla lacks kind of a vision, you&#x27;d probably call it &quot;marketing bs&quot; ;-) but I&#x27;d love to see a vision like &quot;build the best browser of the world&quot;.<p>Focussing resources on this and maybe one or two other big projects (Thunderbird, anybody?), which could really make an impact in the modern day and age of the internet, would be great. That would be a clear way to go, I could become a &quot;follower&quot; or &quot;supporter&quot; with no fear in my heart and let it run.<p>Right now Mozilla looks pretty clueless to me. Losing market share, all the gossip, massive layoffs, starting and ending side projects like Firefox Send (which I&#x27;d really would have loved to see take off, competition for WeTransfer and alike would be good)... There&#x27;s just a big bunch of &quot;hmpf, don&#x27;t know&quot;.')
