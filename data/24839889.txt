Generally, you want to break your sentences with commas _before_ usage of “but”: “He wanted to buy a pen, but the store had run out.”<p>If you’re a native speaker, the comma goes where you’d naturally have a brief pause in speech.<p>If you’re not a native speaker, it may be helpful to remember that the clause with “but” should be able to be removed &amp; what remains should still be a valid sentence: “He wanted to buy a pen.”, not “He wanted to buy a pen but.”')
