The main thing I keep seeing mentioned is impersonation. That can be solved without requiring explicit agreements, and may be counterproductive in some cases.<p>Imagine Joe’s Tapas actually needs to rely on deliveries during COVID and isn’t equipped to do it themselves. With this law they’d need an explicit contract with GrubHub or the like and that would surely include “we can do business using the Joe’s Tapas name for X”. There’d be no room to change the contact and even less protection for Joe’s Tapas having their brand ruined.<p>Why not solve the more narrow impersonation problem? Explicit transparency requirements and hefty fines for companies that run aground of them.')
