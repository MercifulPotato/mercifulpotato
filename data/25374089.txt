The vast array people with financial skills are in London.<p>I won&#x27;t argue that this isn&#x27;t significant, but it&#x27;s assets, not people.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget Gordon Brown&#x27;s &quot;light touch regulation&quot; led to lower costs for financial companies operating out of London, due to less regulation and bureaucracy than the EU.<p>It also helped fuel the credit crunch as well.  So there&#x27;s v2 of that to look forward to if the next UK government decides to relax oversight to attract businesses.')
