You wouldn&#x27;t even give them a chance based on not being part of your demographics?<p>There&#x27;s also a difference between how you pick your friends and how you hire employees. You were advocating that hiring homogeneously is beneficial. In and off itself, that&#x27;s discriminatory.<p>And still you refuse to commit to what is the extents of &quot;homogeneous&quot;. Is it ethnicity? Language? Gender? Sexuality? Nationality?<p>Your post also suggested that heterogeneous work forces , even if you qualify it as applying only to startups, work at an interior level to homogeneous ones. Again, that&#x27;s implying that different demographics can&#x27;t work well together. But clearly that can&#x27;t apply across the board. Or women and men could never work together. So what&#x27;s the extents of your statement?')
