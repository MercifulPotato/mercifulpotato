They even collected DNA form mothers of men who had killed themselves (and matched the description&#x2F;profile etc) in the years after the murder.<p>In fact, they had actually sent a letter to the murder asking for a sample in the months before starting the new approach, but he didn&#x27;t show up and they hadn&#x27;t gotten to taking it further.<p>So in the end, they might have had a chance of solving it the traditional way. But at the same time, it takes a lot of evidence in Sweden to forcibly collect a DNA sample, which probably is not so easy for a 16 year old case.')
