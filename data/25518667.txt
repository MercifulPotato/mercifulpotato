What if they say &quot;Yes&quot;?  Are either answer a red flag?<p><i>Whatâ€™s your P95 latency?</i><p>What if they say &quot;100ms&quot;? What if they say &quot;5s&quot;? Is either a red flag? What if they ask &quot;Are you asking about first response, fist meaningful paint, largest contentful paint, or page complete?<p>This list would be great if you added some guidance around what might be the ramifications of certain answers. Even just something as simple as: &quot;If the answer here is &quot;No&quot;, you might want to dive deeper into such and such.&quot;<p>Keep up the good work.')
