I implemented a fairly complex kickback-tracking business system 15 years ago, due to the rest of the company being entry-level PHP devs, I implemented the whole thing in pl&#x2F;pgsql.  15 years later it&#x27;s still ticking as the core of the business with minor modifications.<p>And the crazy thing is, in today&#x27;s world of microservices and hyperfocus on horizontal scaling, I would still implement it in pl&#x2F;pgsql, and indeed, I&#x27;d expect it to keep ticking for the next 20 years as long as the company stays in business.')
