Tens of thousands of Trump supporters showed up to DC this last week, attending one of several fully-legal, fully-permitted protests. Almost all events and participants were peaceful. A few hundred walked into the capitol complex, and I am guessing most did not initially plan to do so but got caught up in the moment, following those in front of them. Of those few hundred, an even smaller group was engaged in violence. It seems that Trump and the entire GOP will be labeled, censored, and banned for the actions of those few while the same standard won&#x27;t be applied to those on the political left despite hundreds of riots being held across 2020.')
