Not going to be involved in day to day development but want a deeper understanding on the stack and ecosystem.<p>My learning style is to start from the basics and then build on top of it. In that vein I would like to understand the fundamentals of how the various front end pieces fit in vs jumping in straight into a opinionated framework like Vue or React.  This will help me form a mental model on top of which everything else is built.<p>I know there is a lot of blogs&#x2F;articles around HTML, JS, DOM, etc but nothing that I could find which ties everything together. Any good book&#x2F;source out there that will help me kick of my new learning?')
