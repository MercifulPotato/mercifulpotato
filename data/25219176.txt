But it is also obvious that some people can cope with their limitations much better than others. Think of young, able, independent, wealthy adults vs. families, for instance. Families in general do much better in smaller communities, because they offer more space and less traffic (up to a point, though because schools etc. should preferably be in walking distance).<p>That being said, cities might offer communities thag provide for special needs whereas towns and villages tend to be more streamlined. Living with kids is such a streamlined thing.')
