I like broadband as much as the next person but AT&amp;T and Comcast have never seemed like especially strong crisis response teams.<p>Second, though you might think otherwise from Very Online commentary, cutting funding for the police has in fact not much support from Chicago communities. The Online Discourse seems to have a real problem getting its head around the idea that communities of color in Chicago are both very justifiably upset at CPD for abusing them, <i>and</i> very justifiably upset at CPD for ignoring them.<p>At any rate, Chicago will not be taking money from the Chicago Police Department to fund community broadband.')
