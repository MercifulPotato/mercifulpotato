I worked in a restaurant kitchen, back when I was a student where the waiting staff&#x27;s wages were risibly low and they were expected to supplement them with whatever they received as tips.<p>It actually changed my opinion on tipping a bit. Before getting this &#x27;behind the scenes&#x27; insight, I&#x27;d never bothered leaving tips as I thought &#x27;what&#x27;s so special about waiters &amp; waitresses that they&#x27;re expected to get extra gratuities for doing their jobs, when the rest of us don&#x27;t?&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t know if the situation has changed since then, as this was before the introduction of the minimum wage. But, back then, tipping was definitely used as a way of covering some of the wage bill.')
