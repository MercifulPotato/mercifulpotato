Assume there is an algorithm Beauty(R,D) that given the program R and the input D, will return True if it is beautiful and False otherwise.<p>Step 2. Create a high-order function that is a simple wrapper of the halting problem over the algorithm created in step 1<p><i>Theorem. Beauty is undecidable.</i><p>Proof. Assume by contradiction that the halting problem is decidable, then, feed it the function created in step 2, thus you can always have an answer for step 1, but since the halting problem is undecidable this is not possible.<p>For more variety please substitute beauty for &quot;awesomeness&quot;, &quot;arachnid power&quot;, &quot;goodness&quot;,&quot;fear&quot; and so on.')
