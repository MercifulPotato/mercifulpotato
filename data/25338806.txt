For example, do you always test keyboard navigation when making changes to the styling of your components that might conflict with keyboard navigation?<p>The reason I&#x27;m asking is because I&#x27;ve used or evaluated dozens of CSS frameworks and React component libraries, including custom solutions developed by the companies I&#x27;ve worked for, and none of these solutions are as well-tested at Bootstrap. And one example of the issues I&#x27;ve encountered with these other solutions is bugs relating to keyboard navigation (e.g., Ant Design and Semantic UI were two of the worst offenders the last time I evaluated them).<p>For many developers nowadays who grew up with touch-based UIs and can&#x27;t touch type, keyboard navigation might seem like an odd thing to focus on. But I&#x27;ve found that checking if CSS frameworks and React component libraries fully support keyboard navigation is a quick way to evaluate them, like how David Lee Roth evaluated concert promoters by asking them to remove brown M&amp;Ms.<p>And if the teams that made Ant Design, Semantic UI, etc. can&#x27;t adequately test their components, how capable is the average developer of creating their own well-tested CSS framework?')
