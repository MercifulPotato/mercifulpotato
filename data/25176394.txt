You might be fooled by how quickly you can come up with a skeleton interface, but that doesn’t make an app. Especially for people who are coming from “React” as many have said here, once they hit those limitations, they would be fish out of water, just like React Native “developers” are dumbfounded what to do once their app doesn’t work as expected, or slows down seemingly inexplicable.<p>SwiftUI is a nice experiment, but it’s not a serious UI framework, and won’t be for a very long time.')
