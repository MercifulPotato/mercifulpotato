Ball park estimate place it at about 4<i>10^28 joules, and a large nuker only puts out about 4</i>10^15.<p>The theory is still sound though, and could be modified: Drill down a hundred miles or so and put 90% of the nukes down the hole to blow a crater out. Take the largest chunks and the remaining 10% of the nukes and proceed as originally planned, but on a smaller scale. Bonus: The debris should also make its way to LEO and trigger a cascade of collisions that take out everything in orbit.')
