On the other side is a dreadful interface (presumably due to legacy constraints) that you have to gingerly manipulate in the hope that it will cause the proper state changes on the other side so that it can generate the result you want...when I don&#x27;t actually know what the internals of say Xcodebuild are.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like using Italian to correspond with someone when you know Latin but not Italian.<p>If the code base really looks like that it might be interesting to implement a different front end.  Even XML would be better.<p>On the other hand I couldn&#x27;t imagine working without it and would be happy if it supported more languages (I only use it with C and C++).')
