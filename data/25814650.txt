You use the credentials they entered to login from a backend system automatically, and then if that ends up with a 2FA prompt, you show the victim the 2FA phishing page next, instead of redirecting them to the real app&#x2F;whatever.<p>This obviously does have its own downsides (you have to maintain a login infrastructure, as well as your phishing infrastructure), but this was even seen before 2FA became common to detect if an incorrect password was entered into the phishing site.<p>It is definitely an improvement, but TOTP doesn&#x27;t provide much protection from phishing, and as it becomes more popular more phishers will need to accomodate for them in their campaigns, further reducing their effectiveness here.')
