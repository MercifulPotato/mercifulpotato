We just don&#x27;t think about heat flows and temperature enough.<p>There is, of course, the communal thing, done in Sweden and Russia and college campuses, with a power plant and steam pipes going to apartments.<p>But what about an appliance for suburban America? Like, combine a gas turbine generator with an HVAC system and hot water tank (pretty sure you can buy things like this in Germany). No unsolved technical problems here. You generate electricity for your home, heat it with waste heat, and absorb temporary excesses in capacity by usefully heating water. You could imagine integrating other things too: If you need more heat than you use electricity, then you might as well use the electricity to do something high-value (cryptocurrency is a crime against the environment, but you might as well compute some hashes in your resistive heater). All this becomes an elaborate way to burn natural gas to make heat, but you get a bunch of other things out besides. The &quot;smart controller&quot; aspect then becomes interesting -- but even that is &quot;just simple automation&quot;, not super-difficult AI.<p>Maybe logistically, the &quot;everything is electric; electricity comes from renewables&#x2F;nuclear; and heat comes from heat pumps&quot; solution is easier in the long run?<p>But this more &quot;decentralized heat engines&quot; solution has the &quot;advantage&quot;(?) that it could run on biomass, which is easy to store (however, I am aware of the problems of wood pellets and deforestation).')
