No one was fanning the flames. The videotape itself did that.<p>With the capital riots you have Trump and his “team” manufacturing anger with lies. If Trump put country over ego and conceded, none of this would be happening.<p>You don’t think Democrats were pissed off when the FL recount was ordered to stop and Gore lost by 537 votes? Gore could have easily seized that moment to create anger and perpetuate violence, but that’s not the kind of country we want to live in.<p>Plus, it’s not like these bans are coming preemptively. Companies are sensitive now because people have died and political leaders have been targeted.<p>If after the Young Turks comments you had targeted political attacks on Republicans, then I can see your point. But for me the capital riots are far worse because they’re being actively exacerbated with the intent of threatening our democracy.')
