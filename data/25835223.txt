I don&#x27;t think social workers are careless, but they do have to make decisions based on limited information, and they often don&#x27;t have sufficient alternatives to taking kids away.<p>But of course, I&#x27;m just a random dude commenting on the internet, and maybe I&#x27;m wrong. I also live in Austria, so maybe the situation is totally different to the US (the system does work differently). I&#x27;ve also tried to find statistics about foster kids, and it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find them.')
