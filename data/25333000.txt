The ads definitely give an impression that wikimedia is struggling to pay hosting expenses, but this isn&#x27;t really the case. According to their 2018 report[1] &quot;Internet hosting&quot; and &quot;Depreciation and amortization&quot; combined only make up 6.4% of their budget. &quot;Salaries and wages&quot; makes up 47.3%, but it&#x27;s unclear how much of the staff is related to IT, rather than in admin or advocacy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikimediafoundation.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;2018-annual-report&#x2F;financials-leadership&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikimediafoundation.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;2018-annual-report&#x2F;fin...</a>')
