If you were in agreement with the ideas of that autocrat, it felt like freedom. If you weren&#x27;t, you got banned and you found a different fiefdom with rules you liked, but there were plenty to choose from. Nowadays a few megacorps run those fiefdoms so it feels like there&#x27;s less freedom because there&#x27;s less options.')
