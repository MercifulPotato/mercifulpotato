I switched to Arch on the desktop a decade ago because I was tired of having to often nuke and pave my install every 6 months. I am still with Arch all these years later, even for my work machine and I work as a programmer so instability wouldn&#x27;t fly.<p>Obviously the support window for CentOS was much, much longer, but if they&#x27;re careful we can perhaps have the convenience of a rolling release with the stability of RHEL, or close to then more power to them.<p>My only concern is the short EOL window for current CentOS 8 users.')
