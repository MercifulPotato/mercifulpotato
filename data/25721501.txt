Gcc is now a C++ codebase, and new components should be coded in modern C++, for better productivity, performance, safety, and maintainability.<p><i>(You might prefer not to consider modern C++ more productive, performant, safe, and maintainable than C (and</i> reflexively <i>downvote), but the statement remains true: Gcc</i> did <i>transition to C++, for reasons. And, all the improvements that have kept Gcc competitive with Clang were done, since. And, Clang and LLVM are also coded in C++, also for reasons.)</i>')
