The evidence gathered in the last decades is pretty clear: there is little to no advantage using a strongly typed language over something like Python or Ruby (on mobile so can&#x27;t look up references but there&#x27;s really plenty). And that&#x27;s just looking at bug density, without even considering how quickly you can build something (often thanks to the great ecosystem of packages) or how easier it is to hire decent Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;JS devs over, say, C++, Java or Rust.<p>That said: I wish you the best of luck!')
