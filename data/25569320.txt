Each of the largest companies will have PR agencies, personal contacts within the FDA, revolving door of staff between the FDA and the corporates, positions on standards committees, board members who have spent a life time in food safety governance. I&#x27;m sure many of these manufacturers are the largest employers in some congressional districts so it wouldn&#x27;t be a surprise if they managed to get a congressman to write the FDA to focus attention on this. The same complaint from a small company will never get the same attention.<p>My point is that their scale and resources gives them access. A competitor breached a pointless regulation [1] from the last century which has prevented their product from being sold for a year. If one of the large corporates breached that regulation, they would have been able to quickly agree corrective action with minimal supply chain disruption.<p>[1] Many of these food regs are designed to enrich staple foods that were the main source of nutrients for low income families. That&#x27;s just not an issue anymore and just prevents (high quality) imports.')
