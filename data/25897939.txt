People love to crap on Samsung for their software, but their browser is a real solid piece of software.<p>I just tried Firefox for the 5th time (over the past 2 years) last week and it was so much slower to load pages, and the scrolling experience was quite poor.<p>Samsung&#x27;s dark mode is outstanding and while less flexible, a lot less clunkier than Firefox extensions. Any browser without a viable Dark mode setting (for sites i.e.) is a non-starter, especially when you can enjoy dark mode reading in bed with a great OLED screen.<p>Tab browsing and private mode both work really well.<p>Text zoom and general page layouts are much more readable. Accessing old.reddit.com via Firefox was a mess with the font being tiny, whereas it is totally usable on Samsung&#x27;s browser.<p>Ad blocking works quite well as well. At the end of the day, Samsung&#x27;s browser gets out of the way and executes really well on all the main things you&#x27;d want in a browser.<p>I really want to use Firefox or a similar browser that I trust more with my privacy, but at the moment, Samsung&#x27;s browser is miles better than all the other browsers I&#x27;ve tried using.')
