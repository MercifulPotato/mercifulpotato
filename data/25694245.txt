That&#x27;s the difference. If someone is sympathetic to a movement, it&#x27;s hard to say they had a hand in events. If someone literally says &quot;hey everyone, let&#x27;s do this thing!&quot; then it&#x27;s very obvious.<p>You could also argue that Trump&#x27;s previous tweets, the wink wink nod nod tweets to white supremacists, also fall under a similar category as the BLM tweet. Sympathy and possibly support but not actual incitement.<p>This time was different. Trump was literally inciting sedition. &quot;Go to the capitol and stop the steal&quot; was the message.')
