Not sure) I was trying to buy a CD in a Tower Records store in SF, and I found the disk I wanted but it said it was &quot;copy protected&quot;. I would have had no problem ripping it with abcde or cdparanoia or something, but refusing to support this, I asked the store employee: &quot;Do you, by any chance, have another copy of this without copy protection?&quot;<p>He looked at me, with complete disbelief, saying &quot;But why wouldn&#x27;t you want your copy to be protected?&quot; I asked him &quot;Do you know what kind of protection this is?&quot; to which he replied, &quot;yes, it&#x27;s a copy less likely to break&quot;.<p>After this incident, I started asking a lot of people if they are aware of what&#x27;s special about their &quot;copy protected&quot; disks - and the more technical people knew it was an attempt to restrict copying, but the rest thought it was probably a good thing (it says protection, and its on the label, it must be good, or reasoning as such).<p>It was at that point that I started religiously using RMS style acronyms, like Digital Restriction Management, Copy Restriction, etc. and I recommend everyone does.')
