It&#x27;s the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. It&#x27;s not a very strong charge, but it&#x27;s enough to pull particles a few microns out of line and catch them in the filter.[1]<p>It&#x27;s a mini version of an electrostatic precipitator, which has a coarse charged mesh and a strong charge. Those are good for pulling particles out of air.<p>If you want to test this, there are standard &quot;fit test kits&quot; for respirators. They&#x27;re little packets of scented smoke particles. You put on the mask, break the ampule to let the smoke out, and if you can smell it, the respirator isn&#x27;t working, or, more likely, is leaking.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;426IpWoEQsc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;426IpWoEQsc</a>')
