Item(by='cmiles74', descendants=None, kids=[25304980], score=None, time=1607101842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298574, text='I&#x27;ve heard myself and other say many times, &quot;the kind of work they have you do in the technical interview is rarely the kind of work you&#x27;ll actually do&quot;. This so often true, I think many of us take it for granted. Odds are strong that you won&#x27;t be implementing a hash table, a question I&#x27;ve been asked in several technical interviews. Often when pressed on this kind of thing, I&#x27;ll say something like, well isn&#x27;t it good to know anyway?<p>I think the author makes an important point when they say...<p>&gt; My technical skills have definitely sharpened up by practicing Hackerrank-style questions, but I believe the companies using these tests are creating a bias in favor of candidates who a) have time to practice and b) who&#x27;ve recently graduated and are familiar with the format. It&#x27;s very hard to prepare for these tests if you&#x27;re working full time and have a young family.  It&#x27;s also an opportunity to excuse ageism. In an assessment the other day I was asked to code something that I hadn&#x27;t covered for 30 years. If I&#x27;d had the opportunity to read-up on it, I would have been fine.<p>Again, I think it&#x27;s taken for granted that FANNG companies should be gated in this way since they are looking for the &quot;best of the best&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s worth taking a harder look at this and actually try to get an idea of who these &quot;best of the best&quot; look like. Are they all young people with wealthy families who attend top-tier computer science programs and apply for these jobs soon after graduation? I suspect that is the case.<p>Many of these hiring techniques do trickle down to other, smaller companies who view whatever Google or Facebook might be doing as a &quot;best practice&quot;. I think it&#x27;s worth asking if this kind of bias is acceptable.')
