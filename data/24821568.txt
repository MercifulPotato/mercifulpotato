I&#x27;d argue that any distro where it isn&#x27;t easy is a good reason to start looking elsewhere, absent any specific conflicting requirements.<p>Not sure it matters if it&#x27;s full-disk vs just home directory, but full disk is easier to reason about and I don&#x27;t recall an OS that can do homedir easily but not full-disk (there very well could be one, just none come to mind).')
