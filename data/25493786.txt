But even if we skip the challenges of actually doing that, what would be the point?<p>From what we know today quantum copmuters aren&#x27;t magical computers that make everything faster. Instead there are a couple of very special problems that QCs can calculate much faster.<p>If you keep that in mind it&#x27;s clear where QCs job is: As specialized equipment doing calculations for very particular problems, e.g. for scientific use.<p>That also means noone will likely ever need a quantum operating system. We&#x27;ll just continue using &quot;normal&quot; operating systems that interact with specialized hardware for specialized calculations.')
