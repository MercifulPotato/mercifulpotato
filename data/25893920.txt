I remember having longish hair when a primary teacher from an adjacent class stepped in, put her hand in my hair (hair wasn’t supposed to go over finger girth in length for boys) and while dragging it she loudly said: is this a boy? Let’s check his private parts cause he looks like a girl. All other kids were either stupefied or laughing. They did not check my private parts but it was humiliating enough to leave an emotional scar to remember. My teacher liked me and let me have longer hair but when it was growing too long she’d gently tell me she’ll have problems for me, so not everybody was mean. But the mean teachers were very empowered and acting on a whim whenever they felt like. Corporal punishment was also common, they would slap put palms with wooden rulers, pull out hair, etc. I wasn’t roudy and I can say I didn’t get a lot of it but still, if one had ADHD they’d be constantly punished. I wonder what came of those kids eventually')
