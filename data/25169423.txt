So running make -j40 usually ends up with various errors due to running out of file descriptors. You can of course raise the limit for your own user, but this may not be trivial on a shared system.<p>* getting podman to obey a raised user FD limit is non-trivial on CentOS 8. podman is not well supported on CentOS, you need latest Fedora if you want the various bugs&#x2F;limitations fixed.<p>* fuse-overlayfs is a single process for the entire container and quickly becomes the bottleneck for any IO intensive operation (e.g. don&#x27;t try running AFL inside podman, it&#x27;ll be way too slow and peg the CPU at 99% running fuse-overlayfs).<p>Fuse shouldn&#x27;t be necessary though if I could just give it access to the files that my user has access to (of course you&#x27;d loose the snapshotting&#x2F;committing ability), perhaps using -v would improve performance?<p>Using docker on CentOS 7 was a lot easier (and faster) than using podman on CentOS 8.')
