So the connection is over WiFi. But as you walk out the door, currently your application software needs to spot that the WiFi is going away (not too hard), connect over the mobile network (unless your policies say to give up instead to save money) and keep going. QUIC would allow this to be done transparently at the transport layer, at least in some cases. When you reach a coffee shop&#x2F; friend&#x27;s place&#x2F; work and there&#x27;s WiFi again, the opposite transition saves you money and if you go indoors and signal is weaker may also be necessary to deliver a working network.')
