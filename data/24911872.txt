The battery lasts a good long time and it feels pretty good to be able to play these full sized games on a screen like this. When I&#x27;m not using it the toddler watches some kids shows, and with the keyboard case I can type almost as quickly as I can on my 15&quot; Macbook pro. If it had XCode I&#x27;d be set, honestly.')
