These sorts of stories are stupid, but in my view, they&#x27;re just not worthy of retraction because they don&#x27;t break the rules or tell outright falsehoods. At least not when they&#x27;re standalone stories. On the other hand, if the NYT ran a large number of stories like this, not blatantly untrue but offering too rosy a picture of the preparedness of the Finnish government as part of a big campaign to alter public opinion, that would be more of an attempt at deception, and more of a problem. I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;d do that, but we could point at analogous series of stories they&#x27;ve done over the last 30 years. (An awful lot of the NYT&#x27;s behavior in the early 2000s was fairly awful, even when it was superficially within journalistic standards.)<p>&gt; What if in March, a Finnish news agency had interviewed US president Trump&#x27;s office and maybe US CDC Director Dr. Redfield, asked them if US has the pandemic situation in control, and after they replied yes, then ran a story &quot;US has pandemic in control&quot;? Would you say that&#x27;s ok â€“ after all they&#x27;d be honest about the limits of their reporting, and are just citing their sources.<p>Some of it is about trusting the reader. I would be disappointed in a Finnish reporter who left the US government&#x27;s employee&#x27;s rosy assessment unchallenged in the absence of evidence, and in a Finnish editor who decided to run the story, but in 2020, I&#x27;d be disappointed in the reader who took such claims by the US Government seriously without evidence.')
