I&#x27;m just wondering if you&#x27;d recommend syndicating to hashnode as well, and whether that&#x27;s well supported (canonical headers etc etc). I know lots of people syndicate their own blogs to Medium to widen their readership, and frankly getting similar benefits that without having to use Medium would be a big win for everybody!')
