You could argue the batch size doesn&#x27;t fully use the V100 but these comparisons are tricky and this looks like fairly normal training to me.<p>It&#x27;s pretty surprising to me that an M1 performs anywhere near a V100 on model training and I guess the most striking thing is the energy efficiency of the M1.')
