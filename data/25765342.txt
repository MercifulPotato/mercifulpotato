Nevertheless, I had a &quot;this sucks and it&#x27;s completely out of my control&quot; moment recently and threw a bunch more time (and money) into making music. In part making music&#x27;s always been an emotional regulator for me, but this time it was a very deliberate escape to fill my mind with composing so I don&#x27;t leave myself space to think about the thing I don&#x27;t want to think about.<p>So I think escapist workaholism needn&#x27;t necessarily be for the boss man.
