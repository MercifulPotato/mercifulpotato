It&#x27;s just saying that most major news companies will be led and staffed by people with college degrees (business, journalism, whatever).  And, because those with four year degrees tend to lean left in the US, it makes sense the companies they lead and staff will do the same.  Venn diagrams, and all that.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t believe this.  In fact, I don&#x27;t believe &quot;the media&quot; is a useful phrase at all.  It&#x27;s like pigeonholing Trump supporters.  It can make you feel superior or smart, but it&#x27;s not actually informative.  I think the Republican Party has chosen the tactic of discrediting media sources after Fox News showed it could work.  No news organization is perfect, and it&#x27;s best to consume a balanced diet, but avoiding all &quot;mainstream media&quot; just leaves us with dregs.')
