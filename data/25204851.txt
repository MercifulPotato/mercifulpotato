It’s not fashion.</i><p>Of course it is. Our phones are intimately close to us. Physically, cognitively, socially and even emotionally. They may be the most widely-owned intimately-connected object humans have ever invented outside religion.<p>Our computers don&#x27;t occupy as close of a niche. But they&#x27;re in a similar space.<p>I agree with your observation that the new OS feels like molasses. I wish they went for a &quot;snappy&quot; feel. (Though keyboard shortcuts get around that.) But ignoring that Macs and iPhones are objects of fashion as well as computing devices misses a deep part of what Jobs saw that technologists missed.')
