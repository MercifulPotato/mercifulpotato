They are not naive, they knew what they were doing.<p>Not only did they know there was nothing they could do otherwise, but that there would be an existential pull from FB to push for data sharing that would be unavoidable.<p>The &#x27;moral high ground&#x27; that the founders tried to take in public is really kind of despicable, because they knew exactly the cards in play when they sold.<p>If the &#x27;promise&#x27; was to do with branding, or something secondary, but fine. But you don&#x27;t sell drugs to a drug dealer with the promise that the dealer won&#x27;t deal drugs.<p>Anyhow, we are where we are. People should fork over $1 month for chat. It would make a big difference.')
