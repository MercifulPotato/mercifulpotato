Both of them are extremely fast, concrete, and have lots of investment being poured into numerics and fitting into the Python&#x2F;ML ecosystem.<p>I don&#x27;t think Julia or R are going to steal this away. In fact, I think Julia is a major turn off to engineers with some of the bizarre choices they made (eg. 1-based indexing to appease math-centric backgrounds). If you don&#x27;t excite engineers, you&#x27;re not going to get as many library and optimization contributions.<p>Julia feels like it came too late in the game and the newer entrants are making quick strides in the mathematics space.<p>I could be totally wrong. This is just my take, and I have no stake in this fight other than I want a good, safe, highly-compatible, and fast ecosystem to work with.')
