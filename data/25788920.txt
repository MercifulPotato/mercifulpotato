Anywhere outside of Munich €100k is a really high salary for a software engineer<p>These salaries are also possible in Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Mannheim, Heidelberg (and more, this is where I know)<p>&gt; In any case, the point is that with €100k&#x2F;year you can really have way more than a decent life. More like a very, very comfortable life.<p>Well so what? They shouldnt pay more because it is already a decent salary and give the rest to the share holders?<p>It&#x27;s no wonder that avarage salaries are low if people approach salary negotiations with this kind of attitude.')
