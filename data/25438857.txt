Strong punk energy. <i>eyeroll</i><p>It&#x27;s extremely a game that is pastiche of cyberpunk, diving neither into the cyber nor punk beyond skinning things. Where&#x27;s the Ghost in the Shell examination of the self? Where&#x27;s the dive into what it means to have modifiable bodies? Where&#x27;s the anti-establishment story (oh wait, the game opens with praise of the cops by multiple characters, including V).<p>For a game that wants to be cyberpunk, it sure relies on a lot of stereotypes about people and what they can be.<p>To me, it reads a lot like a Boomer&#x2F;GenX take on what they remember cyberpunk being (NEON AND CHROME) and not an actual understanding of the genre (exploration of what it means to be a human in a corporate, transhuman world.)<p>If you want to play an actual cyberpunk game, check out Umurangi Generation or Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The Final Fantasy 7 Remake that came out this year is more cyberpunk than Cyberpunk.<p>That said, the game <i>is</i> a serviceable noire and shooter with some extremely always on aesthetic choices which aren&#x27;t really my taste but they might be other&#x27;s tastes.')
