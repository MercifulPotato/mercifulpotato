So easy with card placeholders and mods to get into a horrible performance zone where even throwing a dice is lagy.<p>- It isn&#x27;t super comfortable<p>- Not as good as roll20.com even with roll20&#x27;s limited features, the effort required is 20x lower.<p>- So easy to get into weird physics interactions. How many times did we try to move a piece, be 1px off, and half the board goes flying.<p>- very space limited. there&#x27;s no comfortable place to set up your stuff, just a tiny spot on the side of your player. Very limiting.<p>Overall I understand why most these problems are not easily solvable, but it isn&#x27;t a great experience. Good for simple board games, not good for something really complex.')
