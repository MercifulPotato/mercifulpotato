Item(by='pfranz', descendants=None, kids=[24860745], score=None, time=1603348978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855157, text='I can&#x27;t imagine Katzenberg doing this (I don&#x27;t think his interests are actually animation or anything &quot;traditional&quot;), but hand drawn animation is just &quot;out of fashion&quot; and the business people don&#x27;t think the ROI is enough. Look at the budget for Princess and the Frog or other hand drawn projects around that time compared to CG films. Hand drawn cost around $80-100 million while CG is closer to $150 million (a large chunk for both is usually voice talent). Disney had tossed their old animation system CAPS (and I&#x27;m pretty sure all their old desks) and they built a brand new pipeline around off the shelf software for the production--subsequent productions would have been cheaper.')
