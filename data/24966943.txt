Covid is well on the way to causing as many deaths in 1 year worldwide as TB; it&#x27;s already killed three times as many people as malaria; comparing it to the flu is laughable.<p>And all of these deaths and infection numbers are low because we have reacted - not strongly enough - much more than we do to a flu.
