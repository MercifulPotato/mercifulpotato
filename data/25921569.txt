The program can update its solution of the maze when the maze changes, but it is capable of only changing that part of the solution that has actually changed. When Shannon changes the maze and places Theseus in the modified part of the maze, I kind of rolled my eyes, sure that it was going to start a new search, all over again, but I was wrong: it searches until it finds where the unmodified part of the maze begins, then it continues on the path it learned before.<p>It seems that, in solving the maze, the program is building some kind of model of its world, that it can then manipulate with economy. For comparison, neural nets cannot update their models - when the world changes, a neural net can only train its model all over again, from scratch, just like I thought Theseus would start a whole new search when Shannon changed the maze. And neural nets can certainly not update <i>parts</i> of their models!<p>This demonstration looks primitive because everything is so old (a computer made with telephone relays!), but it&#x27;s actually attacking problems that continue to tie AI systems of today into knots. It is certainly AI. And, in &quot;early 1950&#x27;s&quot;, it&#x27;s AI <i>avant la lettre</i>.')
