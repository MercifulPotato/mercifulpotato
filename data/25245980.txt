Item(by='kortex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606666224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25245679, text='&gt; but doesn&#x27;t even mention one other. Which is an editorial choice.<p>That&#x27;s some weird hot take on a 20 min video titled &quot;The CIA is a Terrorist Organization&quot;. He&#x27;s obligated to mention Moussad, KGB&#x2F;FSB et al, because &quot;both sides&quot;?<p>Also last I checked, &quot;we only did shady shit cause <i>they</i> did shady shit&quot; isn&#x27;t much os a defense anyway.')
