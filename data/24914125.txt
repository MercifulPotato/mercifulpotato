The Ninja config file is not something you write or, even, look at. It&#x27;s an intermediate file generated by your build-dependency tool such as CMake, Meson, or even (gods forbid) SCons.<p>Those are smarter than Make in various ways, but are really not very good at all at actually running builds, so you get them to just make a ninja file, instead, and then get the hell out of your way.<p>This is good because you don&#x27;t want to analyze the dependency tree on every build when you haven&#x27;t changed any of it. So, you just run ninja in your edit-build-test loop.<p>Ninja is smart enough to rerun Meson or whatever if you <i>do</i> change the build configuration. It understands build directories separate from sources, and ccache compiler wrappers to cache build targets, things you don&#x27;t want your build-configuation infrastructure to bother with.<p>Besides being fantastic to use, ninja is worthy of study as a truly superb example of a program that does one thing really, really well, and integrates cleanly with other programs that do other stuff: build analyzers on one side, compilers on the other. It demonstrates a design discipline that we would all be better off if everyone were to follow it.')
