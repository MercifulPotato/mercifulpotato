In the late 90s I made a massively multiplayer online drug dealing game.  At its peak there were about 3M daily active users.  I went through a few shared hosting companies as I learned to optimize and scale the stack.  One of them cut me off, stole all the source code, and launched their own copy of the game.  I couldn&#x27;t afford to bring legal action against them. Eventually I had my own co-located servers in one of google&#x27;s old datacenters in San Jose, and had everything humming smooth.  The game was free, but I charged $1&#x2F;mo for &quot;premium&quot; features that basically just let you skin your character or start a gang.  No &quot;pay to win&quot; stuff... just gravy.  I had direct payments from Visa and Mastercard, as well as PayPal that included Discover and AmEx I think.<p>I got accused of running an actual drug marketplace.   The DEA contacted me to let me know they were alerted of the claims, but after an investigation determined (fairly obviously) that it was just a game, and let me know that they enjoyed it, and many of the agents in their office were actively playing.  A month later PayPal cut me off, seized all of my funds (that I have still not gotten back), and shortly after that my direct merchant accounts with Visa and MasterCard were cut off.  Lesson learned.  America&#x27;s financial institutions are corrupt.')
