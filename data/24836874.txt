Dayum.<p>re Insomnia &amp; anxiety: Have you ruled out nerve related causes? Maybe injury or impingement?<p>I ask because my insomnia and anxiety was largely resolved after spinal surgery. A lumbar fusion eliminated maybe 80% of symptoms. Removing cervical (upper spine) bone spurs another 10%.<p>Prior to that, my doctors had me try all sorts of pharmacological and cognitive treatments. As my symptoms got progressively worse. No one considered a physical cause. That my surgeries helped, necessary for other problems, was just a lucky side effect.<p>None of my reading about anxiety even hints that feeled emotion can have a physical cause, that the physical sensations of anxiety can induce emotional anxiety. Both a mind blow and facepalm obvious at the same time.<p>I&#x27;m now using gabapentin to manage remaining nerve pain symptoms. (Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m up for another surgery.) Works pretty good, but robs me of my &quot;executive function&quot;, so caveat emptor.<p>Good luck. I hope you find some relief.')
