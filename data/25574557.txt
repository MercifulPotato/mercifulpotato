Supply has lagged behind demand for decades. And still basically everybody opposes new housing near them.<p>If “we don’t know the solutions” means “we don’t know what is causing this,” then I think that’s wrong. We definitely know. But if it means “we don’t know how to change course,” then that’s clearly right. It’s a disaster.')
