I used it for a short time as a Synergy server (keyboard&#x2F;mice).  My future plans for these are:<p>* PiHole (original model should be enough)\n* Home automation, ie Garage door opener &#x2F; automation\n* CCTV monitoring using old webcam (not fast though, perhaps less than 5 fps but that&#x27;s good enough for what I need)\n* CCTV recorder (not video, but just capturing photo every second, which is good enough for me)\n* file server for low throughput device (or TimeMachine server)\n* Server&#x2F;PC status display (displays server status) on TV\n* Prometheus, htop, GoAccess, etc...\n* Lo-fi player\n* pivpn')
