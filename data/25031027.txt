I don&#x27;t have an app. What I do understand is; given the last 20 years of computing is that developers broadly cannot be trusted to run software on my device <i>and</i> I don&#x27;t have the time to inspect the source code of every app. What I have decided is that I can trust Apple to be the gatekeeper to my device and if you can&#x27;t play by their rules you won&#x27;t have access to their official distribution processes.<p>If I, the user, decide that Apple isn&#x27;t in my best interest then I&#x27;ll switch devices. But I have no incentive to adopt a more developer friendly workflow when it&#x27;s been broadly anonymous developers that have been sucking up and spying on me every chance they get. If some innocent apps get caught in the cross fire, it&#x27;s unfortunate.')
