But I can churn out quite a bit of content when I need to. Here&#x27;s some tips.<p>1. Allow 1st draft to be bloody awful. It&#x27;s a brain dump. Just get it done. Don’t edit or correct any spelling as you go. Worry about editing, argument order or spelling later. The Pomodoro Technique is a great way to force yourself to get your 1st draft finished.<p>2. Write way more than you need and then cut ruthlessly in your 2nd, 3rd drafts. Rule of thumb is that your 2nd draft should be 10%-30% smaller than your 1st.<p>3. Proofing your writing is hard. If it’s an important article hire a proof reader - they’ll spot mistakes which you won’t be aware of. If it’s just a personal blog post, then listening to your article through text to speech software is a great way catch errors. Also consider using this app: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intelligentediting.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intelligentediting.com&#x2F;</a><p>4. Writing is a skill. You’ll get better the more you do it. I recently decided to redo a personal blog of mine which I started 10 years ago. This was my first attempt at blogging or writing since my school days. The stuff I’d written 10 years ago was horrible. However, it was good to see how much my writing has improved since then. But it’s taken a lot of practice, hard work and time to get there.<p>5. As Stephen King says: You should read as much as you write. And make a habit of reading good writers often. I recommend anything by George Orwell &amp; PG Wodehouse. Some of their writing is nearly 100 years old but it still shines today. Orwell’s prose is masterful. More modern writers to read are Elmore Leonard and Stephen King.<p>Here&#x27;s some software I use&#x2F;recommend:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wordrake.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wordrake.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intelligentediting.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intelligentediting.com&#x2F;</a> &lt;&lt;great for proofing.
