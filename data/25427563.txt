My company is in healthcare. that means this web dev has been literally hands-on with actual customers. Actual patients. And their children.\nIt really changes your view once you&#x27;re back in the office in front of a keyboard. You start to think about what you design and build in a different way. You start to remember that the people using your web site aren&#x27;t on the latest whiz-bank iPhone 16. They&#x27;re on a craptastic pre-paid piece of garbage that they bought at 7-Eleven and share with other members of their family. A phone you and I would use as a weekend burner is all the internet access some people will ever have.”<p>That perspective must be awesome in every aspect of the word: hope inducing and inspiring but also instilling a bit of fear in that real people, possibly sick or terminal people, will be using your work. I guess this is the mantle of “mission critical”.')
