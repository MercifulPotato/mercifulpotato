Every portfolio I&#x27;ve looked at outside of the top firms has had multiple investments (approved by partners) that to my mind look mind bogglingly dumb. Not Theranos level of dumb, where they&#x27;d have to have a little knowledge of blood based diagnostics and the statistical significance of results from finger pricks to know its a fraud, but &quot;we didn&#x27;t do due diligence and found out that this is a perpetual motion machine&#x2F;founder doesn&#x27;t own critical IP&#x2F;financials don&#x27;t make sense in any universe&quot; levels of dumb. The former slip through the cracks at even the best firms, but the latter is like watching a slow motion train wreck.<p>With the benefit of hindsight, the entire industry looks like thousands of monkeys with typewriters (especially when biotech gets frothy).')
