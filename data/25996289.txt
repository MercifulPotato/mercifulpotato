Once you have to pay enough for nvidia to break even much less make a profit, everyone is going to bail.<p>At least with xcloud &amp; stadia&#x27;s approach there&#x27;s both subscription fees (passive income if people don&#x27;t play), as well as the 30% store cut to offset some of the cost.<p>Although none of these are remotely close to being priced at break-even prices, so this is also likely going to end up with even more IAP-based games on these platforms if this ever &quot;takes off&quot; at all. Which, yuck. This is obviously a bait &amp; switch strategy for everyone involved. Just dressed up as &quot;subsidized during user acquisition&quot; instead so they can feel less evil about it.')
