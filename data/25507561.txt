The engineering students have barely any electives at all. They’re always working their butts off and super stressed out all the time. For the few electives they do have they tend to choose bird courses.<p>I’m a pure math student though. Math students tend to have way more flexibility in what they study. You can take extremely rigorous courses like functional analysis and algebraic topology. Or you can do a math-based accounting program and pretty much stop taking hard math courses after first year.')
