He leaves the stage at 84m23s, in front of a pair of Cingular and AT&amp;T logos. So that&#x27;s precisely 6 minutes on stage, out of precisely 80 minutes total.<p>In the 71-minute iPhone 12 keynote, the CEO of Verizon is brought on stage at 15m55s, and speaks until Tim boots him at 19m55s. So that&#x27;s precisely 4 minutes on stage. Additionally, millimeter-wave 5G is given airtime, but says Verizon&#x27;s product title for that a total of 5 seconds only.<p>ps. All iPhones offer carrier branding in the top-left corner of the screen when cellular service is active and control center is open (non-notch phones may not need to open control center).')
