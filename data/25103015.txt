I switched from Sublime Text to vim and in a matter of one or two days I felt comfortable editing text with it and in contrast to other editors the learning curve quickly flattened, because you&#x27;re actually learning a rather simplistic language with grammar and a small vocabulary, instead of memorizing key sequences which most of the time don&#x27;t follow any logic.<p>&gt; No they speak German because that&#x27;s the easiest option for communicating with other people. Vim is not the easiest option for text editing.<p>What is the easiest option then? And I&#x27;m not talking about the easiest option during the first week, but afterwards (i.e. the majority of time).')
