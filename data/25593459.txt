If we&#x27;re talking about syntax for example, for me it is Clojure &gt; Python &gt; Elixir &gt;&gt; Ruby, but I know lots of people that thing Ruby is the most beautiful language on earth.<p>BTW, if we are talking about things that really goes on nerve for me it is the fact that Golang doesn&#x27;t compile when there is unused imports in the module, so I can&#x27;t simple comment a random line and try to compile it again. But I know people that like this because they editor are configured so the import is automatically removed. Ok I guess, but I still find this behavior annoying (I would much prefer that this was a compiler warning).')
