If github readmes where meant to be both accessible and designable they would not be just markdown&#x2F;rst.<p>Your suggestion means a11y software having a hack that goes against the spec to enable a hack that was used to circumvent a platform that knowingly crippled it&#x27;s document representation because they thought it would be used for mostly unstyled info.')
