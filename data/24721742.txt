I also occasionally check out Michael Christy&#x27;s channel, which is pretty hardcore and aimed more at steel&#x2F;sharpening enthusiasts instead of your everyday joe types. Bladeforums has a lot of smart people discussing knives, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a site specifically for reviews per se.')
