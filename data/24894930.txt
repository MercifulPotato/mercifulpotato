Perhaps you&#x27;re happy in that corner, great! That puts you and whoever else exists there in the same conceptual space where everyone else with impractical and unreasonable restraints on their software lives.<p>That&#x27;s a fine space to be in, but you don&#x27;t get to say that it&#x27;s the &quot;correct&quot; choice for the average user. It&#x27;s the wrong choice, because it puts the Linux ecosystem at a permanent usability disadvantage. Instead of going with this &quot;no you can&#x27;t have it&quot; approach, it would have been entirely reasonable to go with something permissions-based (perhaps even with a default that says it won&#x27;t happen). Instead, we&#x27;re stuck with one part of the community yelling that this is what everyone should want and everyone else trying their hardest to ignore them. It&#x27;s an unhealthy situation for everyone.')
