Styling a real button to look the same way this does would require basically the same amount of work as styling a div. The only difference for most people is that you would need to search for a style clear for buttons, which will be the first result in DuckDuckGo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;css-tricks.com&#x2F;overriding-default-button-styles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;css-tricks.com&#x2F;overriding-default-button-styles&#x2F;</a><p>And it&#x27;s a little bit debatable if you even want that style clear, because you should be using some of the stuff that buttons give you for free like graphical changes when the button is pressed, visual indication of focus, etc... That&#x27;s all stuff that the final developer didn&#x27;t even know they were missing from the final project.<p>So it&#x27;s not even really a question about &quot;does the button look exactly like what I want.&quot; Many times, &#x27;exactly what the dev wants&#x27; is explicitly the wrong choice to make. Most developers don&#x27;t know every graphical effect and interaction that a button should have, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to. The point of native components is to make this stuff easier; you don&#x27;t have to think about every interaction and use case that every non-typical user might require.<p>----<p>In Firefox, I opened the dev tools, changed the div to a button, and added one line of CSS:<p><pre><code>  border: none;\n</code></pre>\nAnd the button looks exactly the same as the div, except now it&#x27;s visually focusable and accessible. Same is true in Chrome. And those are likely the only two rendering engines that the original developer cares about, it&#x27;s not like IE11 is worth supporting for a WASM IDE.<p>No bikeshedding needed here, I didn&#x27;t even need to look up a button reset style.')
