This isn’t directly relevant to things in cars.  Here’s a table that may be more relevant:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecswire.com&#x2F;mmspecs&#x2F;Specsheets&#x2F;Belden&#x2F;leadWireSelectionChart.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecswire.com&#x2F;mmspecs&#x2F;Specsheets&#x2F;Belden&#x2F;leadWireSel...</a><p>So you don’t actually need so big a cable.  You also wouldn’t normally be using MV cables for a car charger — getting 15kV safely through a car charger terminal sounds like an interesting challenge. But 450A at 1kV doesn’t sound like a particularly big deal.<p>Keep in mind that there’s potentially a free factor or 2 available. I don’t know how actual DC chargers work, but I imagine you could supply -1kV and 1kV relative to ground without too much trouble, resulting in effectively 2kV while only operating at 1kV relative to ground. AIUI you trigger rather more onerous NEC rules if you get to much higher voltages relative to ground.')
