Our experience with the two jits is that it&#x27;s very nice that DynASM is ~2 orders of magnitude faster, and also that we have not been able to extract enough high-level knowledge to make a powerful JIT like LLVM worth it.  We do use LLVM elsewhere in our build process, and we hope to write some future blogposts about all of this.')
