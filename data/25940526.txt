Item(by='hulitu', descendants=None, kids=[25942400], score=None, time=1611832260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25939506, text='&gt; Hydrogen fuel cells were a stupid option paraded out repeatedly (usually by legacy companies using it to say EVs were bad) and Tesla said as much at the time.<p>Hydrogen fuel cells are not a stupid option.\nCharging is here the stupid option. When 50000 houses need each 20KWh each night at almost the same time they will destroy the local power lines which were not designed for this.<p>&gt; The predictions about battery tech improvements were reasonable ones and publicly made (arguably easy to accept).<p>Well battery improvements shall have come earlier (in 100 years there was almost no improvement). Even now the dream of having your battery to save your solar power is  still mostly a dream.<p>&gt; Legacy companies could fix this in theory, but in practice they wasted ten years and aren’t making the moves necessary today. I’d bet against them.<p>Legacy companies want profits which are rising, to please the stakeholders.')
