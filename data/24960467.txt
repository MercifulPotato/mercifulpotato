Your mind and body aren&#x27;t separate. If you are ill, not getting enough sleep, recently had a death in the family, etc, you may just have &quot;nothing to say&quot; until some of that is resolved.<p>Other times, your relationship to your audience has changed. Maybe you&#x2F;your life changed and that changes your relationship to everything else. Maybe your audience grew and you are getting different feedback than what you used to get or things went places you didn&#x27;t expect. Now you need time to digest that info and decide how best to adjust what you are doing.<p>Sometimes &quot;taking a break&quot; isn&#x27;t really a break. Sometimes it&#x27;s working hard on something like one of the two above issues so your writing will be better.')
