What does apple even use PyPy for?<p>We need to boycott APPLE because of a group making software they don&#x27;t use? Huh?<p>I suppose we will need to boycott my home builder because they don&#x27;t support my mattress company that works with the house they built me?<p>Apple uses python. They ship python3. They contribute to python. That get&#x27;s folks into python, that get&#x27;s folks interested in ARM64, so python work and golang and others start targeting ARM64 more, which in turn will probably help Microsoft and AWS whenever they inevitably release ARM products into production. That&#x27;s the traditional open source cycle. We don&#x27;t boycott these folks.<p>One issue - Apple WILL NOT ship GPLv3. Many other companies are EXTRMELY careful about shipping GPLv3 (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if google was strict hell no on GPLv3). So there is going to be some fragmenting as the GNU folks and other put out things like Bash as GPLv3. Probably from the same folks that boycott, so it may not matter in the end.')
