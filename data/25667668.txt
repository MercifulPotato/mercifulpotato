So I decided to click on one of your links and go down that rabbit hole.  I picked [3].  This certain Nahshon Garret who claims that he has not voted in Arizona yet somehow did vote in Arizona.<p>So it seems this dude is a wrestler, and here&#x27;s a random Twitter quote: &quot;If the CHURCh understood the Laws of God which govern our relationship with Him, our neighbor, and those whom he has given authority to we wouldnâ€™t be in this situation. The Church has failed to represent the lawful nature character and heart of God. Lawlessness is rampant.&quot;  Anyhow, look him up on Twitter.<p>If you Google this story you&#x27;ll see this dude got a fair bit of media exposure.  I&#x27;d say more than I&#x27;d expect.  So much for &quot;the media doesn&#x27;t report on this&quot;.<p>We also have some mystery Arizona law firm involved here.  So what&#x27;s the story exactly in how this specific person got involved with this specific law firm?  I&#x27;d follow that lead but I sort of got an idea about who is involved here.<p>Just because we have a signed affidavit doesn&#x27;t mean its true...<p>This guy (or rather these lawyers) did have their day in court: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov&#x2F;records&#x2F;election-2020&#x2F;cv2020-015285" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov&#x2F;records&#x2F;election-2020&#x2F;...</a> and the Justice offers a lengthy and educated opinion on the issue as a whole (basically while there might have been some irregularities there is no way they would have changed the outcome of the elections).  And man, there is a lot of minutes&#x2F;paperwork here.<p>Is this your best evidence of fraud?  I think it&#x27;s pretty thin.<p>Also please vote in your elections, it impacts all of us.')
