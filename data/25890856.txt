Further, the steam breaks down the cell walls, freeing delicious juices for caramelization and breaking down the structure to improve heat transfer.  You can get there low &amp; slow, or you can add a few well timed splashes on medium high for nicely caramelized onions in minutes.  It&#x27;s a threshold game, and the closer you come to burning the pan, the darker onions get.  Contrary to the sibling comment, I prefer white so I get clearer feedback about that threshold.')
