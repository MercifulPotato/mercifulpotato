Northern and rural california towns. Not the urban areas. Residents there feel increasingly threatened by scenes of racial protests in the state, fearing that somehow they&#x27;ll be subject to oppression. So it&#x27;s very easy to pack up and leave.<p>This isn&#x27;t a new phenomenon, people moved from the south westward after the civil war, the white flight of detroit during the civil rights period, I do believe we are seeing another similar wave in motion now.<p>And for my own insight on this, people are not usually entirely honest, except when in company of others of similar mindset. Over hearing at a family gathering, I learned that the main reason a relative of mine is leaving california for maine is because &quot;there will be less crime because there are fewer black people&quot;, despite living in one of the whitest towns in the state.')
