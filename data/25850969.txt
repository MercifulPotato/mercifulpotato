I can’t emphasize how much we appreciate your feedback! You’re totally correct about the word “Arab” - we should’ve caught that and am glad you brought it to our attention.<p>The situation with the exchange rate in Algeria is a real problem. Like you said, the banks’ exchange rate is much lower than it should be. When I was there I spent a day with a friend’s friend who runs a side business exchanging money, so I saw some of what this looks like on the ground. I’ll reach out now to pick your brain more on this topic.<p>Thank you again for your feedback &amp; for spreading the word! So grateful.')
