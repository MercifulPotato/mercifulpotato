You have to be willing to lie under oath that the evidence is forged before anyone would even care to look into it. And if it&#x27;s determined not a fake through other evidence, for example, corroborating witnesses and footage, then you&#x27;ll have impeached yourself and nobody will really believe you from then on.<p>Eg, evidence is kind of like a witness. If all the evidence is stacked against you, you&#x27;re screwed. If one video shows you and you claim it&#x27;s fake and everything else points to it being fake, there&#x27;s a shadow of a doubt.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about forged evidence.')
