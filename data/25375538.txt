We built ontology-based databases. Not OWL ontologies; we were actually doing ontologies before OWL. We were briefly and tangentially involved, but we thought they had picked the wrong level of ontology. We had a full-featured logic language for really strong definitions, so that you have strong guarantees about data quality and good ways to reason about data integration between databases.<p>In the end we never found the right use case for it. The advantages were all in maintenance rather than development, and even people who could be talked around to it wouldn&#x27;t see the payoff. There were a trillion other problems, and maybe better management than me could have made it work.')
