Do a google search for &#x27;KFC recipe&#x27; and there&#x27;s no shortage of sites showing you how to make KFC style fried chicken, many using an alleged leaked list of ingredients. It just seems if it was illegal they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that but again IANAL and this is based on observational conjecture. Maybe it being a foreign company under different laws has something to do with it.')
