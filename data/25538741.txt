I run a company that builds visual search engines and one of the sites I build and develop is a colour search engine for lipsticks. One of the main ways people discover it is through Google searches so I was studying which sites rank highest for queries like &quot;nyx budapest lipstick dupes&quot; etc. So yeah, for sure, queries for stuff that lends itself well to visual curation will be full of Pinterest results unlike stuff about Greek philosophy.')
