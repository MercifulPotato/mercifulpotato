That&#x27;s <i>just</i> apps on Google Play — not counting other forms of media, Pixel sales, Android licenses (they can always re-license if it&#x27;s too permissive), etc.<p>Do you have a source for that $10b figure? I imagine some specific part related to the suit has made much over its lifetime. It seems like Google&#x27;s Android business as a whole has made much more.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensortower.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;app-revenue-and-downloads-2019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensortower.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;app-revenue-and-downloads-2019</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensortower.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sensortower.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-20...</a>')
