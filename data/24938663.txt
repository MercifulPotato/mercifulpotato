Because of atomism.<p>The &quot;golden age&quot; argument is flawed. No one seriously argues that literally everything was better in the past. Rather, the criticism is that it&#x27;s absurd to have gotten rid of something positive we already had, only to replace it with something worse and gain no net benefit as a result.<p>It&#x27;s all a matter of interconnected systems, including systems like social shaming. If it&#x27;s unacceptable socially to not have a family, you&#x27;ll have one. If it&#x27;s unacceptable for women to work and compete with men for wealth and power, men will make enough to support their entire families, allowing at least one parent to always be there to raise children properly, instead of outsourcing that to strangers -- same for elderly care.<p>At the end of the day, atomism harms everyone and everything.')
