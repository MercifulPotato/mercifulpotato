If they genuinely were &quot;really really concerned&quot; about the potential side effects then they would have done some research on what those effects could be, what scientists had done to account for them etc. If they have done no research, that is lazy, hence worthy of a downvote. If they have done research but not specified so then it is deceptive and worthy of a downvote.')
