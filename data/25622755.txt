Stack Exchange retroactively &quot;changed&quot; the licence from CC-BY-SA 2.5 to 3.0 in 2011,[1] and from 3.0 to 4.0 in 2018,[2] without getting permission from the people who own the rights. So the code actually remains under the original licence.<p>If the code is used verbatim, it must be released under the same version of the CC-BY-SA licence (unless permitted by the copyright holder), but adapting it would let you put the new work under a later version.[3] But there is also a jurisdiction-dependent question of what constitutes an adaptation, and how much of the larger codebase could be considered an adaptation of the CC&#x27;d work (and would therefore be covered by the same licence).[4]<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;74867&#x2F;should-stack-exchange-switch-to-cc-by-sa-3-0&#x2F;95033#95033" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;74867&#x2F;should-stack-...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;333089&#x2F;stack-exchange-and-stack-overflow-have-moved-to-cc-by-sa-4-0&#x2F;333094#333094" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;333089&#x2F;stack-exchan...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;7430&#x2F;can-i-upgrade-the-version-of-cc-by-sa-from-3-0-to-4-0-in-my-modification&#x2F;7431#7431" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;7430&#x2F;can-i-up...</a><p>4. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;index.php?title=ShareAlike_interpretation&amp;oldid=100807#Examples" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;index.php?title=ShareAlike_...</a>')
