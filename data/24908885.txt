The Tiananmen Square example is better than the messier one in the article because it&#x27;s a clear case of a government leveraging its power to cover up its own abuse.<p>The distinction I was trying to make is about the company being based in a non-democratic country. In the west companies are choosing to appease the CCP for their own self-interest and access to the Chinese market (which is wrong), but companies operating out of China are forced to comply if they want to exist at all.<p>It&#x27;s not possible for Chinese companies to exist and make the right choice, so they&#x27;re going to make the wrong choice (and we&#x27;d be better off avoiding them entirely).<p>The distinction is between the governments and how they operate which makes the pressure on the companies different. It&#x27;s not to excuse western companies from making similarly bad concessions.<p>In the end dragonfly was abandoned by Google.<p>Zoom can never choose to ignore the CCP&#x27;s censorship requests and remain a company while continuing to operate with the majority of its devs in China.<p>Zoom knows this and doesn&#x27;t care.')
