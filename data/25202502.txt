I&#x27;m not super well versed on the pro&#x27;s &amp; cons of each. A lot of soldering irons use a resistive heating element. Dump current in, get heat. Higher end soldering irons tend to use high frequency inductive heating. Hakko has a write up here[1].<p>Agreed that for a switching supply, PPS isn&#x27;t going to help a lot. For a resistive soldering iron, a PPS capable USB power source would be very helpful. All that&#x27;s needed is a control loop, to monitor temperature &amp; adjust the asked for input voltage and&#x2F;or current.<p>Honestly not sure what the Pinecil or the well known TS100 soldering iron are, resistive or RF inductive. It&#x27;d be great if they were RF inductive heating, &amp; PPS wasn&#x27;t helpful, as the much finer control would be great. I hadn&#x27;t considered that they could be.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hakko.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;products&#x2F;hakko_fx100.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hakko.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;products&#x2F;hakko_fx100.html</a>')
