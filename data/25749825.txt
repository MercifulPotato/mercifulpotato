That is so alien to me; I click Suspend, so each day everything is exactly how it needs to be to continue working, including terminal output, running processes, open windows and their state, etc. This saves me time, and jump-starts my brain by basically loading in the swapped-out mental context I was in yesterday instead of reinitializing the same mental state from scratch.')
