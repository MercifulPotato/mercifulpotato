I felt the same way living in the US (minus the kids). Now having moved back, I realize that the problem was not entirely the US, most of it was my own attitude. I won&#x27;t claim that every country is equal, but there are often good and bad things about most countries, and I haven&#x27;t seen a perfect one yet. Being an expat in a country though you will notice every little flaw, or anything that&#x27;s different from what you&#x27;re used to. Things that annoyed me disproportionatly included paying rent with paper checks and the look and density of US cities. There were a million things like that, along with more serious issues like politics and healthcare. Meanwhile you are partially (sometimes completely) blind to the problems of your home country.<p>Try to be cognizant of this and try not to be bitter, it&#x27;s not worth it.')
