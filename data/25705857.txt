Just because <i>Twitter</i> is able to act quickly outside the confines of the legal system doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re descending into tech tyranny.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t want to hear another word about &quot;leftist violence&quot; or &quot;the radical left&quot; now that the right has unapologetically lined up behind the man who fomented a coup attempt.')
