It&#x27;s both reminder and a warning to keep one&#x27;s nose clean during this heightened political tension.<p>It&#x27;s easy to be partisan here and one is reminded to be careful to not overstep the mark.<p>The obvious issue is that AR could be used to circumvent or bypass social media bans etc and that forms of obfuscation could be used to do so.<p>In the past, it&#x27;s not gone unnoticed that AR equipment and bands have been used for nefarious purposes principally by non-licensed interlopers, so the message subtext is for licensed operators to be on the lookout, etc.')
