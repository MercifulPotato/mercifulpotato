It was so easy to visually design a GUI and slap some code into it.<p>That said, as a &quot;professional programmer&quot; I once had to maintain such a VB6 application that was developed by someone that wasn&#x27;t a professional programmer and that application was absolutely business critical for that company.<p>It wasn&#x27;t fun to put it mildly. So my take on this is that it probably died for a reason.')
