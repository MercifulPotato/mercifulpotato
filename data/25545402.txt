My point that macs (and apple) are a hostile environment for free software still stands. By the way, GPL is not a fringe license no one cares about as you kind of hint at, but it is one of the largest licenses out there and a lot of people like its terms.<p>Moreover, you didn&#x27;t even address the point that Apple makes it increasingly difficult (and sometimes even impossible) to distribute code for their platform without the use of their proprietary SDK. That, of course, is an artificial requirement by Apple, yet again signiling that they are not friendly towards free softwre.<p>Note that, a hostile environment for free software does not mean that there is no free software or that free software is impossible. If that was the case, I would&#x27;ve used that wording. It&#x27;s hostile because it makes it harder for free software to exist and because it does not integrate&#x2F;cooperate well with free software.')
