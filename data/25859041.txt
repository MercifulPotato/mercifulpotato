It&#x27;s impossible to become an intergalatic type 2 civilization using physics in the 3D.<p>Much like the fish in the koi pond can only move on a 2D plane, they wouldn&#x27;t find us any more or less interesting. To us it looks like they are moving super fast (tic tac video via USN) or teleporting (common UFO sighting characteristic) but all they are doing is exploiting the dimensions beyond the 3D.<p>I follow the stoned ape theory in that fungi, one of the oldest compound on earth, specifically the psilocybe variety that has a unique chemical formulation that can&#x27;t be found anywhere else on earth except recently similar chemistry was discovered on the Venus atmosphere (as proof of life) as a form of &quot;self replication&quot; software that increases visual acuity, formation of concepts and language in those that ingest it.<p><pre><code>    Psilocybin is the only 4-phosphorylated indole on this planet.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m thinking they might check on the apes that consumed their biological software and see how far they progressed with the same amusement (?) or banality that one would express towards fish tank.<p>Perhaps they like to show off their technology like dangling a carrot in front of us. &quot;You are getting close yet still far, keep going, and one day you can be just like us!&quot;')
