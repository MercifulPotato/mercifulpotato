It&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;re trying to make the point that Facebook is a platform for mostly benign things which as an ancillary has functionality that can be used by extremists, while Parler is specifically a platform built for extremists.  You&#x27;re doing a pretty bad job of trying to make that point by over-focusing on a bad analogy.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s actually accurate.  I think it&#x27;s strongly debatable as to whether or not Facebook ever had any positive intents as a platform.  Arguably, Facebook started as a way for predatory men on college campuses to stalk attractive women and comment on their bodies, which I&#x27;d be hard pressed to classify as a positive intent.  Developing from that, Facebook has taken as many actions as possible to drive user engagement, including actively spying on their users to do so.  Not only is the spying itself user-hostile, but the actions taken to drive user engagement seem to greatly emphasize and create rage, lust, fear, and other negative emotions in their user base.  I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to classify any of this as positive intent.<p>I think you&#x27;ll have a difficult time, regardless of the analogy you try to shoe-horn into place, arguing that Facebook suffers from unintended consequences when their ragebaiting mechanisms lead to political extremism and violence, and that Parler was intending that a platform designed for free speech resulted in extremism.  Probably the best argument in your favor would be to focus on Parler&#x27;s genesis story, which seems to strongly indicate that it too was not formed for positive intents.  I think a mostly honest take is that both platforms are negative in both their intentions and their outcomes and are directly toxic for a functioning democratic society.  The only real difference between Parler and Facebook is that Facebook is socially entrenched and has a massive global user base and the revenue&#x2F;wealth that comes from that, and Parler doesn&#x27;t.')
