It requires expertise in everything from physical construction to thermal engineering to networking. It requires significant amounts of capital. It takes months to years to complete.<p>Sure, many organizations have the resources and expertise to do this. But MANY more people just want to put up a web page or crunch some data. Using the cloud allows you to try things faster and with lower risk.<p>Obviously you can save money in the long run by investing in vertical integration al the way down to the physical data center, but ONLY if you have access to the capital and you have enough demand to keep the utilization up. Oh and you have to have the management capability to handle all those contracts, recruit and manage all the relevant people, etc.')
