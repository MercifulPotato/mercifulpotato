It&#x27;s pretty common for banks, basically the rule for European banks. I&#x27;m still not convinced the numbers are &quot;real&quot; though. As I understand it, there are a few main arguments as to why &quot;buy and strip&quot; price arbitrage doesnt happen, and I&#x27;m not sure which is&#x2F;are true:<p>- Regulatory barriers. JPM or Apple can&#x27;t just buy Deutsche Bank because lawmakers won&#x27;t allow it.<p>- They&#x27;re too big to be bought out out by (European?) private equity, or controlling stakes aren&#x27;t available.<p>- That&#x27;s not real book value. Try to wind it down and it&#x27;ll evaporate.<p>Maybe there are more. I understand that dividends and buybacks are currently limited by regulators in Europe, and that closes one valve for the price arbitrage, but still...')
