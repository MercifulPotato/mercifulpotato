They gave us software that was connected to them. We could request a shipping label and provide an address.  This makes it trackable.  We print out the label and put it on the box of the computer we were to build before shipping.  Sometimes we had to wait on hard drives or CPU’s because we were out.  Then we would qa it for 24 hours before putting the sticker on the box and giving it to ups at 5:15. A week your label was traceable but in reality it wasn’t going anywhere.  Once ups picked it up you had regular updates.<p>I recently went to work for a drop ship company and ups and fedex labels still have a preship phase. This company we had labels printed while we waited for merch to arrive 3 weeks later!')
