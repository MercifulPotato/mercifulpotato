I feel like a lot of these ideas around speech are ones that came from people who were used to arguing with other intelligent people. When the unwashed masses are involved, rational argument doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Some people understand this, which is why people like Trump can get elected. It wasn&#x27;t as if there was a failure of making rational arguments to counter him.  The average person just does not care&#x2F;understand what a rational argument is.<p>I offer no solutions here, sorry.')
