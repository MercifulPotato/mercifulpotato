Were Lenin&#x2F;Stalin&#x2F;Trotsky et al. oligarchs?  Some politicians, in the USSR then in Russia, get rich this way, indeed, but are they the ultra-rich, and do they own a large fraction of the total wealth?  I doubt so.<p>Same for China: Mao and his followers weren&#x27;t rich, and AFAIK rich Chinese are indigent compared to Emperors and their family&#x2F;suit, and not very politically powerful.<p>Juntas were composed of high-ranking military, who AFAIK weren&#x27;t rich (most came from the middle-class) nor became so.<p>Tribalism isn&#x27;t oligarchic.<p>The recent pertinent exception are banksters, however their power (albeit non-neglectable) seems rather limited and focused on some Western nations (the &#x27;Old Core&#x27;).')
