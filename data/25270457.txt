I&#x27;ve run into far too many startups that went to firebase because they wanted to scale fast and didn&#x27;t realize how limited firebase was for queries.<p>If you&#x27;re starting a startup, use postgres for your database. it will handle damn near anything and you can spawn off functionality into microservices as they become bottle necks as you scale.<p>Hell, postgres lets you write database extensions that perform novel behavior. I saw one the other day that automatically syncs data to elastic search. Wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to envision having writes to certain tables sync to firebase if you need subscriptions on records for certain parts of your app.')
