For example, custom pricing is one form of discrimination - offering a discount for students or senior peole is certainly discrimination, but we generally consider that it&#x27;s entirely appropriate.<p>And in certain cases a <i>lack</i> of discrimination would be completely immoral - for example, the concept of &quot;reasonable accomodations&quot; is a requirement for discrimination; for example, a policy that forbids electronic devices in an exam does not discriminate in any way and applies equally to anyone (in colloquial language one might call it a &quot;discriminatory policy&quot; but that&#x27;s wrong; perhaps I&#x27;m nitpicking on that but it a misuse of words to mean their exact opposite), but as it forbids hearing aids for people who need them, then that non-discrimination is bad; and also simply equally allowing all devices would be bad for other reasons, so ADA and equivalent laws require to discriminate and apply different rules to people with different abilities.<p>So if you see a practice that seems definitely bad and harmful, then &quot;is it discrimination?&quot; is the wrong question to ask, since it&#x27;s very likely that it may be harmful but not discrimination, or it may be discrimination but nothing wrong with it; these aren&#x27;t edge cases, the overlap is just partial. The proper question to ask is whether the criteria of the discrimination is fair (the up-thread issue of discriminating upon wealth certainly is debatable whether that should or should not be acceptable) and whether the results of that discrimination are appropriate.')
