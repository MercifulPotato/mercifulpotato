Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605038908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25047802, text='This is going to sound snarky, but isn&#x27;t: assuming you&#x27;re within the normal parameters of an HN commenter --- even a very successful one --- neither General Catalyst nor Bessemer wants your money.<p>Top tier VC firms aren&#x27;t like Vanguard. They are choosy about their LPs --- that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re called LPs and not &quot;investors&quot;. They have an investing thesis, and they go sell it to university endowments and pension funds.<p>Those endowments and pension funds, in turn, have their own investment goals, and they are not as simple as a first-principles analysis on HN would suggest; in many cases, VC LPs are putting money into that asset class knowing that it&#x27;s going to underperform other asset classes.<p>So it&#x27;s a little cringey reading comments about how people here would choose not to invest with Bessemer based on how they handled a liquidation preference. They really don&#x27;t care what you think here; you and the partners at Bessemer aren&#x27;t even working from the same premises.<p>(A good, though very dated, source on this is the old Kaufmann report on VC as an asset class).')
