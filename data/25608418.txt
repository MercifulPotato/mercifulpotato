Like the analogy I gave elsewhere, it&#x27;s sort of like a hash function: doable to compute in one direction but seemingly impossible to invert. If that&#x27;s the case it&#x27;s be very difficult to create such a tree to prune because there&#x27;s no way to categorize the nodes. In other words, the depth of the tree would be 1 and the breadth would be ~10^500.')
