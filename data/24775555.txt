It must be an integer.<p>This worries me. If you&#x27;re debugging a macro, you have to remember to increment the version every time you change it, or your changes mysteriously don&#x27;t take effect. And you have to make sure your macros are clean and deterministic or you might bake things into the cache that don&#x27;t belong there.<p>&gt; The syntax tree of Python is available through the ast module.<p>That module can be annoying to work with because it doesn&#x27;t make stability guarantees. I&#x27;ve even had to deal with code that broke in a maintenance release (3.8.4) because of this change: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.python.org&#x2F;issue40870" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.python.org&#x2F;issue40870</a><p>I can&#x27;t think of any better alternatives, besides doing nothing. But it looks like it&#x27;ll be unusually easy to use wrong, not to be used lightly.')
