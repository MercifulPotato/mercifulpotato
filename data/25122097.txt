It does not prohibit use of copy control circumvention technology.  It prohibits use of <i>access control</i> circumvention technology.<p>Don&#x27;t take my word for it.  Read what is published by the Copyright Office about Section 1201.<p>&quot;As envisioned by Congress, section 1201 seeks to balance the interests of copyright owners and users, including the personal interests of consumers, in the digital environment. It does so by protecting the use of technological measures (also called technological protection measures or TPMs) used by copyright owners to prevent unauthorized access to or use of their works. Section 1201 contains three separate protections for TPMs. First, it prohibits circumvention of technological measures employed by or on behalf of copyright owners to protect access to their works (also known as access controls). Second, the statute prohibits trafficking in devices or services primarily designed to circumvent access controls. Finally, it prohibits trafficking in devices or services primarily designed to circumvent TPMs used to protect the copyright rights of the owner of a work (also known as copy controls). Copy controls protect against unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work once access has been lawfully obtained. Because title 17 already forbids copyright infringement, there is no corresponding ban on the act of circumventing a copy control.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;policy&#x2F;1201&#x2F;section-1201-full-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;policy&#x2F;1201&#x2F;section-1201-full-repo...</a>')
