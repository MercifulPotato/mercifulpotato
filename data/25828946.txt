I was just floored with how much JS was required for very simple things. I couldn&#x27;t help but think to myself, &quot;This whole thing could be a couple dozen lines in a JS file.&quot;<p>I am sure that some people really need these massive frameworks with build chains and universal rendering. I am just not one of them. I use JS for small logic here and there, mostly form validation and a bit of dynamic content. Most web software I know fits this description. I don&#x27;t know why, but web developers are <i>obsessed</i> with making their jobs seem more complex than it really is.
