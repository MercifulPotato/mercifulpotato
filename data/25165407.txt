At the time I left ~5 years ago, it was common for promotion rejections to be given the explanation &quot;the current thing that you&#x27;re working on hasn&#x27;t launched yet, so the promotion committee couldn&#x27;t properly assess your impact. If you successfully launch it, that would clearly demonstrate impact.&quot; If you were a shoo-in via your existing work (i.e. you were obviously underpromoted), then it wouldn&#x27;t matter as much. But since most people were trying to get promoted the instant they had a plausible case, it meant that a lot of people were focused on launching One Last Thing.<p>Since I left, I understand that they&#x27;ve revamped the promotions up to Senior such that managers that are familiar with your work consider your promotion instead of a random committee. I&#x27;m curious to hear whether that has affected the &quot;launch launch launch&quot; push for promotions under staff engineer. I know through my network that staff+ promotions can still be held up for this reason.')
