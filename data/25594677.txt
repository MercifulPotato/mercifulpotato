Item(by='doopy1', descendants=None, kids=[25598399], score=None, time=1609435375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590679, text='I can agree with you to some extent, but the conversation on taxing the wealthy seems like a red herring if it does nothing to solve any of the major problems we face, so let&#x27;s talk about both things at once instead of just posting tweets about how so-and-so&#x27;s wealth sky rockets during a pandemic. I think rather than saying I&#x27;ve changed the argument, I feel like the original argument omits half the story. Anyway, just my $0.02 - I do certainly believe that if we want to look at what&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot;, then the mega rich have an unfair tax advantage, but I think for the other 90% of us, we would see a greater benefit being taxed less than if the rich were taxed more, because the funds ultimately end up mis-managed. I guess I&#x27;m a little cynical.')
