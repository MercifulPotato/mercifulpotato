Both have a plugin ecosystem - my guess is that something close already exists.<p>Otherwise, Pelican source code is simple to understand and extend. If I were to implement this and if the data was static or changed only occasionally, I&#x27;d read my custom data source, add that data to the Jinja template variables and access them from Jinja HTML templates. For fast changing data, I agree with the export to JSON and render from Javascript approach already suggested.')
