See the last Stimlus where Republicans wanted to deal for doubling what was already the Largest government expenditure in US history, and the democrats would accept nothing less than 4x that plus several poison pills that had nothing at all do with the economic stimulus that was inside the so called &quot;hero&#x27;s act&quot;<p>The problem with the division we have now, is Republicans &#x2F; Libertarians and to some extend even Union&#x2F;Blue Dog Democrats have a VERY VERY VERY different view of what the proper role of the federal government to the new &quot;democratic socialist&quot; democrats that have seeming taken over the democrat party (the Bernie, Warren, AOC democrats)<p>When one side wants 0 new spending but will &quot;compromise&quot; and agree to 1.5 Trillion, and the other side will accept nothing less than 4 Trillion in new spending but a fundamental shift in all aspect of American governance,  I am not sure what kind of deal can be had there')
