If you search for something like “men’s shoes” there’s 0% chance you’re getting a search result, it’s going to be a curated result page. Lots of people work on this hand tuning, but they’re not engineers, they’re product and marketing people.<p>If you search for “men’s shoes with green laces” you’ll see the real challenge, with a top 10 search result that’s not even shoes (it’s a pack of laces).')
