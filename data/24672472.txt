It all appears.. plausible?  Although I don’t see new testable predictions, it does look like his theory reconciles quantum mechanics and general relativity and ties it all up with a nice bow.  So, if I were a real physicist I think I’d be interested.  Maybe part of the problem here is that Wolfram has a reputation for being a jerk, and a bit self important.  I’ve spoken to people who saw him give a talk, and he evidently skipped all the other presentations, demanded a massive fee, and didn’t stick around for questions.')
