Just as it is desirable to steer the food culture to healthier diet, it seems desirable to steer the prestige culture to more useful marks of prestige, since just like food, what people find prestigious seems cultural. (e.g. teaching is prestigious in East Asia, and it may be better if other cultures also find teaching prestigious.)')
