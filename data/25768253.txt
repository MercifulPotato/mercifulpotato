Google photos and iPhoto make a little more sense as products when you consider that these are really about viewing the photos you took on your Apple&#x2F;google device and providing native sync from their camera app. I’m not sure what Dropbox’s long term competitive advantage could be in the space from a corporate strategy perspective.')
