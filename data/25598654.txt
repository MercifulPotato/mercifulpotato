It&#x27;s easy to pervasively debunk flat eartherism, or anti-vax conspiracies.  Yet those ideas continue to be pervasive in particular subpopulations.<p>When people want to hold a view, out-sciencing them won&#x27;t work.<p>Ultimately<p>&gt; Will use a smidgeon of an expert&#x27;s time and help a lot of people.<p>Yes, if you have to spend all your time responding to cranks, you&#x27;ll have no time to be productive, and you&#x27;ll embolden the cranks. Bullshit is produce to spew than to refute, so trying to counter bullshit with intellectual honesty is a loosing proposition. At some point you have to set a bar for bullshit, and ignore anything below the bar. The bullshit-artists call that &quot;censorship&quot;, because at that point they&#x27;ve lost and the only way they can continue to spew bullshit is to find popular support with contrarians or free-speech absolutists who don&#x27;t actually have a deep knowledge or care about scientific discourse.')
