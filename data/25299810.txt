My experience is that they hire people they already know. In fact that&#x27;s how I got hired at a FAANG company. I had applied there many times and been rejected. Then I saw that a team where I was a great fit had hired someone I knew and had an opening. So rather than submit my resume through their job board, I sent it to him and he passed it on to the hiring manager. Most of the rest of the team got hired because they were all a team at another company that got cut. One of them got an interview and said, &quot;Hey, I have about 20 coworkers who just lost their jobs and already know all the stuff you need for that new product you want to write. Why not hire them all?&quot; And they did.<p>Sure, there are a few who went through the regular recruiting path. But many did not. I&#x27;d say on my team, most did not. (And they&#x27;re all good engineers, too.)')
