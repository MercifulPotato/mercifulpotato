They pay me a salary with some benefits and some vacation time and bill be out to clients.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a cultural thing why we don&#x27;t use it. Working hard and making big money is the dream. I&#x27;m not saying my company forces me to not take the vacation time. Heck they try to tell us all to use it more! (PTO is a liability on the books, FYI). But culturally, it&#x27;s just not a priority (as in our countries culture, not the company itself). I realize it makes no sense. I need to make it more of a priority. My original point is my friends who are ex-pats on the EU seem to have a culture of using that time being more important than working.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m being down voted. I&#x27;m mostly sharing what I see and feel. Your milage definitely may vary and I hope it does!')
