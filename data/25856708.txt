For that I use a Canon 5D MK III, with a MK II as a backup in case the main camera dies.<p>When I was looking around, years ago, at buying a DSLR there were a few options.  Canon &amp; Nikon were the obvious ones, along with Sony (who bought Minolta) and a few others.   I went to a store and held them all - in the end the Canon felt most comfortable for my (smallish) hands.<p>I started out with a Canon Rebel, but you&#x27;ll soon discover that when you buy a few lenses you get &quot;locked in&quot;.  When I&#x27;d spent Â£750+ on lens and wanted a better body it made no sense to switch to a Sony, Nikon, or other brand.  So I bought the next body up, gradually getting to where I am today.<p>If you stick with the standard&#x2F;stock&#x2F;&quot;free&quot; lens you can switch around freely.  But if you spend a few thousand over a few years you&#x27;re almost never going to switch brand.   Selling used lenses is pretty easy, and they mostly hold their value.  But even so you need to be somewhat aware of the possible choices you&#x27;re restricting yourself towards.')
