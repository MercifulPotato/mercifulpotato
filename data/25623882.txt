I figure almost everyone would shift all their focus on doing things that &quot;really matter&quot;.<p>But if you are going to try and do things that &quot;really matter&quot; don&#x27;t you want to be productive at them?<p>I&#x27;ve seen a number of folks with ALS who have done amazing things with the time they had left, and I am sure they focused on their productivity in doing them.<p>This also isn&#x27;t a hypothetical for me. I have a damaged spinal cord and have spent amazing amounts of time tracking data to try and improve my body and my life. Not the same as facing death since I am trying to optimize my time to get back to a point where my body is stronger and in less pain so I can spend more time with my kids and also do the other things I want. It is a very tough balance.')
