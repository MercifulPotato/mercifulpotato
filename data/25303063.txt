(Also the only one who wanted to live in Seattle -- which might as well have been Siberia to them.) So they shipped me up there and gave me a team. It was like somewhere, deep down, they knew it was a good idea, but each person could forcefully argue why it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> -- so that it didn&#x27;t have to be them.<p>It was great! Well, other than encountering more of the famously toxic culture, where people get promoted for being smart but nasty. But I&#x27;m sure that little problem has been solved.')
