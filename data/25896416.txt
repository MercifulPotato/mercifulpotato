Downtown &#x2F; City Centre) are effectively ghost towns, with tenants leaving the city, while still paying rent, and rated rental prices dropping by  25%. The general sentiment seems to be that no-one is interested in being forced into close proximity in home &amp; work situations like you&#x27;d find on public transport and apartment blocks. So free standing houses, townhouses with separate entrances are at a massive premium.<p>From friends and family in New Zealand, it&#x27;s hard to tell, because the already over-priced and rising market is reaching utterly insane levels, potentially (disclaimer: anecdotal based speculation here) driven by New Zealanders returning home from overseas from countries that are now seen as unsafe.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abs.gov.au&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;economy&#x2F;price-indexes-and-inflation&#x2F;residential-property-price-indexes-eight-capital-cities&#x2F;latest-release" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abs.gov.au&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;economy&#x2F;price-indexes-and-...</a> - Graph: &quot;Residential property prices, quarterly percentage change, September quarter 2020&quot;')
