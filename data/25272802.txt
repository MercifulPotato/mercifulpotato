Governments only have power to the extent that citizens agree to abide by the government&#x27;s laws. If enough citizens get fed up with the laws, they stop abiding by them. Sometimes it&#x27;s open revolution, as happened for instance in the United States in the late 1700s. Sometimes it&#x27;s just selective noncompliance when people know a law is unenforceable, as for instance the way most Americans today treat speed limits and many other traffic laws.<p>A more difficult situation is when a society at large is split between two very different views of what kinds of laws are good social policy. IMO, in such cases <i>neither</i> side should have the power to get their preferred laws passed; laws affecting entire societies should only be passed when there is a broad consensus that they are good laws, or at least acceptable.')
