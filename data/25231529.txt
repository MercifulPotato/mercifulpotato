We have good universities, but the best one is in economics. The whole city works around Airbus. When they aren&#x27;t doing well the whole city is doing terribly. Most software engineers here work for subcontracting companies that are heavily linked to the aerospace business. Finding different lines of work recently have been really hard due to those subcontracting companies looking for new contracts outside of the space. Unless there&#x27;s a solid political decision to implement more research facilities outside of the aerospace industry then other companies will start coming. But for now compared to places in the region such as Montpellier I find we&#x27;re really behind other cities.')
