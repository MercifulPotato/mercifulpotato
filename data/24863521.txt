Item(by='approxim8ion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603402357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24863212, text='I&#x27;ll give you two reasons I use it over Bitwarden.<p>Bitwarden autotype is very sketchy on my (admittedly older) Android phone. For some apps it straight up doesn&#x27;t show up, on others the prompt disappears when I need it. The alternative is to use the system clipboard which is absolutely terrible and no one should ever do it, especially on smartphones. The special keyboard option that KeepassDX and Keepass2Android provide are significantly better without being too inconvenient in my opinion. Whether or not the autotype issue is fixed on newer Android versions is irrelevant, I shouldn&#x27;t have to switch out a perfectly working phone just for a workflow I can live without.<p>Also Keepass has been a standard for so long that I just trust it more. If tomorrow Bitwarden were to disappear off the face of the planet (I&#x27;m aware it doesn&#x27;t work that way), I&#x27;d have to export my passwords and look for another solution. This is probably mitigated by self-hosting but I have neither the infrastructure nor the inclination to do so. I can theoretically at least continue to use my kdbx file on any platform without issue, sticking to a particular version of a client that I like or switching it out for another if I&#x27;m so inclined. No hijinks involved.<p>I will concede that the sync is not as convenient but I use Syncthing and Snapdrop for a bunch of other stuff already so I don&#x27;t mind, not to mention the fact that I feel better about my vault never being exposed to the internet in any form.')
