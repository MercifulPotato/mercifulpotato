Since then I have a Nokia 3310 new model, with Facebook installed. However the wi-fi is turned on around 10 minutes per month, in best case.<p>What I&#x27;ve immediately observed after switching to the new phone that I&#x27;m receiving more precisely targeted ads. Before, on smartphone no adds were relevant, after the smartphone new adds were all relevant.<p>My guess was the phone &#x2F; the cellular service company is listening me all the time, not just when talking on the phone.<p>To test it we&#x27;ve started playing games. Sitting with friends, we&#x27;ve used a predefined brand name very often in a conversation. Next day I&#x27;ve got the ads on the social media, on my laptop, I have no other internet device.<p>What I&#x27;m doing now? Not using the phone at all. Which means 1-2 daily quick conversation to set up places to meet. For long conversations I use email or messengers.<p>How do I feel? It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;m not paranoid. I know we are all sold since the blogging era begun. Right now what I can do is to make the lives who exploit data harder in this particular case.<p>Edit: My phone is Nokia 8110 4G, with KaiOs.')
