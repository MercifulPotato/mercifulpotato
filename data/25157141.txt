I&#x27;m now trying to install both versions of brew and spin up terminal sessions accordingly.<p>Are these &#x27;good practices&#x27; for Arm Macs?:<p>1) When spinning up an iTerm session, figure out if it&#x27;s &#x27;Darwin x86_64&#x27; or &#x27;Darwin arm64&#x27; - and configure paths accordingly. so they use the right brew binaries.<p>2) Easily double check what version of a running package&#x2F;keg based on what arch is displayed in Activity Monitor.<p>3) That way, you can just use brew with Rosetta to start (which I did) then build up native arm Brew over time. and let the Rosetta brew fall away.')
