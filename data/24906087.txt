There are subscriptions with guaranteed performance, but at a different price.<p>My home Internet connections are 1 Gbps and 300 Mbps (2 links from 2 providers, I work from home and I need the uptime) for less than $10 each, but the transfer speeds are close to these numbers only for local servers, getting out of the country is about half these speeds.')
