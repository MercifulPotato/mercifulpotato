Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25211605], score=None, time=1606321390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209353, text='I&#x27;ve never had a non-eInk Kindle, so maybe it is different for them, but I&#x27;ve had eInk Kindles both with and without ads. My first was without ads. Since you can add the &quot;without ads&quot; option to a &quot;with ads&quot; Kindle later by paying the difference, I bought my second with ads to see how bad it was.<p>Here are the only differences I&#x27;ve noticed:<p>• With ads, the sleep screen displays some artwork from a book Amazon is selling [1] and some text suggesting you come to the store and buy books,<p>• The home screen has an ad at the bottom.<p>Since when I&#x27;m not using the Kindle the sleep screen is hidden behind the cover, and when I am using it I&#x27;m somewhere other than the home screen 99.9% of the time, I never saw any reason to add the &quot;without ads&quot; option, and when it was time to replace that Kindle I again went with ads.<p>I suspect that the vast majority of people that buy the &quot;no ads&quot; option up front do so because when they see &quot;with ads&quot; they are envisioning a web-like experience where the ads are all over the place and intrusive and animated and distracting.<p>[1] Usually a romance novel for me, even though I&#x27;ve never bought any romance novels from Amazon, nor anything even remotely like a romance novel. In fact, I don&#x27;t think any book I&#x27;ve bought from them even had any romantic relations between any of its characters.')
