Rust 1.51 will be easy, given that &quot;const generics&quot; is a huge headline feature almost every Rust user will care about, but for features that are full of tiny things, it&#x27;s just way way less clear.<p>This has the funny effect of posts getting harder to write as time goes on; we have less releases with big, important features, and more releases with &quot;tons of bugfixes and some minor improvements.&quot;')
