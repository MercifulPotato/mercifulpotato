I suspect that the lower average figures have more to do with ISPs offering lower prices for a 40Mbps capped service (which does seem to have been quite common as FTTC has spread) and with some ISPs using much higher contention levels than others.<p>In any case, even if 34Mbps is the real world average download speed for the type of fibre connection most homes would be using today, that&#x27;s still much higher than the figures in the article would have suggested for a typical UK home Internet connection speed.')
