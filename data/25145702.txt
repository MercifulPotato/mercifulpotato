The rule that precludes your hypothesis is much simpler: the laws of physics don&#x27;t change with time. That doesn&#x27;t require the laws of physics to be &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;elegant&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t require anyone&#x27;s subjective judgment about which laws of physics they think are more beautiful.')
