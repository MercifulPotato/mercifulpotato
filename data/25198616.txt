However, there is a huge qualitative difference here, illustrated even by your example of quarantine recommendations.<p>If we approximate an answer to &quot;What is the optimal quarantine strategy?&quot; through the combined efforts of various sciences--statistics, biology, etc--then while the results are not guaranteed, the recommendation is certainly not unfounded. It may be incomplete, but it is built off of decades of empirical evidence.<p>Conversely, outright ignoring recommendations about COVID or climate or something similar, simply because &quot;science isn&#x27;t always right&quot; or because you &quot;aren&#x27;t a scientist&quot; is a different thing altogether.')
