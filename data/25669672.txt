You can always go a level deeper. Great engineers know all of the tools at their disposal and will bend the computer to their will if they need to.</i><p>I&#x27;ve worked with some people who definitely seemed like &quot;masters&quot;, and this was true of all of them. Quiet patience and an unshakeable belief that this thing is going to be fixable, even after trying multiple things that have gone nowhere. And they&#x27;re almost always proved right.<p>It also made me realise I need to get out of this business as soon as possible, because I&#x27;m the polar opposite. After a few failed attempts my brain goes into panic mode and the problem seems insurmountable. Then I &quot;wake up&quot; an hour later after a bout of procrastination, no closer to a solution.<p>I often wonder about the chicken and egg of how people attain this state. Are they first and foremost technically brilliant, and the confidence emerges from that? Or is it more of a personality type that has allowed them to solve lots of problems and become technically brilliant along the way?')
