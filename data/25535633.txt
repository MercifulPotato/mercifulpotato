I just assume that&#x27;s going to be a PITA everytime I want to find something because I have to filter out all the companies&#x2F;people I don&#x27;t want to work for and mostly because of the time it takes.<p>&gt; And TripleByte&#x27;s model is also to let you skip stages of the interview process IIRC, which is appealing no matter how much experience you have.<p>With companies who are interested in using their service (after you have already scanned, uploaded oneself and jumped through all the services hoops and agreed to be at the whim of whatever they decide to do with said data now and forever more into the future) and who have not yet run into the problems (i.e. incentivizing people gaming the system) that the person I originally responded to has run into and that many corps have run into with similar services in the past.<p>The part I want to skip is the part where a corp ignores the content of what I sent and sends a TripleByte link mixed with some boiler plateâ€¦')
