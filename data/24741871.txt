I had been using a 1960&#x27;s Fender Bassman and changed out the tubes to some Sovtek ones. Sound guy at one of the clubs (who&#x27;s had been around for 20+ years at that point and seen everything) noticed right away and asked why my amp sounded off. A little while later I bought one of the first Line 6 modeling amps and my first gig with it the same sound guy said &quot;Ahh, you put the old tubes back in&quot;. I&#x27;m like, &quot;Nope, totally different amp, and it&#x27;s all digital.&quot;. He didn&#x27;t believe me and while he was inspecting the amp kept saying &quot;No, no, no. There&#x27;s tubes in here I can <i>smell</i> them warming up&quot;.')
