On the other hand if the records of which voter number voted which way are printed on bits of paper and put in a big locked box it&#x27;s pretty hard to reconstruct that on the fly unnoticed. But they are there if there is a court ordered investigation.<p>The UK system I think is a bit like that. When I go in my name is checked against a voting slip number (on paper) and then I vote on a bit of paper so someone could theoretically figure which way I voted but the odds of someone going through both paper lists is minimal.')
