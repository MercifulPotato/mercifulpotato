AMP versions of sites aren&#x27;t just magicked out of thin air! Without &quot;valuable developer time&quot; there are no AMP sites.<p>I think the point you&#x27;re actually making is that without AMP forcing these sites to be faster, they would still be slow. Which I agree with. But as I said in my original post, Google ranking sites according to their performance would have the exact same effect as forcing AMP on people, except that it would let sites choose their own implementation rather than be strong-armed into one controlled by Google.')
