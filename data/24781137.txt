The problem is a lack of incentives.<p>Amazon offers 70% royalties to indie authors.<p>YouTube offers peanuts to indie film makers. Netflix offers nothing.<p>Film-making is more expensive than novel writing, and there is a higher barrier to entry. Few indie film-makers are going to stick with it, unpaid, for multiple years. If they can receive funding, then that whole paradigm will change.<p>Patreon made a few steps in that direction, but I think crowd-funding has limits.<p>If Google&#x2F;YouTube were to do what Amazon did, and offer a huge royalty share of profits...?  That would turn everything around.')
