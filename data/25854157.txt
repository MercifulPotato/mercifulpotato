And the same will happen soon to the California Central valley.<p>The American bison, an animal that once roamed in large herds that lifted enough dirt to darken the sky, is now almost extinct.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Bison_skull_pile_edit.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Bison_skull_pile_edit.jpg</a><p>From rivers and oceans full of fish where you could see fish jumping everywhere, to people eating mediocre farmed fish due to overfishing.<p>From a continent full of fertile land and biodiversity, to a place where topsoil will be almost impossible to find in 60 years.<p>From a country full of insects and birds, to a place completely devoid of them that will soon become a desert.<p>Native Americans were able to live sustainably for over 10,000 years here.<p>Next time you sit to have lunch, try to putting aside any ingredients made from Native American crops: tomato, potato, corn, squash, avocado, peppers, most species of berries, chocolate, etc. Then avoid preparing any recipes that do not have a strictly domestic origin.
