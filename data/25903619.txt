So I don&#x27;t notice any less attention -- it&#x27;s just a rest for the muscles in my right foot.<p>But really I&#x27;d definitely go with your own perception here -- if you feel like you&#x27;re paying less attention then it&#x27;s a good thing you&#x27;re not using it! Everyone&#x27;s attention habits and patterns are different. And I&#x27;m glad to know people vary in this.')
