How can the complexity be both relative and constant simultaneously?  Personally, I favor the former.  An operating system, for example, seems to me to dramatically lower total complexity since a few hundred (thousand?) people can maintain it. Meanwhile, without operating systems how many hundreds of thousands of people would it take to maintain our modern tech if we all had to work on bare metal?')
