Because it avoids the rebase? Many people do this anyway, early commit messages often need rewording. Because it maintains the separate state of the current working directory and the index? Is that it? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really a compelling enough reason to claim the author&#x27;s avoidance of stash is the wrong way to work.')
