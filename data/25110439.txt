What was the reason for this choice? Have you considered other languages, like Rust, Zig or similar instead of C++? TBH not sure what an alternative to Go would be, maybe JVM AOT-compiled with NativeImage (but AFAIK that&#x27;s still experimental).<p>Did Go&#x27;s GC and&#x2F;or C++&#x27;s lack of GC help&#x2F;impede the project? IMO memory management is one of the main differences between languages... the other is concurrency &#x2F; memory model &#x2F; undefined behavior, where JVM is significantly ahead of the rest (no undefined behavior), I&#x27;m not sure exactly where Go stands (there seems to be a memory model, but no mention of undefined behavior or lack thereof).')
