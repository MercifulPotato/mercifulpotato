Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25110050], score=None, time=1605377546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093235, text='&gt; People who don&#x27;t know much about suicide prevention think these are important points, but anyone who works in suicide prevention can tell you that observations don&#x27;t work;<p>You are being intentionally misleading here. I&#x27;m not saying that they could have or should have prevented the suicide, but the guards should have been there to monitor. The cameras should have been there to record&#x2F;document. It&#x27;s not the prevention I&#x27;m concerned about, it&#x27;s the convenient lack of documentation&#x2F;monitoring&#x2F;etc.<p>&gt; People kill themselves all the time, even when supposedly on 1:1 obs and in special wards.<p>But how many cases as important as epstein, where he was being monitored via guards and camera, and being watched for suicide have both the guards and cameras fail?<p>Arguably the most important inmate in US custody ( maybe in history ) and the guards are sleeping and the cameras are not working? Give me a break. Even the most naive person has to admit things aren&#x27;t kosher here.')
