Which is what happened.<p>It&#x27;s very doubtful that if they wanted to keep her, that they couldn&#x27;t have found terms.<p>Surely the manager would have bent, indicated the wording was a little bit strong, and found a way forward.<p>It seems clear they were wavering, she crossed a line and offered them the path out and they took it.<p>If there were material issues being covered up, there was material suppression of information, this story would look completely different - but there wasn&#x27;t.<p>This was the right thing to do by Google in a tricky situation.')
