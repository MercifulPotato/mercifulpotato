It is by far the worst and most dangerous part of my ride. They were put in place instead of the non-separated bike lane in the rest of downtown to preserve on-street parking.<p>On the majority of rides I am either dodging doors, dodging cars that are overtaking too close, or both. This entire stretch of road has a double yellow as well, which makes the overtaking even worse.<p>I got a Varia light&#x2F;radar from Garmin so I can at least know when people are approaching from the rear. I feel a lot safer but that’s probably not actually true unfortunately. I highly recommend the light&#x2F;radar combo because it is very helpful with overall awareness while riding.<p>I don’t know how this could be resolved because much of the street is residential with fairly small front yards and no driveways to speak of. So I’ll just have to do my best to stay safe and hope that drivers in my city get more accustomed to sharing the road.')
