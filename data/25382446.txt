Because YC&#x27;s first impression of hundreds (or thousands) of other founders has been wrong.<p>IIRC, YC has rarely rejected a company that would be valued at $1B+. Perhaps SendGrid is the only one.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just kind of pitiable that YC can&#x27;t do better than this.<p>I don&#x27;t believe any seed investor has a better rate of return than YC. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even close. Whatever you imagine as &quot;better&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; A huge improvement for a YC-like investment firm would be to do something more objective. Competent people do not hire employees on the basis of a first impression, they spend many hours assessing their skills, abilities, personality, etc.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s not wise to fund founders based on how companies hire employees. Companies hire for risk minimization, not return maximization - just look at your average tech interview.<p>I think you underestimate the value of culture fit when it comes to building successful businesses. I&#x27;m sorry it doesn&#x27;t fit into your framework of objective assessment.')
