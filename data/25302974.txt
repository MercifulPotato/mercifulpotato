Every org I have worked at that had separate pools there was widespread lying about being sick.<p>Nobody really asked or cared, so in effect they are the same thing. In practice lying was incentivized, and managers that didn&#x27;t want to be lied to just adopted the policy that your sick days were yours to take for any reason.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is something that should be legislated.
