Remember the browser wars? Web 2.0?<p>You&#x27;re &quot;remembering&quot; a pendulum that did not ever exist. The online services like AOL became web portals like...AOL and <i>really</i> only died out as social media sites like MySpace and later Facebook replaced them for the &quot;average&quot; user. There was no magical utopian era where Web 2.0 darlings dominated either in terms of users or raw traffic over portals or social media sites.<p>The non-existent pendulum isn&#x27;t swinging the other day. Outside of a few niches blogging is a ridiculous amount of SEO spam and content farms. While some podcasts seem to do well I sure come across a lot of dead ones. It certainly looks like a lot of &quot;podcasts&quot; are moving to YouTube and the like for better monetization if they didn&#x27;t just start as a YouTube channel.<p>Maybe blogs and podcasts will somehow find a way to thrive but right now it looks like they&#x27;re just trying to game algorithms rather than make good content. Since that&#x27;s how they get paid I can&#x27;t exactly fault bloggers or podcasters for doing it but it&#x27;s far from the Platonic ideal of either medium.')
