A system that says, &quot;we believe nothing&quot; or even, &quot;we believe nothing said by someone&#x27;s who&#x27;s ever lied&quot; is fine. What I don&#x27;t understand is how easily they do believe in stuff that is, at the very least, not more credible than the stuff they don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not their skepticism that perplexes me, but their credulity. They clearly have an epistemology that&#x27;s very different from the mainstream Western tradition (or any other, for that matter), and I&#x27;m curious to understand what it is.')
