In a month I&#x27;ve already put more hours into VRChat specifically than the total I&#x27;ve done with other things in VR. I&#x27;m not exactly sure of its mass appeal, but it&#x27;s definitely been the killer app for me and my friends.<p>I&#x27;ve become somewhat convinced that the killer features of VR are in how it works for social games. The ability to socialize in 3d space with regular body language present (your head and hands are positionally tracked) is great. The sense of presence from being in an all-encompassing scene in VR makes your mind feel more involved in social situations compared to a standard voice call. Having positional audio and the ability to see where other people are looking makes it easier to follow the flow of conversations. Groups can smoothly reform and break apart into multiple separate conversations just as easily as they can in real life meatspace gatherings, which is something that&#x27;s much less natural in voice calls.')
