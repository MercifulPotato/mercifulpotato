They claim that it makes sense to not test the use of security privileges in CI, and instead route &quot;reports&quot; to a separate security team, who will then somehow know whether this app should or should not be using the key. And then even block access when the app isn&#x27;t known to use the privileges. Shouldn&#x27;t this just be a declarative configuration alongside the app, and then allow the security team to audit which apps are given what privileges? That seems like an actual &quot;least privilege&quot; implementation. This seems more aligned with the first two Ways.')
