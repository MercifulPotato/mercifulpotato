Though I find it hard to believe, as I&#x27;ve seen examples of medical papers written from long-term post-vax surveillance. For instance this one from the WHO, finding that they could prevent the deaths of about 500,000 more young girls per year in Africa alone by using a different, more effective, measles vaccine: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4052142&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4052142&#x2F;</a><p>I particularly like that example as it shows what&#x27;s at stake: literally millions of lives are saved by vaccinations. Screwing up that with hasty approvals, and misleading the public about how much safety data we have, could lead to literally millions of additional deaths in the future if vaccination rates go down. Health authorities should be thinking about the long term, not just getting through the covid crisis.')
