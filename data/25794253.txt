I have read reports from therapists that they have clients from former communist countries who struggle with the lockdowns, because it reminds them or horrific things they experienced.<p>Those are probably not the people who compare themselves with Sophie Scholl on protests or something like that. They know the difference.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not that far fetched to think about totalitarian regimes murdering people in that context.<p>Really?
