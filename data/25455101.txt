The reporting seems to have so much lack of detail it’s weird. It’s all summaries of statements without sources.<p>I understand that Gebru may feel dehumanized but without seeing the email that she references, it’s hard for me to understand her statement. If the CEO of Google painted her as “an angry black woman” then that’s a really big deal. If she feels that way, then that’s not as unique to me as people frequently feel upset and about ways that are unique to them, but not interesting to me.<p>Similarly with the fire&#x2F;resign thing. These stories seem to all say “fire” even though that seems contested by Google for what happened. Without reading her actual ultimatum email then it’s hard for me to tell.<p>So it’s frustrating that what I want to know, these stories don’t cover. They are statements from Gebru that seem vague, easily substantiated, but not substantiated. So the articles seem to just focus on someone’s feelings.')
