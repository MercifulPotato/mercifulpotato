No censorship, no algorithms.<p>Facebook should <i>only</i> be allowed to show you a feed of all your friends&#x27; posts, in chronological order. Twitter should only show you the tweets of people that you&#x27;ve followed, in chronological order.<p>Aside from solving any potential censorship or manipulation problems, it would also make a much more pleasant user experience than the unnavigable garbage that is Facebook&#x27;s current product.')
