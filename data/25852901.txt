Apple is pretty straightforward: they support hardware until they don&#x27;t.  And they&#x27;re quite explicit about ending support and it&#x27;s almost always a major release.  You might be able to hack support after that, but I&#x27;ve literally never had it be a &quot;toss-up&quot; about when Apple was or wasn&#x27;t supporting their own hardware.<p>As for Windows... I&#x27;ve got a 10 year old 2600k based desktop that runs the latest version of windows flawlessly.  I guess if you go back 20? 30? 40? years you might find something that can&#x27;t run the latest version of windows, but you&#x27;re going to be down a really, REALLY obscure rabbit hole.  I can&#x27;t say I ever recall it being a coin toss, it was about 10 seconds on google of finding or not finding a driver.<p>Linux on the other hand... the support of hardware is awesome, but determining if something is or isn&#x27;t supported is generally an afternoon of reading mailing lists.')
