Item(by='jventura', descendants=None, kids=[25470549], score=None, time=1608315595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25469506, text='&gt; If I&#x27;m reading that right you taught 7 hour per day for 4 months? 16 weeks * 5 days a week * 7 hours = ~500 hours?<p>There were 6 professors. I taught ~75h of server-side web development..<p>&gt; I think the traditional style of teaching (large class, one teacher) isn&#x27;t very time efficient, so it makes me sad to see something like WGU dismissed solely because of the time spent.<p>Not that time spent == quality, but as in the examples I mentioned above, 15h for operating systems concepts (which I&#x27;ve been teaching for the last 3&#x2F;4 semesters) doesn&#x27;t teach you anything unless you already know most of it, and 9h30 for Math is only enough if you are reading a book (diagonally, that is)..<p>Again, the author&#x27;s effort is something that he should be proud, but I, personally, think that he hasn&#x27;t learn much things with enough quality..')
