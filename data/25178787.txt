Asymptomatic transmission being what it is (ie, real), you would expect to see high compliance with masks and social distancing correlate well with reduction in overall caseload.  That hypothesis was not investigated here, so this study contributes no information to it.<p>- the authors of the paper themselves conclude “We think you should wear a face mask at least to protect yourself, but you should also use it to protect others ... We consider that the conclusion is we should wear face masks.”<p>- if you want to see population statistics where community transmission is frankly rampant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;mm6947e2-H.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;mm6947e2-H.pdf</a> , <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32543923&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32543923&#x2F;</a>')
