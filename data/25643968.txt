That is, unless you can come up with a theory that had no free parameters.<p>These theories are fundamentally math models, and I don&#x27;t find it likely that we&#x27;ll determine that p = np by finding just the right np problem and exploring that on its own.<p>In the theory department, we&#x27;re fine with what we&#x27;ve got. What we&#x27;re missing is new experiements that can actually challenge our models. We&#x27;ve got a couple things to push on, sure { black hole singularities, dark matter, dark energy, wave function collapse, quantum gravity } but we don&#x27;t have the tools to manipulate and observe them like we do for electromagnetism or chromodynamics')
