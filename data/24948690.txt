You end up building almost double the amount of capacity that you actually use, because you need e.g. 100GW for the peak load in the evening but only 50GW for twelve hours overnight.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem likely to be cheaper than using storage for only the differential load in the evening. But once you have storage there isn&#x27;t any good reason not to use cheap solar for the daytime load differential, and to provide the energy to charge the storage for later in the day.')
