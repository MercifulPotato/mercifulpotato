That would imply a corresponding reduction in government spending, or else the government would have to increase the rate to account for the reduced land value.<p>Which is why people would be forced out of single family homes. The amount of government services required by the occupants of a twelve story building would have to be financed by a tax that collects the same money from the owner of a single family home. The latter would be forced out by that amount of tax.')
