Definitely not modern civilization -- as a general rule, if you don&#x27;t see massive differences between human populations in varying regions on a particular metric, you can assume that there hasn&#x27;t been any strong evolutionary pressure on that attribute in the last few hundred generations (e.g. height varies quite a bit, as does melanin concentration, implying fairly recent selection for those traits, while lifespan is pretty constant given similar access to healthcare, implying that there hasn&#x27;t been a significant difference in evolutionary pressure from region to region on lifespan).<p>Additionally, humans have a much longer lifespan than other mammals of similar size, implying that at there <i>was</i> strong evolutionary pressure for increased lifespan around the time humans diverged from other primates, and even a bit before that as other primates also live longer than most mammals their size.')
