Of course this somewhat hard to calculate on the VC side due to the lack of transparency and illiquidity of the market.<p>But in fact that author is going about this all wrong. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if VC outperforms. The point of VC or hedge funds or any other alternative investments isn&#x27;t to outperform the market on a risk adjusted basis (though that would be nice), but to provide a uncorrelated return stream.<p>When these uncorrelated or less correlated return streams is mixed into the standard market return stream, the risk adjusted return of the entire portfolio is enhanced. This is why you shouldn&#x27;t focus on the individual risk&#x2F;return profile of an asset or investment, but instead focus on the entire portfolio.<p>A great example of this somewhat counterintuitive statistical phenomenon is gold. Gold historically has had both high volatility and low returns. However, due to the low correlation to the market, mixing in gold to a SPY portfolio and performing a minimum variance optimization to determine the weights actually boosts the return&#x2F;risk profile.<p>If anyone is interested, I have a blog post about it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptm.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;alt.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptm.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;alt.html</a>')
