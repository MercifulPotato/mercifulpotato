Add 5 jugs of water with a gallon each and you end up with <i>almost</i> 5 gallons. You call that a measurement error, not a leaky abstraction. The jugs are wrong and the math is right. Play on words really, since you could as well say that the integers are a leaky abstraction that fails to take into account inexactness. Point is, people don&#x27;t tend to think of it that way.')
