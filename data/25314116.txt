So entanglement cannot &quot;propagate&quot; faster than the fastest possible &quot;mediator&quot; of an interaction, which is the speed of light.<p>The &quot;instantaneous&quot; aspect comes up in entanglement and measurement. Say you start off with an entangled pair of electrons A and B in your lab, and measure electron A. Measurement is an interaction, so you become entangled with the electron. By knowing the initial entangled state and your reading of electron A&#x27;s state, you can know stuff about the state of electron B at the time of the measurement, even if electron B has traveled a very long distance in the meantime.<p>I personally find this point of view nicer than assuming that I somehow collapsed electron A&#x27;s state and caused an instantaneous remote collapse of B&#x27;s state.')
