Otherwise, what&#x27;s the point? It simply won&#x27;t be able to compete.<p>For example, static sites should be included for free on top of Spaces. There&#x27;s no way this offering will be able to compete with Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase which all offer static sites for free with CDN. Vercel even includes 1TB of traffic per month, for free.')
