First off here in Germany I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not legally possible for authorities to request my voice commands randomly and due to GDPR I can delete all my recordings at any point, and turn off personalisation meaning they wouldn&#x27;t use my individual data.<p>Secondly I just don&#x27;t say anything in my home that&#x27;s super secret, I live in an apartment and I&#x27;m pretty sure the neighbours can hear me talking on my balcony, and I&#x27;m in voice chats most of the day these days due to covid which probably accidentally means more people listen in because I forget to press mute than some guy at Amazon.')
