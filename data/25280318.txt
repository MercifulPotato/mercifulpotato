However I do agree that that no one person can master all the domains of <i>what you can do with programming</i>.<p>But I would also say, while it&#x27;s probably impossible to really <i>master</i> more than a handful of domains in one lifetime, an awful lot of problems really can be reduced to inputs and outputs, and the more experience you get with solving diverse programming problems, the easier it is to penetrate some of these &quot;advanced&quot; sub-fields, at least at a superficial level, and solve a problem or two using tools from that domain.')
