African farmers were dismayed when their bumper crops were rotting in their fields because they couldn&#x27;t export the crops or even sell the excess locally [0].<p>Livestock farmers also saw this as well [1].<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine that people haven&#x27;t learned the value of having a robust local food supply chain, which is the one thing that I had hoped we had learned after the shortages and panic buying created during the 1st wave of COVID.<p>I agree that vertical farming has limitations, but it could be a useful adjunct to meet demand the typical soil based farming cannot deliver. Moreover, much like Holland&#x27;s greenhouse farming the chances are most of it will be exported in exchange for other goods. Also, remember Denmark has a limited growing season that could in theory help them plan for larger scale operations, which they can  partner with for Mars colonization as things develop in both sectors.<p>&gt;  I imagine it would work quite nicely in Iceland, with abundant energy and little (any?) arable land. Itâ€™s arguably better than mining Bitcoin with that energy.<p>Why not both? The excess heat from the mining could be used to have heated greenhouse&#x2F;nurseries while still utilizing the excess heat and energy. This was working rather well in Canada [2].<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allianceforscience.cornell.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;ghana-farmers-lose-money-as-covid-19-disrupts-key-export-markets&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allianceforscience.cornell.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;ghana-fa...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanguardngr.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;covid-19-has-ruined-pig-farming-%E2%80%95-farmer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanguardngr.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;covid-19-has-ruined-pig-...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inhabitat.com&#x2F;bitcoin-mining-powers-canadian-mans-innovative-aquaponics-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inhabitat.com&#x2F;bitcoin-mining-powers-canadian-mans-in...</a>')
