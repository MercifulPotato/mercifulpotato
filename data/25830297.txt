Their selection really sucks too, and while their prices are roughly competitive with the local grocery store, the lack of selection just kills it for me.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that FreshDirect[0] is much better than Amazon Fresh in terms of selection as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshdirect.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshdirect.com</a>')
