It&#x27;s true because it&#x27;s true, not because of who said it.<p>&gt; &quot;Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.&quot;<p>&quot;This statement is false.&quot; &quot;We had to destroy the village in order to save it.&quot;<p>Karl Popper was wrong, and here&#x27;s why.<p>Speech and actions are different. Society can tolerate any kind of speech, because they&#x27;re words. They don&#x27;t cause direct harm. And the indirect harm, i.e. violence or firing people or refusing to serve them as a result of their race or religion, can be prohibited, while still allowing the speech.')
