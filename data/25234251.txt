Item(by='peterwwillis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606526360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229291, text='I don&#x27;t give a shit about your company, because it&#x27;s <i>your</i> company. I don&#x27;t actually have a say in what&#x27;s going on. I can&#x27;t refuse to do what I&#x27;m told because I disagree with the direction of the company&#x27;s mission. I&#x27;d get fired.<p>I <i>might</i> give a shit about the mission, in as much as you can give a shit about the trite verbiage assigned to, in essense, the general thing that&#x27;s supposed to increase shareholder dividends. But the mission is very frequently lost in the minutia of doing one&#x27;s job. Does the mission relate to how I&#x27;m going to fill out this change management form? No; the change management process isn&#x27;t based on the mission, it&#x27;s based on its own thing. I give a shit about the change management process. If I only gave a shit about the mission, I might say, &quot;screw change management!&quot; And then I wouldn&#x27;t be very good at my job.<p>And &quot;giving a shit&quot; based on who&#x27;s interpretation? I can tell you that I give far too much of a shit about how my company works, and if I voiced this frequently, people would be absolutely sick of me. My manager sometimes reminds me - in the nicest terms - to calm the fuck down about the work. You don&#x27;t want the whole company filled with people like me, because they&#x27;d drive each other bonkers. A few of us are nice for variety, and to pop up occasionally and say, &quot;Hey, do we have a central place we can put all this documentation rather than a lot of independent places?&quot; And then calm the fuck  down and focus on just <i>writing the damn docs.</i><p>You should want people to care, in a healthy way, both about the thing they&#x27;re working on and the way in which they work on it. But you should never want them to be obsessed.<p>Obsession, n: <i>Compulsive preoccupation with a fixed idea or an unwanted feeling or emotion, often accompanied by symptoms of anxiety.</i><p>If you want this for your employees, you need to get a grip and re-evaluate life.')
