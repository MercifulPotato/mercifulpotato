Its ok. Miss some of the collaboration sometimes. Have a local groups of guys I share contracts with so we can pool skills. So that helps.<p>Smaller midwestern city is a plus - lots of amenities while still very navigable and understandable. Went to my 2nd-favorite Indian place for lunch today (2st-favorite is in next city over, 20 miles). Post-pandemic I&#x27;ll be able to enjoy one of half a dozen production companies on their various stages. Fresh local food everywhere. Amazon brings the rest of the world of shopping to my doorstep.<p>In the end I can only live the one life, one person, right where I am. What does it matter how many other lives are played out around me - 50K or 2M? At some point there&#x27;s only so much I can sample and enjoy.')
