To see why, imagine searching for a big string of the form &quot;aaa...aaax&quot; in the much bigger string of the form &quot;aaa...aaax&quot;.<p>The analysis case for average time is more tricky. You could intuitively think that it, too, should include an &quot;m&quot; term, right? But if strings are uniformly random then the probability of finding your way in to the n&#x27;th character of the needle from any given start position decreases geometrically (1, 1&#x2F;256, 1&#x2F;65536, ...). Since the sum of any such geometric series is a constant[0], we end up with O(n) * O(1) so it&#x27;s just O(n).<p>[0]. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geometric_series#Sum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geometric_series#Sum</a>')
