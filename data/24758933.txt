I always get the idea while doing something and thinking &quot;hey, it would be cool if...&quot;. Latest idea I had was when I was playing piano, then played in VR and realized it would be really cool to create a VR trainer&#x2F;game&#x2F;vizualizer for the piano to fully immers yourself in the music that you play. So, not only you can be told what to play but you could also shape the entire world&#x2F;environment around you by what you play. So something like Tetris Effect VR but with you playing the piano instead of Tetris.<p>Whenever I get an idea, I quickly note the main pointes in a note-taking app and usually never return to it, as the secret of creating actual useful products is to spend the time to create them well. Ideas are worthless if they are not well implemented.')
