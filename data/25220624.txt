Bear in mind that there are proper SUVs for proper terrain, then wannaby suv&#x2F;crossovers&#x2F;whatever which don&#x27;t handle rough terrain well and are just not good cars overall. Also you can have a small crappy dacia sedan or audi a6 all road type.<p>The reasons pro SUV often boil down to:<p><pre><code>  - I need to see more - indication that person isn&#x27;t a good driver to have this need - my older bmw is super low and I see no problem there, sensible drive makes much more difference, but new&#x2F;bad drivers want to buy extra safety feeling\n  - people being sheepish, so they buy what is fashionate because others have it (although physics often disagrees its a good choice)\n  - the &quot;I drive rough terrain&quot; - which often boils down to going to ski resort in the winter, you don&#x27;t need SUV for that, not even 4x4 if roads are OK (which they 99% are in Europe at least)\n  - people think only SUV can have 4x4, or only SUV are for rough terrain - marketing win for manufacturers\n</code></pre>\nDisadvantages are numerous:<p><pre><code>  - more consumption, often higher maintenance (bigger tires)\n  - mentioned Audi allroad or similar gets exactly same job done as usual SUV\n  - since they are tall, they are pretty small inside, smaller trunk\n  - much worse driving properties due to higher centre of mass\n  - rolling risk is much higher in SUV due again to higher centre of mass\n  - subjective but within same brand, SUVs are plain fugly as hell, still waiting for a single one I could even remotely call a pretty car\n</code></pre>\nYeah, I am definitely not a fan of SUV. Between some Audi Q7 and Audi A6 combi allroad, A6 wins in all possible aspects. Its also much more fun and safer car to drive.')
