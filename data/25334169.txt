The engineering that goes into HVAC systems is under appreciated. When messed up the system that is supposed to give you fresh air can easily become a source of pathogens. You also want filters on ingress <i>and</i> egress (to ensure critters don&#x27;t have a path into your house), and you want to have a nice fat overdimensioned heat exchanger between the two airstreams to ensure that you&#x27;re not heating the world instead of your house.<p>+1 on the rapid change of filters, much better to change a filter frequently even if it is a bit lower performance than to let one sit for too long, but keep an eye on your electricity cost, that is <i>the</i> factor that should decide the quality filter that you purchase and frequently you replace it.<p>Ground rule: the better the filter, the more it will absorb, the better the chances that something you really don&#x27;t want lodges there and starts spreading if the filter gets overloaded. Fiberglass filters are a good compromise between energy efficiency and cost, they have excellent working surface compared to their physical size and tend to have a relatively long working life before they &#x27;join the other side&#x27; and become a source of contaminants rather than a filter of contaminants.')
