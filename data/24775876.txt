Hobbyists regularly port games between the systems. There was definitely something in the air for Z80-based systems at the time. The Sega Game Gear is also almost identical to the Master System and can also play Master System games with an adapter.<p>Curiously, the Sinclair ZX systems also used a Z80 as the CPU and there are also a great many ports of ZX Spectrum games to the MSX computers, but those are a bit more complicated.<p>If you&#x27;ve never played SG-1000 games, they&#x27;re worth it. The system had about the same power as the Colecovision, but the games are Japanese style games of the era vs Western games the Coleco mostly received. The ports are so stripped down that they&#x27;re functionally demakes and it&#x27;s often rewarding to see games just a <i>bit</i> too complex for the system stripped down to their core gameplay and graphics essentials. My favorite is the port of Elevator Action, which barely holds together, but somehow has all of the game there.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;kUFgy6aVgbw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;kUFgy6aVgbw</a>')
