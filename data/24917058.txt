It&#x27;s the moderate left. Almost no one from far left starts outright supporting far right, but a lot of people &quot;seep in&quot; to more certer oriented views as they age. Also the only way to get into places of power in a &quot;attention economy&quot; is to be more radical than all the rest. Most people do not have any political views at all. The &quot;silent majority&quot; is a myth. Those are people that will just bend to anything that is mainstream, while complaining about this at home. The reason for that is that they do not have an integrated political view that is sufficienty important. It&#x27;s just a third rate thing, while for the radicals it&#x27;s the most important thing in the world. Political environment is developing based on movement. If there is no shift, there is no place for people to make careers, that&#x27;s why no one who is seriuous about being a politician will stick to defending the center. An attack position will always yield better result than a defensive one. You do not have to have answers to all the possible problems, in reality you do not have any answers at all, just prove that your oponent does not have answers to SOME problems. It&#x27;s a game that we cannot avoid playing and a game that makes everyone lose in the end.')
