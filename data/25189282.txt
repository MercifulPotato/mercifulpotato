Filter them, to increase signal:noise\n2. Set a schedule so that I get a “morning briefing” with industry news.<p>This way I’m not inundated throughout the day.<p>I do the same thing with hn and other personally interesting sources, but have those delivered Friday afternoon<p>I still skim hn (why I’m here now) but mostly looking to see if there is anything I want to comment on. If I see a neat headline I know I can read the details later.<p>I also read the economist (a weekly) and listen to and read books to stay more generally aware of the world<p>Getting away from a continuous feed has been really great')
