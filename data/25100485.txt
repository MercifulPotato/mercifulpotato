Today, what I feel is something I attribute to Autumn&#x27;s reduced daylight (darned harsher in Northern Germany, where even the sun seems to need government clearance to even just appear nowadays, and the government is most of the time too busy with other things to grant it so), plus the disruptions of being in &quot;quarantine&quot; (yeah unfortunately I haven&#x27;t really settled to my personal &quot;new normal&quot; yet).<p>On the bright side, I&#x27;ve actually managed to achieve several of the goals I set myself to back when we thought WFH would just be, 2-4 months. I overplan, there&#x27;s usually a ton of things I want to do and achieve, no way it would&#x27;ve fit in that initial 2-4 months. Now, I&#x27;m actually pretty satisfied with myself if I think about it.')
