Item(by='ck425', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608461168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478744, text='&gt; CDPR had 3 games to perfect the formula<p>That&#x27;s a very good point. The first Witcher game has interesting ideas but not all that great just decent and innovative. The second was very much a refinement of the concepts from the first game, expanding the game world but keeping it within a workable scope. Then Witcher 3 basically took everything they&#x27;d learned from the first two, refined the gameplay even more, created a truly excellent story (not sure how much the story was planned as a trilogy) and on top of it all expanded it into an incredible open world. But by the time they built the world for W3 they&#x27;d had two games to refine everything and had a formula that worked.<p>Compare that to Cyberpunk and it makes sense that it&#x27;s not as polished. You can make the same irritative argument for Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Spiderman etc. I&#x27;m super excited based on that to play the New Horizon game.')
