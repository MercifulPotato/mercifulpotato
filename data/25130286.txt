I know in OOP toolkits you can override any public and protected functions and add your little stuff on top but I am not sure if you can do it in React without cloning the code and modifying it.<p>As an example you say have a DataGridView , a giant component with a lot of features and you need to modify something, can you do it in React using inheritance like functionality and not risking breaking anything where the component is already used ?')
