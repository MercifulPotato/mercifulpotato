Java could be as easy as Go to write quick micro-services, utilities etc if all the HTTP client and server stuff were part of the standard library. If Java had offered a Java -&gt; native option right out of the box (instead of installing and setting up GraalVM), Go would have had difficulty in achieving the adoption it had today.<p>Go lang also made some fundamental re-useable interfaces that are leveraged across all its packages making the stdlib consistent to learn.<p>I still prefer Java though - because Intellij rocks and I am personally faster with development. But for newbies, golang is easier.')
