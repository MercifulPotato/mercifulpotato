This was a national scandal that resulted in Starbucks closing its 8,000 stores for racial bias training.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the company&#x27;s official policy was and is to allow people to stay as long as they like without making a purchase, and that witnesses to the event described white people in the store doing exactly that at the same time the black man was arrested.')
