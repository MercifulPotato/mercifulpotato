E.g. my health insurance company (AOK) here in Germany called me last year, and tried to give me an Apple Watch for free. The main part of the contract was, to submit my movements for &quot;a study&quot;. In return they offered me something like &quot;bonus points&quot;, and cheaper additional insurance plans. I said no, and they asked if I&#x27;m interested to have this for my kids, and that they also have a smart toothbrush &quot;to motivate&quot; kids to brush their teeth 3 times a day, I just WTF&#x27;ed, and told them to not call anymore with such offers. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;app&#x2F;aok-bonus-app&#x2F;id1085724967" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;app&#x2F;aok-bonus-app&#x2F;id1085724967</a> with this App you submit your activity, this was part of the contract. 100.000+ downloads on Google Play says it all, Apple does not display an App download counter.')
