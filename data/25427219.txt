That&#x27;s socialism.<p>Its weird that you conflate forcing people to live in 3m^3 tubes like the Japanese and high tax rates on capital. They don&#x27;t have to go together, do they?<p>&gt; But dragging travelers out of their cars for a protection bribe (if you&#x27;re lucky enough not to get Sandra Bland-ed) is a-ok. &#x2F;s<p>These same rural people don&#x27;t approve of the extortion but when you have a system where the government decides what people pay they don&#x27;t have any recourse.')
