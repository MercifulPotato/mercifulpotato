The library was already functionally problematic for SAML, because it doesn&#x27;t fully implement namespaces. Nor does it implement `xml-exc-c14n`. For the IdP I wrote last year, I just wrote my own XML; it&#x27;s not that big a deal.<p>Software security people have understood for a long time that XMLDSIG is sketchy, and that implementations often need to be &quot;bug-compatible&quot; to interoperate safely. SAML is an XMLDSIG protocol. I feel bad for putting it this way, but I think that reasonably skilled security engineers should be alarmed if their platform&#x27;s standard XML library easily allows you to implement something that claims to be DSIG.')
