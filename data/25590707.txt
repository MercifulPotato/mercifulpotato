The medium is sketchy, the messenger can&#x27;t be abstracted from the message, one would have to be physically near the messenger, and the messenger would have to be actively trying to communicate with you when you came into proximity.<p>A person posting links to a (fake news) site (asserting something like &quot;Liberal politicians run a pedophilia ring, look for the Pizza code!&quot;) via FB can reach on the order of 10^6 people in a day or two. And FB promotes that content to the people who are more susceptible.<p>Ideas couldn&#x27;t spread like this ever before.')
