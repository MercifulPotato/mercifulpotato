Section 230 says that you can&#x27;t be held liable for content on your site that you did not create yourself, even if you generally moderate your content (i.e. are not just a common carrier).<p>But there are still laws that require you to _remove_ certain content (child porn comes to mind, but also material that infringes copyrights, etc) once you are aware of it.<p>Concretely, given this sequence of events:<p>1. You have a web site that allows people to post pictures.  You moderate them some.<p>2. Someone who is not you or one of your employees&#x2F;contractors posts child porn.<p>3. Before your moderators notice it, someone else sees it and reports it to the FBI.<p>4. You remove the child porn (based on normal moderation getting to it, or you getting notified by the person from item 3 or by the FBI).<p>my understanding is that Section 230 means that there is no legal liability on your part, as long as step 4 actually happens once you become aware of the content.')
