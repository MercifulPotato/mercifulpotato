Now I&#x27;m looking for an alternative email client for macOS with IMAP support.<p>Some of the email clients that looked like a solid alternative to me (Spark, Polymail, Mailspring) use a backend that store the IMAP credentials. To me, this looks like a additional security risk. I run a small software company and if a third party gains access to my emails (and even send emails from my account), they could cause significant damage.<p>How do you assess these risks? Do you trust these email clients? Which clients do you use?')
