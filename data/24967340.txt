It&#x27;s easier to just continuously benchmark performance and kill machines that don&#x27;t perform as expected. It&#x27;s very easy to automate.<p>The article also doesn&#x27;t mention spot pricing and per-second billing. Being able to burst up to hundreds of machines in minutes is super nice. I did some back of the envelope calculations for some build servers and it came out favorably for $cloud providers. Having idle machines also cost money.<p>For a highly optimized and predictable work load I&#x27;m sure providers like OVH can provide better bang for bucks. But that also assumes you don&#x27;t use any of the cost reduction methods that are available with $cloud, like using spot pricing for variable load and reserved capacity for base load.')
