These have many more than 20-30 functions, and they all have to be there because one can obtain them as values and pass those values around (and, in the case of standard generic functions, add new methods for them).  There may be specific expansions for calls to particular standard functions when the types of the arguments are known, or when particular keyword and optional arguments are or are not present.')
