My next thought is that having the separate sick days with the expectation that people will only use them when needed introduces several less-than-optimal problems: 1) some employees will lie about being sick, 2) some employers won&#x27;t trust their employees, interjecting the need for unnecessary dacotr&#x27;s notes, etc and 3) some employees who follow the rules will resent those who don&#x27;t.<p>Everyone getting the same combined amount of day mitigates the above, with the understanding that might be 45 PTO days instead of 30 vacation + 30 sick. This would seem to leave the problem of people who are genuinely sick for longer 15 days, under the 30+30 they&#x27;d not be dipping into their vacation days as quickly.<p>There will always be some number of people who run out of sick days, no matter how many you have. Maybe the policies around short-term disability should be adjusted, and the more drastic situations handled with that (requiring doctor visits, etc).<p>I&#x27;m currently reading &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot; by David Graeber, something that rings a lot of bells for me. I&#x27;ll admit to having an very questioning attitude about workplace culture lately :-)')
