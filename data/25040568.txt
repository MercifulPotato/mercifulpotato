AT&amp;T is always available, but its shitty DSL. Supposedly some parts of the city have fiber, but I&#x27;m 0&#x2F;3 at my locations.<p>I&#x27;m paying like $50 + tax for 500 mbit down &#x2F; 20ish up. I&#x27;d trade that for 100 mbit symmetrical, but that&#x27;s not happened on cable anytime soon.<p>I bet like 20% of houses at most are networked well enough to even use 200 mbit.')
