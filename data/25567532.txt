ANC does not hurt us even if it is loud. We are hearing a sound but not a ”real” one, but our eardrums still vibrate a lot. The thinking is that high level ANC is as fatigue inducing to eardrums as prolonged music listening. That’s why I nowadays recommend to friends to not use ANC on its own for too long daily.')
