Happy to explain my thinking here.<p>Regarding marketing and selling what we have: we tried that and it&#x27;s pretty clear we&#x27;re missing important bits, in particular packages for common vendors (stripe, slack, etc), and a package for user management, as well as common things like validation. People love the concept (as do you, thanks!), but were struggling to build things because of what was missing.<p>As we went to build these, the tech&#x2F;product debt that we had built up during our experimental phase really started to become apparent. We were missing common and expected things like user-defined types (maybe not important for dynamic langs, but we&#x27;re a statically typed functional language, so being able to create types is kinda important), configurable (or at least changable) HTTP middleware, and a few other things.<p>The reason for the rewrite is that had been taking long detours around our tech stack for a while. Now that there&#x27;s limited resources (as in, just me), the cost of taking the long way to everything we build is just a little too high, so it feels like a rewrite (note: just of the backend, the majority of the code is in the frontend and doesn&#x27;t need to change!) is necessary to get to product&#x2F;market fit.<p>I also hope it won&#x27;t be the death of us. Fortunately, F# isn&#x27;t a valid value for $hotlang! (Good thing I didn&#x27;t pick Rust!)')
