I promptly told them no and thought that was that. A few days later I notice an $800 charge to my credit card I had on file with them. I call them and ask about the charge, they say I agreed to the purchase in the sales call. When I refuted this they said they had a recording of the call, and verified that I agreed. I asked them to play the call back and they refused. I called them a few times again asking for a refund or to hear the call that supposedly proved I agreed to the purchase. Anyway, a few weeks of bullshit later, I sent and email to HQ@godaddy.com, laying out what happened and telling them that in 24 hours I would be filing a complaint with consumer protection Ontario[1]. I got a full refund and an apology within a few hours. Needless to say I transferred all of my domains out of godaddy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ontario.ca&#x2F;page&#x2F;consumer-protection-ontario" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ontario.ca&#x2F;page&#x2F;consumer-protection-ontario</a>')
