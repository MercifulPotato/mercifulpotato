So we&#x27;re seeing French go the same way as Scots or Gaelic did in the UK -- slowly dying.<p>Overall though, as long as we ensure that the population is distributed (I guess high housing prices are a good thing), and that people learn French, the 100 million thing isn&#x27;t too bad.<p>---\n[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bnnbloomberg.ca&#x2F;canada-needs-to-get-to-100-million-people-by-2100-blackrock-s-mark-wiseman-1.1337065" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bnnbloomberg.ca&#x2F;canada-needs-to-get-to-100-milli...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;5&#x2F;5a&#x2F;Koppen-Geiger_Map_CAN_future.svg&#x2F;1200px-Koppen-Geiger_Map_CAN_future.svg.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;5&#x2F;5a&#x2F;Ko...</a> \n - Note right now, Only Toronto - Windsor has that light blue climate (same weather as New England), and in 2100 most of Canada will, while southern Ontario and BC will have the same weather as Washington or Normandy.')
