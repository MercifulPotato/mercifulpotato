If you&#x27;re a historical revisionist, you could make the claim that the separate colonies constituted separate nations before the AoC, but I wouldn&#x27;t agree with you. The AoC formed a nation, post-revolution, and formed it out of states. I would read Article IV as <i>preventing</i> the elimination of freedom of movement and capital, because when it was enacted there was honestly little to no barriers to either already in place.<p>The EEC&#x2F;EU was preceded by nations, continues to feature nations (1) and still has no actual federal structure (though quite a lot of Europeans wish it had more, and quite a lot of other Europeans wish it had less).<p>(1) consider how easy it was for even the Schengen zone nations to close their borders and think about how difficult it would be for a state to do the same.')
