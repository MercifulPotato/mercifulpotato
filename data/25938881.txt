It’s not meaningful work. They’re riding motorcycles; they’re hiking. Which can all have value—don’t get me wrong. But if it’s the main thing in your life? Ummm, that’s not probably a meaningful life.<p>I&#x27;m never really to sure which to find more shocking about these kind of public intellectuals, their hubris in thinking they can define what makes a life meaningful for someone-- everyone--else or that they are often given positions of actual influence.<p>Then again, maybe things makes more sense if the people running the world think the only thing giving other peoples lives meaning is work.')
