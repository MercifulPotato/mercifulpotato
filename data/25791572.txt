I just opened my History Panel, checked that several thousands of entries were present, then searched for various characters, then navigated in several tabs. Everything was instant.<p>- Vivaldi Android has its own ad-blocking system. IIRC, it can load external lists. Though it has less features than uBlock Origin, it&#x27;s enough for me.<p>I prefer the desktop Vivaldi to other web browsers because of its features:<p>- Vertical tab list<p>- Mouse gestures (click-right-left to go back, down-up to duplicate a tab...)<p>- Sane download manager (compared to Firefox)<p>- The features above are native. No need for shady extensions (or clean extension that could become shady on a future upgrade).<p>- More customization than most browsers (not counting the undocumented config of FF)')
