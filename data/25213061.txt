You could kind of say XNU is a superset of the FreeBSD kernel.<p>On top of that, the unix userland resembles FreeBSD, although it&#x27;s pretty eclectic in choices, e.g. it ships with GNU grep and GNU make by default IIRC while I think FreeBSD uses BSD grep and make by default?<p>(Darwin is pretty eclectic overall -- some portions are more NetBSDish. Kernel is mostly Free I think)')
