We will just keep optimizing, pointing the needle so to speak to the next cheapest place, which might in the future be a country that used to be &quot;more expensive&quot; but now, forced to compete, lowers its standards to accomodate the market.<p>We&#x27;re stuck in a Malthusian Trap. Thinking we can simply escape it by not playing the game is missing the point: the question we need to solve is: &quot;how do we stop competing for resources as individuals or arbitrary groups (neighbourhoord&#x2F;cities&#x2F;countries&#x2F;continents), and start having a real shared understanding of our habits, genetic behaviour and use of resources&quot;.')
