Left often has an inexplicable urge to assume that Government Knows Best.  Imagine the Fed government gets somebody like Trump at the top again, but smarter, with more effective political tactics and stays in power for a longer time.<p>Limiting what government can do puts the brakes on what such a person can accomplish.  Leave things up to the states, of course you can still occasionally get problems at the state level, but that&#x27;s only 1&#x2F;50 as much of a problem.<p>Assuming anti-vax is a single movement.  I have a normally reasonable friend who refused an STD vaccine for his newborn.  Having a &lt;1 year old baby vaccinated against STD&#x27;s simply doesn&#x27;t make sense.  His experience opened my eyes:  Some vaccines undoubtedly are genuine medical miracles that save lots of lives, but the necessity of others can be rather questionable.  (The number of recommended vaccines for children has also exploded since my friend and I ourselves were kids, unless you have children yourself you might assume your childhood experience is still the norm, which it isn&#x27;t.)<p>When you say &quot;Why should I vaccinate my 0-year-old against an STD?&quot; and the doctor can&#x27;t give answer beyond &quot;You won&#x27;t be able to send them to school if you don&#x27;t,&quot; it <i>really does</i> seem rather reasonable to conclude that it&#x27;s medically unnecessary but Big Pharma&#x27;s successfully lobbied the government to require this particular shot.<p>To be fair, my friend may be wrong.  There may be sound medical reasons their doctor didn&#x27;t know or didn&#x27;t feel like explaining for the 1000th time.<p>My point is, there are shades and shades of anti-vax.  We use the same term to describe (a) the irrational nutjob who rejects all vaccines and denies all historical reports of how bad things like smallpox were as some kind of elaborate hoax, and (b) reasonable people who are trying to reasonably evaluate whether a given medical product is a reasonable step for their health situation, and sometimes reasonably comes to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not (as in the case of a parent who decides it doesn&#x27;t make sense to vaccinate a newborn against STD&#x27;s.)')
