Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=[25105201, 25104175], score=None, time=1605459385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102389, text='&gt; what are some problematic &quot;unhinged&quot; popular left wing places? which major politicians back them?<p>Start with anything related to BLM (notice the capitals, I&#x27;m talking about the organisation, not the fact of skin tone not being a factor in whether your life matters), anything related to Antifa to make it easy. The former is supported by a vocal minority of the DNC, the existence of the latter is denied by the current president elect while his running mate called for her supporters to supply funds to bail out its members after they&#x27;d been arrested. From there you might want to go past organisations like Extinction Rebellion for another example of polarised rhetoric which is supported by a vocal minority of the DNC.<p>&gt; and why are they anywhere as near a threat to civilization &amp; order as the divisive gun toting pissed off angry conspiratoroal rhetoric as is so widespread on the right, that even Fox News batshit crazy is no longer sufficient?<p>Have you not followed the news - and with that I do not mean just what CNN and MSNBC say - for the last 5 months? A simple count of victims of violence would answer your question.<p>&gt; it is one side. the lefties hanging out in cities are not busy making new media outlets to invite ourselves into violent revolutionary overthrow &amp; conflict.<p>Either you&#x27;re ideologically blinded, or you&#x27;re intentionally talking falsehoods. The <i>lefties</i> hanging out in the cities are the ones who have been or have been complicit in looting and rioting. They are the ones who have tried to start actual &quot;revolutions&quot; - and failed horrendously since it turns out they had not really thought it trough.<p>Do you know the concept of &quot;steel-manning&quot;? It is the opposite of &quot;straw-manning&quot; in that it is a way to see the opponent&#x27;s point of view from as strong a position as possible. It can help you to see the opponent as something other than an object of hate. It can also help you find weaknesses in that opponent&#x27;s position. I think you should try it instead of simply throwing well-worn epithets at anyone who does not share &quot;your&quot; point of view.')
