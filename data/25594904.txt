In general somehow reading has seemed to grow more gendered over time; if you go into the average chain bookstore its apparent that its heavily targeted towards women, and something like Amazon&#x27;s free Prime reads are often almost entirely women-targeted genre selections.<p>Young adult books for example are targeted almost entirely towards teen girls now, and even manga or comic books seem focused on the female market in increasing amounts.<p>Jon Scieszka, a kids author, noticed this over fifteen years ago and started guys read, a website trying to encourage boys to do so and raise awareness about it. But it seems to have stalled, and I don&#x27;t hear a lot of talk about the feminization of reading.<p>I really think that this is a major part of why boys fall behind. Reading in general is the basis of learning, and boys over time have moved away. There&#x27;s always been cultural resistance against &quot;book-larning&quot; but its weird how gendered reading itself has become lately.')
