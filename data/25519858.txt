Traditionally the rice bowl. India used to grow rice according to the monsoons. Rice was grown twice a year. The vindhya range was a buffer and bought rains from monsoon clouds. I don’t think it’s even feasible to grow rice at this scale in northern indian. It’s more wheat country.<p>Indian farmers with tractors and GMO seeds and followed by pesticides and herbicides have been made to feel like super farmers and especially bolstered by green revolution.<p>The green revolution was a disaster. It is NOT possible to increase yields without causing imbalance in the eco system, resource availability and resultant domino change&#x2F;impact.<p>This is all very tragic. The green revolution was a quick shot in the arm. Coaxing increased yields from soil should be used as an emergency measure..like a shot in the arm during times of need. It’s not sustainable over long periods of time supporting billions.<p>It gives the false security of abundance and the underlying system will collapse because the soil is a living organism. It cannot bear this chemical warfare we are waging upon it.')
