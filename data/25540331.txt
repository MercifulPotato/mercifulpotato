No, the money and prestige don&#x27;t belong to the people who actually make the things we use and enjoy, it all goes to the top where it belongs. If you&#x27;re obedient they&#x27;ll keep you around, but certainly some other slave could have done the same work for cheaper so don&#x27;t get too comfortable.<p>Now my company is very different, we have respect for our workers and let no part of the employee go to waste. When you&#x27;ve outlived your usefulness your ulna will be fashioned into a long spoon for serving gruel, and the dome of your skull becomes a fine bowl. We actually use half of my former cofounder&#x27;s pelvis as a frisbee during offsites!<p>Your work will outlive you, and continue to aid the company for many years after you&#x27;ve been decommissioned. That should be enough to comfort you in your final moments, as you await incineration.')
