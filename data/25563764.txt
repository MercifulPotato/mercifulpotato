If you don&#x27;t receive an e-mail back from HR or a recruiter, it means that the company wasn&#x27;t interested in you.  &#x27;Ghosting&#x27; doesn&#x27;t exist in the hiring world.  No reply universally means that you&#x27;ve been turned down.  Receiving a reply is an unnecessary courtesy provided by some companies.  Job hunting can be daunting, but do not whinge to companies that have turned you down.  They may hire you in the future.')
