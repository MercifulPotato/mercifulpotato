Not quite the same thing in my opinion.<p>The point is they weren&#x27;t only exercising free speech.  They were inciting a violent riot.<p>&gt; Those sites are offering illegal goods and services. That is why they are offline. Companies are generally ordered by law enforcement to take them down. Again...hardly comparable.<p>Again, the calls to march into the Capitol, provocation of violence, etc... are also illegal.  But you won&#x27;t find our government ever willing to take that stand.  The distinction is less clear than you suggest.<p>Lets put it this way, no one is suggesting to blacklist the WSJ or the National Review.  The Parler is the equivalent to an Antifa social media network for planning attacks on right wing establishments.')
