Hence you&#x27;re likely to see systemic biases in junior and senior authors alike as the field may not converge to &quot;truth&quot;.<p>But in fields that the method is closer to science (e.g. physics, chemistry, neuroscience), I would expect that the overall field is converging to the truth and that senior authors will therefore be more tuned in to the best estimate of truth or how to get to it than junior authors.')
