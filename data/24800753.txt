Thanks so much for taking to time to reach out. Glad to see they released a Linux version of the rasUnsteady64 executable! I was able to run the example on WSL! It wasn&#x27;t there the last time I looked, for sure. There&#x27;s a lot more to HEC-RAS than that, but it&#x27;s certainly the most important component.<p>Mike Bannis has done great work wrapping the HEC-RAS controller and creating parsers some of the file formats. There&#x27;s a very helpful _unoffcial_ book [1] laying out the win32com control and file format details. Making HEC-RAS open source would allow many more projects like these, with significantly less guesswork.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kleinschmidtgroup.com&#x2F;breaking-the-hec-ras-code-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kleinschmidtgroup.com&#x2F;breaking-the-hec-ras-code-...</a>')
