In other words, as long as &quot;whites&quot; don&#x27;t makeup an proportionate percentage of the lowest quartile, and &quot;blacks&quot; don&#x27;t make up a proportionate percentage of the highest quartile, that is, by definition, <i>systemic racism</i>.<p>In essence, the term no longer represents a critique on equality, but rather a critique on <i>equity of outcomes</i>.')
