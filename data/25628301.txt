Item(by='baron_harkonnen', descendants=None, kids=[25628494], score=None, time=1609740250, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25627621, text='&gt; without any attempt to validate their investments.<p>I&#x27;ve also worked in adtech, for quite a long time on all sides, and my experience is that far more companies do research to <i>justify</i> their ad spend not validate it.<p>I have managed plenty of A&#x2F;B tests in my day, each one claiming to show some improvement, 10%, 15% etc (some, as you said, showing no improvement). Even though these tests are often run &quot;correctly&quot;, essentially nobody goes back and asks &quot;wait, we had a 10% increase multiple times in the past year, but is our &lt;metric&gt; really showing the <i>cumulative</i> improvement we expected?&quot;<p>The greatest trick in the industry is that because VC are pouring money into everything, everywhere, every metric appears to grow. At every startup, everywhere, pre-pandemic, numbers were going up because people were pouring money into the system.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at companies who I know for a fact their adtech product cannot and does not work, yet their business continues to explode because in recent months nearly all ad spend has been on digital ads.<p>I&#x27;ve talked to companies whose entire function is bidding optimization who literally do not understand how to optimize bidding given the information you have.<p>Absolutely people are running &quot;experiments&quot; but the function of the &quot;experiments&quot; is to justify that the ad team is worth having, and then that the VP of marketing is doing their job and then that the CEO has hired some super smart people, and then that the VCs might have really found a unicorn. Everyone sees what they want and no one really wants to ask the question &quot;wait, does this really work? are these tests really able to capture the complexity of the environment?&quot; And if you are one of those ornery people that insists on probing into the details and seeing if any of this is working, you will eventually get fired.<p>Ad tech is largely a scam, but a huge number of rich and smart people benefit from the illusion that it is not, so we continue to see experiments showing that everything works as expected.')
