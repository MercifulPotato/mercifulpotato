Every other printer we&#x27;ve had worked well with the same VPN.<p>I didn&#x27;t manage to get it to work, but my investigation led me to suspect it was because of some networking shenanigans it was doing (some kind of broadcast packet IIRC). At some point, it started working, maybe a firmware update fixed the issue. Might also have been a Windows issue to be honest.')
