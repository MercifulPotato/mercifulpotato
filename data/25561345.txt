I wonder if a confluence of several efforts would come together and make a real impact. E.g. make it illegal to charge more then x for an apartment evaluated at y. Make it illegal to raise the rent more the x over inflation (also between tenants). Make it illegal buy housing with the intention to sell for profit. County could buy housing with set rent to drive down the market rate. Make it illegal to own a house that stays empty more then x months.<p>EDIT: I know it might seem unfair if you are a landlord or in the housing speculative market. But heck, you’ve had your chance to play a fair game, and seriously screwed us over. You’ve proven your self unworthy as a player in a fair market to a point that you shouldn’t be allowed to play it.')
