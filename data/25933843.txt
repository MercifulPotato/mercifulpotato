In the past few years, you have been able to legally bring a few months of drugs back from Canada if you visited in person.  But if you order drugs online, the drugs are at risk of being seized.  Sometimes they get through fine, sometimes they are seized for things as silly as improper labeling (or the drug being straight up illegal to import).  You can still save money on many drugs if you can accept the risk or you can order far enough in advance to be able to reorder if one of your packages gets seized.  Ordering drugs from another country is a slightly better plan to save money than making friends with a veterinarian.  But most people should just go to the local pharmacy and work with their insurance provider or state aid programs if they can&#x27;t afford their prescriptions.<p>Ironically, the Trump administration recently allowed states to import drugs from other countries to enable them to offer lower cost drugs through state run programs, but was still seizing the same products if they were ordered by individuals.  While I can&#x27;t really complain about an initiative to lower drug costs, the mental gymnastics needed to come up with this plan are pretty incredible.  &quot;We don&#x27;t think price controls are compatible with a capitalist society, so we won&#x27;t implement them.  But we campaigned on lower drug prices (since that will increase our appeal among the elderly), so we have to do something.  Let&#x27;s import drugs from countries that do have price controls.  But people can&#x27;t order the drugs themselves, we have to protect them from themselves.  We have to order the drugs and repackage them with new labels, because we need American instructions and American warning labels, not the instructions and warnings that the Canadian government is fine with.&quot;<p>Right now, it&#x27;s better&#x2F;easier for most people to get their drugs from a local pharmacist with our current system.  If Mark Cuban is willing to throw a lot of capital and break up the price collusion between established drug companies, then I suppose it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.  We should be happy to accept lower prices and get to work on fixing other important problems with our healthcare system.')
