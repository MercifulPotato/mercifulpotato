The classical example is prescription drugs. Consumers are not price sensitive b&#x2F;c they NEED those drugs. As such the seller can raise price and not see a drop off in sales.<p>I think a good example of a highly elastic good is hamburgers. Is McDonalds raises burger prices by 300% there a ton of other options for consumers to switch to and sales will drop.')
