Like comparisons of Apple to Intel debates, this one is missing the clear other player in the room.<p>While it&#x27;s arguable about how successful this is in either pragmatic or policy terms, dropping the context that the government is investing in both:<p>a) cross city train tunnel<p>b) outer suburban loop<p>c) airport line through Sunshine interchange<p>d) faster trains from Geelong upgrade<p>is to likely lose some important perspective.<p>This is on top of Melbourne&#x27;s (which makes up easily the vast majority of the population of the state) already impressive public transport infrastructure.<p>Again, maybe this seems weird because people are interpreting it from the frame of private vehicle ownership,  where the comparison is between ICT and EV. But that&#x27;s not the correct comparison: it&#x27;s actually a policy of moving between private and public transport.  And from that perspective,  it can also arguably make sense from an environment perspective as well.')
