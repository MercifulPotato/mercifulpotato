And a lot of those can be even tested at home with simple experiment. You can sometimes even find something new, or that one theory is wrong.<p>Want to test if god exists ? If heaven or hell exists ? If following some rules will grant you access to heaven ? You can&#x27;t. There is no experiment that you can replicate that will prove any of those claims. You can try to find your own, in many way is is also scientific, but there is many religions and people have been trying to prove many of those theories for eons without any advancement.<p>Comparing science and the belief in scientific theories as similar to a religious faith is just wrong if you stop and think about it for more than 5 minutes.')
