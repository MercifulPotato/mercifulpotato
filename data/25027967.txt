But owning expensive things is considered a clue that the owner has the ability to procure many other resources, which might be relevant for a woman looking for economic security.<p>If you’re in the US, you can also look up someone’s job title&#x2F;employer&#x2F;their house address and get an idea of their income&#x2F;wealth more accurately than the phone they use, so it might seem nonsensical in the US.')
