Excitement about career opportunities. Room to move upwards.<p>Hard-tech job opportunities w&#x2F;o having to regress to an entry-level or mid-level role.<p>Senior level job opportunities, w&#x2F;o having to join a consulting firm (i mean, if i&#x27;m potentially traveling 4&#x2F;5 days, i&#x27;m not really &#x27;living&#x27; here anymore...) I&#x27;ve rolled the dice on management consulting before in my life and spent almost no time in my home city. That was great when I was 20 and not so great with a family.
