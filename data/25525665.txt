I encoded all the movement rules for each piece and then programmed the opponent to choose random valid moves. It would pick a random piece, pick a random square to move it to, and if it was considered valid, it would make the move, or pick another square. I think later I reprogrammed it to select 10 random valid moves, and select the one that allowed it to capture the highest value piece.<p>The great thing was that it worked, and it could &quot;play chess&quot;. The sad thing was, I am such a bad chess player that it could still actually beat me around 50% of the time by choosing random moves.')
