You can blow them up and make a mess, but you can&#x27;t have a critical excursion without first turning the reactor on, which would be very hard to do with an explosion. Even if you pulverized the fuel elements on the explosion (that&#x27;s one hell of an explosion), it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as Chernobyl or Fukushima because until you start the reactor, the nastiest isotopes won&#x27;t be there.')
