Item(by='kypro', descendants=None, kids=[25965498, 25966588, 25964921], score=None, time=1611968308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964347, text='&gt; All of them deserve blame BUT the hedge funds and mortgage brokers got bailouts and the home buyers didnt. That smells like BS to me and anger at the people that allowed that to happen, hedge funds and bankers included, looks justified to me<p>What bail outs are you referring to? Are you talking about the TARP program? Because didn&#x27;t most of that go to banks (not hedge funds) and wasn&#x27;t that actually a net benefit to tax payers? I&#x27;m not asking rhetorically, I&#x27;m honestly just not that well informed on the details of the TARP program being from the UK and having not been old enough to have direct experience of the GFC.<p>I do agree that more should have been done to help those struggling with mortgage debt, but again it&#x27;s weird to blame hedge funds for this. To blame the hedge funds you would first have to assume they planned to take down the global economy, and then secondly assume that they have some level of responsibly over the government&#x27;s decision to purchase toxic assets from the banks. It was the government who took the tax payer&#x27;s money and gave it to the banks.<p>It&#x27;s also not like all hedge funds were involved in the GFC either. I guess I don&#x27;t really understand what Melvin Capital did that was so bad that people now want to bankrupt the company. Being angry at certain individuals and companies for taking on the excessive risk that caused the GFC is understandable, but being angry at all hedge funds or all of &quot;Wall Street&quot; is silly. A lot (and I&#x27;d assume most) of these companies are perfectly responsible and acting within the law.<p>And to be honest it&#x27;s worse than just targeting random Hedge Funds, a lot of the posts I&#x27;ve seen on Reddit seem to be complaining about capitalism and the financial system in the general. I think this is partly why I&#x27;m feeling the need to question what and who we&#x27;re angry at here. I want to make sure we&#x27;re justified when we&#x27;re bankrupting these companies and making their employees redundant. A mob as big as this without a clear target should worry everyone.')
