Not just that either. For example, the fricking <i>Associated Press</i> ran an investigative piece about immigrant kids being handed over to forced labour traffickers that was 100% open about the fact its purpose was to attack Trump&#x27;s immigration policies, even though if you looked at the dates every incident it described happened under Obama. That didn&#x27;t stop everyone on social media interpreting it in the intended fashion.')
