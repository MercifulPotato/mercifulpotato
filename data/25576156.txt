Calling oneself a &quot;scientist&quot; or having an advanced degree does not make one less susceptible to that. One has to set up institutions that will harness the craziness of humans and human groups in a direction that, on average and over the long term, is productive.<p>But what most people call &quot;science&quot; today is not such an institution. For example, the real message of the &quot;replication crisis&quot; is that most of what the average person is told is &quot;science&quot; is actually nothing of the sort. A sane institution of science would never have labelled that stuff as &quot;science&quot; in the first place; it would have said &quot;sorry, we&#x27;re still working on this, no results yet&quot;. And a lot of times it would say that and there never <i>would</i> be any results, and science would say &quot;no results from this line of research; that&#x27;s to be expected since many lines of research that initially look promising don&#x27;t pan out&quot;.')
