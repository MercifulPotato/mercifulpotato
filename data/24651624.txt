[1]<p>With GPS, it&#x27;s easy to simply not pay attention. And if you&#x27;re not even paying equal attention, then you&#x27;re not even trying to learn. <i>But</i> that&#x27;s <i>not even what the study&#x27;s about</i>.<p>The study is about people <i>actively</i> trying to learn, first of all. It&#x27;s about the rates of people who are trying to <i>solve</i> something from <i>trial and error</i>, not people trying to <i>memorize</i> a route they research or look up or are told.<p>But the study is specifically about discovering that <i>choice confirmation bias</i> appears to lead to <i>higher learning rates</i>, which is <i>entirely</i> non-obvious. In layman&#x27;s terms, why would &quot;assuming I&#x27;m right&quot; lead to <i>better</i> learning outcomes? Traditionally, common sense tells us that prejudice or bias leads to <i>worse</i> learning outcomes.<p>So this is actually a quite interesting, non-obvious result.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41562-020-0919-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41562-020-0919-5</a>')
