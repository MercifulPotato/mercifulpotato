And I said &quot;linked to&quot; not &quot;is&quot;. Having the opinion isn&#x27;t terrorism. But giving money or vocal support to people who then invite others to or themselves try to violently overthrow a form of government is - from the subjective perspective of people in the current system - closely linked to terrorism. If they had succeeded in installing Trump as the continued leader in a post-democratic US, it wouldn&#x27;t have been terrorism. Because they would&#x27;ve been judged under the new system of government. But they didn&#x27;t succeed so far. So from the perspective of a post-Trump democratic government, it was terrorism. Terrorism doesn&#x27;t mean every single person is scared afterwards, so your personal feelings towards it aren&#x27;t the defining factor.')
