Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605305880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084506, text='Not for public situations, but internally, and proactively...<p>For my startups&#x27;s new engineering hiring process, I recently wrote the boilerplate part of the email I send when requesting a first Jitsi&#x2F;phone technical meeting, after a prospective team member has passed the initial meeting with the CEO.<p>Part of this is to tell them the purpose and format of this meeting (e.g., no surprise coding test, start to get a sense of each others&#x27; abilities and what it&#x27;d be like to work together).  But then the majority of the text is to convey the culture we&#x27;re going for, and the professional mode it&#x27;s safe to be in for the interview (which is different than some other places, and than some standard advice).<p>I&#x27;m shooting for the engineering&amp;ops culture to be what I call in the boilerplate &quot;honest and earnest&quot;.  And that it&#x27;s safe and encouraged in this culture to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, &quot;that&#x27;s a problem&quot;, &quot;I made a mistake&quot;, &quot;I need help&quot;, etc.  And that it&#x27;s safe and encouraged to be in this mode in the interview, as well (and I will be, too).<p>In work (and in the interviews), I absolutely don&#x27;t want people thinking they should be posturing or cultivating social media-like distorted images, avoiding pointing out system problems, getting into conflict of interest situations with personal career advancement vs. the interests of the team and our work, etc.<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll refine this over time, but I believe that an honest&amp;earnest culture avoids a lot of problems around mistakes, including helping to avoid mistakes in the first place, and avoiding compounding them when they do happen.')
