Does he not deserve his share? I don’t know. If he does not, then our legal system is broken - he paid for a service he is denied. If he gets his share, then what about the workers he denied their share to? But his denial was enabled by the law, what are we going to do about this?<p>And if his pledge is denied, I am going to see this as a petty retaliation against a sick old guy.<p>If you want to fix something, fix the system that enabled him to fight the regulations in first place. Don’t fight his cruelty with your own just because you think he deserves it and he cannot punch back anymore.<p>(throwaway because I am afraid of expressing my views due to socialist culture prevailing. Call it self-censorship if you like)')
