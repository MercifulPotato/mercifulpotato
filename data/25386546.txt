For example they might require a machine to suspend+resume 1000 times in a row. This shakes out both OS + driver issues before they go to market. This level of rigor is important to avoid support calls + RMAs, which are expensive for the OEM.<p>Many Linux drivers can&#x27;t pass this level of rigor. Back when I used to care about this professionally (before 2014), video + wifi drivers were some of the worst culprits. Each variant of each chipset would need its own driver, and often those drivers needed tweaks for stability.<p>Firmware implementations are (were?) also built + tested exclusively for Windows, and Linux is different enough that it can trigger untested&#x2F;broken code paths or otherwise cause firmware to misbehave. Linux also has its own set of issues with ACPI + UEFI.<p>Canonical, RedHat, etc have teams dedicated to enablement and testing for OEMs like Dell that ship computers with Linux. Back when I was involved, Canonical had 60+ people dedicated to this, and qualified hundreds of SKUs each year. Even then they don&#x27;t cover all hardware. The fixes+workarounds those teams produce also take time to make their way upstream.')
