No matter who wins the election, it will be close and there will be a legal battle.  Many people will be upset with the outcome.<p>Retreating into conspiracy theories is well known to be a coping mechanism for dealing with exactly these types of fears.  Fixating on articles about election fraud in the US over the next couple of days is the same as diving into wikipedia about the materials science of steel beams after the 9&#x2F;11 terrorist attacks because you want to believe that it was an inside job.  I&#x27;m also seeing stuff pop up on here about Benford&#x27;s law which is uncertain science at best [1].<p>The next few weeks will be a difficult time for our country and we need to be prepared to accept the results of the election without devolving into conspiracy theories.
