Let me offer another one. Let&#x27;s go back to your example of the 66% weighted coin. Given the physical properties of the coin, different people could independently come to the same conclusion that the probability of heads is 66%. I would describe this as an &quot;objective&quot; probability, as it&#x27;s a nice representation of the available information, independently reproducible by different people, given the same information. It&#x27;s different than &quot;Bob arbitrarily decides that any yes&#x2F;no question has 50&#x2F;50 probability&quot;, which is inherently subjective.')
