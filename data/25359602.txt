Stack ranking culture has created a system in which every team must have at least one person who can be justifiably allocated to the lower end of the bell curve.<p>During review season, every manager&#x27;s worst nightmare is to not have any evidence that they can label someone a low performer.  Once one is identified, it&#x27;s in the manager&#x27;s interest to keep them in that low performer state for as long as possible. This makes it easier to reward high performers when raises and promotions are zero sum within a team. It also signals to upper management how keenly they can assess talent. In short, having an underperformer on the team is a wonderful asset for a manager.')
