To me that doesn&#x27;t mean 80 hour weeks, 40 years of working and dropping dead of exhaustion the day I retire. I&#x27;m alright for that, thanks. Would rather be slightly poorer financially (some might say &quot;less optimised&quot;) and richer for time. Time I can spend with my kids, looking at the sea, making music, reading. I&#x27;m ok for optimisation.<p>If there&#x27;s anything covid should teach us, it&#x27;s that optimisation to the max leaves us collectively and individually extremely fragile. We all need time and space and quiet and contingency, not &quot;optimisation&quot; and &quot;growth&quot;, not all the time, anyway.')
