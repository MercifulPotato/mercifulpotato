I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never heard of or thought of this until now. But my primary focus has been non-audio software through the pandemic, so I haven&#x27;t been actively trying to find solutions to this. Thank you.<p>What applications would you recommend? Can it also do video, if not each link in the chain, at least one camera for the conductor (the node providing the metronome audio)? I realize the conductor would hear nobody at all, until playing back a recording from the end of the chain. Playback of said recording could begin after the song, or one measure into the song if there are no tempo&#x2F;time changes (NINJAM style).')
