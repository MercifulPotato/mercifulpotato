Suddenly you can search for it.<p>Screen sharing can cause a meeting to drop out for no reason.<p>Want to upload a video? Or an image? Well, you can get an empty white box and when you click on it, you’ll get an empty white pop up. Great job.<p>Now, all of that said... that’s on windows.<p>Now try using it on a Mac. Ha! Haaaaaa!<p>Usable? Yes.<p>Good?? Not in my books.<p>It’s one of the poorest chat applications I’ve used, personally. &#x2F;shrug<p>To be fair, I haven’t had much trouble with the mobile app on iOS, but I don’t use it much, and it’s seems on-par to the slack one to me.<p>...but I certainly wouldn’t call it a marvel of engineering; it’s just deeply integrated with outlook and it’s mandatory; so people who don’t do “chat” also use it.')
