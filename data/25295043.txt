Mac&#x27;s look like a comfortable unixy environment. Preinstalled zsh, a fast terminal emulator (item), gnu utils. I&#x27;m sure I could make it work as a dev machine.<p>I have to admit that m1 macbook air battery life is compelling. A long time ago I was thinking about a perfect laptop that would be very light and have a 20+ hours of battery life. This comes close. Even though I have never used a laptop more than 5 hours on battery. And that happens a couple of times a year.<p>Hope you&#x27;ll enjoy your m1 air.')
