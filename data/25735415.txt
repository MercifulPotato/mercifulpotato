During his time there, he witnessed first-hand that access to private equity investments is only available to Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) individuals ($30MM+ in assets).<p>The lack of access to these investments to almost everyone presents a clear opportunity to create a marketplace similar to Cadre or EquityZen to democratize access to private equity investments.<p>Would love to take questions and feedback on the idea!')
