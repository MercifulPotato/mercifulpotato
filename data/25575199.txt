This frustrated my wife and I to no end as she&#x27;d be driving the car and I&#x27;d say &quot;you know you&#x27;re basically riding the shoulder&quot; and she would legitimately not realize the car was not centered.  (To be clear, not from lack of attention, but from over-judging the distance from the left lane.)  We had similar snips to your point about &quot;can&#x27;t you just visualize it in your head&quot; (As it turns out, no, but I had trouble wrapping my head around that at first.)<p>For almost a decade this just ended up in recurring irritation and arguments whenever we drove together, until, and kinda to the point of the GP, we realized I _cannot differentiate dark objects on black backgrounds_, despite otherwise excellent visual acuity and response times.  This may sound orthogonal to the car story, but to your point, after many inverses where she&#x27;d tease me about &quot;well maybe you can&#x27;t find your shirt just like I can&#x27;t find the center of the road&quot; we started to ask &quot;wait maybe we both actually just really suck at this one class of task.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not quite as stark as the &quot;can&#x27;t visualize 3d fields&quot; to be clear, but it was still a moment of &quot;wait, we&#x27;ve just been living in completely different perceptual universes for a long long time now.&quot; (E.g. we&#x27;d be in a dark room, I&#x27;d walk into a wall or be unable to find anything, she would think I was making a bad joke or being obtuse.)<p>I tend to believe that this runs so so so much deeper than we know, and have made it the subject of some sci fi shorts that I&#x27;ve been hacking on.  (That our mental models, ways of reasoning about the world, perceptions of reality, are truly distinct, the whole &quot;what if what you think is green is blue to me&quot; conundrum; and what happens when rational decisions coincide in pathological ways given varying, but individually rational and internally, although not externally consistent, perceptions)')
