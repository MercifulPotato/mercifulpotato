I think in some cases you can list stock holdings as collateral on a loan, in which case you can derive a similar cash benefit from the stocks as you would get from selling it, meanwhile not incurring the social and political consequences of selling your holding.<p>Bill, as I recall, had a much larger percentage of MSFT when he retired.
