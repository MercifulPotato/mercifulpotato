I remember being a little boy home from school, either sick or summertime, and saw this episode.  Well at least the first part where they had to freeze frame mid show and the show’s host Peter Tomarken walked out to tell everyone how Larson was making Game Show history.  I was too young too know much about statistics, patterns, etc. to understand how impossible this could be if the board was truly random.  Larson just seemed like an awkward but lucky and smart guy.<p>Hearing this full story some years later shows how much we were in the dark on so many situations before the internet.  As hard as you try to bulletproof things, there’s that one person who figures out a way to bypass it.')
