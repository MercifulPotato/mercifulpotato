The cone of possibilities is large when we know nothing. As we become more knowledgeable, we eliminate hypotheses. So, for instance, while you might have believed all sorts of nonsense about the size of people&#x27;s heads and whatnot a hundred years ago, you no longer can.<p>Hell, a thousand years ago, maybe you could have hypothesized the existence of dragons. No, the space of hypotheses is massive, and we keep cutting into it, making small enclaves of things that resist falsification.<p>This necessarily reduces diversity. I&#x27;d be a fool today to believe in miasma theory.')
