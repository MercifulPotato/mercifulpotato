They didn&#x27;t say &quot;the M1 is faster than any other processor out there&quot;.<p>The 5800X runs at 3.7 GHz, peaking at 4.8 GHz with all 8 cores.<p>The M1 runs at 3.2 GHz and 4 of the cores are low-power cores. <i>Of course the 5800X is faster; this shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise.</i><p>However, as the AnandTech review has pointed out with their benchmarks, if the M1 ran at the same speed as AMD&#x27;s processors, the M1 would be faster. That&#x27;s what Apple implied with the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest core&quot; thing. Even now, the M1 has 8 vs. AMD&#x27;s 4 instruction decoders, allowing it to process more instructions per clock cycle, with faster RAM.<p>They have cranked-up M1&#x27;s in the lab running at faster speeds that they&#x27;ve benchmarked, so they <i>know</i> what they said is true--even if they can&#x27;t say how they know yet.<p>The proper way to understand Apple-speak is &quot;even though the M1 is an entry-level chip, it&#x27;s more than competitive with Intel and AMD&#x27;s newest chips at a fraction of the power and heat. Wait until we crank up the speed and add more performance cores in future products to see what they can really do.&quot;')
