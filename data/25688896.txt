With the number of units needing to communicate some foolproof means for not using overlapping sequences of the one time pads between different parties is essential. Otherwise, a technique known as multiple anagramming can be used to reveal the plaintext.<p>Generating a secure paper and pencil one time pad is very easy on a computer and can be expected to be completely secure if used properly. Of course, distributing, coordinating, and updating the pads is a weakness of such a system.<p>In the electronic era, messages can still be encrypted with digital one-time pads and this was the case years ago when the secure “hot-line” between the Soviet Leadership and the US president used such a system to communicate. (The hot line wasn’t a phone but a teletype.) This was a perfect use case, a single pair of end points resulting in an unbreakable use of the digital one time pad.')
