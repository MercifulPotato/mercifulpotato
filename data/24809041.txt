Used it on and off for 10 years (but most actively 3). It&#x27;s a fine language.<p>To me using C++ means you are ready to give up a lot of time and energy in order to gain a complete control over certain aspects of your program. I was very much into that at the start of my career and gradually started drifting away to more immediate productivity while reserving the right to poke under the hood when necessary. This has led me to Rust and I find it to be the better natively compiled strongly &amp; statically typed language, but YMMV of course.<p>These days I reach for dynamic languages for personal projects and experiments. I want to sketch an idea and see if it works in the interval of 15 minutes to a day. Languages like C, C++, Rust, D, Nim, Zig, Fortran, Pascal, Haskell, I found to be generally terrible for when I am in a flow state. Using Elixir &#x2F; JS &#x2F; OCaml I found that I could iterate much faster.<p>I never will participate in a language war (although all of us have slipped on that ice more times than we&#x27;d like to admit, let&#x27;s be honest). But to me C++ is simply not productive. It feels like having to learn a 10x5 meters of control panel with dials, blinky lights, keys and levers. I know there are many who enjoy that -- more power to them. But I am not in that group.')
