That&#x27;s what I did for Microsoft. If you want to work on actual research yourself though, you&#x27;ll probably need a PhD. There are some non-PhD positions that do research-adjacent work like simulating, implementing &amp; refining researcher findings for the specific hardware the company is developing, but those are quite competitive&#x2F;difficult to get (I tried!)<p>Microsoft also has a fairly large team working on Q# and the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit. That would also involve research-adjacent things like efficiently compiling programs to specific quantum device layouts with appropriate error correction schemes, etc.')
