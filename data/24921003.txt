This means that if you were looking at the monitor and using the keyboard&#x2F;mouse then you wouldn’t be able to tell it’s a VM. If you had two of each peripheral, you could run two local machines from a single tower.<p>I think Linus did something similar with unraid (same idea) and ran 8 (?)  gaming VMs from a single tower using 8 GPUs, 8 monitors etc.<p>Note that nvidia doesn’t like you using GPUs in VMs and actively fights against it in the drivers but there are workarounds.<p>*not actually vnc, something propriety.')
