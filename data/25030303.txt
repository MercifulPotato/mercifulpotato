We need more choices!<p>I got so sick of these kind of shenanigans, I built a simple, non-mobile phone with a Raspberry Pi 3B+, a Raspberry Pi 7 inch touchscreen, and a Logitech headset.  It runs off Wi-Fi or Ethernet only.<p>It does voice and SMS only, but it does what it does very well. I wrote all the software myself (Python3 and C).<p>I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily driver for over a year now.<p>I&#x27;m planning to make it available to the public soon.
