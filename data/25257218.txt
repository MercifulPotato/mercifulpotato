I&#x27;m not born in wealth or in a wealthy country, I had to work a lot to get out of the initial hand life dealt me, including getting out of my home country.<p>I won&#x27;t sacrifice another 10-15 years of my life while I&#x27;m young to have a possibility to have all the time in the world when I&#x27;m 60.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of perspective as you pointed out.')
