Item(by='jhatax', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606499944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230631, text='1) you can submit application paperwork 6-months prior to the 5-year mark.<p>2) I did this on my own. It’s quite straightforward and there are tons of great resources online.<p>Two things to help you:\n1) use Adobe Acrobat Reader to fill the form. The forms were created with Adobe’s tools (or so it seems), so validation is built&#x2F;in. Also, there are sections where the response to the first question dictates the next few responses; with Reader, if you don’t check the box, you don’t need to fill N&#x2F;A in the rest of the fields for that section. This might seem like a small detail but when dealing with USCIS, you don’t want to take any chances. With the right tool, you don’t have to worry.<p>2) if you don’t hear back on your application post the interview stage, request an appointment with the reason that you want to provide additional details or answer follow-up questions. My application got “lost” in a pile somewhere and took 75-days to make it through to the step wherein I could schedule an oath ceremony. The wait is nerve-wracking, to say the least.<p>Good luck and send me a message if you need any help. Once again, not a lawyer; just another immigrant who went through naturalization (and now filing of my dad’s GC) on his own.')
