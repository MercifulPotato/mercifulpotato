A person has more capacity for pain than a mosquito, and in turn the mosquito has more capacity for pain than does a heap of sand.<p>I figure plants lie further down the ranking than mosquitoes, for the reasons you&#x27;ve just explained. They&#x27;re certainly further down than farmyard animals. It would be considerable moral progress to switch from torturing billions of chickens and pigs, to torturing billions of plants (and that&#x27;s ignoring that a plant in a farm environment is likely &#x27;happier&#x27;, in its own terms, than a livestock animal).<p>A vaguely related TED talk on how brains ultimately exist to orchestrate movement, and essentially nothing else: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7s0CpRfyYp8?t=15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7s0CpRfyYp8?t=15</a>')
