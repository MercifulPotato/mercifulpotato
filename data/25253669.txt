I did a lot of ending puzzles and knew a lot about openings and variations at age 5, learned mostly because a father of a friend was very enthusiastic about it.<p>I quit playing around age 7 because some kids there were really out of my league and there wasn&#x27;t enough government or support for me to continue playing given that I wasn&#x27;t the best.
