In theory, you could end up with a point where they all met again, however due to the focusing effects of the various landscape, and ambient pressure differences, this would rather be a diffuse area than a concentrated point, just like the lines where the sound met wouldn&#x27;t be straight either.<p>This, combined with that the fact that on the on the &quot;other&quot; side of the world it was really only detectable by barometric readings means that you would be hard pressed to notice it, even along those lines and or point.')
