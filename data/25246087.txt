Freedom and democracy doesn’t just come for free.<p>Take another period in US history... at a time of another pandemic, the Spanish flu, and a World war.<p>The 1918 Sedition Act [1] made illegal the use of &quot;disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language&quot; about the United States.<p>The effects of this law were so successful, that at a time when a pandemic killed 20 million Americans, the newspapers never wrote about the flu. In fact this is why that virus was named the Spanish flu, since during the war Spain was neutral and allowed its press to freely report on it. Not because the virus came from Spain.<p>History of course repeats itself. But the real lesson for us is that we need to always be vigilant. And it’s not a time to despair that things are at their worst, or can’t get better, or everything is downhill.<p>Instead look at how far we’ve come. Look at what we’ve overcome in history.<p>We just need to keep moving the ball forward.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sedition_Act_of_1918" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sedition_Act_of_1918</a>')
