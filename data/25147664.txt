They were just laypeople who just bought it because they thought it was cool, and actually were surprised by all the limitations afterward.<p>To apple only made their money on the power of FAME and &quot;coolness&quot; only. I dont see how the &quot;product&quot; has ever been any better at any point. (Ok except the iphone in the first smartphone years.)')
