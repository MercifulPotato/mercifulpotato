This complicates interpretation of the findings in Finland and Sweden. It seems likely that some as yet unidentified additional factor was operating in Sweden and Finland. The findings from the VAESCO project and further investigations in Finland and Sweden, may help clarify the determinants of any increased risk of narcolepsy, which currently appears to be restricted to the months following vaccination and by age group and country.”<p>What’s certainly true that for some effects to be observable, millions have to be vaccinated first.<p>2013:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-narcolepsy-vaccine-pandemrix-idUSBRE90L07H20130122" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-narcolepsy-vaccine-pandem...</a><p>“In total, the GSK shot was given to more than 30 million people in 47 countries during the 2009-2010 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.”<p>“Independent teams of scientists have published peer-reviewed studies from Sweden, Finland and Ireland showing the risk of developing narcolepsy after the 2009-2010 immunization campaign was between seven and 13 times higher for children who had Pandemrix than for their unvaccinated peers.”<p>“Europe’s drugs regulator has ruled Pandemrix should no longer be used in people aged under 20.”')
