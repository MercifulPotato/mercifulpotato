Nvidia didn&#x27;t care to upstream things and that caused them not to support Wayland and many other modern use cases for years.<p>Today it&#x27;s less relevant, since usage of Nvidia on Linux is gradually dropping, so their damage to the progress is also diminishing thanks to that. Wayland compositors&#x27; developers can simply say - we don&#x27;t support the blob and don&#x27;t plan to and be done with it. In the past it was much harder, due to how many Linux users had Nvidia still while alternatives were way less viable.')
