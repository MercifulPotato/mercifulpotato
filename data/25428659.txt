Even outside of games it can be hard to find something that feels like it matters and is important (even if you can make money and be otherwise better off in your life by doing it). Curiosity can also pull you in a thousand different directions.<p>Yes, pretty similar for me. Therefore I quite envy people that can get\nthat much out of just games, and I&#x27;m even struggling to find something in\nthe real world.<p>I think the modern kind of work can feel quite pointless, because being\njust a part of a complex machinery can make it hard to see what you&#x27;re\nreally provoking. And if you&#x27;re a bit of a misfit for the modern culture,\ncan&#x27;t get meaning out of money, status and career, then also these\ngame-like achievements aren&#x27;t an option.<p>But life in general is just quite strange if you think long and deep\nenough about it. So it&#x27;s pretty nice if you can loose yourself in such a simple\nthing as a game. I really think that being able to look at life as a kind\nof game makes it a lot easier, because taking it really seriously is just\ntoo painful.<p>Well, seems to be one of my more melancholic days. ;)')
