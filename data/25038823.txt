It simply said they&#x27;re &quot;trying to contact me and the interview will only take 5 minutes.&quot; However, having not scheduled any interviews with the government I had no idea what they were talking about, so I chalked it up to spam or polling attempts and ignored several similar calls.<p>I&#x27;m now wondering if it was an attempt at contact tracing. Had they simply stated what they wanted in the message I would have been pretty likely to call them back myself or answer a later call.<p>I have no idea where they got my cell phone number from, but the whole thing seems poorly handled at best. Anyone with legitimate business will state the nature of that business and allow for a return call. There&#x27;s just so many solutions to this problem but nearly zero aligned with incentives.')
