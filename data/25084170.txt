Communicate with the iframe via postMessage only, be strict about message origins, and have limited trust in those messages, too. Strict CSP policies and use the &#x27;sandbox&#x27; iframe attribute.<p>iframes are cruddy, but they are designed for this - the long era of iframe-based embedded advertisements caused vendors to double-down on those security policies.<p>Observable doesn&#x27;t use WebWorkers, duktape, or a custom JavaScript interpreter. If you had sandboxed JavaScript that didn&#x27;t need access to the DOM, those might be options, but if you want people to write JavaScript like usually, they don&#x27;t do any good.')
