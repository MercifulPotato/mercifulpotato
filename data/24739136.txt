At my child&#x27;s school (a large high school) they have had a handful of infections.  As they began the year, each student who sat adjacent to an infected person was quarantined for two weeks.<p>Reportedly, those quarantined students were not testing positive.  They have, in the last week, ceased to quarantine the adjacent students as it is now in line with the state guidelines.  Seems encouraging, if true.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wdmcs.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;quarantine-rule-changes-wdmcs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wdmcs.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;quarantine-rule-changes-wdmcs&#x2F;</a>')
