That&#x27;s insanely regressive.<p>My understanding is that it&#x27;s all the deductions that make the US system on the whole quite regressive.<p>In any case US taxpayers don&#x27;t appear to be getting good value for their money.<p>They do have a pretty insane military though...<p>The Economist article is paywalled so I can&#x27;t read beyond the intro. But the headline is intriguing: &quot;gov&#x27;t spending is not.&quot; That seems to be me to be the crux of it; Canada&#x27;s tax system isn&#x27;t terribly effective and we&#x27;ve been running deficits for seemingly forever, but at least all that debt is on the whole focused on things like health and education; while the US has an absolutely huge debt that seems to produce little of value for its population.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll add that Canada is no worker&#x27;s paradise. Inequality here is still very pronounced, and the gov&#x27;t is also involved in all sorts of stupid subsidies on failing industries, and seems unable to effectively build new infrastructure. And our housing market just gets more and more irrational every year.')
