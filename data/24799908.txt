Item(by='Udo', descendants=None, kids=[24800439], score=None, time=1602849550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799591, text='&gt; <i>I&#x27;m 100% atheist but I&#x27;ve considered reading the bible because it&#x27;s culturally significant. But isn&#x27;t just a bunch of boring and inconsistent tales? is there really anything to be learned from the bible?</i><p>I went to a school that taught ancient Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. With that came loads of bible passages to translate. Having grown up a non-believer (<i>many people tried to literally &quot;cure&quot; that during my lifetime, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be thrilled to know there is a simple drug I could take to make me normal</i>) I can honestly say it&#x27;s about what you&#x27;d expect from religious texts of those time periods. I found it less relatable than, say, Greek mythology.<p>What I found interesting is how many parts modern Christians habitually ignore, either because they&#x27;d be arrested if they&#x27;d follow them, or because those parts don&#x27;t fit in with their personal beliefs. Of course, the entire corpus of text has also seen numerous redactions, in an effort to streamline it and make it more coherent (with mixed results).<p>Is it culturally significant? Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure. The Bible as an idea sure is, and certain famous passages are. But a given group&#x27;s or individual&#x27;s interpretation of it seems more informative, and that&#x27;s often only losely based on those ancient texts.<p>Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think there is anything in there to convince a non-believer of the existence of dieties, much less that one specific pantheon. And to be fair I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the authors had in mind. It was probably intended as a shared folklore for groups that already strongly believe. Conversion, I suspect, comes through missionaries, not through the text.')
