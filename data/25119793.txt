There is a wide, wide rift between what users desire and what will actually solve their problems. I&#x27;m paid to reconcile that difference.<p>I do not intend to design society. But then, people are, as we speak. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s better--letting them design for what people want regardless of what it does to society, or designing for a society that&#x27;s better regardless of what individuals desire.<p>We&#x27;re primitive creatures. All of us, myself included. We&#x27;re mostly run by our lizard brains, going after what spurts the happy chemicals into our brains.<p>I don&#x27;t think society should be shaped to battle against human nature; but I certainly don&#x27;t think uncontrolled human nature should shape society. As in all things, a balance.<p>That is what design is, always.')
