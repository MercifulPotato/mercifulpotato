You cannot optimize for both. The choice for high throughput makes sense for batch programs, like compilers, command-line tools, generating analytics reports, etc. Choosing low-latency makes sense for web services and the backend services behind them.<p>As fanout increases, the GC latency in backend services becomes much more important.')
