I&#x27;m not shocked mushrooms would grow in blood.  Their air needs are pretty low, and might be solved by the ambient level in blood.  Afaik the light is primarily to signal time of year to the mushrooms, they don&#x27;t photosynthesize.<p>I am surprised the body didn&#x27;t kill the spores off though.  I&#x27;m very curious what portion of his symptoms were from the spores directly, and what portion were from the body&#x27;s immune reaction going absolutely crazy.<p>If the symptoms are from the mushrooms and not from an immune response, that seems medically interesting.  It might have applications in drug delivery systems, and in a long shot, maybe things like synthetic organs.  Keeping the body&#x27;s immune system from killing itself seems like a major hurdle to that.')
