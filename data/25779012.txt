I can’t think of a single thing that they produce that I would ever pay them money for other than CPUs, especially if they aren’t relevant in the CPU world anymore. Intel has tried to get into so many other markets over the years, but the company’s culture and the nature of their high margin, high R&amp;D business made it impossible to compete in those other markets.<p><i>Intel&#x27;s productions nodes might be behind TSMC&#x27;s but they are still quite valuable, not all chips need 5nm processes. Heck we could say most chips don&#x27;t need it.</i><p>That’s a very different market with very different margins. If they shrank so much that they became like Maxim or something, then that’s really not much different than going out of business altogether.')
