The main problem with disabling write flushing is what happens if the OS crashes or the power goes out. Doing periodic backups&#x2F;restores provides a &quot;last known good state&quot; to revert to, but you&#x27;ll still lose all the writes between the last backup and when you crashed. Depending on your workload this might be fine, but I doubt the COO is going to be pleased when he finds out you lost all customer orders from today.<p>The bit about &quot;restoring periodically&quot; also doesn&#x27;t make any sense because such events are easily detectable. There&#x27;s no need to constantly take the system offline to do a restore. Disabling write flushing isn&#x27;t going to cause increased bitrot.')
