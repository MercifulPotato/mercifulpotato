Semi was acquired by Apple, a major part of their &quot;secret sauce&quot; was a custom cell library. And then Intrinsity, a few years later, also seemed to be using custom cells on Samsung&#x27;s process. Is this recollection &#x2F; understanding correct? Is Apple still using custom cell libraries rather than TSMC&#x27;s standard library?')
