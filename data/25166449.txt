It&#x27;s easier to do a wide decoder thanks to ARMv8&#x27;s fixed-length instructions, but that&#x27;s more or less the only difference that results from the ISA. And only Apple is even taking advantage of that currently - all the ARM CPU designs are 4-wide decode. Same as pretty much every modern x86 CPU.<p>Do you think Amazon will be better at design &amp; fabrication than Intel (when they get their shit together) or AMD? Do you expect Amazon to actually throw Apple&#x27;s level of R&amp;D money &amp; acquisitions at the problem? And when&#x2F;if they do, why would you expect any meaningful difference at the end of the day on anything? People love to talk about supposed ARM power efficiency, but the 64-core Epyc Rome at 200w is around 3w per CPU core. Which is half the power draw of an M1 firestorm core. The M1&#x27;s firestorm is also faster in such a comparison, but the point is power isn&#x27;t a magical ARM advantage, and x86 isn&#x27;t inherently some crazy power hog.<p>Phoronix put Graviton2 to the test vs. Epyc Rome and the results ain&#x27;t pretty: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=epyc-vs-graviton2&amp;num=8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=epyc-vs-...</a><p>&quot;When taking the geometric mean of all these benchmarks, the EPYC 7742 without SMT enabled was about 46% faster than the Graviton2 bare metal performance. The EPYC 7742 with SMT (128 threads) increased the lead to about 51%, due to not all of the benchmarks being multi-thread focused.&quot;<p>Graviton2 being a bit cheaper doesn&#x27;t mean much when you need 50% more instances.<p>But right now there&#x27;s only a single company that makes ARM look good and that&#x27;s Apple. And Apple hasn&#x27;t been in the server game for a long, long time now. Everyone else&#x27;s ARM CPU cores pretty much suck. Maybe Nvidia&#x27;s recent acquisition will change things, who knows. But at the end of the day if AMD keeps things up, or Intel gets back on track, there really doesn&#x27;t look to be a bright future for ARM outside of Apple&#x27;s ecosystem and the existing ARM markets.')
