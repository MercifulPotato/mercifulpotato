Even in these cases I suspect status is some component though not the driving force (how much of a role it plays I think varies depending on the person and what they value).<p>People want to do something important&#x2F;have purpose - I think it&#x27;s hard to disentangle this from status because it&#x27;s so tied up in how we see ourselves and what we often consider important. Millions of years of selective pressure and social behavior&#x2F;hierarchies of intelligent primates can&#x27;t really just be ignored.<p>There are some outliers, but I&#x27;m generally skeptical. I tend to think often the DNGAF persona is done because it&#x27;s a signal of high status to not care about your status. I suppose at some level it&#x27;s real though.')
