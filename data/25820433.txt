It feels like a form of signalling - &quot;I do this&quot; where &quot;this&quot; is some high-skilled activity, particularly with the real intention of just ending up in management just to make more money.<p>And, regardless of skills, connections, etc., I still am concerned of any change in my job status. Career narratives or hoping to join the managerial classes don&#x27;t pay bills or save for retirement. I wish I gave more stock to this idea when younger.')
