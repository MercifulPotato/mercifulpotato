A few things I have in mind:<p>First, I want my browser to be upfront about what they are doing. &quot;We monetize through ads distribution.&quot; Honestly that won&#x27;t throw me off. I don&#x27;t dislike ads. In fact, I used to insist on not running ad-blockers when YouTube started to play ads. &quot;that&#x27;s how you support internet&quot;, I thought to myself at the time. My attitude changes when I realize YouTube is not a great representative for the internet.<p>Second, I want to see more diverse ads. Not new amazon prime titles, not the same mobile games, not Udemy, not square space, not the same thing over and over. I remember the first few years the ads on podcasts are quite interesting and diverse, and I can even find helpful business and products from the ads. Maybe it is because the entry fee is low so small businesses have a chance to market themselves. And maybe all you need is to write a appealing script instead of hiring professionals to make a Hollywood grade video with celebrities shouting brand names. Unfortunately that dynamics is certainly lost today.<p>I know I am asking too much as someone who&#x27;s opinion does not matter at all. But place like Show HN and products hunts kind of give me hope that someday maybe paid ads can become something useful instead of hateful, someday maybe people with good products and honest marketing strategy can have the equal chances to get attention as big players.')
