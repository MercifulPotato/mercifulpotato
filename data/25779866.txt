Snap&#x27;s are basically docker gone wrong. Snaps are sandboxed, blocking access to NFS shares which I use extensively. Under Ubuntu, Chromium is usually broke (apt-get installs a deb that then installs a snap); You have to install either a debian .deb or use a PPA to make it work. I love that Ubuntu is directly including ZFS, but the distro has gotten so bad that I don&#x27;t want to go near it anymore. Arch works, and works well.')
