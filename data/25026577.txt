I think you may be mistaking my comment for a different opinion that you disagree with.<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; In any case, before commenting on a complex subject of research with a long history, my recommendation remains to first become well acquainted with the subject and its history. Otherwise, one runs the risk of appearing confused.<p>Sorry, I did misunderstand what you were saying.<p>I do find it somewhat baffling how you&#x27;re talking as if 1980s terminology is today&#x27;s terminology, or that everyone should just recognize it as the default way of things. As much as you argue I should adopt the subject&#x27;s history, I&#x27;m saying you should adopt its present.<p>The point you&#x27;re making would have held fine two decades ago, but as a description of modern ML, it&#x27;s like calling a sedan a cart.
