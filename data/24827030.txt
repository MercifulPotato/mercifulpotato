Started coding at 12. Dropped out of school &amp; wrote my first mobile app at 16. Been in a couple of start-ups.<p>After all these years I realised I&#x27;m more interested in living things. I have recently gotten into an (imo, extremely) decent job and finally have the confidence again to think about what I really want to do in life.<p>I would like to switch fields to medicines or bio-engineering. How difficult will this be? Does having ~8 years of software engineering experience help although I don&#x27;t have any degrees and formal qualifications?<p>For anyone who&#x27;ve been there done that, what advises would you give to someone like me? Thanks!<p>p.s. I can code in coq[1] and I have strong interest in applying automated theorem proving in consciousness research and BCI. And so I want to acquaint myself with medical studies &amp; bio-engineering-specific stuff before I get too old.<p>[1]: I&#x27;ve done a Ph.D course in programming language theory at 19 when I was vagabonding in a univ with my older sister&#x27;s ID. And I&#x27;ve also done some work in combinatorics (never got published; just posted on arxiv &amp; shared with friends in academia). I&#x27;m currently working on a new proof for an old theorem using coq and hope to get it published.')
