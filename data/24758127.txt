Item(by='Symmetry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602529419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757711, text='Unfortunately a lot of police training in the US is about lowering inhibitions about being the first to use violence, google &quot;warrior training&quot; for more details.<p>But I think that is a very real problem in regards to the sort of late night kinetic entries that result in the deaths of so many civilians and cops.  I think that SWAT teams can have their place in large metros like LA where the sort of events that called for them happen every once in a while.  But in third or fourth tier cities the local government can&#x27;t afford the sort of intensive training required for a job like that but also those teams are always being sent on drug raids or things like that because there just aren&#x27;t any incidents that would justify the existence of the teams otherwise.  But sending a SWAT team into a situation that isn&#x27;t already violent is just a terrible idea and US army forces, for instance, make an effort to avoid late night raids in a way that I wish our law enforcement community would follow.')
