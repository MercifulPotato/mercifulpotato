There is a million functions for reshaping multidimensional arrays. The syntax is uncannily like Matlab: retrieving the last element of an array with `[end]`, indexing into a collection with an array of booleans, element-wise versions of operators prepended with dot, etc.<p>However, I keep running into niggling corner cases that kind of make Julia&#x27;s promise of a powerful, extensible, yet intuitive type system less convincing.<p>ME: I want to write a custom getproperty() for Tuple!<p>JULIA: No.<p>ME: I want to broadcast over the fields of a NamedTuple!<p>JULIA: Not allowed.<p>ME: I want to get a view, not copy, with `@view M[m:n, r:s]`, but also get the ability to specify a default for out-of-range indices, like `get()` allows.<p>JULIA: I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t let you do that.')
