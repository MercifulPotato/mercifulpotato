How do France and the UK, for example, secure their critical infrastructure networks? The U.S. strategy of just contracting out all these essential service is revealing its pressure points. Seems that the USG insists on just cutting checks to these companies like SolarWinds, which are more interested in gaining clients, generating revenue, and marketing than effectively engineering durable solutions. Another factor is probably NIST&#x27;s questionable practices about password hygiene (requiring them to be changed every 30-60 days).')
