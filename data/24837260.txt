Brilliant people who need to understand everything to the bare essentials. And -- they produce strikingly simple solutions to almost every technical problem in the house.<p>Fairly often, though, this mindset seems to come with quite a complicated, uneasy personality.<p>My dad was a kind person, but I remember something he said about his civil engineering studies in the 1970s Soviet Union: for certain exams, not a single mistake was allowed. One wrong answer, and you failed. For if you build a house and miscalculate (e.g.) the needed strength of a crucial beam, you&#x27;ll risk with fatalities.<p>I&#x27;m not an engineer, and I&#x27;ve always been in the &quot;why might this work&quot; boat myself.
