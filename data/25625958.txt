Which is fine!  But not everybody likes that kind of show.  It also doesn&#x27;t have the same addictive amount of leaving each episode on a cliffhanger the way more recent shows are written.<p>I never watched the Sopranos or West Wing, so I can&#x27;t speak to them.  I enjoyed The Wire (bought the box set!), but it&#x27;s still a slow-paced drama.  If that&#x27;s your jam, it&#x27;s fantastic.  If it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s still worth a shot (it&#x27;s that good), but it&#x27;s not &quot;try it for 18 hours if you don&#x27;t like the genre&quot; good.  All IMO of course.  And full disclosure:  I&#x27;m not a big fan of dramas, but The Wire still grabbed me.  Hence my caution that it&#x27;s somewhat slow compared to other fare.<p>I should watch it again, it&#x27;s been a long time and it is worth it.')
