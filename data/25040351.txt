Item(by='makecheck', descendants=None, kids=[25043664, 25040511], score=None, time=1604958424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040278, text='Delivery tracking can be extremely misleading.<p>For instance, a sender can “create a shipping label”, and suddenly it has a tracking number and looks ready to ship soon.  In reality, it may literally not even be <i>in a box yet</i>, much less anywhere near a shipping warehouse!  Things can stay in these limbo states <i>for weeks</i> and claim to be “shipping” or whatever else.  Not to name names but ReserveBar did this to me and I’m still bitter about it (ended up cancelling an order after being lied to about its true state of shipment for over a month).')
