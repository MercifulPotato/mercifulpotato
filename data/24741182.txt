Everything involving instructions in the CPU is extremely performance critical and cross-cutting, so designing an interface which allows custom instructions without utterly destroying performance seems like quite a feat. I&#x27;ve a feeling the memory interface is a much more natural place for any integration (this is how it works on any existing FPGA + CPU chips)')
