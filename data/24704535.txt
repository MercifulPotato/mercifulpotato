I&#x27;ve never hit the point personally where I&#x27;d prefer death to diabetes, but I&#x27;ve certainly been close, and were it not for a pretty fortunate life - good insurance, ability to afford a good doctor who is knowledgable in this field, ability to afford a CGM and never have to worry about paying for testing strips (another ridiculous expense - frankly far worse than insulin given how much larger of a population it impacts) - I could certainly see myself in their shoes.')
