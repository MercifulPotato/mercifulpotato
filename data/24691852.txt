The expectation seems to be that, if a variable was created as the result of a function call with side effects, <i>every</i> use of that variable on the right-hand-side of an equals will result in an additional function call, with side effects.  I suppose that that&#x27;s mathematical equality, as defined in math papers, but we aren&#x27;t writing math papers.  Programmers would find that behavior to be <i>much</i> less useful than the current one.<p>[Edit:  I mean, I guess that the proposed approach allows &quot;algebraic reasoning&quot;, which some people find helpful...]')
