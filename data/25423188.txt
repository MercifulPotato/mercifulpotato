I worked with UX teams on Cloud a lot. They _are_ brilliant. But every time the lifecycle seems to be:<p>1) They come out with fantastic mocks.\n2) They run this by some internal committee and the design gets degraded.\n3) Repeat step 2 10-20 times.\n4) The final result is tiny incremental changes that look like the original UI was slightly re-shaped.\n5) Rinse, repeat.')
