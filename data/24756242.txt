It starts with Holocaust denial, then pedophilia advocacy, then saying blacks are racially inferior to whites, then to plain old anti-Semitism, then to saying men have higher iq than women, then to militant vegans (&quot;meat is murder you say, incitement!&quot;), then to people wishing that Trump will die in Covid, then to people arguing that U.S. soldiers should be drone-striked.<p>Two weeks ago Facebook banned a seminar arranged by a U.S. university because one of the speakers was Leila Khaled. A 76-year-old lady who hijacked two planes 50 years ago. How can what she had to say be so &quot;dangerous&quot; that Facebook had to ban her? Sooner or later, this censorship will encroach on what you have to say too.')
