I agree, not everyone need software for modeling or design, but again, looking at Grammarly, which is pretty useful addon, and it&#x27;s only available for MS Office. &quot;Average user&quot; may start from Libre Office, but end up disappointed, why addon developers don&#x27;t care about him. And they don&#x27;t care (well, maybe just deeply concerned), because investing 20-30% of the whole development time for supporting 1% of user base is financially pointless idea.')
