Over time we are gathering more and more data that shows that may just not be the case.  As we&#x27;ve built better and better telescopes we&#x27;ve found no evidence of Type III Civilizations.  We&#x27;ve intercepted no interstellar communications or even errant radio waves.  As we learn more about other stars we find that many of them probably create hostile environments for life on nearby planets due to solar activity.  On top of that a number of studies have come out recently like these two:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s43247-020-00057-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s43247-020-00057-8</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-06-advanced-civilization-universe.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-06-advanced-civilization-universe...</a><p>that, through the use of models and simulations, come to the conclusion that we are dang lucky to have evolved on the Earth at all.<p>While I don&#x27;t know that I was ever a believer in the Earth being visited by ETs, I always thought that we wound find evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy any day now.  For the reasons above, I&#x27;m less and less convinced of that with every passing year.')
