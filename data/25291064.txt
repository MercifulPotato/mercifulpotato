The domestic cocaine industry in Colombia is irrelevant. The international market is what drives production. Regardless of domestic legality, international trade isn&#x27;t going to become legal just because Colombia wants it to. Even if the US didn&#x27;t interfere internally, they (and the UN and others) wouldn&#x27;t change their stance on international trade. The government purchasing domestic production would only <i>increase</i> domestic production, and when they ultimately stopped buying it up due to cost and cancelled the entire program, the international market would be flooded with even more cocaine, and the economic disruption would cause even more internal conflict.<p>Cocaine should be legal everywhere. It&#x27;s not, though, so this is a stupid idea. A giant unsustainable agricultural subsidy isn&#x27;t going to reduce domestic production when the entire market is international. On the contrary, it will only increase the size of the market and the amount of violent criminal behavior associated with it. By all means decriminalize consumption (which they&#x27;ve already done), but until there&#x27;s a legal international market, don&#x27;t subsidize it.')
