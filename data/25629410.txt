The problem is that Industry has infiltrated itself into the system and turned the &quot;Research Objective&quot; into &quot;Profit Motive&quot;. This has to be eradicated completely. Others in this same thread have also proposed some ideas and i will try to add to it;<p>* Establish a network of &quot;Research Universities&quot; from each country in the World (sort of UN of Universities). The poorer countries can be partially funded by richer countries. This is to ensure that knowledge flows are not constrained due to lack of resources.<p>* Research in the various Sciences have to be clearly identified as &quot;Critical&quot; or Not. The former is funded and managed completely differently than the latter. For example, research in vaccines&#x2F;cancer is considered critical while research in &quot;battery chemistry&quot;(currently a hot area of research) is not. In the former case, all we keep tabs on is &quot;some progress&quot; and not necessarily an external deadline i.e. researchers are given the freedom to keep working on it with self-imposed and self-defined milestones.<p>* All &quot;money making&quot; (eg. licenses&#x2F;patents&#x2F;royalties etc.) from Research is to be shared between Researchers, Institution and Industry (where applicable).<p>* All &quot;Research&quot; in Universities get funding from the following sources, some with constraints and some without;<p>----- 1) Govt. grant as part of yearly budget with no strings attached. This is taxpayer money and any output is available to the public.<p>----- 2) Academia&#x2F;Industry tie-up (eg. VC&#x2F;Angel money) where all stakeholders needs are considered. However if the research is considered &quot;critical&quot; Industry needs may be waived.<p>----- 3) &quot;Corporate Social Responsibility&quot;(CSR) money from all large corporations&#x2F;rich folks etc.<p>----- 4) Revenue&#x2F;Profit from University &quot;businesses&quot; like Education etc.<p>* Finally, No &quot;Research&quot; project should ever be overseen by purely &quot;Administrative&#x2F;Finance&#x2F;MBA&quot; types. Only Core Domain Experts should be granted oversight with the above mentioned helping as needed.')
