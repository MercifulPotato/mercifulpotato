But while waiting for the best light or long exposures I snap off a couple pictures on the phone. And I was just thinking, if I&#x27;d just post to Instagram and not print, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even bother with the fullframe camera - a nice hike without 20lbs of gear and as great photos if you don&#x27;t need the resolution&#x2F;detail. HDR+ and the other computational photography goodness makes for great photos straight out of the phone and a tiny bit of editing then goes long way.<p>I bet if you showed 20 non-photographers 2 images a phone screen, one from the phone and one fullframe edited, most wouldn&#x27;t appreciate the difference.<p>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t give up my camera for many shots but I can understand why many people do. Post-processing camera raws is definitely more cumbersome than quickly editing photos on a phone.')
