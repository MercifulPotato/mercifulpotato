There are marches and protests against femicide.<p>Not to say that public attention should never focus on the ordeals of any specific group that doesn&#x27;t hold the #1 prize in victimhood.<p>But the thing is that you will read all these headlines and start to wonder what Mexico has against its women, and that life here must be especially tough for women when it comes to staying alive. When Mexico comes up in conversation, you might start mentioning things like &quot;oof, really hard to be woman there right now!&quot;<p>Eventually, you might not realize that men are the victims of 90% of all homicides in Mexico.')
