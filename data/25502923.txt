Consensus could have authority in democratic context, but that isn&#x27;t the meaning of &quot;argument by &lt;X&gt;&quot; which is the distilled context of some basis of proof. You could just as easily link consensus to &quot;Argumentum ad populum&quot;.<p>In fact, this is spelled out on wikipedia: The two are similar, but not the same - both are &quot;Fallacies of relevance&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argumentum_ad_populum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argumentum_ad_populum</a><p>This doesn&#x27;t really apply either though, because we are talking consensus among a specialized group of experts&#x2F;peers, which seems to me a lot more relevant that general consensus. Appeal to authority isn&#x27;t always fallicious: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argument_from_authority" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argument_from_authority</a>')
