(Tesla doesn&#x27;t spend money on ads, but they spend $50-100 million annually on marketing.) Additionally, a number of QC-related costs (like taking back lemon cars, or paying for repairs before cars are accepted by customers) are excluded from the calculation of automotive sales revenues.<p>But that&#x27;s not all: Tesla <i>adds</i> regulatory credit sales to their &quot;automotive&quot; gross margin figures.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s right, Tesla&#x27;s &quot;automotive&quot; gross margin isn&#x27;t just vehicle sales like it is for other car manufacturers. For example, look at Q2 2020 filings. The clean-car credits that they sell to other manufacturers are treated as automotive revenue, and that accounting chicanery is entirely what lets Tesla claim a 20+% gross margin on their vehicles. (The clean-car credits are also what lets Tesla claim to be profitable, though it has yet to make a profit actually selling cars.)<p>Without treating the sale of clean-car credits as automotive revenue, Tesla&#x27;s gross margins are <i>at best</i> in line with industry gross margins (and fall below industry margins once you apply automotive GAAP to standardize the financials).')
