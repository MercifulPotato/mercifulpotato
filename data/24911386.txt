It’s a data structure that’s renderer-agnostic. It can be rendered to HTML, or to a live DOM, or to other outputs. IIRC, Netflix uses React to render at least some components on entirely non-web interfaces like smart TVs.<p>To me, that fact is what makes React (and other libraries like Preact that have a similar interface) more compelling than the template-oriented alternatives. As far as I’m aware, Flutter takes basically the same approach, just with different syntax. I believe the same is true of SwiftUI. And Elm, and the various UI libraries for Clojure.<p>And as another comment mentioned, you can use a variety of CSS-in-JS approaches, which at least last time I looked is actually the more common approach in the React community.<p>Add in TypeScript (or whatever static type system in whatever compile to JS language), and you’re basically comparing bike sheds at this point.')
