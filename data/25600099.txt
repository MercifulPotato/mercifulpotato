Second, that Wikileaks published the information they received. That is not a convincing argument.<p>If further evidence did emerge clearly showing Assange knowingly and actively assisting Russia, my position on the legality of his actions may change, and punishing him would not violate his rights.<p>&gt;And it wasn&#x27;t a foreign spy agency feeding them stolen materials to leak for destructive purposes<p>No, but many of the CIA&#x27;s worldwide operations are exactly that. Plus, I don&#x27;t find a domestic spy agency feeding them stolen materials for destructive purposes much better.<p>&gt;Yeah that&#x27;s not what he said<p>Those are my words, based on similar trials I have mentioned. He may have had other choices, at this point he would not receive a fair trial. Zaid already believes he deserves the punishment, like you do, so you both seem unconcerned about whether his trial would be fair.')
