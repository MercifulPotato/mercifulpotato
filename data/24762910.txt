A sufficiently advanced eavesdropper could record the small variation in the frequency transmitted due to the movement of the transmitter.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really possible, but sound has been reconstructed from video of the movement of leaves of plants or empty potato chip bags. Is it so strange that the signal from a transmitter might be carrying info you don&#x27;t expect?<p>Sound is such a strange beast. The keys you press on a keyboard can be reconstructed from audio because of differences in the sound of each key. Cryptographic keys can be reconstructed from the sound of a processor decrypting specially computed messages. I even read a theory about a bios worm that can infect nearby air-gapped computers via sound waves.<p>Am I paranoid? Perhaps.<p>Are these things possible? Perhaps.')
