It seems to agree that Gebru resigned and then complains about her being fired.<p>&gt; “Dr. Gebru’s dismissal has been framed as a resignation, but in Dr. Gebru’s own words, she did not resign,” the letter says. It notes that Gebru asked for certain conditions to be met in order for her to stay at Google, including transparency around who wanted her paper retracted. Ultimately, the leaders of the ethical AI team said they could not meet these conditions and preemptively accepted her resignation. Her own manager said he was “stunned.”<p>Saying “I quit unless you do these things” and then the company saying “We won’t do those things” is very different from firing someone.<p>I can’t find a list of her demands, but it seems to me that making any ultimatums to a company is usually a bad idea. Being upset when my ultimatum isn’t met seems irrational.')
