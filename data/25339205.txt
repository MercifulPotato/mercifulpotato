I have lived in both Dallas and Houston without a car, for example (but also Berlin, Santiago, Tokyo, so I have comparison points). If you don&#x27;t have kids, and have the freedom to plan a bit around where you live and work, you won&#x27;t really feel like you&#x27;re missing anything. I would take a trip via Lyft twice a month to some venue that&#x27;s further away than the bike&#x2F;rail&#x2F;bus combo could get me, but that&#x27;s about all.')
