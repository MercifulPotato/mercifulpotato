My kids, well teenagers, use iMessage and SMS and coordinate on Discord (that&#x27;s not really a social network). My wife uses word of mouth and local referrals to run her hair business with communication via SMS&#x2F;iMessage&#x2F;email and a bookings app she has. All my friends use use email and iMessage. My parents both use email and&#x2F;or SMS too.<p>The only thing I use any form of social media for is signing up to Twitter to tag Royal Mail or Hermes delivery in complaints about twice a year because they actually listen if you shitpost in public.<p>I see society functioning exactly how it did before if in 30 seconds time social media disappeared off the face of the planet.')
