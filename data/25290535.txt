It&#x27;s not just ham.<p>Buying an entire prosciutto costs hundreds of dollars, <i>obviously</i> people don&#x27;t want to buy a whole one.<p>It&#x27;s also usually not heated, by the way. This has <i>zero</i> to do with not liking to prepare meals... most people who buy sliced prosciutto are doing it as <i>part</i> of the meal they&#x27;re preparing. We&#x27;re not talking about hot pockets or frozen lasagna here.')
