It&#x27;s high performance for a cellphone part.<p>Dual channel DDR3L or DDR4L also has a 128 bit bus. 4200MHz DDR4 is clocked on the high side for most laptops, sure, but it&#x27;s hardly unusual.<p>Run the numbers and you get the exact same throughput figure as for M1, which isn&#x27;t surprising, because we&#x27;re just taking width * rate = throughput.<p>So I&#x27;ll repeat my assertion, downvotes be damned: the memory on the M1 <i>is not special</i>. The packaging and interconnect is interesting. It might reduce latency a little; it probably reduces power consumption a lot. But there&#x27;s nothing special about it. The computer you&#x27;re on right now probably has the same memory subsystem with different packaging.')
