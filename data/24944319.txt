Did they actually hit you? Did they cut you off and force you to hit them? Those are much different situations than them having plenty of time to make a turn and having to stop for whatever reason, and you assumed that they wouldn&#x27;t stop so you didn&#x27;t slow down. And to be clear, I don&#x27;t care what the law says in this conversation; I care about what I think is the correct outcome.<p>A double stop at a stop sign is a very simple situation.')
