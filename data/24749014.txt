You&#x27;ve conveniently ignored successful projects elsewhere, like the Hanul nuclear power plant and the Taishan nuclear plant.<p>Hanul is in Korea.  The nuclear &quot;success&quot; there turned out to be due to massive corruption and corner cutting.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;22&#x2F;136020&#x2F;how-greed-and-corruption-blew-up-south-koreas-nuclear-industry&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;22&#x2F;136020&#x2F;how-greed...</a><p>Taishan in China.  China is basically the single remaining bright spot in nuclear, anywhere in the world.  But to treat it as such, you have to believe the financial information coming from a communist government.   I am not as trusting as you are on that.<p>&gt; Also, you&#x27;re incorrect that Votgle is the only nuclear project in the US, Turkey Point is installing two more AP1000 reactors.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.miamitodaynews.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;13&#x2F;economics-shelves-fpl-nuclear-units-turkey-point&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.miamitodaynews.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;13&#x2F;economics-shelves-...</a><p>&quot;Nuclear units Florida Power &amp; Light was to build at Turkey Point have been delayed indefinitely as itâ€™s too expensive to compete with natural gas, FPL says.&quot;<p>&gt; You continue to miss the point. With renewables and storage, we&#x27;re talking in terms of hypothetical costs.<p>Yes, all future costs are uncertain.  So any plans involve risk, and all investments are gambles.  The market has judged that the risk favors renewables and storage, not nuclear.<p>&gt; Nuclear costs are historical costs. We know what nuclear costs, because we&#x27;ve built it before. And we&#x27;ve built it at scale.<p>They are costs from another time.  Unless you have a time machine, those costs are just of historical interest.   What matters today is what it costs to build today.    And even back then, the costs became unacceptable.  There&#x27;s a reason the first nuclear expansion stopped, and it&#x27;s not regulation.<p>&gt; You seem to be particularly determined to avoid the one solution that is actually proven to work.<p>You have linked to a solar + storage + transmission solution, not needing any nuclear.   Are you sure that&#x27;s what you were wanting to link to?  I&#x27;m fine with that solution.   Note that the &quot;three weeks of storage&quot; there would be better done with hydrogen than with batteries.')
