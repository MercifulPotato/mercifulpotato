However, in case we are seeing the same thing I’ll reword the following sentence for you:<p>&gt; By that definition it’s your PWA not planning on supporting Firefox.<p>The above could also be written:<p>&gt; Under the assumption that a PWA is defined as a website which queries the browser to discover additional functionality, and then goes on to use features it discovers, it is the PWA which doesn’t support a particular browser. Specifically, the PWA likely <i>depends</i> on functionality which may not always be present, which means it it not progressively enhanced.<p>Apologies if my rewording comes across condescending. I have no information about your level of knowledge on the subject and chose not to omit anything on purpose.')
