There&#x27;s a law against that for broadcast television, but it doesn&#x27;t apply to internet content. (It may not apply to cable&#x2F;netflix either? I dunno.)<p>I don&#x27;t watch youtube on my phone anymore. IMHO this is profoundly bad for Google. The last time I bought a phone, having a bigger screen was one of the considerations. I don&#x27;t remember how much it was, but I spent like $800 on it. Not anymore. My last phone was $350. I use for a lot less stuff. Mostly just texting and discord. So Google has lost out twice- once for just less watching of youtube, but also less mobile device usage, which likely earns Google quite a bit more from that the ads.')
