The two are separate.<p>IMO, this is more about Hyundai&#x27;s autonomous vehicle efforts. A BD robot is almost completely different than an industrial automation robot, the former attempts to use 3D mapping to dynamically generate an unpredictable path around obstacles between two points, while the latter is designed to always follow exactly the same kinematics between hard-coded points. A car with a steering wheel and forward&#x2F;reverse electric motors is a lot more comparable to a Boston Dynamics robot than a 6-axis industrial arm is.')
