What I&#x27;ve realised is that most technology doesn&#x27;t improve our lives, it complicates it and makes it measurably worse. I still check HN, which is probably the last remaining symptom of my link to the tech world.<p>The world needs less software and less technology, not more. The further down this rabbit hole we go the worse everything gets. Physical health, mental health, social health and the broader links that bind society together all suffer.<p>It&#x27;s all noise and its supposed benefits are, for the most part, an illusion.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a role for tech to play in our lives, but a limited, balanced role. We&#x27;re living in a world saturated with it, overdosing daily.<p>Give it all up, move on, and in time you will recover. Even if it takes years.<p>Good luck.<p>(It&#x27;s unlikely that I will return to read any replies to this comment.)')
