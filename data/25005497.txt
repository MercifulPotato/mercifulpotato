Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604644689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25004582, text='Yeah, Apple&#x27;s page titles generally suck, especially when they are presented without context. The big things in this one is that they&#x27;re pushing fixes to devices that people had considered abandoned for almost two years, and that these fixes explicitly mention that they have been exploited in the wild in what I believe is Apple&#x27;s second admission of this, and the first time they did so without blaming Google Project Zero of a mischaracterization. That&#x27;s clearly a bit too much to put in a title, but something like &quot;Apple releases iOS 12.4.9, backporting fixes for severe security vulnerabilities&quot;. I&#x27;d like to put &quot;exploited in the wild&quot; in there somewhere as well since I think it&#x27;s an important part of the story, but I am not sure if this would keep it neutral.')
