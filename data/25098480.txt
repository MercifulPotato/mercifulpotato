All I wanted to do was sample an ADC channel at 8Khz. The software triggered ADC proved to be fundamentally broken (it felt like a race condition in their lower level coprocessor), and I had to switch to I2S so that the ADC would be accessed by DMA. The documentation was basically non-existent and the most relevant code examples were an incoherent mess. I eventually got it to work barely well enough, after probably spending 16 hours on it.<p>I&#x27;m still impressed with the wifi functionality. It&#x27;s a cool chip, and I appreciate the company&#x27;s willingness to support hobbiests. I wouldn&#x27;t use their SDK as the reference for a particularly good vendor support package, though. On the other hand, maybe there are no good vendor support packages and ESP32 is one of the least worst?')
