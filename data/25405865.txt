Isn&#x27;t that just contributing to what many people perceive as the upgrade treadmill?<p>Take those legacy Android devices you mentioned. If CPU rendering, or more limited use of the GPU, was good enough for those devices when they shipped, why isn&#x27;t it good enough now? Do we really need to keep increasing resolution, frame rate, color depth, or whatever, at the cost of leaving behind people stuck on older hardware and adding to e-waste?')
