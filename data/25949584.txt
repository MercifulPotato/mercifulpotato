But this is silly, because you and I both know without a shadow of a doubt that RH shut down buys to protect the underwater hedge funds. It&#x27;s obvious to anyone with a brain. And I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s obvious to you. And would be obvious to any judge, jury or lawyer. But does it matter that its true? No. Is there some legal basis that would encompass &quot;you can&#x27;t shut down trading to protect some hedge fund that you are connected with&quot;. I&#x27;m certain there is, but it probably won&#x27;t matter. Because &quot;the law&quot; and &quot;rule of law&quot; is a meme. Power is what matters. And the sovereign power decides what the law is... average joe traders don&#x27;t have the power and hedge funds and finance in this case do.')
