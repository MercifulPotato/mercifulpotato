DNSSEC authenticates requests <i>between servers</i>. But between DNS clients (&quot;stub resolvers&quot;) and servers (&quot;full recursers&quot;), there is no authentication, just a single bit in the header that says &quot;trust me, I authenticated this data&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re using your ISP&#x27;s servers, 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, or a custom server you set up on Digital Ocean somewhere: an on-path attacker can forge DNSSEC responses to you. It&#x27;s a ridiculous situation.')
