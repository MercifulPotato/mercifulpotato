Indeed, I would be surprised if there weren’t, and if there really are no other such stories then I would be surprised that the authors don’t mention that explicitly since that would be give enormous weight to their position.<p>Also, TFA only says that the aboriginal stories <i>seem</i> to predate European contact, but which is more plausible: that we found a story that is ten times older than the oldest previously reconstructed myth or that we were wrong and the aboriginal story is actually influenced directly or transitively by some European culture (or some other culture which had a similar myth)? This depends on the evidence back the “seems to predate European contact” claim.')
