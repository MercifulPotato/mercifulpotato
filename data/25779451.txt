They&#x27;d happily tuck this machine away in the basement and eliminate the human supervision as a &quot;cost&quot; if they could. At heart, they really don&#x27;t care what the machine does. And the engineers? Let&#x27;s hope they automate themselves away eventually! They&#x27;re always demanding payraises and causing a stink. Instruction side condition: keep engineers busy with scaling up, try not to get us into trouble.')
