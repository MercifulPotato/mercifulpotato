It&#x27;s a Python3 library to emulate the remote control for a Zoom H6 recorder from your computer.\nYou can use it directly from the terminal, or import it in your Python scripts.<p>I created it because I was looking for a way to automate some steps in my podcast, and starting or stopping the recording was one of them. This led to a big rabbit hole to understand and emulate the commands sent by the real remote to the recorder. All the digging has finally paid up and the code works!<p>I hope you find this useful. Pull requests are also welcome.<p>I&#x27;d love to know what you&#x27;ll be using it for :)')
