If the receiver doesn&#x27;t know who is giving the money, how could it act as a bribe?</i><p>It would be pretty hard to set things up so that donations were not only anonymous, but non-verifiable (as in, it should be impossible for a donor to prove to a recipient that they were the one who donated). This attribute in voting systems is part of &#x27;coercion resistance&#x27; (as in, if you can&#x27;t prove how you voted even when you want to, there is no point in trying to coerce you into voting a particular way). In a payments system, we can call it &#x27;corruption resistance&#x27;.')
