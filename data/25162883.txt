It&#x27;s a quantitative argument, and that&#x27;s not how the numbers work out. In the US, about 1 in 30 people have had a reasonably confirmed case of COVID (10 million out of a bit over 300 million). The odds of being exposed to it are significant at this point, unless you&#x27;re locked up in a bunker in the mountains.<p>If you do catch it, the risks of long-term disability are pretty high too. We don&#x27;t know a lot about long COVID, but the known numbers on long COVID there are concerning.<p>1) Vaccines are 95% effective.<p>2) We didn&#x27;t see any side effects in 30k person studies.<p>It&#x27;s hard to run numbers where the &quot;extremely small chance this vaccination causes long term effects&quot; are greater than p(catching COVID) * p(long COVID).<p>There was a tragedy of the commons when there were a few dozens confirmed cases of COVID. There was virtually no individual risk to going out and partying, and if everyone did that, it would double in 5 days. Everyone went out and parties until the personal risks were high, and the collective costs of those decisions were huge.<p>In this case, though, we&#x27;re comparing the risks of an engineered and rigorously tested vaccine against those of a relatively poorly understood new virus. I can&#x27;t work any sensible numbers where it doesn&#x27;t make sense to take the vaccine from that argument.<p>The only place where I could run reasonable numbers for a reason to wait is:<p>1) If you can afford to 100% quarantine at home<p>2) You want to pick between vaccines, waiting for a better one')
