Lots of missing libraries to common services or libraries that weren&#x27;t mature enough like the saddeningly reported Postges driver. That seems particularly damning, if I can&#x27;t reasonably access one of the most popular and general purpose DBs then how am I going to expect a litany of other software I might want to use and expect after having worked with Java or Ruby or Puthon. Personally this drives me to Clojure more, which they said they used at CircleCI and had success with given it&#x27;s interoperability with the large Java ecosystem. That meshes well with my experience too.')
