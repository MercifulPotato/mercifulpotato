It means pushing it&#x27;s own weirs APIs on the web while simultaneously refusing to implement other vendors&#x27; ideas. And that is exactly what Chrome has been doing for years.<p>All of the 3 points you mentioned are exactly reasons why Google has been so successful at taking over the web and will continue to be in the future.<p>- They know how IE died, so they&#x27;ve embraced the openness just enough to avoid any kind of backlash regarding new features,<p>- the automatic updates mean web developers can jump on new features immediately without having to wait for them to propagate, giving other vendors basically no time to catch up, and<p>- the fact that Google&#x27;s websites account for a gigantic percentage of the web traffic and are unavoidable for most people, means that even if web developers want to wait for broader support of new features, Google&#x27;s own websites can implement them immediately and force their users (==almost everyone) to  Chrome.')
