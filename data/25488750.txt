It was a completely raw deal. The addition of WhatsApp&#x2F;Messenger&#x2F;Jitsi&#x2F;FaceTime&#x2F;Duo&#x2F;Allo&#x2F;etc has not reduced options. In fact, I&#x27;d give up anything not to go back to $0.20&#x2F;sms.<p>I think much of the &quot;harm&quot; narrative is driven by lobbying, not actual harm. They both have harm, different types, some more than others. One has better lobbyists.')
