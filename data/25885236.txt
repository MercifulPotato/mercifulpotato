At 90% capacity it will take you 10 hours to catch up for every hour you are behind.  Taking long periods of catch up time for outages isn&#x27;t acceptable.   At 100x capacity most conventional equipment right now would fail to complete its initial synchronization before the participant gave up.<p>The security of the system comes from decenteralization, so its goals can&#x27;t be reached if its only workable for the best funded 10% of the participants.  Moreover, the operating cost of a node are only compensated fairly indirectly and are a public good (if everyone else runs an honest node, you don&#x27;t gain from running your own).  As a result, it&#x27;s not sufficient to just be not-astronomical, it has to be fairly close to painless.<p>Node&#x27;s ability to keep up is also only one part of the equation.  Bitcoin&#x27;s long term security is absolutely dependant on transaction fees paying for proof of work.  With functionally limitless capacity the natural price of transactions is essentially zero-- as has been demonstrated by competing systems which have found that they can only fund security with inflation.<p>Most critically-- while you can make a fine argument that some moderate increases (more like 2x or 5x than 100x) are viable without too much increase in security risks--  those kinds of changes (heck, even 100x)  don&#x27;t categorically change the situation.<p>But we do have technology to categorically change the situation, tech that was thought of and made accordance for before Bitcoin was ever released and has always been part of the long term plans-- regardless of whatever lies motivated parties might want to tell you--  tech like lighthing adds essentially unlimited transaction throughput to Bitcoin because it doesn&#x27;t require public broadcast for each and every transaction.  I was talking to someone this morning who is doing a test sustaining 400 transactions per second.<p>&gt; and that was the sentiment expressed by Satoshi any time he commented on it.<p>Sorry, that is just a flat out lie-- at I pointed out in a prior comment literally the last public statement Satoshi made on the matter of scalablity&#x2F;resource usage was: &quot;Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it&#x27;s easy for lots of users and small devices.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg289...</a><p>There is a long history of the position I&#x27;m presenting, going back to many of Bitcoin&#x27;s earliest participants.')
