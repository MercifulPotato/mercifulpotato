Otherwise they&#x27;d be flooded with spam, griefing, child porn, moderate or left wing opinions, etc. That&#x27;s why spammers have always been advocating for maximalist &#x27;free speech&#x27; rights for access to platforms. Given this, it&#x27;s simply up to each platform owner to determine their editorial policy.')
