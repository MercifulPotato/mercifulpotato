I think the easy take away is that the bid ask spread is the transaction cost. If you can buy and sell a stock for the same price (minus price movements), it&#x27;s very efficient to move your money in and out of different assets.<p>With the bid-ask spread being wider, that adds a transaction cost to every trade, as you can&#x27;t sell for the price you just bought. This means that trades are more expensive and riskier. HFT provides liquidity that reduces those risks.<p>HFT seems to me to be one of those words that means two different things and people select the version of HFT that fits their arguments. &quot;Evil&quot; HFT is a rent seeker that just can get in front of the trades you make without adding value, you&#x27;re just paying an extra penny or something for transaction. &quot;Good&quot; HFT is a market maker with tons of info who just gets there first every time because they&#x27;re FAST.<p>You can see how the amount of info HFT turns it &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, and that&#x27;s a tightly held trade secret for most of the trading firms, so it&#x27;s a grey area.')
