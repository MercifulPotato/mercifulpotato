It&#x27;s possible to dump images and restore them, but it&#x27;s not the norm of working with CL.<p>Unlike in Smalltalk, I currently know of no tools that allow one to easily edit source code of functions&#x2F;methods that have already been compiled into the system, and therefore the dependency on the filesystem source files is heavy and immediate.<p>AFAIK dumping images in CL is mostly used for shortening load times by preloading code and data, and for application delivery, but not for live editing support.')
