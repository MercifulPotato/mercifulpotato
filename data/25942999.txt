If something is misaligned or bends or breaks or even if it&#x27;s just insufficiently lubricated, you&#x27;re SOL. Solid state transistors are stupid reliable in comparison. Further, implementing more than two or three levels of conditional logic with mechanisms is prohibitively expensive, whereas you can have thousands of checks in a digital system practically for free. Finally, a mechanical system can only handle situations it is designed for, upgrades are difficult and sometimes impossible to implement. On the other hand digital logic is easily updated to deal with unforeseen issues.<p>Electricity is just as much a physical phenomenon as fluid flow or mechanical stress.<p>[Edit] I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer, no one should be any more enthusiastic about doing things mechanically than I am.')
