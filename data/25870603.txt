Now no one buys ad real estate on newspapers so they have to serve google adds on their websites which is a fraction of the income they would get.<p>Google is eating up the lunch of news, so news have to find another way to monetize. Of course, we come slowly but surely to the understanding that News are essential to the society even without generating profit. But who pays the bills??<p>Government cant without making them depended on them and hence biasing the news. People are not seeing the immediate value since they are spoon fed this clickbait, bigot garbage and they think they are &quot;up to date.
