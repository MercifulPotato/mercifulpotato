Item(by='milkytron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606760751, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256740, text='&gt; If covid and the worldwide economic disruption can&#x27;t put a dent in asset prices, then what will happen when the pandemic passes and the economy recovers in the next few years?<p>Pure speculation, and I am not an economist, but I&#x27;d imagine that those with wealth will acquire more wealth. And those without wealth will encounter more difficult means to acquiring wealth.<p>The last time the housing market crashed, investors bought a lot of the single family homes to use as wealth storage and rent them out. If housing prices go down or stabilize (we&#x27;ll see what happens after forbearance periods), this will most certainly happen again, consolidating more wealth to the top while market rates for rent steadily climb. Housing shortages are high, and growing in the US. Other assets like stocks will likely increase as they have done, but entering into this market will be more difficult as consumers are spending more of their income on necessities (shelter, cars in the US, etc). All of which are becoming more expensive, and funnily enough, these assets aren&#x27;t included in the Consumer Price Index, which is meant to measure inflation.<p>Basically, I just see this as expediting wealth consolidation. Times will be more difficult for a lot of people for a long time. Strong cultural shifts and policy changes will likely be needed to avoid furthering the divide of the wealth gap. Neither of which is easy.')
