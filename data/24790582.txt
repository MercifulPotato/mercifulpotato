Elite class does exist in the society, and they exert tight control on the flow of information in traditional media, e.g. TV, newspapaer etc. Their control is loosened in the Internet age initially, which led to the rise of Trump. Trying to correct this, a narrative of blaming &quot;fake news&quot; was used to pressure leading companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to toe the elite line.<p>2. Censorship of &quot;effective&quot; speech, which is speech that can reach vast audience, always exists in any society. Just think back about the &quot;mask is useless&quot; than &quot;everyone should wear mask&quot; media campaigns in the in the past few months, on traditional media. Internet weakened the traditional guardians of &quot;effective&quot; speech. With the multiple challenges faced by the elites today, e.g. COVID, class and racial conflicts, disruption to internal orders, the elites are trying harder to take control of important nodes of Internet, so they can build consensus and move the society to a direction they desire.')
