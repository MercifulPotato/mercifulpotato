Within a non-VR shooter I can, in one continuous motion, run into and knockdown a guard, shoot his friend, jump through a window, run across a room, leap over a crate, parkour up a wall, grab a rifle, and shoot another flanked enemy.<p>VR gameplay isn&#x27;t remotely comparable. Perhaps it&#x27;s due to VR linking us with our real-life limitations. In real-life, I doubt many untrained people can turn 90 or 180 degrees, raise a rifle, sight in, and fire accurately in a under a second.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t great VR games but VR doesn&#x27;t appear to add new elements to the genres or gameplay beyond &quot;now try this without an accurate mouse&#x2F;keyboard&#x2F;controller&quot; or &quot;you can now see a virtual representation of your hands... and use them to awkwardly manipulate the environment&quot;.<p>When you say &quot;Blaston.. (provides).. gameplay that would not be possible in another medium&quot;, I think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re referring to.. the awkward manipulation of the environment. Blaston is a very simple 3D game that absolutely could be played without VR but wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as goofy and fun. Perhaps that&#x27;s it, perhaps the &quot;akwardly manipulating&#x2F;traversing the environment&quot; is the unique gameplay that VR adds (similar to Kinect). The human element I guess you could say.<p>It seems as though the trade-off is a boost in immersion for a simultaneous reduction in game and gameplay complexity.')
