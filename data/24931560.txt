Masks anytime people would be within 10ft. Spend as little time indoors (outside of the house) as possible. No visiting friends, no visiting family, nothing.<p>Recently we&#x27;ve started to very slowly relax things. It&#x27;s become clear that surfaces aren&#x27;t really a transmission vector, for one, and that generally if you&#x27;re outside (or in a well-filtered space) and people use masks you&#x27;re probably fine. We went to the botanical gardens last weekend. My partner&#x27;s friends are having a back yard (masked) movie night that we may go to. We&#x27;re contemplating going to my parents&#x27; house for Christmas if we can get everyone to hardcore-quarantine in the weeks leading up to it.<p>I&#x27;m normally an introverted person, but even just the thought of some of these allowances has lifted my spirit dramatically.<p>But no: despite all that I have no intention of sitting down for a meal at a restaurant anytime soon, much less going to a big box store when I could simply order a delivery. The risk&#x2F;reward just doesn&#x27;t work out there until there&#x27;s a vaccine and it works.')
