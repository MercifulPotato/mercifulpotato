My father produced over 60,000 slides for her, over the course of their academic careers, by copying illustrations in art and architecture books (and by street photography on their many trips abroad)<p>She could walk up to the slide cabinet, and ask &quot;give me a theme&quot; and we&#x27;d say &quot;animals&quot; and she&#x27;d say &quot;give me a period&quot; and we&#x27;d say &quot;modern&quot; and she&#x27;d select slides about the history of representative art about animals, in modern times.<p>When she&#x27;d put the slides back, she could re-enter the cabinet and select slides about Michaelangelo and followers, or about the role of the pediment in architectural design, and select from the same slides, but for a different context.<p>Amazing stuff. Totally indexed by herself, operated for a lifetime of academic teaching.<p>I think she &quot;invented&quot; hypermedia in the 1960s basically.')
