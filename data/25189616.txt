And given the underlying map, it&#x27;s likely to come down to whether a GOP-controlled Senate wants stimulus.<p>Since your comment indicates you have no idea of what&#x27;s going on politically: for the past several months the D-led House has been pushing a $3T stimulus bill [1], while the R-led Senate has been trying to negotiate it down to a $0.5T stimulus [2], and generally failing to prioritize even a middle-ground negotiation in favor of court confirmations.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to prefer one position or the other -- generous stimulus or paltry stimulus -- but being unable to determine the two parties&#x27; positions after <i>literally months of public wrangling on the issue</i> is just inexcusable. This is why our country is in so much trouble.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;us-policy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;democrats-pelosi-congress-coronavirus-3-trillion-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;us-policy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;democrat...</a> \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;senate-to-vote-on-500-billion-gop-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-wednesday.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;senate-to-vote-on-500-billio...</a>')
