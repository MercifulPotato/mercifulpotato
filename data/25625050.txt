Crucially, that question depends on how someone will realistically implement $FOO.<p>I like PyPy as an example: on the surface, implementing a Python runtime in Python and expecting performance gains seems crazy. PyPy manages to outperform CPython because although a C implementation should theoretically be faster, realistically the increased expressiveness of Python lets the PyPy devs opt into optimizations the CPython devs find out of reach.<p>I don&#x27;t know C or Rust well enough to comment on these specific scenarios, but if two technologies <i>can</i> be fast, and one makes that speed accessible while the other encourages implementors to leave performance on the table, that&#x27;s much more useful information to me than seeing a back-and-forth where folks compete to implement optimizations I&#x27;ll never make in my own projects.')
