Item(by='valarauko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608572536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479155, text='In my home country (India) the academic job hierarchy used to be &quot;Lecturer&quot; --&gt; &quot;Reader&quot; --&gt; &quot;Professor&quot;<p>Somewhere in the last decade or so this nomenclature was revised to &quot;Assistant Professor&quot;, &quot;Associate Professor&quot;, and &quot;Professor&quot;. I can&#x27;t speak to the rationale for this, but it brings it in line with the naming convention in the US.<p>While the minimum requirement for an Assistant Professor job in India is a Masters, in practice now you really need at least 2+ years of Postdoc experience. To move up to an Associate Prof. position, the minimum requirement is at least 5+ years of post PhD experience, to have guided at least one PhD student, and n number of publications with x Impact Factor. A Professor requires at least 10 years of post PhD experience, and at least 3 PhD students. Of course, these are minimum requirements, and I know of several people who far exceed those qualifications and still waiting to move up the ladder. For example, a senior from my graduate lab has been an Assistant Prof for about 14 years now, has 15+ publications, and 3 PhD students who&#x27;ve gained their degrees.')
