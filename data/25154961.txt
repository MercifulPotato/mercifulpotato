Processors change architecture. Code becomes obsolete. I don&#x27;t want to minimize the problem the author is decrying, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like specifically Apple&#x27;s fault.<p>That being said, why write an emulator to ARM? Apple Silicon will die someday as well. Write an emulator to JavaScript. If there&#x27;s a day where JavaScript isn&#x27;t a valid platform, we&#x27;ll probably have transcended physical matter by then. There&#x27;s definitely prior art in browser emulators too.')
