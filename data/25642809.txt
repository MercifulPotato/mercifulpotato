Their quarantine systems are good, but not perfect:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;taiwan-tightens-pandemic-measures-after-first-local-covid-19-case-since-april&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;taiwan-tightens-pandemic-mea...</a><p>While they have certainly come closer than most places, the downside of this approach is that it comes at a debilitating economic cost (edit: for <i>most countries</i>...Taiwan specifically may be able to get away with it for a while because they&#x27;re a manufacturing hub), and literally <i>any minor slip up</i> can lead to the virus spreading like wildfire through the population.<p>Again, considering the vast differences in scale and complexity here, it&#x27;s pushing the bounds of credulity to claim that the United States could do something similar. Even a &quot;science-following&quot; state like New York can&#x27;t conduct a quarantine of remotely similar strictness.<p>Pretty much the only equivalent thing the US might have done would be to stop all immigration in January. <i>Neither</i> political party would have supported such a thing.')
