People go to Twitter to see what their representatives are saying.  Journalists use it almost exclusively to discover what&#x27;s relevant.  Yes, they&#x27;re a private company, but when a private company reaches a certain level of influence they become a <i>government</i> of sorts, just not one that owns a standing army.<p>I think you underestimate the power that social media has.  The mass 80% doesn&#x27;t give a fuck about Mastodon or even <i>leave</i> the domains of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Amazon.  This isn&#x27;t the year 2004 - getting anyone to use a shitty knockoff of Twitter or the like is always going to be an uphill battle.  It&#x27;s due to a few things, namely an accumulation of wealth and confluence with the mainstream media apparatus that wants access to that wealth by proxy.
