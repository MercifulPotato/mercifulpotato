It gets rid of the ambiguity you&#x27;re talking about.  If Trump was forced to tweet from @potus, the verified account for the POTUS, that makes it clear he&#x27;s communicating as the POTUS, not a private citizen.<p>Personal accounts should be subject to the same rules as everyone else.  Give official government accounts special treatment; can&#x27;t be banned, no censorship, etc..')
