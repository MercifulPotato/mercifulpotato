And is 30% slower in single core.<p>Firestorm Cores use less than 4 watts each. A 16 firestorm core Mx will produce roughly the same multicore performance as your TR, with a less than 70 watt TDP.<p>And a $65 M1 dusts a 4800h that costs over 4x as much and using 1&#x2F;3 the power. Top end ThreadRippers cost $2,000 to $3,000 each. You can bet an Apple Mx ThreadRipper killer isnâ€™t going to cost more than $500 given it only needs 4x the cores of the $65 M1.')
