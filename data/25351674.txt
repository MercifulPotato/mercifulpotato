I&#x27;m comfortable going out to eat.  I live alone, the only people I physically interact with these days are all under the age of 28, anyone in a risk group that I would interact with is back home a thousand or so miles away.<p>&gt; virtually never take group outcomes into consideration when making choices unless forced to under the threat of violence.<p>Group outcomes are effectively a moot point.  That presumes that the group, as a whole, has an agreed upon preferential outcome, and an agreed upon means of getting there.  We do not (and basically never do, when it comes to the group).  Some people want more stringent lockdowns, some people just want the lockdowns to be lifted.  People who want more stringent lockdowns are averse to the risk of COVID, and are willing to sacrifice some of the joy of life to avoid it.  People who want to lift the lockdowns are unperturbed by the risk, or are okay with allowing people to assume that risk to be able to go on with their lives.  I don&#x27;t see a clear winner from a utilitarian perspective; either really bad things happen to a small ratio of people, or mildly bad things happen to everyone.  I certainly don&#x27;t think the gap in net happiness is wide enough to warrant condescension about people ignoring group outcomes.')
