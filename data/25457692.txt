I did the same thing and after running the filter for several months, when I disassembled it, the filter was clean as new, but the bulk of the dust was laying somewhere between the blades and the motor and on the edges of the fan. It is very hard to actually get the right type of fan and assemble it correctly because simple fan will not work (the air will flow over the blades, thus not providing the required suction so that the air passes through the filters). The filters have pretty high resistance so you need a very efficient sucking &#x2F; blowing fan to make the air pass through.')
