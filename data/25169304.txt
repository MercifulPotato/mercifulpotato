There really is no need to tinker these days, but if you want to tinker, you can!<p>But a hugely underestimated cost is the cost of moving away from Apple. Watch, phone, tablet, music, accounts etc makes it an ecosystem. It&#x27;s not a simple computer, Apple is a brand that integrates with lives.<p>Of course just how much of the population don&#x27;t care about privacy so long as they can use a nice UX, many people will not care about Free Software so long as they have a good experience. Linux on the desktop is not going to win UX wars, just like how duck duck go will not win the search wars.<p>People don&#x27;t use Linux because it has a better experience than Apple! There are other reasons.<p>In the future when users can only rent Mac&#x27;s and not own them, people will still be saying the same thing: I don&#x27;t care that I don&#x27;t own this thing, I just want it to work, and it feels better than this other thing.')
