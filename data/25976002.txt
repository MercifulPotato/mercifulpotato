I&#x27;m sure that internet marketing is a key part of some companies&#x27; business plans. Warby Parker, perhaps.<p>What I&#x27;m not yet convinced of is that they&#x27;re a panacea for all small businesses. Details aside, one moral of the eBay paper is that a $50B business, with a whole dedicated department, still managed to make a dog&#x27;s breakfast of their online advertising; Uber reported similar problems earlier this winter.<p>It seems <i>hard</i> and it&#x27;s not obvious to me that every business has the aptitude, market, or business model to do it well. At the same time, I can easily imagine people deciding &quot;We need to do something about advertising&quot; and then forging ahead with whatever <i>something</i> they land on. This is especially true with the ROI is difficult to calculate--and I do think it&#x27;s probably harder to calculate for an ad than for something with very standardized cost&#x2F;performance characteristics like new equipment.<p>Google, Facebook, and Shopify making money doesn&#x27;t really answer this question.
