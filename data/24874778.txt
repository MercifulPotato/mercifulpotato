Item(by='sowbug', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603490658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24865898, text='Pretty sure this is a Bayes&#x27; Theorem thing, but happy to be wrong and learn something.<p>I think we both agree the table talks in terms of current age. But making it to age 50 doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll make it to age 51, so you can&#x27;t add that extra bit of life (the one you think of in terms of a day lived counting a little less than a day against your life expectancy) to the age 50 row in the table. You can&#x27;t add that bit until you actually are age 51. Otherwise you&#x27;re counting both a known thing (you did make it to 51) and an unknown thing (whether you will make it to 51 if you&#x27;re only 50 today) to a predicted thing (when you&#x27;ll die if you&#x27;re 50 today). Not exactly double counting, but taking for granted something that&#x27;s not yet proven.<p>I believe that extra bit is what the other commenter was wondering about.')
