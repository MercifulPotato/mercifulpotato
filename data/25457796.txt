My recipe is basically:<p>Sleep enough, exercise (especially outside), eat right, make sure your brain is active and engaged on a regular basis (read real books, challenge yourself by getting out of your intellectual comfort zone). Studies show that coffee is good for Alzheimer&#x27;s, so as long as you&#x27;re not using it to stay awake when you need sleep, it&#x27;s probably fine.')
