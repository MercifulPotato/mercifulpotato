This is partially due to the fact that boring, everyday meal recipes just aren&#x27;t as flashy as a 15-ingredient, hour long recipe that results in a stunning picture for someone&#x27;s blog or instagram.<p>I think the root is that everyone&#x27;s rents and other costs are way higher. Many folks are barely getting by. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Instagram or vanity - I think that might reveal your personal privilege and position in society. That isn&#x27;t meant in a demeaning or derogatory way, it&#x27;s just that it surprises me how today people from different classes do not often &#x27;meet&#x27; each other anymore, in their day to day lives. Propably due to rising inequity. I think a lot of working class people buy quick meals because they have so little time.<p>&gt; Everyone should learn how to cook some boring, staple meals using basic ingredients from the store.<p>100% agree. Shame we&#x27;re still letting corporations brainwash the general population, not to mention kids.')
