Because you&#x27;re very likely to get stuck ;).<p>If you strictly follow a wall from the start (or any of the checkpoints), you&#x27;ll find your way to the end. However, most walls are on loops. The style of maze I used is called a braid maze, and replaces all dead-ends with loops. (The maze algorithm considers a 2x2 square a loop though, while the renderer doesn&#x27;t fill anything in the center, so those still look like dead ends.)')
