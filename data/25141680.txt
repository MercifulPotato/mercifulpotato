Item(by='usaphp', descendants=None, kids=[25141747, 25141842], score=None, time=1605729512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25141303, text='that&#x27;s ridiculous, why not just write <i>padding: 2px 5px; display: flex; align-items: center; color: #fff;</i> You are basically just creating a set of attributes that just mimic standard css properties, I find this approach of tailwind absolutely counter productive, and I am surprised that it gets so much popularity.')
