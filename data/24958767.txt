That type of event have caused a slingshot to accelerate a planet like Venus into a highly elliptical orbit, one which might be further accelerated by other planets to a point where it reached escape velocity - especially if combined with large collisions.<p>This would happen in the same way the voyagers gained speed as it flew past the gas giants in the 80s.<p>It’s unlikely, but there are a lot of solar systems and a lot of planets.<p>Predicting the location of a given rogue planet would be like predicting the position if a tractor in a given field in Nebraska. However once you see the tractor is there you can start to predict how it got there.')
