I’ve had debates on how much retry makes sense for a login service I built. People have the tendency of hey this endpoint used to work with these parameters didn’t work? Fine I will keep retrying! The only difference here I think is in company paid job you step up immediately put in a server side fix to fix outage and then make these changes to roll them out. All of this is achieved in matter of hour or so rather than 12+ hours.<p>Circuit breaking, exponential backoff, bulkheading should be key pillars and no dev should be allowed to write a client without these key skills.<p>Edit: Please add Jitter to the list of items.
