I strongly disagree and for proof I present the FCC&#x27;s handing of the 2017 Net Neutrality repeal process.<p>Do you remember the millions of comments left by the public in opposition to NN?  Do you remember that these comments were created by bots and not real people?  Do you remember that after closer investigation it was revealed that the vast majority of &quot;real&quot; comments were for NN, not against it and that a large percentage of those comments in opposition were from Russian bots?<p>When questioned about it the FCC claimed that there was a problem with their logs during the voting period and they were unable to provide information about where these comments came from.  As far as I can remember, there was no real consequence for these actions and the FCC simply continued to dismantle NN.<p>This type of activity is unforgivable and was a malicious attempt to put the will and good of ISPs over that of the American people.  For this, Mr. Pai should have been shown the door years ago.  I guess it&#x27;s better late than never.')
