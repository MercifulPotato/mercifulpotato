While it&#x27;s obviously a small fraction compared to Windows (as noted in the article, 0.5-2% seems accurate), those that tried playing modern games on Linux a decade ago would be pleasantly surprised to see how much more feasible it is today; it&#x27;s come a long way.<p>Valve and Steam have played an important role in this, but we&#x27;ve also seen significant improvements in wine, applications like Lutris, and all-around steady improvements in hardware support and drivers, as well as a much larger and more accessible community and body of knowledge.<p>While there&#x27;s still quite a few games that seem near-impossible to play from linux, I think a lot of people that decided against trying this many years ago would find things much better off than where they left off, especially for someone that is willing to put in just a little bit of time to fix potential issues (but of course, we must admit that sometimes one can be unlucky and spend hours trying to fix some specific issues, even if that is much more rare than it used to be). Although I don&#x27;t play much, I&#x27;m happy to not have to dual boot Windows just to run a few select applications and I hope that things look even better this decade with the amount of interest we&#x27;ve seen in FOSS, user privacy and security, and so on, all increasing.')
