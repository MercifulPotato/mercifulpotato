So I, personally, wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in the idea that the disease per se <i>causes</i> mental illness.<p>More like: &quot;Being very ill during lock down with something known to kill people causes some people anxiety, depression and insomnia.&quot;<p>Shock of shockers.<p>(They do note that in the article, tbf: “This is likely due to a combination of the psychological stressors associated with this particular pandemic and the physical effects of the illness,” said Michael Bloomfield, a consultant psychiatrist at University College London.)<p>Edit: I will further add this is a good time to reach out via internet to get some of your social needs met. I&#x27;ve noticed substantial growth in some Reddit communities this year, like r&#x2F;UrbanPlanning (currently 105k, was like 80k not hugely long ago).<p>Please seek out things that are sanity-promoting and not freak-out promoting if you are really struggling with the psychological fallout from this whole thing.')
