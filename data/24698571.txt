Multics’ design was more sophisticated than the 286 as it supported different security rings on a per-segment basis, a simpler version of which I believe appeared with the 386.  I believe Multics was the first to use this approach, but my memory might be faulty in this regard.<p>The 60s was a fruitful decade for architecture experimentation with a real Cambrian explosion of designs.  Things settled down more in the 70s as people started to converge on fixing the byte length on 8 bits, 2’s compliment arithmetic and the like.')
