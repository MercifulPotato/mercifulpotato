I assume the DA has some political reason that it finally matters to end this, or else they would have ended it ages ago.<p>If you’re curious to learn more about this kind of corruption, California has another bribe at the state level: the “11-99 Foundation” offers a license plate frame for a $2500 donation that, when placed on your car, mysteriously reduces your chances of receiving speeding and carpool tickets to near-zero — even from CHP. This is apparently legal, since traffic stops are discretionary, and no protections exist to detect or prevent discretionary bias <i>prior</i> to the stop. (Non-caucasians, 11-99 is <i>not</i> rumored to protect against racism, and may well inspire it under the guise of “heard a report of a stolen car”.)<p>I think it’s incredibly evil that this is tolerated and I don’t give them anything.')
