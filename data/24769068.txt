Happened to get double the storage along the way, as well as iOS 13 compatibility for my country&#x27;s Covid exposure app. As a device, I love that it&#x27;s small, and it having cost me very little means that I&#x27;m not nearly as paranoid about losing or breaking it.<p>And the screen swap&#x2F;upgrade experience was great too— so much so that I expect my next device (in a year or two) will be the iPhone 8, with the explicit intention of doing a similar upgrade down the line to the 2nd gen SE.')
