My forestry friend in college complained about how every time trees died on campus, they&#x27;d replace them all with some other species, creating waves of dead trees every few decades, whether disease or old age, instead of a tree or two every year.<p>But then even without humans, nut trees are born in statistical clusters as well, (&#x27;masting&#x27; is an adaptation to overwhelm predator populations) so it stands to reason they&#x27;d die in clusters too. And a bad spring may result in more seeds germinating the following year.')
