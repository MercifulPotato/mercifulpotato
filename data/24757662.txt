Had some friends in from out of town and put them up at a hipster boutique hotel 3 blocks from my apt. They hung out at my place for as long as they wanted, stumbled back to the hotel when they were done, and retreated to privacy of their own hotel room. We all walked to breakfast the next day.<p>The way the math works out is that I would be able to pay for three nights per month in that hotel for the difference between a 1br and a 2br in my building.<p>I don&#x27;t think everyone reading this article needs to shoehorn their own situation into the analysis, but for me it makes a ton of sense. I kind of want a 2br, but I really wouldn&#x27;t use the space that often and I have excellent alternatives.')
