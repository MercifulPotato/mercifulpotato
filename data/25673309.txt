Things that people click on, are also shown to other people in the same group. You can target your message (ads) to a specific group.<p>It looks harmless, but our amplifying algorithms gave a voice and a platform that led to this event. They created huge echo chambers with different set of facts and realities for different groups.<p>If you look deeply, this is partly our fault.<p>I may get downvoted for this.

It excites us so we click. The algorithms amplify it.
