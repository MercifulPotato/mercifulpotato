Obviously the massive buildings and projects are going to be using a shit-ton of power and I don&#x27;t know where dubai gets its power from - but it is most likely limited... so this is a good thing for that infrastructure.<p>I have a friend who lives in dubai, Ill ask her about where their power comes from as well..<p>I wonder how many datacenters are in dubai.<p>We bought a new house this year, and replaced all the lights with LED lights - and our power bill is really low.<p>in 2001 when the Enron fiasco happened, I received a power bill for $900 for one month, and my usage behavior didn&#x27;t change from previous months.
