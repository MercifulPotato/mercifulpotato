I&#x27;ve daily driven macOS for well over a decade, but periodically dip my toe into the Linux world just to get a feel of it&#x27;s &quot;there&quot; yet or not. Unfortunately for my purposes, it never is, and so I end up returning to macOS.<p>The biggest problem is that none of the DEs really fit my tastes â€” they all have to be poked and prodded into kinda doing what I want them to do, but they&#x27;re never quite there and it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating. I&#x27;ve also faced similar issues with starting with a bare WM and snapping together smaller pieces.<p>To get what I want I&#x27;d likely have to build my own DE from scratch, which I&#x27;m not even necessarily averse to, but I have no idea where to start with the mess that is X11 and Wayland and all the &quot;build your own WM&quot; tutorials that could be used as a springboard are written for building hyperminimal borderless tiling WMs, which aren&#x27;t straightforward to adapt for a more &quot;typical&quot; floating WM with titlebars and the like.<p>So I guess the endpoint of this rant is that it&#x27;s frustrating that building one&#x27;s ideal Linux desktop from the ground up isn&#x27;t all that accessible in reality. The configurability and openness is there on principle but it&#x27;s difficult to take advantage of past a skin-deep level.')
