Despite not having any external peripherals connected, it always goes into clamshell mode rather than sleep. It then appears to sleep (i.e. the display goes off), but then I come back to my desk the next morning to find the laptop uncomfortably warm with the fans running, while closed and doing literally nothing.<p>The more I spend on MacBooks the more issues they seem to have.')
