And if Epic was found doing something illegal and was shut down or bankrupted, that would also impact the user. Your over-simplification that it&#x27;s a &quot;business disagreement&quot; is disingenuous and incomplete. The signature revocation system you&#x27;re claiming is simply to &quot;protect their business model&quot; is the same system that allows Apple to immediately shut down any malware that makes its way into the App Store inadvertently. It&#x27;s the same system that&#x27;s been used in the past to <i>protect</i> users from private key leaks.<p>The only anti-consumer behavior in your situation came from Epic who knowingly violated the rules as a PR stunt.')
