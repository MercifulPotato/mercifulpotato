Item(by='detaro', descendants=None, kids=[25496421], score=None, time=1608562784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492938, text='For media coverage, does injection molding have flashy new use cases etc? My (non-expert) impression is that injection molding is the &quot;boring default&quot; for many use cases, and thus improvement in it won&#x27;t see much coverage. (+ the specific submission is on a website specializing on 3D printing as a topic). If you show me an industrially made part and say &quot;they injection molded that&quot;, the reaction is &quot;sure, as you would&quot;, not &quot;Oh? that&#x27;s interesting, why did they do that?&quot;.<p>Similar to how news will rather report on unusual building materials rather than run stories to remind people that bricks are cool too. (and if a home buyer insists on using something fancy new over bricks or whatever default would be more appropriate, that&#x27;s their fault)<p>That&#x27;s not to say that defaults actually are boring if you deal with them directly, I find people explaining details of things like injection molding fascinating, but &quot;we improved X in a standard industry process&quot; just isn&#x27;t as easy to make briefly interesting to mass audience and thus gets reported less.')
