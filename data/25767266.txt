Like have problem get help 1:1 or 1:4 from a tutor or instructor? That was always my biggest hurdle with online or book learning. If you didn&#x27;t understand a concept or problem there were no real resources to ask. Writing out a problem in an online forum still might not be enough the personal discussion and interaction helps so much.')
