Maybe three out of every four trips something really dinky like a smart car would do the job, whereas on one out of four I need the mid-sized estate car that I actually own. I live in a small village so to hire a car I&#x27;d have to get on a bus to the nearest town, then walk to the car hire place to get the car. That probably adds an hour to an hour and a half every time I need an estate car. Am I going to deal with that BS once every two weeks? Hell no. Even if I did, over time would it cost less than simply owning the damn car? Maybe, but it&#x27;s pretty fricking marginal. I&#x27;d save a bit on fuel, no doubt, but economical cars hold their value much better than those that are less economical so the price of the cars (I always buy used) might not be so different.<p>I don&#x27;t &quot;use&quot; my back garden a lot as a place to hang out, but it&#x27;s certainly a handy place to leave the motorbike when I don&#x27;t want to put it away, and also a great place for cutting up wood, MDF, and the like when I&#x27;m doing DIY.<p>The space has value that goes way beyond the amount of time that I use it for.<p>I could list plenty of other examples where this is true.')
