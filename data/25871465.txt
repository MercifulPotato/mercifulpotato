Even without actively seeking them out, I end up with piles of t-shorts (which I do fairly regularly wear around home in the summer). I&#x27;ve given bags of them away but they still seem to accumulate over time. <i>Very</i> few of them are ones I&#x27;ve purchased. But, yeah, I&#x27;ve never seen a pair of pants as swag. That is something I have to periodically buy when they start getting ratty or stained.')
