The world needs to stop China.<p>China is stealing Western tech to gain an economic and strategic advantage. They&#x27;re going to out-compete our tech and leave us in the dust. They have far more engineers that are willing to work &quot;996&quot;. (Sure, founders might work &quot;996&quot;, but our workforce doesn&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t.)<p>Playing unfair isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not the most worrying component of this. Our opponent has concentration camps, organ harvesting, no free press, crushes dissidents, disappears billionaires. And this is a regime that wants world domination. This gives me nightmares.<p>We should be doing everything in our power to disentangle and stop China.<p>When China has a military that surpasses the US in terms of scale and tech, they&#x27;re going to start invading and taking more than they already do. They&#x27;ve shut off water to Vietnam, set up shop in the energy&#x2F;resource-rich South China Sea, etc. They&#x27;re not going to stop.<p>Our media is already censored and caters to Chinese tastes. None of our movies are ever critical of China. They&#x27;re actively manipulating us.<p>Western democracies aren&#x27;t primed to fight this. This is such a lopsided fight. We have to start playing hardball.<p>edit: I&#x27;m being censored right now. This is the game we&#x27;re playing.')
