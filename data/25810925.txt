For example, &quot;not caring what others think&quot; and just cutting in-front of a queue is an objectively dick move. So in that sense, yes it&#x27;s self fulfilling (but this is not what &quot;not caring what others think&quot; means).<p>Perhaps a good example of a positive &quot;not caring what others think&quot; might be dancing however you want; you don&#x27;t feel embarrassed because you&#x27;re not a good dancer you just do whatever.<p>Perhaps another good example is Bob is a vegan and hates that you aren&#x27;t; now you don&#x27;t really care anymore and can focus on eating the food you want to. Flip the roles, Bob eats whatever he wants and hates that you&#x27;re a vegan; you again don&#x27;t care.')
