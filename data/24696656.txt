The opposite of that would be being able to tell when they&#x27;ll happen and where they&#x27;ll end before they start, and&#x2F;or make them happen on demand and land on desired target.<p>&gt; <i>We have had machines that do what you describe for decades.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t knew that. Thanks for citation. This leads me to ask: so why aren&#x27;t we employing this for VR?')
