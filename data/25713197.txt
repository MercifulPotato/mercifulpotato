Are you all ready to fight for our rights?&quot;. &quot;Oh no, those are fighting words, they incite violence&quot;. Would you like ban her from all platforms?<p>What happens to people without a party? A recent trend on the progressive left was the #ForceTheVote to ask the AOC, squad and the progressive wing of the party to withhold their vote for Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s speakership in exchange for a vote on M4All (the thing they&#x27;ve run on, &quot;but now is not the time&quot;). Should they all be banned because they want to &quot;force&quot; the vote?<p>&quot;Hold your representatives feet to the fire&quot;? Do I want to literally do that and burn them alive? Or I want to keep them accountable?<p>&quot;Heads on pikes&quot;? Do I want to behead them, or I want them to lose their position and I want them to get fired?<p>What if I get frustrated at a party, and I say &quot;the gloves are off&quot; and decide to run against them? &quot;Oh no, he said &#x27;gloves are off&#x27;, he wants to be beat up the congressman&#x2F;congresswoman. Silence him!&quot;. What if I say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to destroy them&quot;. Obviously, I was speaking in the political sense, but if enough people on cable say the opposite, you&#x27;ll never believe me.<p>The point is that there are usually hundreds of ways to frame something. If you didn&#x27;t hear the context, and you only see the 5 seconds soundbite, you&#x27;ll believe it&#x27;s justified. You also won&#x27;t look into it, because &quot;why would you protect an aggressor? the clip was clear, he&#x2F;she threatened people with violence&quot;.<p>FYI: I brought examples from the left so that people understand that almost every person who has given an energetic speech can be framed as &quot;violent&quot; and in the future can be shut down (if the power dynamics change). I used American examples, as the two-party system is simpler as a multiparty system and most people are familiar with the things that happen in the US. The same would be true in other countries, though.')
