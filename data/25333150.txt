With AI the current subscription model is probably not granular enough. Every device&#x2F;robot will switch tasks and capabilities and upgrades&#x2F;downgrades with such a frequency that traditional subscription breaks (refunds&#x2F;tax&#x2F;fees etc) so blockchain subscription per device without human interaction will probably work better. AI is bots learning from bots which is already distributed, so centralizing that may be inefficient (high bandwidth).')
