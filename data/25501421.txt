If they don&#x27;t get therapy they can be become aggressive and violent as they get older.  A screaming hitting 5 year old is far different than a screaming hitting 15 year old.<p>Spinning in circles, flapping, repetition, sensory issues, the requirement of definite routines.  It&#x27;s a whole different world and exhausting.<p>You can identify signs of autism as early as 18 months.  At age 2 or 3 it can be reliably diagnosed.  I&#x27;ve personally seen autistic non-verable young kids go through intensive therapy and develop into kids who can attend kindergarten or 1st grade.<p>What is really sad is that for the kids that don&#x27;t get early intervention and where schools and states are not able to identify these kids.  These kids end up with behavioral IEPs, might get kicked out of school and have no friends.  Not that the kids necessarily want to play with other kids.<p>Also the UK is seriously behind in autism therapy services and while it is good to focus on positive traits that might be associated with autism it is not helpful to those who really need the help.  And in many cases you need a lot of help.  But if you invest when the kids are young you can really make a difference.<p>In the US, Obamacare really opened up services in the US and even then its hit or miss.  For example, federal employees have no early intervention&#x2F;autism coverage.  And before that you had to go to specific states or school districts or be really rich to get any type of help.  Even then it takes 6 months to get your kid in somewhere and the wait lists are huge as demand is so high.<p>Kids with autism basically need 1:1 therapy 8 hours a day with positive reinforcement either ABA, AVB etc...  I am a fan of center based programs but you do need to find a good program.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autismspeaks.org&#x2F;signs-autism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autismspeaks.org&#x2F;signs-autism</a><p>Also I am not sure what Baron-Cohen is suggesting here but saying that there is a &quot;scientific rationale&quot; behind the kid flipping the light on and off or staring at the fireplace or a ceiling fan wondering how it is just nonsense. I mean maybe its true but did the kid tell you that?  The kid is presumably not able to ask someone as to why the light turns on when he flicks the switch or if told, integrate the response.  I think it is more consistent with the need for stimulation.  Also his comment on a savant with autism is really not helpful.  Savant syndrome is probably co-morbid with autism, development delay, and intellectual disability... but to say that&#x27;s an autistic trait is just irresponsible.<p>His book is basically a generalization based on autistic traits focused on systematizing and pattern matching and guess what the major confounding variable is ... we are all humans.  Humans are pattern matchers + more.  We also all respond to stimulus&#x2F;response.  And even animals are pattern matchers.')
