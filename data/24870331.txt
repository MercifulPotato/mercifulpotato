I&#x27;m not really a big fan of corporate taxes just because they seem to always either find a way around it, or they just raise prices. It&#x27;s hard to escape.<p>There&#x27;s no way around payroll taxes for employees. The ones they elude are corporate income taxes. If they have to raise prices to cover the cost of insuring drivers, or paying their share of social funds, then good. Because if they don&#x27;t, its the public that bears the costs.<p>&gt; I think the issue here is the definition of full-time work is not enough. It has to include other things, like having to physically go to a place of employment, work hours that you&#x27;re told to work, etc.<p>There is more to it. What you&#x27;re arguing for is an escape rule if hours are too low, that supercedes all of the other logic.<p>&gt; Here&#x27;s the actual issue. These gig workers, or contractors, or whatever you want to call them need benefits (healthcare etc.) that the government isn&#x27;t paying for.<p>No, the government (the public) is paying for it, because Uber and Lyft aren&#x27;t.<p>&gt; The government needs to pay for that by raising taxes and&#x2F;or lowering costs, etc. The way to do that isn&#x27;t to make Uber and Lyft leave California and leave those workers without any sort of income.<p>The government needs to do that by raising taxes on Uber and Lyft, which is largely the point of making these people of employees. Is there a middle of the road version where uber just pays the proportion costs that drivers earn pro rated to the hours they work? Yeah, maybe, but that&#x27;s likely not viable either. Uber is already in the red because their business model is bad.<p>If we imagined them paying their fair share, would you support an explicit subsidy to help keep them in business in CA? God I hope not.')
