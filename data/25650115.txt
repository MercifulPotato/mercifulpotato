But it is not only the Israelis that don&#x27;t want them there, the majority Sunni and Christians in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq also not happy with the Iranian push, hence the joy everybody had when Trump killed Sulemeini.<p>Obama was an idiot who bought into the meme of &quot;preventing nuclear&quot;, he didn&#x27;t understand the middle east at all and during his time the middle east was in flames with millions of deaths and refugees. He didn&#x27;t support the demonstrations in Iran when they happened, just stood there looking like a the lame useless president that he was with his useless speeches.<p>Trump brought quiet and peace and he did it with almost no cost of life, just by having a knack to dealing with crazy leaders of the region which is more aligned with his natural craziness and line of thinking, and with a bit of Kushner brilliance behind the scenes.<p>I just hope Biden is not as stupid as Obama and will keep the pressure on Iran, got a feeling he is a bit more experienced and realist so I am hopeful he will understand what&#x27;s going on.')
