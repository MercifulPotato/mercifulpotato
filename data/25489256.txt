As if women don&#x27;t have other reasons to need money just like everyone in society.<p>3) Assuming that women are searching for a &quot;high quality man&quot; who would disapprove of them having made money off of OnlyCams because it&#x27;s &quot;filthy&quot;. Again, places women in the passenger seat, assumes that they are only around to try to find a quality mate (male) and that their only desirable qualities are their &quot;purity&quot; that has somehow been tarnished.<p>I could go on. This is a disgusting point of view.')
