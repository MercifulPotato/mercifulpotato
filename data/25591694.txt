[Click link for an explanation by the same author]<p>&gt;  There is no strong sandboxing in the standard Linux desktop. [...] This is in contrast to other desktop operating systems such as macOS or Windows 10 [...]. Windows automatically sandboxes UWP applications and provides the Windows Sandbox utility for non-UWP applications.<p>Is this actually fair? Windows Sandbox is not that different from using docker, or even better a VM, is it? It&#x27;s great that UWP apps are sandboxed, but they&#x27;re a minority of the apps people use.<p>I don&#x27;t get how Windows gets a point over Linux here. Running all or most apps in a sandbox without the user even noticing improves security, but neither OS really do that effectively. Windows Sandbox is cool, and Linux doesn&#x27;t have something like that out of the box, but a VM is easy to install and create no?')
