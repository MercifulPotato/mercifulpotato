Stability and looking after yourself are key strategies to make your life easier. Save money if you can. Having a buffer makes it easier to say no or walk away or take time off.<p>I think that the invisibility of chronic illness combined with the expectations of society and others is the hardest thing to deal with. Especially during certain life phases, and especially with people who are close where the expectations reveal themselves over time (family, partners &#x2F; their family, business associates). Empathy can erode over time too.<p>Every man and his dog will give you advice how to manage or cure things, but in the case of an ambiguous chronic illness, I found that being selective about who you listen to &#x2F; when you listen is best. Some days you say to hell with it and ignore everyone&#x27;s advice. Other days you will wake up and say, today is the day I am going to try this that I haven&#x27;t tried before. Also keep an eye out for those little things that make a difference that nobody knows about but you. Don&#x27;t feel like you have to justify them to anyone.')
