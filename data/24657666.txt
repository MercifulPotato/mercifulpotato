Lawyers for corporations do not care about their obligations under the law. They blatantly abuse it.<p>I am not an attorney and when lawyers, 3 teams of them from the corporation and 2 separate firms come after you with 50 page legal memorandum, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you quote the law to them. It doesn&#x27;t matter if what they are doing is illegal. It&#x27;s the most intimidating thing I&#x27;ve ever done. They lie, gaslight, ... and I don&#x27;t even know what is what.<p>They can absolutely ruin people, but I feel strong in my case and I have more to file.<p>I went to an attorney about this and they said I absolutely do have a case and it was even bigger than I realized. The attorney told me I should take this case myself. Several steps I can take alone. Yes, that&#x27;s right. They said I should represent <i>myself</i>. If I got an attorney the corporation would financially <i>ruin</i> me. All communication would go through legal firms and at hundreds of dollars an hour, I would be in debt for the rest of my life.<p>Not only would I be emotionally ruined, but I would be financially ruined too.<p>So I&#x27;m fighting this through the legal system myself.<p>I&#x27;ve researche the law. Read hundreds of cases. I have handled my own correspondences. At one point, I quoted the law back to them, as you have done here to me, and <i>ordered</i> them to stop the illegal activity. They asked who my legal counsel was so they could direct communications through them and I was so proud in that moment, because I listened to the other attorneys&#x27; advice and thwarted that attack. When they stonewalled me, I proceeded through the legal system. I have even questioned their witnesses under oath in a hearing. It has been an intense journey and I am still waiting for justice.<p>As it turns out, I actually have even more power than I initially thought by representing myself, because an attorney in a position of power abusing that power the way they have toward me was a big mistake on their part. The courts don&#x27;t look kindly on professional attorneys bullying former employees going <i>pro se</i>.<p>Every day is a roller coaster. I support myself as an underdog going up against this behemoth.<p>When I can get my head above water and breathe for a bit, like right now, I feel proud of what I am doing. I am resigned to the idea that if I die because of this pursuit for justice, then it&#x27;s a world I don&#x27;t want to be in <i>anyway</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not asking other engineers to go this far. I have nothing to lose but my mind and my future. I am in a unique position to do it. Most people do not have the liberty I do.<p>All I am suggesting is that when in a position to implement functionality that you know will make the world around you <i>worse</i>, just don&#x27;t do it.<p>Don&#x27;t do it for money. Don&#x27;t do it so you won&#x27;t get fired. Just don&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t do it because if you don&#x27;t, someone else will. If they fire you, sue them, or just get another job. There are plenty out there. They can&#x27;t tell everyone what a horrible employee you are like they said they would to me so I would just <i>quit</i> and sweep all this under the rug.<p>You have the power to say no to evil. Just don&#x27;t do it. Stop sacrificing your integrity for money.<p>Look around at the world around us. <i>We</i> built this. It doesn&#x27;t matter if we have PE licenses and wet stamp documents. We have the power to write code or <i>not</i> write that code.<p>I don&#x27;t have a job anymore. But I have <i>integrity</i>. I have my <i>honor</i>. I feel <i>good</i>. I&#x27;m scared. Of course. I&#x27;m in way over my head.<p>But I&#x27;m righteous!<p>If I have to suffer for it. Fine.<p>I&#x27;m not asking anyone to take it this far. Just don&#x27;t write code that hurts society anymore.<p>And don&#x27;t be afraid not to. There are other jobs. Let evil corporations fill up with crappy engineers and bloated salaries. All the good ones will migrate to the good companies. Or, look at me. I&#x27;m simply <i>not</i> implementing fraud that helps criminals wash their money.<p>I feel <i>real</i> good about that. I&#x27;m also learning a lot about the legal system. Maybe I&#x27;ll come out of all this and work for a <i>good</i> law firm or the justice system. I&#x27;m learning a lot and it&#x27;s very interesting. The law is like computer code, but written to control human beings. I didn&#x27;t even know what <i>prima facie</i> meant before all this started, but I referred to precedent and I think I established my prima facie case!<p>All I need to do right now is survive until it&#x27;s over so I can think about anything else at all and I can&#x27;t wait for that day. One thing I&#x27;ve learned about the legal system is that it is very, very slow.')
