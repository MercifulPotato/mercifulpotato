My father in law had the same experience.  He once took an enforcement person into his house and insisted they go through the house together and conduct an exhaustive search of all the places a TV could be.  &quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s in the cistern of the toilet?  Let&#x27;s look!...Not there?  Perhaps it&#x27;s in the bread bin...&quot; etc etc<p>It is really bad the way they do this, and having seen the threatening letters they send out they could be very frightening.  The letters were on the lines of &quot;Our detectors have found that you have a TV and you have to pay the license fee or we&#x27;ll send bailiffs around, take you to court etc&quot;, and the one I received once (when i too didn&#x27;t have a TV) was printed on red paper.')
