Chicken or egg?<p>Does a thick German or Scandinavian accent count against them?  What about Mexican&#x2F;Spanish?  What about Ebonics&#x2F;Black English?  That has well understood rules for how it&#x27;s used, even though many people don&#x27;t realize it.<p>Presumably what you <i>actually</i> care about when hiring is their ability to work well with their peers and managers, and how well they accomplish the work they are given.  If so, you are using mannerisms to help inform about these attributes you actually care about because you think those mannerisms correlate in some way.  But what do you have to go by to actually support this evidence?  If it&#x27;s from personal experience, how rigorous have you been in making sure you note the data, and didn&#x27;t subconsciously discount or ignore instances counter to your expectations?')
