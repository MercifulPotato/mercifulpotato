You should not invert this by demanding people prove things don&#x27;t work and aren&#x27;t dangerous; that way lies madness.<p>But at any rate, we can see for ourselves how great an impact those mask mandates had:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalground.com&#x2F;mask-charts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalground.com&#x2F;mask-charts&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;france-masks-cases2-e1600240628130.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;france-masks-ca...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;these-12-graphs-show-mask-mandates-do-nothing-to-stop-covid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;these-12-graphs-show-ma...</a><p>Mask mandates don&#x27;t seem to be associated with any impact on the graphs of positive test results, anywhere. If they don&#x27;t work then they should not be used for all kinds of reasons, dangerousness is by no means the only factor that should determine decisions.
