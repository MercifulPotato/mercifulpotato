I went through it and wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. On the other side of it you attain focus on what is valuable to you, which is singularly useful for evaluating subsequent jobs. However, the crucible for me consisted of: depression, burnout, tendonitis.<p>It sucked.<p>From that, I decided I&#x27;d never do webdev again, including so-called backend. The web as a medium is not where I&#x27;m supposed to be. I can&#x27;t stand the culture, the churn, the faux openness, the re-invention of things that already exist. I don&#x27;t care. In fact, I&#x27;d rather do another job entirely than webdev. And I considered that for a long while. I took a long, winding journey away from software and eventually back into it, through things like LLVM, Haskell, Rust. Slowly, I began to discover people with whom I shared a technical aesthetic actually existed, and were much smarter&#x2F;capable than I was. This was humbling and exciting, as it started to paint a picture of what I wanted to work toward.<p>One priceless realization: the people with the technical career I wanted weren&#x27;t the ones always featured on HN or elsewhere. HN&#x27;s startup focus tends to suck all the air out of the room of other interesting domains.<p>Professionally, I started seriously investigating domains that weren&#x27;t web&#x2F;data-related. (I also decided I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone about this, because Smart People like to say things like, &quot;but then what job would you get? Every job is a web job, Jeff Atwood even said so!!!&quot;) I&#x27;m doing quite fine now.<p>Focus, in both the moment-to-moment attention and long-term vision sense, is a superpower. Without disillusionment, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have it.')
