Not baby sitting the employees is the only correct option here.<p>&gt;So the company should just call the Police and wash their hands<p>Yes they should call the police, and it&#x27;s not &quot;washing their hands&quot;. Sexual harassment is a criminal offence. Your employer shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;handling&quot; that like they shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;handling&quot; rape.<p>&gt;have an appropriate sexual harassment policy, train their employees on how to identify and deal with sexual harassment, have a clear procedure on how to file and deal with complaints.<p>The policy is the law. Adults shouldn&#x27;t have their employer telling them that sexual harassment is a no no.<p>&gt;Maybe you will call such things &quot;babysitting&quot;, I say its being responsible.<p>The responsible thing is to involve the authorities when one of your employees is committing a crime. Simple as that.')
