I&#x27;m with others who are not really impressed. For years the best Facebook could do were &quot;Hot single [your gender preference] in [your city] are looking for [your age] [your gender]&quot;. Thanks, Mad Lib ads.<p>But for the sake of argument let&#x27;s say there is some small increment. What is the cost we are willing to pay for that? Databases that know exactly how much time we spend on the toilet? Political disinformation campaigns? Insurrection attempts?<p>It&#x27;s like making baby monitors a little bit more convenient, but in the process opening the door for pedo hackers to speak directly to your children&#x27;s cribs. Tiny conveniences aren&#x27;t worth sacrificing everything we have.')
