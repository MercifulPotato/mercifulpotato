I was baffled how did I get into that? Did I develop some neurological problem? Did I hurt myself during sleep and damaged something? Nah...<p>...it was all because of years of poor posture and sitting for hours in front of the PC.<p>So I&#x27;m committed to unlearn the bad sitting&#x2F;posture habits that I&#x27;ve acquired for more than a decade. It&#x27;s not just about standing desks&#x2F;ergonomic chairs, we need to move regularly, rest in different positions other than sitting, and develop the strength required to keep a good posture.')
