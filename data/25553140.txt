It&#x27;s already cheaper than coal.<p>I don&#x27;t think retrofitting residential rooftop solar is necessarily such a great idea given the high installation cost. It&#x27;ll make much more sense on large flat roofs like on strip malls. Residential electricity users will probably get more bang for their buck by being able to take advantage of fluctuating spot prices - e.g. with intelligent storage heaters.<p>It&#x27;ll make sense on newbuilds though. If you&#x27;re already building a roof, why not make it generate a bit of electricity? The installation cost will already be built in.')
