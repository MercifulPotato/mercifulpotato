Maybe in some kinds of racing, either in cars, bicycles or on foot (or the million other kinds like kayaking etc), come closer to either pure skill or athletic prowess anyway. Something like guitar hero (III is the only one I played), where it&#x27;s the same every time is pretty much a pure test of skill.<p>Significantly, none of my examples really are real world things - anything interesting always involves some element of chance that cannot be isolated from skill.')
