I thought it was total transmitted bytes, since the numbers seemed pretty lowâ€¦but then I checked and danluu&#x27;s site is like 20 KB on my computer because of Google Analytics but it&#x27;s listed as 3 (TIL it&#x27;s five times heavier than my site, though I write much less: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saagarjha.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saagarjha.com&#x2F;</a>). Anyone know what is going on here? Is it &quot;transferred bytes with JavaScript off&quot;, which is a rather strange metric?')
