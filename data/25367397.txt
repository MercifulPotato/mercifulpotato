In the letter, senators Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Gary Peters of Michigan and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota ask YouTube to commit to removing content with false or misleading information about the 2020 US presidential election and future political races, including the coming, pivotal Senate runoffs in Georgia.<p>&gt;“We urge you to immediately remove all election outcome misinformation and take aggressive steps to implement prohibitions, as other social media companies have done, regarding outcomes in future elections,” the letter reads.<p>This isn&#x27;t a company deciding, this is censorship urged by the government. I thought that kind of thing was illegal down there.<p>Not saying anything either way about the politics of the election, but isn&#x27;t this blatant government censorship?')
