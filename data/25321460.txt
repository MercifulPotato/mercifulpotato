I find people often conflate having a powerful type system with static typing. Julia has a very powerful and expressive dynamic type system and I really appreciate it.<p>Static typing is significantly more restrictive, which I think is harmful for the interactive workflows which are so prevalent in exploratory data oriented applications.<p>&gt; Furthemore, some statically typed languages do have typing features that are advantageous for data analysis. Think F# type providers or type systems where e.g. the shape of arrays is guaranteed to match at compile time.<p>For instance, julia can do this with it&#x27;s type system too. There&#x27;s nothing here requiring <i>static</i> typing. See StaticArrays.jl[1] which has a SArray type (static size, static contents), a MArray type (static size, mutable contents) and a SizedArray type (is a statically sized wrapper for a regular array (rather than Tuple) making it more appropriate for large arrays)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaArrays&#x2F;StaticArrays.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaArrays&#x2F;StaticArrays.jl</a>')
