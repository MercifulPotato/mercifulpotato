Item(by='XorNot', descendants=None, kids=[25024146], score=None, time=1604802782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021620, text='Hi, I&#x27;m from Australia. Voting is mandatory here! Turn out in our elections is 99.x%. You are not obligated to make a choice, but you are obligated under pain of a $30 fine to be registered at a polling station on election day. You can avoid the fine if you present a valid reason for not voting after the election when notified. Such a reason would definitely include &quot;I was prevented from voting&quot; or &quot;I was threatened if I voted&quot;, and would be registered with the AEC and investigated seriously.<p>Our Electoral commission is the most trusted government body in the country, and has maintained a culture of independence and accuracy. We don&#x27;t have any form of electronic voting, but generally have election results on election night.<p>Our system has multiple viable political parties! Factions on both the left and right of the spectrum at multiple government levels have successfully won and lost seats over the years depending on their ability to poll within the electorate. This <i>has not</i> resulted in them being regarded as &quot;spoilers&quot; to the main political parties, and has acted at times as an effective check on government policy since it encouraged cross-party negotiation through multiple avenues.<p>Is our system perfect? No - no system is. But come election night, our representative government <i>actually</i> represents the people. If you got 51% of the vote, then 51% of the population, through some means, selected you as a preferred candidate.')
