It&#x27;s more or less as good as regular Java, or better for some languages, but it&#x27;s not really worse except perhaps on a few specific microbenchmarks.<p>Moreover, GraalVM is open source. Please don&#x27;t try and redefine basic terms, as otherwise by your logic Linux would be shareware because Red Hat sell a better version of it, Android would be shareware, Chromium would be shareware etc. Making an open source product and selling a better version that isn&#x27;t is perfectly legit. If you don&#x27;t believe that, how do you envision platforms be funded?<p>As for the pricing, it is or was on their online shop. You could buy it with a credit card. Seems they have a problem with their store right now, but I&#x27;ve seen public price lists in the past. It&#x27;s expensive but not at all &quot;if you have to ask you can&#x27;t afford it&quot;.')
