This is effectively a tax, added to every bottle sold, available to be redeemed upon being turned into a recycling center.<p>Even with this, not enough people bother.<p>The real solution is to make our garbage collection far more efficient. Why do we still separate recyclables and garbage into separate bins? As-if regular people can be trusted to do this without fail? Make it automatic, and a lot of this concern will go away.')
