Sometimes you do need to describe the relationships between data. Rust attempts to leverage your description of the transformation and relationships to make memory management something you don&#x27;t have to worry about either.<p>There are limits, of course, and sometimes you need to help it out, however this amounts to improving or clarifying the description of your system. On the other hand resolving garbage collection issues often involves making surprising and seemingly irrelevant changes to your system that happen to influence via spooky action at a distance the behavior of an unrelated component of the system. And if you remove them it all falls apart again.<p>To borrow a turn of phrase, it has a cost, sure like it has a cost using C instead of assembly.')
