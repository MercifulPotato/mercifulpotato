With 250kW (v3) charging, you can get to a sufficiently high state of charge (&gt;80%) in under 30 minutes. And the thing is, given how efficient an EV is, you <i>don&#x27;t need</i> 2700 mega-joules (20 gallons of gas or 750 kWh) to go ~500 miles. The Cybertruck will do that range to with ~100-150 kWh of battery and charge up in under an hour. This will probably get faster over the coming year as charging rates go up.<p>And like another comment pointed out, majority of charging happens overnight or during the day when the car sits idle. I own a Model 3 myself and I have not been to a supercharger in several months.')
