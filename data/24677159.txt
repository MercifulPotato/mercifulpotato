There are no tricks which solve the problems completely. It would be like asking for a trick to gain muscles or a trick to learn Spanish. The trick for both is: do the work. I&#x27;d argue that it is the same for focus. For example, Einstein was able to work through the sound of his crying baby [1]. Ignoring the questionable fatherhood practices, it shows that Einstein did not need a trick to get into the flow.<p>Doing the work implies that you optimize for doing the work. For one, that means reducing the number of possible distractions. Two great examples are Donald Knuth and Linus Torvalds. Knuth, doesn&#x27;t read his emails or letters for extended periods of time and Linus&#x27; workplace is a desk staring straight to a white wall. Both people have clearly optimized for avoiding distractions and they seem to have come quite far with their lifes. If you want to hear a similar message about cutting distractions from an ex-Navy SEAL, then see Jocko [2].<p>Note that my examples do assume an, lets say, average Hacker News individual. Of course, if you have ADD or live under the poverty line then hearing that you &quot;should just focus&quot; is as unhelpful as telling a depressed person to be happy.<p>[1]: Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WAiZqtxbvYQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WAiZqtxbvYQ</a>')
