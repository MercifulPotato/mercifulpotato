Companies like Pfizer and Astra etc have lots of infrastructure for manufacturing and logistics, as they’ve been making drugs for years. Moderna hasn’t ever released a product before, and now we need them to successfully make hundreds of millions or billions of doses of it very quickly? I have every confidence that the drug itself is safe and effective, but I fear that they won’t be able to deliver on the quantities required.')
