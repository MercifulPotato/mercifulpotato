Advertisers and copyright maximalists less so.<p>Bandwidth and distribution are no longer the limitations on independent hosting they once were.  Independent discovery methods (e.g., DDG video search), are improving.  Noncommercial orientation makes youtube-dl and similar mechanisms a net positive --- simplify the web-based delivery, increase viewer flexibility, provide greater tolerance for network or system variability.<p>My own interest in YouTube has very little to do with commercial mass media, and far less to do with ad-seeking chum-spewing bottom-feeders.')
