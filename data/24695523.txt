Humans operate in a 3D world, but act on a 2D plane. Very few places in nature let you have one sector over another (one person over another). We have 3D presentation, but there are 4 cardinal directions, no up and down because we don&#x27;t fly and don&#x27;t dive very often. We&#x27;re like Warcraft3 &#x2F; Starcraft(2) creatures.<p>For this reason even if we had flying cars, we would crash all the time. Pilots get disoriented easily, and they are cream of the crop.')
