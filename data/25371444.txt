It&#x27;s presumed it&#x27;s not controversial. The important point is we&#x27;re able to discover a tar → cancer causation by controlling for smoking behavior without doing an intervention, and combining this with the smoking → tar causation, we can then reason there&#x27;s a smoking → cancer causation.<p>Of course this is a simplified example to illustrate the causal logic at play. No one seriously believes there are only ever two possible hypotheses. But the point is the universe of plausible hypotheses is not infinite, either. Scientists in the real world are not dealing with the set of logically possible statements consistent with raw sensory experience. They&#x27;re building models of the world, and testing and challenging a few of their beliefs at a time, to gradually come closer to the truth.<p>When they can conduct randomized controlled trials, that&#x27;s great. But it&#x27;s not always feasible or even possible, yet it&#x27;s still often possible in those cases to test competing causal hypotheses via observation. The Eddington experiment tested the (causal) theory of General Relativity against the (causal) theory of Newtonian gravity, but there was no intervention. The discovery of iridium in a giant crater off the coast of Mexico was a key confirmation for the (causal) dinosaur meteor extinction theory, but there was no intervention there either. These were causal hypotheses tested by observation. A scientist is always free to propose an alternative hypothesis, but in the mean time, these were tests of their predictions.<p>The point is RCTs are a special case of a more general causal logic. RCTs work because they sever the statistical link to confounders, <i>but only provided your assumptions about the RCTs are correct</i>. In particular, your random number generator must not <i>itself</i> be confounded with what you&#x27;re measuring (how do you know there&#x27;s not a hidden variable simultaneously controlling your coin flip and the outcome of your experiment?), you must do the observations double-blinded, your results must not be a statistical fluke, etc. etc. <i>All of these assumptions can be challenged</i>, just like the assumptions in my smoking&#x2F;lung cancer example. In the real world scientists often accept, at least tentatively, that these assumptions hold. For if they don&#x27;t, they can never learn anything.')
