He wasn&#x27;t the only one.  Hoare, Backus, McCarthy... there were a lot of people who made important, fundamental contributions.<p>Structured programming caught on.  Proofs did not, for reasons that would have offended Dijkstra - they took time, and it was actually more valuable (both socially and financially) to produce mostly-working software quickly than to produce proven-correct software slowly.<p>But he never would have accepted that the real world was that way.  He insisted that his approach was correct.  As Backus said of him, &quot;This guyâ€™s arrogance takes your breath away.&quot;<p>So:  Important contributions?  Absolutely.  More than anyone else&#x27;s?  Perhaps.  Carried computer science on his shoulders?  No, but he probably thought he did.')
