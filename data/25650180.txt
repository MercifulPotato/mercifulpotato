A lot of proofs also require creativity, in the sense that they aren&#x27;t just &quot;find the set of logical steps from &#x27;initial condition&#x27; to &#x27;proof&#x27;&quot;, but they require auxiliary theorems, definitions and constructions that help make the problem manageable.<p>Another problem is that a lot of proofs starts by exploration. For example, certain bounds for functions or convergence rates are proved without knowing what will be the end result.<p>Of all the problems that ML could be applied to, I find mathematical proofs one of the least promising. One, I don&#x27;t see enough similarity between proofs that would allow any algorithm to learn useful patterns; and two, I don&#x27;t think most mathematicians would trust a proof that cannot be understood (even if the output is a set of steps for a formal system, I imagine translating that to human language could be quite difficult).')
