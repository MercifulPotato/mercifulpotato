Apple developers love Apple product, look around the third party software on Mac, their developers love the operating system, and use it every day. It makes a huge difference. Elon Musk drives a Tesla, so he knows what it feels like to be a customer. I doubt Sony executives use Sony headphones in everyday life.')
