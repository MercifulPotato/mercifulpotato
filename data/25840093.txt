Short sellers have been running the stock into the ground over the past years and have been stupid enough to get to roughly 130% short interest as percentage of available float.<p>2. There are no more shares available for them to borrow and sell short, WSB has jumped into this trade following Ryan Cohen (your dog must know him), buying as many shares as possible, decreasing the float even further and pushing the price up.<p>3. Ryan Cohen owns about 13% of the company. He founded chewy.com and is an e-commerce wizard who wants to turn GameStop around from a brick-and-mortar shop to a digital &#x2F; e-commerce player. He joined the board last week together with two other former Chewy execs (COO and CMO). FYI GameStop digital sales are 300% yoy and the company has recently posted a profit for the first time in many quarters. Shorts pretend like Chewy never happened, Ryan has nothing to do with GameStop and digital sales are nonexistent.<p>4. This short squeeze is inevitable. There are no other moves short sellers can do. They are trapped and check-mate is near. It will be similar to VW in 2008 and more aggressive than Overstock last year.')
