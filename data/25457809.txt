I love how easy Netlify makes it to deploy things, but I don&#x27;t really understand their pricing.<p>I recently built a pretty basic static webapp that would have racked up around £100 in bandwidth charges (~0.5TB) in the first 24 hours on Netlify. I stuck it on BunnyCDN instead after I realised this and it ended up costing around £3. The five or so minutes I save manually running and uploading the build each time is not worth many hundreds of pounds a month.<p>Netlify&#x27;s bandwidth charges seem excessive, but then Vercel and DO App Platform are comparable, so maybe I&#x27;m missing something. I guess CDN companies have an advantage here. I&#x27;d be happy to pay Netlify money for all the sites I host that don&#x27;t use a lot of bandwidth, but they insist in hosting them for free.')
