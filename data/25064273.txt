I&#x27;m not a professional photographer but I care about image quality. Google&#x27;s &quot;high quality&quot; option really means &quot;16 Megapixels or less&quot; which is lower quality than most modern cameras can capture, so by taking advantage of unlimited storage, you&#x27;re sacrificing image quality.')
