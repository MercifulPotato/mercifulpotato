I only use ECC DRAM in my desktop these days and I monitor bit flips which on my 64GB desktop happen about once a month[1]. A similar rate on my FreeNAS device which also has ECC memory.<p>Like others, I was super happy when I could by a Ryzen chip at retail prices and get ECC rather than buying a Xeon sku which was an extra $300.<p>[1] When I first built the system I was getting about 2 a week which I tracked down to a &#x27;weak&#x27; ram stick. Replaced it (Corsair, and they replaced it for free) and now it&#x27;s about one a month.')
