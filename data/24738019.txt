TCL is chosen because its portable across almost All EDA tools, so by using it, Xilinx are ensuring your existing HW design skills apply to FPGA tools also, instead of the proprietary interfaces ISE used. So while TCL is not a language I like, it is the HW standard so it must be in any serious EDA tool. I use many EDA tools daily (design compiler, primetime, icc2, vcs, xcelium, verdi, redhawk, and vivado) all have TCL, so some scripts are portable between tools, which is I assume why Xilinx chose to also have some command compatability with the Synopsys commands. So doing this makes HW design skills portable, which I really appreciate. This was also why they moved to XDC constraints from the UCF, embraching existing standards to help engineers.')
