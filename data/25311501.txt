Why do you get to decide?<p>I wrote a paper recently in which I omitted most tangentially-related papers in mathematical physics, as they would not be mathematically accessible to the audience in question and also do not address the questions posed in the paper. A mathematical physicist wrote to me and was grumpy about it. Fine, I added his name one more time to make him happy. That&#x27;s the reality of research papers.<p>It&#x27;s clear that Google didn&#x27;t want to be affiliated with this paper. And it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s time for Gebru to find a place with intellectual freedom, so her work can be judged on its merits.')
