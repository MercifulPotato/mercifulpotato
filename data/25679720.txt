In the former case I would at least have told support about my problem.<p>I do believe that there is &quot;enough&quot; money to be made solving real-world problems for people and treating them like humans so they aren&#x27;t going to drop you like a hot rock at the first chance.  I&#x27;m happy to see some voices confirming that in this thread.')
