Virality of the kind Twitter relies on is not essential to the definition of a social network. I do not quit out of a desire for some ascetic lifestyle or asocial tendency. I like to discuss ideas in the comment threads of HN as much as anyone. That&#x27;s originally what drew me to the service over 10 years ago.<p>As to why I wrote this, I thought HN readers may be interested in my take on how we got here, having worked in the space professionally. After all, social media tech used to be a big thing on these forums back in the day.<p>Then again, maybe there&#x27;s also a lesson in that we expect anyone who writes anything now only does it to farm clicks.')
