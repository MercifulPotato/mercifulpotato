Lockdown itself wasn&#x27;t applied in a uniform fashion: hospitals figured out pretty quickly that lack of care was killing people and modified policies to mitigate that damage. My <i>own</i> advice to friends and family was &quot;probably best not to go to the hospital for that&quot; in March, and back to normal in April when I realized that the numbers weren&#x27;t as bad as portrayed. Anecdotally, all of the deaths I mentioned happened close to the beginning of lockdown in their respective countries.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t idle speculation: genuine mainstream health authorities believe lockdown has killed significant numbers of people. This is not a controversial position.')
