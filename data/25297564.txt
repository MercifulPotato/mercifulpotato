Because if you don’t, then what’s the difference?<p>You don&#x27;t test the ORM, you test your models. If you&#x27;re writing db procesures you&#x27;d test the procedures, not the db&#x27;s procedure engine.<p>But yeah, you should be doing your testing in a test database already. The only problem I see is that you might have a tighter coupling between db schema version and software version with procedures (although then again, you could avoid that if you&#x27;re careful and make it less coupled)')
