Which is a good thing, given that the government has in the past done things like that.<p>&gt; This is how such matters should be tackled in a free society<p>Well that is cold comfort to the people who suffered real harm, during the red scare.  While other people were trying to solve that problem &quot;the right way&quot;, lots of people still suffered harm in the mean time.<p>Things don&#x27;t always get solves immediately.  Sometimes, problems just exist.  And regardless if things have been solved &quot;the right way&quot; or not, other solutions, such as anonymity still help.<p>None of this stuff is exclusive.  Feel free to try and stop government consequences some other way.  But regardless of that, anonymity still helps some people avoid some consequences for their speech, which is good.<p>&gt;  elaborate mechanisms<p>None of this is elaborate.  Lots of people have pretty effective ability to post speech anonymously.<p>Instead, it would be you who would have to engage in large elaborate schemes to prevent people from being anonymous.<p>The default, easy, non-elaborate solution is what we have now.  Which is that there are many platforms where anonymity is easy for most people, most of the time.  And that the government would have to take pretty extreme actions to remove that from people, like court orders that don&#x27;t happen very much right now for most people.')
