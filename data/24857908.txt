Was there an industry as prone to mishandle basic customer service like this in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, etc... Before ISP came to basically ruin our lives once every few years (and provide access to the greatest source of info in between ?)<p>I conjectures that the industry is so new that there has never been a &quot;decent ISP&quot; to set a gold standard, and that everyone is just operating into a &quot;well, we shitty but so is everyone else&quot; mindset. Is that accurate ?')
