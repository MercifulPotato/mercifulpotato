This is what it says:<p>Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at the block level, reducing the total amount of data stored. If a file system has the dedup property enabled, duplicate data blocks are removed synchronously. The result is that only unique data is stored and common components are shared among files.<p>Deduplicating data is a very resource-intensive operation. It is generally recommended that you have at least 1.25 GiB of RAM per 1 TiB of storage when you enable deduplication. Calculating the exact requirement depends heavily on the type of data stored in the pool.<p>Enabling deduplication on an improperly-designed system can result in performance issues (slow IO and administrative operations). It can potentially lead to problems importing a pool due to memory exhaustion. Deduplication can consume significant processing power (CPU) and memory as well as generate additional disk IO.')
