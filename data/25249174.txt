My daughter will try to open up my eye lids whilst I’m asleep and then start yelling “it’s morning time” at the top of her lungs. She has done this before at 4am and now I jolt awake at the sound of her entering our bedroom. Sadly it has been very effective at waking me up, and it’s hard to train her out of it when it works so well. To be honest I think I’m also sort of hard impressed by the brutality of it all.')
