This Lisp compiler won&#x27;t have a full implementation of closures or even labeled procedures for some time. So right now we&#x27;re getting used to name binding and using what we have.<p>While it&#x27;s possible to generate the same code I did even when rewriting to lambda, you&#x27;ll probably have to have some kind of strength reduction afterward.')
