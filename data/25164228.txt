Check out the worldwide trend.[1]<p>&gt; No one AFAIK, has managed to get their &quot;green&quot; energy solutions down to the levels france was in the 1980&#x27;s<p>The share of nuclear power generation in France peaked around 2005.[2] They had to temporarily shut down four plants in 2018 to avoid meltdowns[3] due to heatwaves which will become more frequent and they are cancelling nuclear projects in favor of renewable projects.<p>Renewable energy surpassed nuclear for the EU as a whole around 2014[4]. And the first half of this year, renewables provided more energy than fossil fuels:<p>&quot;It’s official: in the first half of 2020, and for the first time, Europe generated more electricity from renewable sources than from fossil fuels. Not only that, but electricity is proving cheaper in countries that have more renewables.<p>From January to June, wind, solar, hydro and bioenergy generated 40% of the electricity across the EU’s 27 member states, while fossil fuels generated 34%. In the United States, by way of contrast, fossil fuels generated more than 62% of electricity last year, while renewables accounted for less than 18%.&quot;[5]<p>&gt; The day its actually cheaper to put solar on your average house with a tesla power wall will be the day there is a shitton of home equity loans being taken out to do so.<p>&quot;Per the US residential solar finance update: H2 2019, a bit over half of homeowners who upgrade their homes with solar panels get a loan, a sixth of the population pay cash, and the last third rent their roof out to a third party.<p>Within those numbers were $1.35 billion of residential solar loan ABS (asset backed security) 144A public issuances in 2019, doubling 2018’s $680 million.&quot;[6]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;modern-renewable-energy-consumption?time=earliest..latest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;modern-renewable-energy-c...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_France" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_France</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;france-nuclear-reactors-shut-down-edf-europe-heat-wave-a8477776.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;france-nucle...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Renewable_energy_in_the_European_Union#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Gross_electricity_generation_by_fuel_in_Europe_(EU-28),_GWh,_1990-2013.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Renewable_energy_in_the_Europe...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;davidrvetter&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;european-renewables-just-crushed-fossil-fuels-heres-how-it-happened&#x2F;?sh=4c2fba5315df" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;davidrvetter&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;europea...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commercialsolarguy.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;01&#x2F;residential-solar-finance-a-review-of-2019s-1-35-billion-in-abs-144a-transactions-and-this-years-870-million&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commercialsolarguy.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;01&#x2F;residential-solar-...</a>')
