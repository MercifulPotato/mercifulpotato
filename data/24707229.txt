In 1920, I expect it was a lot more practical to target an open-border policy. Economically, the failure of a migrant means nothing to a local. In 2020, if a migrant does not succeed then there is a risk that the locals will be paying for it. I argue that that would reasonably change someone&#x27;s opinions.<p>The idea that a person&#x27;s location should have no impact is great, but sits in conflict with the US welfare system.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;0&#x2F;00&#x2F;Government_Revenue_and_spending_GDP.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;0&#x2F;00&#x2F;Governme...</a>')
