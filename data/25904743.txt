I&#x27;m very, very confident that there are people out there working in them full time, and making a good living.<p>But they are not even remotely in the same tier as Java, Python, Go, C++, C, Objective C, etc.<p>Again, this depends on your definition of &quot;common&quot;, but... can anyone tell me with a straight face that Java and FORTH are in the same class of usage?<p>Also, I already called out assembler as an exception. By its nature it will always be unsafe. This is fine by me, because any restriction that it lays down will be something that <i>no</i> language above it can possibly get around, no matter how good an idea that may become in a future, which is dangerously restrictive over the long term. I don&#x27;t look to assembler to provide language-level safety. I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> assembler to, say, rigidly protect the &quot;private&quot; fields of objects from exterior access, because then my debuggers and state viewers and other tools become impossible.')
