In essence, this is the same thing the body below is doing to you already, with continuous acceleration in the radial direction. But we&#x27;re talking about impact debris here, which do not accelerate under their own power. What happens is they get an <i>impulse</i> - a one-shot, near-instant change in velocity. If you just apply an impulse sideways, the eccentricity will increase, because your speed is now greater. The shape of your orbit around a spherical body is fully defined by your momentary position in 3D space and your <i>speed</i>. If your speed increases, the shape changes.<p>KSP maneuver node planner shows what would happen to your orbit if you applied an <i>impulse</i> to it, of a configured magnitude and direction. It&#x27;s not accounting for the burn time. Which makes it perfect for the purpose of talking about debris propelled by a collision.')
