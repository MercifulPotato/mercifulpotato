It&#x27;s what 4K is defined as, exactly 2x 1080p resolution in each dimension.</i><p>That&#x27;s irrelevant though, except if we&#x27;re talking about consuming movies fullscreen.<p>For a monitor I don&#x27;t want 4K, I want insivible pixels at viewing distances, so hi-dpi.<p>I would also prefer no scaling for assets that are bitmap in nature. This ideally means pixel doubling (less cpu&#x2F;gpu demanding and less fuzzy than fractional scaling).<p>This, for 27&quot; and more, means higher resolution that 4K. I don&#x27;t want to restrict myself to pixel-doubled 1920x1080 on my 27&quot; or 32&quot; monitor.<p>You do get nice DPI, but needlessly large buttons and other assets (compared to something closer to 5K).')
