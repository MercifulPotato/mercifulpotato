I didn&#x27;t know about this before, and all I knew what I&#x27;d ruined one of the most visible parts of the model and I was really, really upset.<p>My dad cut one for me out of plastic from a soda bottle, doing a great job of shaping it so it&#x27;d fit perfectly, but to me it just wasn&#x27;t the original and wasn&#x27;t just... right... So I never finished the model.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soinc.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;uploaded_files&#x2F;forensics&#x2F;For_supergluing.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soinc.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;uploaded_files&#x2F;for...</a>')
