You say in one comment that &quot;<i>there are a plethora of third-party tools that allow you to clear your browser data [...] you&#x27;d also be surprised how much you can do [...] from a simple policy file.</i>&quot; and in the very next comment insist that &quot;<i>it&#x27;s easy!</i>&quot;.<p>Lastly, your suggestion that we shouldn&#x27;t enshrine privacy in law because we haven&#x27;t enshrined other important things is nonsense. As you well know, enshrining privacy in law would cost the taxpayer $0 while the others you mentioned would literally cost <i>trillions</i>.<p>Not a very convincing argument.')
