I was tired and burnt out. This is the second time I&#x27;ve taken time off. I didn&#x27;t plan as much I had some high level goals, spend some time traveling, volunteering, work on open source projects.<p>The first month I felt guilty leaving a paycheck. \nI really didn&#x27;t travel much due to the pandemic.\nI did contribute to OSS and volunteer teaching high school students CS.\nIt definitely got lonely, I think due to the pandemic, but I would say my break time was fair.')
