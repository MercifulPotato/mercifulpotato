I have both, and am starting to prefer the APP, but batteries don&#x27;t last as long.  I keep using the QC20 wired some each week too.<p>In both cases those &#x27;transparency modes&#x27; do filter out a bit of useless noise, and I do feel a bit more &#x27;aware&#x27; of things&#x2F;people outside me with that mode on.  I&#x27;ve often thought that&#x27;s also at least partially because I intentionally switch to that mode for a reason (then switch back to full noise cancelling when done).')
