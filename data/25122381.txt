The application is not public, however.<p>There are many aspects to UI performance. Unlike IntelliJ, our app has only tens of widgets displayed at once - I can&#x27;t compare in this regard.<p>However, we have very big models, namely tables with &gt;100000 of rows. Scrolling is smooth and initialization as well. From my experience, JavaFX allows you to write elegant code which still caches a lot of components. This is a strong performance benefit.<p>My issue with JavaFX is a very well thought-out philosophy, translated into an API which is far from perfect. Once you go beyond &quot;hello world&quot; examples, you e.g. have to start type-casting. I&#x27;d love to see JavaFX v3 where these things would be sorted.')
