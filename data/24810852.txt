I like Smalltalk as a language, I do think that Swift would have been better if it&#x27;s runtime model was more similar to Objective-C and Smalltalk, but it&#x27;s not fair to say Swift &#x27;added Smalltalk syntax to address a special case&#x27;.<p>I do agree in general that Swift can benefit from a reduction of special cases, but my personal feeling is that Swift is getting more consistent every version (at least in the features that already existed). YMMV, of course.')
