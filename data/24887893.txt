They executed successfully (they got the language out there, built an ecosystem, didn&#x27;t undermine their own goal in the language design or make it unusable.)<p>If I had to choose between Go and C++, I&#x27;d probably pick Go because of C++&#x27;s complexity, so they really nailed it.<p>In the grand scheme of things, it&#x27;s a really forgettable language. Frankly, I haven&#x27;t programmed in it. I don&#x27;t need to. I know ALGOL+(N+1) when I see it.')
