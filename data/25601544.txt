For that i can have probably at max 40 tabs open. Once it gets past some threshold(i don&#x27;t recognize or remember what&#x27;s in them) i tend to start to close the obsolete ones. If there is something i find useful i bookmark it. If there is something i think i would like to read in future i also bookmark it. Once the work is done i close all the tabs. In general i like my tabs closed, it brings peace to my mind.')
