Thats a major difference.<p>And those users have repeatedly crossed the TOS of the services they are using but the pages stay up because it generates engagement. Twitter even admits that Trump was too big to ban because he generates far too much money for them and other social networks.<p>Thats the crux of the argument people have been saying for years. Banning a gay couple is a complete false equivalence and I don&#x27;t believe you can argue that in good faith.')
