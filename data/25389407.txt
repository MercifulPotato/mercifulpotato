The majority of Americans, and nearly all the &quot;journalism&quot; to which they are subjected, still believe that they should fear brown people overseas enough to preemptively murder them. That is counter to logic and reality, but logic is not the way to make this argument. Few people (well, few Americans anyway) are capable of controlling their fears through logic. Lots of people don&#x27;t like to be the butt of jokes, though. If the rest of us are always laughing at them, their insecurity might open their eyes to the emptiness of their fear.<p>The &quot;journalism&quot;, however, won&#x27;t change until it&#x27;s no longer cost-effective. We have to change ourselves first.')
