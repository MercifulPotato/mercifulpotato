I&#x27;m glad someone found it interesting :)<p>The cost of providing the service isn&#x27;t huge: there are already systems in place to provide you with money at a broker - the main cost is the systems to automatically sell securities when the value goes down. But that&#x27;s not _too_ crazy complex.<p>And it makes a hell of a lot of money. IBKR reported _hundreds_ of millions of dollars of net interest income on customer margin loans in 2019. Those hundreds of millions were made on a net interest margin around 1.7% (an even lower ~1% in 2020!) Traditional loans, people default all the time. But margin loans are collateralized by the securities in the account. For example, you hold 100 shares of Apple in the account, which is the collateral for the margin loan. You can&#x27;t default: if you try to run away with the cash, well, they have your Apple shares. Really, the only time they lose money is when the value of those securities drops significantly faster than they can sell them, and the borrower racks up a large debt and can&#x27;t pay it back. But that happens so rarely that the overall program remains very, very profitable.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about reading about the times it goes wrong, here&#x27;s an interesting link [0] describing how users with options lost a lot of money IBKR had to cover - keep in mind that 88MM was what they had to initially cover, and they undoubtedly recovered a lot of that back over time from the borrowing users.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;01ee0794-158f-40c5-8bb9-82cf5d5f314b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;01ee0794-158f-40c5-8bb9-82cf5d5f3...</a>')
