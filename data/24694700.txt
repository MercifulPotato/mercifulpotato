Imagine dreaming to drown&#x2F; being chased&#x2F; killed or falling down holes every night until waking up in sweat without orientation. My boss welcomed me from the airport by telling me he was just that day released from hospital after having malaria because he could not take the nightmares anymore and stopped taking the meds. They did not tell me so I would not worry during my preparations... Apparently the hospital refused to release him at first and wanted to evacuate him because his liver was so fucked up they thought it was destroyed by malaria. He then said no thats because he is an alcoholic and its his normal fucked up liver so they let him go and he started working immediately and still somehow had more energy than me.')
