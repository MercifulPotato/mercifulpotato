Item(by='dandanua', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607706185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381325, text='&gt; If you knew all the busy beaver numbers, then you could settle all of those questions.<p>A lot of important questions in number theory could be answered, but not all. For example, the mentioned Collatz conjecture (3n+1) is of different type. To prove this conjecture you need to prove the halting for EVERY argument. Checking halting of a single program will not be enough, so busy beaver won&#x27;t help. This is a next level task in the Arithmetical Hierarchy [1]. Though, in fact, you can define the next level Busy Beaver that could solve Collatz conjecture. To solve more complicated problems you need high-order Busy Beavers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetical_hierarchy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetical_hierarchy</a>')
