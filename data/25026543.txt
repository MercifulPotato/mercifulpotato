But that&#x27;s not all the law is doing. Many websites from US simply stopped serving anything for European IP addresses, responding just with error 451, which I always take as a sign that this site wants to sell my data more than they want to show me ads, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t accidentally visit it.')
