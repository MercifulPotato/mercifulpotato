I see their point.<p>I wear a poppy; I like seeing poppies; I definitely think it&#x27;s something we should all be darn tootin&#x27; grateful for. It&#x27;s a cultural event in Canada and embraced by virtually the entire population. You can get them everywhere you go and generally you can wear them everywhere you go. You certainly see them everywhere you go :).<p>But - I also have seen tons of  businesses squeezed between rock and a hard place and PR and legislation and human rights and lawsuits and boycotts, because you genuinely cannot please everybody, and today it&#x27;s easier than ever to find X number of people across the continent who are bothered by any given thing and give endless headache to the poor store manager who just wants to run a store. Sometimes it&#x27;s just easier&#x2F;safer to force the lowest common denominator and get with your business... except when it&#x27;s not.<p>Problem is - anybody who starts a sentence with &quot;It just makes sense that...&quot; or &quot;Everybody agrees that...&quot; or &quot;This is different because...&quot; is empathically wrong. There empirically are people who think Poppies are political statement, there empirically are people who think their own statement is just as equal or more, and there are people who will claim, with fair amount of logic, that now we have government sponsoring &#x2F; legislating one cause while forbidding others.<p>etc etc etc.<p>Reason #138492 I&#x27;m not running a public store&#x2F;business these days.')
