Item(by='disabled', descendants=None, kids=[25799136], score=None, time=1610760119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798675, text='&gt; Texas has a huge map of vaccination locations across the whole state, with the ones with availability highlighted.<p>Texas also has an “accessibility version” of this, that is an Excel file that is being constantly updated and is far more navigable. It can be sorted in ascending&#x2F;descending order by primary&#x2F;secondary&#x2F;tertiary criteria (Excel columns), like “date last updated”, “time last updated”, and “number of vaccines available”.<p>Nevertheless, rollout is a mess in Texas. I probably spent 20+ hours this week trying to get a vaccine for my elderly family members.<p>In a lot of states, it’s nearly impossible for somebody 65+ at this point to get a vaccine slot without their children&#x2F;nieces&#x2F;nephews looking near constantly and perpetually.<p>Some of the signup websites also have messed up APIs. If the young person signing up their relatives is not very technical for their age group  and is not extremely vigilant, then it is unlikely that they will be successful at this point.<p>While Texas is not doing super terribly at releasing its vaccine reserve, as of yesterday it was the #48 state in terms of vaccinated people per capita.')
