It wasn&#x27;t super common, but some professors did do that for seniors on occasion for small classes where cheating wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. They were so stupidly hard that even with multiple text books and the internet, the best I could often do was a &quot;B&quot;. There&#x27;s simply no way to google an answer for something that requires multiple pages of analysis and so forth per problem.
