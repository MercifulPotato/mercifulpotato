The cops don&#x27;t make arrests. Judges don&#x27;t do squat. The entire justice system is rotten here. You&#x27;re free to openly steal from Walgreens and commit as much property crime or assault and cops will never do anything. Our joke of a DA recently refused to charge a repeat offender who went on to kill two others. I&#x27;m super progressive, but I cannot understand why the left thinks it&#x27;s progressive to let people defecate in the street and that giving free needles and tents to that crowd is helping them. The left in America is sick sad joke. Compare SF to Amsterdam and it boggles my mind to see what the left in America does with unchecked power and what Amsterdam can do with similar levels of freedom and even lower income. We have no excuses for how filthy our city is. The only rationalization I can make is that somewhere someone is skimming off these funds and making money off all the homelessness.')
