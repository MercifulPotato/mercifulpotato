Having banks as middlemen between transactions introduced inefficiencies that actually act as a level of opacity that prevents total and absolute control of the transaction ledger. State-regulated cryptocurrencies facilitate all kinds of large-scale economic control, from money printing to sanctions, ostracization etc on a scale that that even systems like SWIFT cannot.<p>Call me when paypal sells gold, in physical form that you get to keep in your property. Make no mistake that paypal will ban any crypto that cant&#x27; be 100% subject to the whims of governments. These centralized &quot;mainstream&quot; cryptocurrencies are going to kill the anarchic ecosystem and consequently outlaw it. The playbook &quot;save the children&#x2F;our enemies&quot; is such a popular routine nowadays that i wonder why there&#x27;s not a startup for it.')
