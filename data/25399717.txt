I&#x27;ve even had this happen with things like CSS, where a master stylesheet changes somewhere upstream on another server, and hundreds of hours of my own custom, vendor-supported modifications now make my web application or website look like doo-doo.<p>Plus maybe I&#x27;m weird but I think it&#x27;s enough to love the energy you can get from building something. It&#x27;s fun. And considerable portions of work should be fun. Especially if you work for yourself, where building stuff for money, for other people, often isn&#x27;t enough without a strong connection between the work, customer, and the subject&#x27;s own interests and values system.<p>(IMO a lot of those kinds of projects also build on the edge of one&#x27;s core expertise, extending it outwards, almost like a recon mission, so it&#x27;s less of a binary yes&#x2F;no core expertise condition.)')
