It also subsidizes unemployable degrees.<p>Promises to wholesale cancel student debt is populism. More specifically, it is left-wing economic populism that panders to the young upper-middle class for their votes. (Interestingly, Federalist Papers Number 10 predicts populist demands to cancel debts 200 years ago.) It&#x27;s worth noting that Biden&#x27;s plan, which cancels debt for people below a certain income, is somewhat more reasonable.<p>However, I do think that college expenses are a real issue. Education is important in society, and college is also a way for lower-class people to move up the economic ladder. Precisely because people can borrow money, colleges are free to charge exorbitant prices. Colleges then expand with amenities and market a lifestyle rather than a place to learn. They also expand with administrative bloat. I think colleges should be held accountable for their rising prices and where the money is going.<p>P.S.
