That place was hidden in yelp search when I looked for &#x27;coffee &amp; tea&#x27; in my area (their yelp page existed). While I don&#x27;t know the actual reason why this happened, I immediately discovered that coffee shop using google (as a double check). It gave me a charm because it reminded me a fact that if you have the &#x27;right service&#x27;, people will find out. Given this flow, I started to believe gatekeepers might begin losing their odds.')
