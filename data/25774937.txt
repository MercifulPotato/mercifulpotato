There are also arguments that there shouldn&#x27;t be a constitutional right to freedom of speech at all. If these arguments are convincing, the only line of defense against them is the argument that the state (and&#x2F;or the population in general) cannot be trusted to make any <i>further</i> restrictions - and I think that&#x27;s a good argument. Similarly, in countries where speech is more limited, we can point out problems of those limitations; I think it is not a fallacy to suggest there is a slippery slope - especially in the case of governments that serve capital, be they conservative or liberal.<p>I&#x27;m very skeptical of the benefits of free speech. I don&#x27;t think the arguments along the lines of free speech promoting truth or being beneficial to political discourse or allowing &#x27;bad ideas&#x27; in the open to be &#x27;disinfected&#x27; with debate are valid. But I&#x27;m even more skeptical of the state, and I do not trust it to use evidence-based methodologies. I&#x27;ve completely lost all faith in the whole political spectrum, particularly the left-anarchists who promote governmental and corporate censorship.')
