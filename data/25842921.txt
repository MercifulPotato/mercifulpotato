Saving face is deeply embedded in Asian culture. Most of the locals  down here where I am are very careful to avoid confrontation or criticism of anything or anybody because in a culture like this it can lead to losing face and then the next step is generational conflict, banishment, and sometimes even murder. People often want to avoid going to the police to settle disputes because the cops are just as corrupt as the local government, and graft and bribery are endemic.')
