Item(by='donut', descendants=None, kids=[25501965], score=None, time=1608599002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501306, text='Nice and terse :-)<p>Right, the &quot;..&quot; part was hard to remember because it&#x27;s something like:<p><pre><code>  {\n    &quot;entries&quot;: [\n      {\n        &quot;fields&quot;: {\n          &quot;fileURL&quot;: {\n            &quot;en-US&quot;: &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;...&quot;\n          },\n          ...\n        },\n        ...\n      },\n      ...\n    ]\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand as you can see the field fileURL is actually an object with another field en-US (with a hyphen) so the jq becomes something like this:<p>&lt;file.json jq -r &#x27;.entries[] | .fields | select(.fileURL) | .fileURL[&quot;en-US&quot;] | select(startswith(&quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>&quot;))&#x27;<p>And later I had to do the same for other fields that ended in URL (websiteURL, etc.)<p>Anyway, gron made it simpler to get a quick summary of what I needed because it represents every node in the tree as a separate line that has the path in it, which is perfect for grep.<p>I still use jq more than gron :-)')
