The advice in this thread is really lacking. Maybe it&#x27;s because the real answer is there is no advice and we just have to suck it up?<p>&quot;Take a 3 month break and come back to it&quot;. I&#x27;m back. I don&#x27;t want to do programming anymore.<p>&quot;Ok you should play video games and not do anything productive, then come back to it&quot;. Cool, just finished Days Gone and i&#x27;m replaying BioShock. I don&#x27;t want to do programming anymore.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re just burned out and depressed, find a therapist, take medicine, etc.&quot;. Did that. I&#x27;m on Welbutrin and my therapist says I should look into changing fields, maybe going back to school. Easy right? I don&#x27;t want to do programming anymore.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all mental, meditate&quot;. I sit outside on my deck every weekend and just enjoy the outdoors. I still don&#x27;t want to write programs.<p>&quot;Buy a motorcycle&quot;. I already have one and I love it, but I still don&#x27;t want to write programs.<p>After many years of feeling this way and getting the answers like the above, any answer not in the realm of &quot;you can move to X field with relative ease and maintain the same salary&#x2F;benefits&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to help. It seems my only option is to just accept defeat')
