Or can explain why it feels so much better to me? Whatever they do for audio is magic. I spend half my day on teams and 4 to 5 hours a week in zoom, and both are totally exhausting. I bought my own blue jeans account and I push it on family&#x2F;friends just because the audio ...makes sense to my brain. I &#x2F;enjoy&#x2F; talking to people there. I even convinced my d&amp;d group to switch  from hangouts&#x2F;meet&#x2F;duo&#x2F;allo&#x2F;??? And they seem to agree, blue jeans+roll20 is great.')
