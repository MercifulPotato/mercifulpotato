I don’t remember what the issues were specifically, but given that Xorg was working perfectly fine, it wasn’t something I was willing to spend much effort troubleshooting.<p>It sounds like screen sharing is a known problem area? Does anyone know if they have fixed these issues in later versions of Zoom or Ubuntu?')
