Companies like Activision, Blizzard, and EA are going to push out something that has low-risk, high reward (Call of Duty, Assassins Creed etc.) rather than push the medium of games forward.<p>They&#x27;ll leave the interesting &quot;games as an art form&quot; type idea to indie devs, and once some idea or concept has broken mainstream, they&#x27;ll snatch it and tag it to a well known IP (see Battle Royale + Call of Duty) and call it a day')
