Item(by='mdip', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602261064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719680, text='I love this sort of stuff -- does anyone know of a solid forum&#x2F;place for these kinds of projects (outside of searching <i>here</i>)?<p>Specifically, I have a basement full of old (some non-working) hardware for various gadgets&#x2F;computers&#x2F;electronics and I&#x27;d love to upcycle them into ... <i>something else</i>.  Instructables and WikiHow are the usual places, but it&#x27;s usually things that require &quot;the thing you&#x27;re building&quot;[0] to build or require buying so many new components that by the time your done you&#x27;ve bought a product minus a few motors.<p>I yearn for the &quot;Make X do Y&quot; with a small number of inexpensive tools (preferably ones I own, but that&#x27;s a tricky proposition) where &quot;X&quot; is something common, or obsolete and &quot;Y&quot; is something outside of or is an upgrade to it&#x27;s design[1].  I love doing this sort of thing and I find that about half the time when I&#x27;m working on Pi&#x2F;Arduino projects I have way more <i>parts</i> than I realize -- I can&#x27;t believe I purchased <i>any</i> loose low power LEDs (IR, colored...) I have a whole box of remotes&#x2F;miscellania that should really be in the <i>garbage</i> for how useless it is ... until I need a 1.5V LED, have only 5V+, and can&#x27;t wait a day for shipping.  I started salvaging electronics before trashing them.  It&#x27;d be nice if I could look up the whole obsolete device and see what I can use more of it in... plus, at least for me, I&#x27;d throw less away (and store less in boxes).<p>[0] My go-to is the small number of &quot;Blu-Ray Engraver&#x2F;Laser Cutters&quot;. Every one I could find (A) required a laser cutter, or (B) many of the laser-cut parts required a laser cutter that was <i>bigger</i> than the one being built, so you couldn&#x27;t even <i>sell</i> the more expensive laser cutter if you wish to be able to produce a second one.  It&#x27;s a small issue in that there are still other parts that need to be purchased, but you have to <i>buy a laser cutter</i> to make the custom, $0.01 in pressed board, set of parts.  The others are nearly every upcycled RC-Car.<p>[1] I had a friend who designed custom sub-woofers for cars when I was younger.  He had a Yamaha off-the-shelf sub that he modified to the tune of $250 and some of his own time.  It put my $1000 sub to shame.  I can&#x27;t remember <i>all</i> the specifics of the modification, but I know he used the original amp board and some upgraded MOSFETS but didn&#x27;t touch the 10&quot; speaker or the cabinet (which was what he spent most of his time on, typically).')
