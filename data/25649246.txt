If Starship pans out, the market for satellite hardware, orbital habitats, space probes and associated software and services is going to explode.<p>In a lot of threads about this people seem to think Boeing, Lockheed, etc are finished because they can’t compete with SpaceX. On the contrary, the demand for their skills at building payload hardware is about to expand massively. Somebody’s going to need to build all the infrastructure and systems for these Moon and Mars cities.')
