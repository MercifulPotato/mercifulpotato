You must have something in mind. Right now I have no idea even if the intent is solo play, 2-player, or more. Much less whether it&#x27;s cooperative or competitive, deck building or engine-building or just tactical, and so on. How about whether there are going to be other (possibly a non-collectible core set) card types?')
