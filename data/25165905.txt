I noticed that a lot of default workflows (needlessly) depended on docker running with privileges. One big reason for that seem to be Mac users that only know docker from inside a VM. However, if you think about what you&#x27;re really needing for CI you will easily see that docker-in-docker gains you nothing. You can as well use plain docker (or podman). The same holds for privileges. No CI operation should need privileges, if only for the reason that it should never alter the CI system itself.<p>I encourage you to not take the standard workflows as a given and really think about what you need and I bet you either end up with a use case that can be covered by rootless podman or something that requires real VMs anyways.')
