It is such a horrible company! For example, they made Angular builds extremely slow as described here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;issues&#x2F;37293" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;issues&#x2F;37293</a><p>Last year there was another similar issue and each new version builds become slower and slower. I waste half of my time waiting for compilation. Never had any such issue with React&#x2F;VueJS or any other framework except Angular. I really hate it.')
