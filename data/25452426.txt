These arenâ€™t difficult to learn, and once you reach these basic positions you can expect your opponent to resign.<p>The reason for the advice to avoid end games is that the real end game contests happen with positions having a few more pawns or pieces. These positions can have a single not obvious winning move out of many alternatives. One false step can lead to a draw or loss instead of a win <i>many</i> moves later. Two almost identical positions can result in different outcomes even with perfect play.')
