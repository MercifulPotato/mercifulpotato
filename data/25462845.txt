Generally, this doesn&#x27;t apply to cameras as long as their use doesn&#x27;t violate community norms and they are used in an area without an expectation of privacy. Using a security camera on your porch is fine because there is no expectation of privacy, but if the microphone is powerful enough to pick up the conversation across the street on the neighbor&#x27;s porch, that is illegal.<p>&gt;Security cameras that are not clearly visible (i.e., with a sign pointing them out) are also illegal in CA.<p>Again, it depends.<p>There is no two-party consent rule for video recording. You are free to put security cameras anywhere on your property (inside or outside), without notification, including hidden cameras.<p>There are some exceptions:<p>1) Commercial operators of vehicles used to transport passengers require notification to passengers when using a video recording device.<p>2) It is illegal to use a video recording device in the interior of a bedroom, bathroom, changing room, fitting room, dressing room, or tanning booth, or the interior of any other area in which the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, with the intent to invade the privacy of a person. This doesn&#x27;t include areas of a business used to count negotiable instruments.<p>3) It is illegal to use a video recording device to view the naked body or undergarments of a person, without their consent, under circumstances in which the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.')
