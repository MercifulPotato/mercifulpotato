Saying “___ claimed ___” is objective, and can be easily followed up with “this appears to conflict with ____” or “____ (an expert, authority or  opponent) denies this.” When reporters start writing things like “___ falsely claims”, they are venturing into subjective territory, and when they don’t present information that both sides may be relying on, they lose the trust of the readers who are looking for a comprehensive report that will help them understand the story.')
