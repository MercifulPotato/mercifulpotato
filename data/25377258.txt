And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they’d all had a great experience… That experience was why the Airbnbs didn’t give up.<p>It seems safe to say that the majority of Airbnb use now is not a delightful experience of being hosted in someone else&#x27;s home, but whole-apartment&#x2F;house rentals or other circumstances with not much interaction between host and guest, feeling very business-like. No? I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s common to especially enjoy it as an experience anymore, it&#x27;s just a way to make money or a way to find a nice place to stay at a good price.<p>If that delightful hosting experience is what inspired them to keep going... it&#x27;s still not what the company mostly ended up providing to the world. If we were to weigh the pro- and anti-social aspects of airbnb, that pleasant human relationship between host and guest would barely weigh on the scale, because it&#x27;s mostly not what happens there anymore.  The founders don&#x27;t seem that concerned about that though, do they?<p>So what do we take from all that? It seems odd to me to highlight that aspect of the founders initial motivation without even mentioning whether that&#x27;s what the company actually does now.')
