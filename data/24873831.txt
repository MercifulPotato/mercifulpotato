Looney theories flourish when authorities are perceived to lack credibility.  It&#x27;s little wonder that politicians of any persuasion are popular focal points for such doubt; either because they are known habitual liars or because they are simply perceived as such by those on the other side.  Transparency and blind justice are key to stopping the spread of loony theories.  If Jeffery Epstein hadn&#x27;t received preferential treatment when he was convicted in 2008, I think few would remember him today (much less harbor so many suspicions about what politicians may have been involved with him.)<p>Consider moon landings:  Many people doubt they occurred because the American government lost a ton of credibility during the cold war.  I considered the possibility that it was faked, but easily concluded that it was real because NASA is very transparent with the details.  The information they&#x27;ve made public about it has breadth and depth; for nearly any little tiny detail of those missions you can think of, a little bit of research will reveal information about it.  Autistic detail of anything from the helmet visors to the  guidance computers is all available for anybody who chooses to look; to fabricate a story with such breadth and depth is simply inconceivable.  The truth of the moon landings is apparent because NASA is open with it.')
