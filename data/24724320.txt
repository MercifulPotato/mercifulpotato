That&#x27;s what happens in grocery stores and hotels now.  They wipe down the  shopping carts, and they seal the doors.<p>But there&#x27;s only one way remove the possibility of getting sick from the driver.  We&#x27;ve been talking about that for 15 years, but it doesn&#x27;t work yet.<p>I don&#x27;t think the risks are equivalent on a per-person basis either.  The &quot;viral load&quot; apparently matters, so using the same car as 1 person is not the same as riding with a sick driver for say 30 minutes.  It could be that the driver risk is great than that of 30 passengers combined.')
