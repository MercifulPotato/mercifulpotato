The last time I used JavaScript was with Angular 1.x around 2013.  Iirc the angular learning curve was negligible; React&#x27;s is steeper, but I can&#x27;t compare with modern Angular - seems it&#x27;s up to 11.rc1.  I get the impression React has mostly won the battle.  I was wondering if maybe I should have tried Svelte instead, but React is the name I keep seeing, so figured that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll peek (first?).  I think the muddle I need to sort through at the moment is the old tutorials vs the new tutorials as I&#x27;m seeing multiple ways of doing things but don&#x27;t yet know which are the new ways, the best practices, or the trade-offs with each.')
