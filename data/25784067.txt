I typically lose weight while travelling because I&#x27;m walking more and have fewer snacks around. This includes months in the US last year where pace and timing of a lot of our driving meant we ate fast food a bit. It was hot so we couldn&#x27;t stash chocolate&#x2F;ice cream, we didn&#x27;t have access to a fridge so we didn&#x27;t scoff leftovers, etc. We mostly lived out of a cooler and cooked on fires. We walked around exploring cities&#x2F;towns where many residents would not have though. The number of mobility scooters and the like is incredible.')
