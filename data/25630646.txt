It is like there&#x27;s a general discourse that they are a bad thing, just like with &quot;that other&quot; thing (cough socialism cough).<p>This is even more strange when you find out about police unions - that are widespread -, and what their power is. From my point of view actions of police union are usually borderline &quot;mob-like&quot; (as in, I mostly hear about them when they save the necks of abusing and &#x2F; or corrupted officers). It&#x27;s like people think unions are generally bad, but then they have police unions everywhere and nobody bats an eye... even when their actions are on the shadowy side of things.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about the film industry, thought (Even thought I remember about the writer&#x27;s guild strike of a few years back).<p>Just like democracy, unions might be the worst solution, except for all the others.')
