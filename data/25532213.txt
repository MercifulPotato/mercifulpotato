Unfortunately the incentives in both industry and academia make it difficult to even start such a project. As a result we&#x27;re stuck with incremental work on narrow problems.<p>I&#x27;ve been on both sides of table (started in industry developing AI solutions and now in academia pursuing phd in AI). When I was on the industry side, where the information and infrastructure was there to build such a system, you had to deal with the bureaucracy and institutional politics.<p>In academia, the incentives are aligned for individual production of knowledge (publishing). The academic work focuses on small defined end-to-end problems that are amenable to deep learning and machine learning. The types of AI models that emerge are specific models solving specific problems (NLP, vision, play go, etc).<p>It seems to move towards developing large AI systems we need a model of new collaboration. There are existing models in the world of astrophysics and medical research that we can look to for inspiration. Granted they have they have their own issues of politics but it&#x27;s interesting that similar scope projects haven&#x27;t emerged on the AI side yet.')
