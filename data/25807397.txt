This has lead to really harsh anti-spam measures that make it hard to self-host. Sender verification + client-side sender whitelists would solve spam for good. It also means grouping by sender gives a very false sense of security regarding identity continuity between messages<p>- There is no good support for groups or threads. Subject lines of type &quot;Re: Re: Aw: Re: Sv: new proposal&quot; is not an acceptable solution, as they look ugly and clients often disagree on how to parse and write them, leading to breakage of the thread<p>- Clients do not group by sender, group or thread, partly because these concepts do not actually exist in email (see above) and partly for social reasons<p>- Partly for historical reasons (it&#x27;s just mail on a computer!) and partly for technical reasons (there is no sender, etc.) email is presented as huge letter-like affairs, leading to a felt need for all sorts of formalisms for every single message even if the messages are two minutes apart. Also email signatures (with logos?!) being attached to every message are just so wasteful both in terms of storage and in terms of screen space')
