Everyone I know works.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because they all have to, or because, like me, they choose to.  All I know is that they all do.  (Actually, that&#x27;s not quite true.  I know <i>one</i> couple who is retired.  But I don&#x27;t know anyone my age (mid-fifties) who doesn&#x27;t work.<p>One thing I do is take jobs with flexible schedules, so mostly consulting gigs nowadays.  If I want to take a Monday off, I just do it.  But I find that if I&#x27;m out of the loop for too long, I want back in.  I find it tremendously valuable to have someone counting on me to deliver something precisely so I <i>dont</i> spend all day watching YouTube, which I could very easily do.  But when I do that, I feel useless, and I don&#x27;t like feeling useless.<p>But that&#x27;s just me, I guess.<p>One other thing that makes it work for me (no pun intended): I don&#x27;t have kids.  If I did, I would probably be focusing a lot more energy on them.')
