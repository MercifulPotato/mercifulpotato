If the user agrees you&#x27;re allowed to do pretty much anything with their data.<p>It has also become a lot easier, unfortunately, to get that consent.<p>Both the convoluted legal framework itself and the dark patterns that arose from it (such as the &quot;Allow everything&quot; button being the primary action button and &quot;Privacy settings&quot; being a small, obscure link) are prone to putting off users, who more often than not will just click on anything just do get rid of those annoying pop-ups and banners.')
