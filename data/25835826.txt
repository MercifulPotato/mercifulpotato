The important thing for servers, disk and network I&#x2F;O differs across ARM chips of the same ISA. Linux kernel abstracts it away i.e. stuff is likely to work, but I’m not so sure about performance portability.<p>Indeed. But Intel Xeon + Intel Ethernet integrates tightly and drops the Ethernet data directly into L3 cache (bypassing DRAM entirely).<p>As such, I&#x2F;O performance portability between x86 servers (in particular: Intel Xeon vs AMD EPYC) suffers from similar I&#x2F;O issues. Even if you have AMD EPYC + Intel Ethernet, you lose the direct-to-L3 DMA, and will have slightly weaker performance characteristics compared to Intel Xeon + Intel Ethernet.<p>Or Intel Xeon + Optane optimizations, which also do not exist on AMD EPYC + Optane. So these I&#x2F;O performance differences between platforms are already on the status-quo, and should be expected if you&#x27;re migrating between platforms. A degree of testing and tuning is always needed when changing platforms.<p>--------<p>&gt;Still, are there many public clouds built of these Ampere Altra-s? Maybe we gonna have them widespread soon, but until then I wouldn’t want to build stuff that only runs on Amazon or my own servers with only a few on the market and not yet globally available on retail.<p>A fair point. Still, since Neoverse N1 is a premade core available to purchase from ARM, many different companies have the ability to buy it for themselves.<p>Current rumors look like Microsoft&#x2F;Oracle are just planning to use Ampere Altra. But like all other standard ARM cores, any company can buy the N1 design and make their own chip.')
