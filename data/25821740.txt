Most money is not &#x27;printed&#x27; directly by Central banks, it is instead printed by regular banks, who have been given the right to lend money they do not have, up to some limit. This would not be automatically changed by pegging the dollar to BTC or gold or anything else. As long as banks are allowed to lend value they do not own, nothing significant would change.')
