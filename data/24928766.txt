For example, how do you know that the toolchains for Rust, Spark, sel4 work correctly? Have all aspects been verified or proven? Can a single person fully understand them? I’m not saying that’s the necessarily best criterion. The point is that all the guarantees that Rust, spark, Haskell, etc give are only meaningful if you can trust the tools to correctly implement them. Simplicity of the tools is one approach.')
