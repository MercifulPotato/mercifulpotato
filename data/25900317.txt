The games I&#x27;d already playing provide _a degree_ of passive immersion, as they often only have Japanese audio and leave background elements untranslated, which is useful and motivating. It&#x27;d also be nice to some that do have an English release in their native language. Were I not a native English speaker, I suspect I&#x27;d feel the same way about English. Mandarin may be more useful&#x2F;practical in some sense, but I don&#x27;t come across non-English or Japanese texts often, so it&#x27;s not as immediately useful to me.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why the language is so seemingly popular, but I suspect the popularity of Japanese games and anime in the West is one of the factors.')
