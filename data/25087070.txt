Fund some open access initiatives or something and your money will go a lot further.<p>The vast majority just don&#x27;t have a use case where &quot;LaTeX-2030&quot; is going to help, and this wouldn&#x27;t make much difference to them.  I&#x27;m a mathematician and I write papers in LaTeX every day.  Sure I could benefit from programability occasionally, but it&#x27;s just not a serious problem.  If I need to automatically generate a table or something, I have a Python script output LaTeX, it takes me 30 seconds.<p>Obviously there are some uses cases where it would make a big difference, but there just aren&#x27;t very many in the grand scheme. We already have LaTeX3 which lets you do scripting, and lualatex.  The fact that basically nobody uses either gives you a sense of how much the general community wants this.')
