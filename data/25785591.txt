I am certainly more put off by $50 than N minutes.<p>On the other hand I often base my purchases based on &quot;Will this $50 spend save more than N minutes of my time&quot;<p>For example a top-filling humidifer may cost $50 more than a bottom-filling one but I spend an extra 1 minute fighting with the bottom-filling one and cleaning up water spills so after 15 uses it makes up its price difference.')
