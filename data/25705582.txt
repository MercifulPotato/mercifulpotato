My only point in the comment above was that the character limit remains a fundamental characteristic of Twitter, and removing that constraint would <i>qualitatively</i> change Twitter, in a way that &quot;emoji now always count as 2&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;re moving from 140 to 280 characters&quot; did not.<p>Constraints <i>can</i> lead people to be more innovative and creative. That does not mean they universally do, only that they <i>can</i>. Removing such constraints is thus not an <i>obvious</i> improvement with zero potential downside.')
