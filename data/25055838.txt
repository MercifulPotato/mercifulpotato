Item(by='nullc', descendants=None, kids=[25058883], score=None, time=1605073584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25054257, text='&gt; The fingerprint on the yubikey is really just a possession check for the yubikey in case it was stolen.<p>And one that only depends on the tamper-resistance of the hardware.<p>It&#x27;s possible to use error correcting codes to extract deterministic secrets from fuzzy data like fingerprints, but no one (virtually no one?) implements that.<p>Instead, the fingerprinte reader has some cleartext fingerprint fingerprints that it compares the fingerprint to and just makes an accept&#x2F;reject decision.  Extract that data and you can make an acceptable input, or glitch the processing and you can just bypass it.<p>Presumably it&#x27;s better than the button that literally any touch activates, but I think a conservative security analysis would pretty much just treat it like a button.')
