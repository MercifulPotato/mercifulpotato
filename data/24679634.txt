I used to think disk was way slower but now if we look at AWS ec2 instances, they are within one order of magnitude of each other:<p>Network: ec2 instances (except tiny ones)\n1-2 Gbit&#x2F;s Baseline, 10 Gbits&#x2F;s Burst<p>disk: EBS volumes, general purpose, throughput\n128 MiB&#x2F;s - 250 MiB&#x2F;s or ~ 2 Gbit&#x2F;s (1,000 MiB&#x2F;s for io optimized)<p>So the top of the baseline network bandwidth is the same as the top of the disk throughput, or am I wrong?')
