I am trying to help tour guides to get their customers back despite pandemic. I have worked with 3 fantastic certified guide in San Francisco to prepare virtual tours using our set of 360 video panoramas, equipped with build-in video conference. They all love it, our friends are in shock, but I don&#x27;t believe my friends who have not paid. I would like to get honest feedback from all of you here in hackernews, I really hope a lot of them can get back to pay their bill while accompanying those who want but can&#x27;t travel. Hope you&#x27;d take a look. I really appreciate it.<p>Here is a snipped of the tech - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xOKFAQwt6_U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xOKFAQwt6_U</a><p>Thanks')
