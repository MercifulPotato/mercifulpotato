I was extremely surprised. I was actually wondering if they switched to some level of human in the loop, because it used to suck in the past, but now is great. I expected people to have good experiences too. I &#x27;m actually shocked to see how disappointed people are here...<p>Here&#x27;s an example of some stuff that just showed up recently.<p>[1] Some guy camping an exploring an island that used to be a federal prison - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2xnI1hZdltw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2xnI1hZdltw</a><p>[2] A documentary about homeless people racing carts - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zi-f_J6hV-g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zi-f_J6hV-g</a><p>[3] Fantastic funk music (and I don&#x27;t even listen to funk!) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;m1oLjnKeUiY?t=2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;m1oLjnKeUiY?t=2</a><p>[4] Fantastic old school theatrical hard rock from Japan - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CbI79e5iZKs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CbI79e5iZKs</a><p>[5] Sapolsky&#x27;s must-see lecture on stress - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=D9H9qTdserM&amp;t=112s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=D9H9qTdserM&amp;t=112s</a> (which I got recommended and was watching this morning in the background while I worked)<p>Just a random sample from stuff that popped up in the recent past.
