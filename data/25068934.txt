This problem involves (at least) thousands of new examples every day and so far has proved nearly impossible to control. And next to that we have a different problem based largely on idiosyncratic examples, and extrapolations from those idiosyncratic examples to hypothetical worst case scenarios.<p>I find this way of engaging with the problem to be profoundly misguided in two ways. One, it&#x27;s a failure to correctly evaluate the relative scale of the two problems, and to consistently think and speak clearly about them in terms that reflect their relative scale.<p>And secondly, it mistakenly sets up the two problems as being in a relationship of interference with one another, such that talking about one is used to mean we should stop talking about the other. Instead of saying &quot;this statement that racism is bad and sexual harassment is bad is a statement I do not support&quot; it would be more helpful say &quot;yes, that is a problem, I agree, we need to solve it. And meanwhile here&#x27;s this other thing, but don&#x27;t let this other thing detract from the importance of the first problem or imply we don&#x27;t need to actively work on the first problem.&quot;')
