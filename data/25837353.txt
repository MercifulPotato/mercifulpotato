It&#x27;s not 1997, so it&#x27;s not like you don&#x27;t know that this kind of thing happens. If you want to build a social network, handling the moderation load is part of your job, not an afterthought.<p>We absolutely allowed large social media platforms to get away with it for far too long. It&#x27;s not the only thing making them a monopoly -- the network effect of having all of your friends in one place is also a significant barrier to entry for any new social media site.<p>Fixing that after the fact isn&#x27;t easy. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that you can act as though you&#x27;re not very, very, very late to the party in trying to establish a new social media site. In 2021 it&#x27;s part of any new site to make sure you&#x27;re not being used for crime -- or at least making enough of an attempt that authorities don&#x27;t see you as being implicated.')
