Whether they know they are doing false equivalence is a matter of debate.<p>I&#x27;ve heard people compare the imprisonment, re-education, forced labor, and organ harvesting of Uigher minorities in China today to the US internment of japanese in the 1940s.<p>Needless to say, both are bad, but if you need to reach back 75+ years in US history to find a comparable example, then the difference between the level of civil rights abuse in the two countries should be crystal clear.<p>It&#x27;s obvious on the surface that the US still has many problems, but government sanctioned organ harvesting isn&#x27;t one of them.')
