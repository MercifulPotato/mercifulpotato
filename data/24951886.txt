Absolutely an important consideration if you&#x27;re considering a big upfront investment in a nuclear plant  whose returns will be realized twenty to seventy years from now (or whatever reasonable build time and operating lifetime you come up with).<p>Needing &quot;several orders of magnitude&quot; improvement is also pessimistic. There are installations that are borderline economically profitable right now (Tesla battery farm in South Australia): another factor of 5 or 10 makes those attractive in many more places.')
