I&#x27;m a satisfied Home Assistant user as well.<p>&gt; <i>I walk around and the lights turn on with a time-appropriate brightness. They turn off when the room is empty again. I haven&#x27;t touched a light switch in months</i><p>I have motion sensors in my &quot;transient&quot; areas as well (toilet, garage etc.), but not in the other areas of my house (living, kitchen etc.) How do you prevent the lights from going out again when you&#x27;re sitting motionless for a couple of minutes or so? Do you use other stuff besides motion sensors, such as computer vision or geofencing for example?')
