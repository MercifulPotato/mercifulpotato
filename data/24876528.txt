I just figured they were too cheap to wire in a little LED light to let you know when the camera is running.<p>Shoddy? The author obviously never actually used a modern Windows laptop, and just listens to the fanboys on the Apple zealot forums.<p>My Lenovo Yoga has a light and a mechanical shutter to cover the camera.
