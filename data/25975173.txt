The astrophotography community has software to remove both high and low pressure sodium lights&#x27; color frequency. LEDs can be in several different frequency bands, and makes them harder or impossible to remove, even if there is less overall &quot;light pollution&quot; from them.<p>I live in a purple area (one step brighter than black - none or close to none) on the pollution maps and even so, when a nearby city switched to LEDs for the &quot;main drag&quot; it made the city lights really apparent even further out than before, about 7 miles further out, due to the high humidity and other local effects.<p>However i do think that something needs to be done, i lived in a suburb of Los Angeles growing up (quite far though) and i remember being able to see the milky way during the summer when i was allowed to stay up later than usual or play outside later than usual. In my teens and early 20s though, we had to drive to angeles national forest mountain roads to be able to see the milky way.')
