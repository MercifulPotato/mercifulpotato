Visibility is <i>terrible</i> for the driver. You need to be paying close attention in multiple directions at once, you often don&#x27;t have visibility at all when you need to start moving (like a larger vehicle parked next to you), and both pedestrians and other vehicles can appear out of nowhere, often moving in unexpected directions. It feels very unsafe.<p>Computer vision could be making those go-stop decisions for you, much more effectively than human drivers.<p>Heck, imagine a &quot;smart&quot; parking lot that tracks its available spaces and communicates with your car. You enter the parking lot and hand over control, and the car and lot work together to park you safely in the best available space.')
