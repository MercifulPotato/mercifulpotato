Pump &amp; dumps happen.  They are usually over in a few hours max.  Sometimes much quicker.  This has been going on for days (the majority of the week) and shows no signs of stopping.  In fact tomorrow could be the most volatile day yet.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what is making you think all of the RH users were suckers, many of them have made quite a bit off of this.  I don&#x27;t personally use RH currently (although I have in the past).  Ideally the bag holder in this situation would be those covering their short positions. But there is no doubt some will get burned.  It&#x27;s far from over though and there has been plenty of opportunity to cash out. In fact it&#x27;s way up in aftermarket again this evening.')
