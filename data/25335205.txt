Item(by='2ion', descendants=None, kids=[25335425], score=None, time=1607365380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331933, text='What&#x27;s troublesome for me is that I have been using<p>* xetex when I needed a font that was not easily achievable in pdftex over the past decade\n * pdftex for everything else because microtype(TM) just works(TM) (even though kerning can be done using fontspec and font features in xetex).<p>I&#x27;ve tried luatex multiple times over the past decade, it was mostly just too slow. Now luatex is fast. But I have no idea if I now &quot;should&quot; use luatex over pdftex for best out-of-the-box results or not.<p>Unfortunately, switching to luatex is not a zero-effort (moving to polyglossia, using fontspec, maybe removing some magic in many-lines private templates, and so on).<p>For all I know, because I&#x27;m always curious and peek at PDF file properties as a hobby (if only to check which cool font that is), basically every scientific paper I read is set using pdftex. luatex usage in the wild is, as far as I perceive it, nil, outside of enthusiast luatex user spheres. I don&#x27;t think this will change unless texlive drops pdftex (as it still ships ptex and even uptex, it probably won&#x27;t for a very long time).')
