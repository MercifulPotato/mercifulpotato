If you say your code isn&#x27;t, then I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> it is. I just do the best I can to keep the error rate as low as possible. But it&#x27;s a rate, and it&#x27;s never zero.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not just about vulns in security-critical code. It&#x27;s also about ordinary bugs. Why not be a little more careful? It won&#x27;t hurt.<p>&gt; It might get unzeroed if you work with the memory.<p>Maybe, but it isn&#x27;t very common. I&#x27;m not sure when the C standard allows changing padding bytes, but in practice the compilers I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t seem to do it. And again, it&#x27;s just a debugging aid, if it causes too much trouble on some platform, just turn it off.')
