I&#x27;m explaining why Lisp is hard to learn.<p>&gt;I hate this kind of wording because it makes it seem that Lisp is mysterious [...] or requires a ton of unlearning<p>In my experience these things are 110% true.  Even ASDF uses strange terminology completely divorced from modern usage.  What are systems and modules, and how do they map to what every other language calls a package or a library?  I have no idea.  The &quot;Getting Started with ASDF&quot; page that was the top hit on Google works through an example where they define a Cow System that has legs, tail, head, etc.  That&#x27;s the usual example when talking about class inheritance... So are systems classes?  What about CLOS?<p>How the fuck do I get packaging in lisp?<p>Again, here is where I usually give up.<p>&gt;In contrast your own difficulties are puzzling.<p>Okay, well they&#x27;re still the difficulties I&#x27;m hitting.<p>I see lots of puzzlement on HN and elsewhere as to why Lisp isn&#x27;t more popular than it is, and I honestly believe this is partly why.  I have a busy job and soon to be a second child; I could spend my time trawling through powerpoint slides from MIT courses that took place in 2008 trying to find the answers, or I could brave the extremely caustic world of stackoverflow (no thanks, I deal with enough condescension already), or I could just give up and pick a different language and get up to speed faster and with less frustration.<p>&gt;I guess I don&#x27;t know what to say other than if you really want to learn Lisp<p>I guess I <i>did</i> want to learn Lisp, until I actually started trying to use it.  The language itself seems awesome but the ecosystem around it, including the onboarding experience for non-graybeards, is pretty bad.')
