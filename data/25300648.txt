For me, this was icons. I&#x27;ve learned what they are in GUIs as a small kid. I&#x27;ve only discovered the original meaning of the word - religious pictures painted on wood - many, many years later.<p>Related phenomenon happens for people for whom English isn&#x27;t their primary language. Like myself, they&#x27;re likely to learn terms of modern computing on their own terms, without referring to the underlying analogies, because they don&#x27;t know the non-computing meanings of English words just yet. For me, the notable examples were &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;menu&quot;, which I internalized entirely without any reference to what these words ordinarily mean in English.<p>I bring this up every now and then, because the experience of people of my generation in non-English-speaking countries is one big counterexample for the idea that UIs have to be &quot;intuitive&quot; and refer to non-computing concepts.<p>(As for the &quot;hamburger menu&quot;, I of course knew what the hamburger was, but it took me a while to &quot;see it&quot; in that icon. Perhaps if the outside lines were rounded, instead of straight, then it would have resembled an actual hamburger.)')
