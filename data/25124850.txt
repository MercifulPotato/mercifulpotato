Still the way it manifests is weird. For example sometimes in apps like Chrome or Firefox the tab bar will freeze momentarily while the UI is hung waiting for something, however if you click something like a tab close button during this period your click will be processed once the UI un-hangs.<p>In intelliJ it was like whenever the UI was not immediately responding to mouse events, it would often just lose the event instead of it being correctly processed once the UI thread was freed up.')
