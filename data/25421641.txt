For me FPS games were fun because it was a little competition between players (also I was often interrupted growing up and short rounds are better for this).<p>After trying WoW and having to walk 30min to pick up a feather and bring it back then do the same for an acorn I lost total interest in ever playing again. That might be all the time I had to play that day.<p>I suspect some people get more of a positive feedback response from seeing numbers go up than others. I think MMOGs can also have a social component that keeps people coming back to do shared events which is probably stickier than the fake achievement bits.<p>I&#x27;d be curious if people really vulnerable to fake achievement would also be successful if they could create a fast feedback environment for themselves with something other than the game as the goal (since they&#x27;re clearly amenable to that kind of motivation).<p>For me, the difficulty is on the other side. Even outside of games it can be hard to find something that feels like it matters and is important (even if you can make money and be otherwise better off in your life by doing it). Curiosity can also pull you in a thousand different directions.<p>Figuring out what you want is hard, figuring out how to move in that direction is hard, then actually getting yourself to focus and do the work is hard.<p>When the search space of what&#x27;s possible is so big, it can be difficult to coordinate. I think games reduce that to something extremely narrow. For some that&#x27;s effective, for me the illusion is obvious and unfulfilling.<p>Today I tend to like one-off indie games driven by story (like Firewatch). I feel like I get more out of it.')
