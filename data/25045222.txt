It is speculative but he comments that these peasants may have felt they were following in the footsteps of their grandfathers who would have rightfully assembled for defense in time of need, and in fact that had formerly been the prerogative of free peasants.<p>So the point still pretty much stands regardless, the language speaks of free peasants self-organizing as a threat and an easily defeated one.')
