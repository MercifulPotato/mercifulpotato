Item(by='sethhochberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607718637, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388391, text='You and I seem to travel in the same way, but I know many people - even of roughly my generation, late 20s&#x2F;early 30s, who literally don&#x27;t know the right tools or communities to plan a trip like that. Its guidebooks, maybe some YouTube videos, and mostly things like Pinterest boards that get used to plan a trip. No trips to the local destination&#x27;s subreddit, certainly no use of Google Translate to read some local media&#x2F;magazines, etc.<p>For a lot of people, &quot;tourist trap&quot; doesn&#x27;t register as a thing - those are just the things you _do_ when you go to whatever place you&#x27;re going to.<p>If Airbnb becomes the safe, convenient, well-marketed way to discover reputable but not stereotypical local experiences in a marketplace that takes your credit card, they could do well IMO.')
