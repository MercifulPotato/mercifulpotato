If you grow a bunch of wheat, it leaches nitrogen out of the ground. Your options are:<p>1. Let it sit fallow while it naturally regenerates, meaning you need 2-3 times more land as you rotate through the fields, meaning you need to cut down a lot of forests and put them to the plow.<p>2. Add nitrogen based fertilisers. The only viable way to generate them produces a lot of carbon, and the runoff has its own ecological toll.<p>It&#x27;s been a huge factor in human development for ever; you either need to use a stupid amount of land, or you add your own nitrogen. Neither option is great; neither option really changes based on the scale you&#x27;re doing it at.<p>&gt; Any large scale industry can theoretically be the most efficient and optimal for the environment but these days none of them is.<p>I mean....aren&#x27;t they? The issue is <i>scale</i>. Australia produced something in excess of 500 million tonnes of coal last year, mostly exported to Japan and South Korea. What is the most &quot;optimal for the environment&quot; way to extract 500 million tonnes of coal and ship it around the globe so it can be burnt for power?<p>I would suggest that there <i>is</i> no way to do that, but that&#x27;s not an indictment of the industrial scale of the process. If you managed to mine that much coal via small batch artisanal hand mining, it&#x27;d be just as bad for the environment. Probably worse; you&#x27;d need a much larger labour force, meaning even more food and water trucked out to the mines.<p>If you take a giant factory that&#x27;s doing something bad for the environment, and split it up into 1000 small factories that are still doing something bad for the environment, you&#x27;re not obviously winning.<p>&gt; there is no price on environmental costs.<p>Quite true, but that works at every scale. The giant agribusiness has no reason not to over-apply fertiliser to their fields other than the cost of the fertiliser (they don&#x27;t pay for the damage to marine life when it washes into the river). But the small hobbyist gardener has no reason not too either. The same incentives apply at every level.<p>If anything, there&#x27;s <i>less</i> incentive to be efficient at a small level, because it seems so small (&quot;how much damage can ONE lawn do?&quot; &quot;how much carbon does ONE trip to the store in a car add?&quot;), or because it&#x27;s being done at a hobbyist level. A 40% tax on fertiliser (or whatever) would have enormous shockwaves on industrial agriculture; steps would be taken rapidly to reduce useage. A hobbyist growing tomatoes for his own use might not even notice, and thus, would <i>not</i> reduce usage.')
