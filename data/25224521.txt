Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that human genes cannot be patented in the U.S. because DNA is a &quot;product of nature.&quot; The Court decided that because nothing new is created when discovering a gene, there is no intellectual property to protect, so patents cannot be granted. Prior to this ruling, more than 4,300 human genes were patented. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision invalidated those gene patents, making the genes accessible for research and for commercial genetic testing.&quot;')
