I went on my own. Made some friends (basically women I wasn’t attracted to) which made it marginally less awkward but still spent many hours alone on dancefloors.<p>I get the practically  of\nonline dating, but not why people would expect it to be easier than going out, breaking a sweat, talking to (and getting snubbed by) women. If anything in nightclubs the element of physical attraction (which isn’t just looks but pheromones and spit and whatever else) is immediately available, whereas in online dating you have to painstakingly evoke an atmosphere.<p>But sure, not everyone enjoys dancing to DJs. But it’s hard either way.')
