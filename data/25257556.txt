Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25257976], score=None, time=1606763285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256754, text='&gt;Tether has never been redeemed<p>Why is this relevant when you can withdraw tethers for USD at any participating exchange? Or are you saying that None of the exchanges that support tether (eg. bitfinex) has never fulfilled a withdraw?<p>&gt;Itâ€™s the mother of all Ponzi schemes, clearly, and is definitely going to implode in the next big pullback.<p>Sounds like a great way to make a lot of money. Tether is currently trading 1:1 with USD (yes, even at exchanges that offer real USD). It should be easy to short-sell a bunch of tether, and buy it back when in collapses. And unlike short-selling stocks, your downside should be relatively low as tethers can&#x27;t realistically go above their current price.')
