The amount of businesses that never change their passwords is quite frankly, shocking. I left a fortune 500 company two years ago and I just tried my login on their external facing portal - and it still worked.<p>I&#x27;ve seen passwords being passed around in word docs and internal blog posts. At one place they were mixing development information with financial information. The idea you had several folders of corporate contracts mingling with developer docs on a sharepoint server was a real eye opener for me.<p>Nobody else seemed to care when I brought up the fact you just gave a bunch of developers access to facebook contracts and other financially important docs they have no reason to have access to. Their reason? It was too hard to set up a new folder with access restricted.<p>After a few years of experiencing these, I just became kind of apathetic to it. If nobody in authority cares, then why should I??')
