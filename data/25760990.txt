Create crappy bug report and move on quickly to get things done or:<p>2. Do not create a bug report and move on immediately, to get things done<p>I try to file whenever I can but when it&#x27;s getting late and I want to go to bed I choose option 1 sometimes. Maybe I should choose option 2?<p>For example, take the Nextcloud bug filing template on GitHub [0]. It&#x27;s quite a long read but sure, worth the effort for free software I agree (Nextcloud is my favorite project, my life is in there, on my server)! However, I may not know exactly where these things are:<p><pre><code>    ```\n    #### Web server error log\n    &lt;details&gt;\n    &lt;summary&gt;Web server error log&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;\n\n    ```\n    Insert your webserver log here\n    ```\n    &lt;&#x2F;details&gt;\n    \n    #### Nextcloud log (data&#x2F;nextcloud.log)\n    &lt;details&gt;\n    &lt;summary&gt;Nextcloud log&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;\n    \n    ```\n    Insert your Nextcloud log here\n    ```\n    &lt;&#x2F;details&gt;\n    \n    #### Browser log\n    &lt;details&gt;\n    &lt;summary&gt;Browser log&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;\n    \n    ```\n\n    Insert your browser log here, this could for example include:\n    \n    a) The javascript console log\n    b) The network log\n    c) ...\n    ```\n</code></pre>\nThey also want config.php, contents of `sudo -u www-data php occ app:list`,  ask you to do this:<p><pre><code>    Login as admin user into your Nextcloud and access \n    http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;settings&#x2F;integrity&#x2F;failed\n</code></pre>\nAlso all versions:<p><pre><code>    ### Server configuration\n    \n    \\*Operating system:\\*\n    \n    \\*Web server:\\*\n    \n    \\*Database:\\*\n    \n    \\*PHP version:\\*\n    \n    \\*Nextcloud version:\\* (see Nextcloud admin page)\n    \n    \\*Updated from an older Nextcloud&#x2F;ownCloud or fresh install:\\*\n</code></pre>\nMoreover, I&#x27;m quite afraid to put my domain names or even more sensitive info onto a public website if I just copy and paste. All I&#x27;m saying is that a big button that generates everything a dev needs with sensitive stuff redacted (which should be doable here and yes maybe I should make a PR for that) will make the experience a lot nicer for the reporter and the dev.<p>As said, the Geyser MC project [1] can do exactly this and to me it is a game changer, the whole process was fast and pleasant and it was easy to test the automated builds they made in the branch based on my issue and report back in context on GitHub. Pasting the JSON their report feature generates into their Discord channel together with your question and their ability to just !docs&#x2F;something point you to relevant docs with a small command feels like magic. I found the whole process inspirational.<p>I love all FOSS devs. You are my heroes.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nextcloud&#x2F;server&#x2F;issues&#x2F;new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug%2C+0.+Needs+triage&amp;template=Bug_report.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nextcloud&#x2F;server&#x2F;issues&#x2F;new?assignees=&amp;la...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GeyserMC&#x2F;Geyser" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GeyserMC&#x2F;Geyser</a>')
