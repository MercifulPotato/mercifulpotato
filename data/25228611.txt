I had a friend who was interested in psychedelics who told me about similar neutral to negative changes in perception. He observed a number of changes:<p>- Night vision changed and became impaired by &#x27;visual noise&#x27;<p>- &#x27;Auras&#x27; or &#x27;halos&#x27; around lights became extremely exaggerated<p>- Letters were occasionally harder to read as switching to a new sentence would leave a burned-in impression of the previous sentence overlapping on the new text<p>I honestly find these changes fascinating but it would probably be quite frightening for people not expecting possible perceptual changes. If it was me and I didn&#x27;t know any better I&#x27;d think I was &#x27;stuck in a trip&#x27; or &#x27;permanently broken.&#x27; I wonder if people have ever lost it from having thoughts like that before. Definitely not a toy.')
