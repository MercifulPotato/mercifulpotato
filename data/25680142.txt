It seems to me that lack of care and attention leads to the rise and dominance of companies like Viber, Grab, Lazada, and their ilk in markets like the Philippines.<p>In the end, these apps that you and I both despise are what works best for the consumers that use them most precisely because they just work (but not well).')
