They are not doing a very heavy computational workload. Typical heavy-duty servers these days can do 100k&#x27;s or millions of TPS. 40 TPS is a really, really, really light load.<p>Further, I was looking at those new server specs. There&#x27;s an error I think? The server config on the Dell site shows 2x 8 GB DRIMMs, for 16 GB RAM per sever, whereas the article says 2 TB!<p>With only 16GB of RAM, but 153.6 TB of NVMe storage, the real issue here is memory limitation for a general-purpose SQL database or a typical high-availability NoSQL database.<p>Check my math: 153600 GB storage &#x2F; 16 GB memory = 9600:1 ratio<p>Consider, by comparison that a high data volume AWS i3en.24xlarge has 60TB of NVMe storage but 768 GB of RAM. A 78:1 ratio.<p>If the article is correct, and the error is in the config on the Dell page (not the blog), and this server is actually 2 TB RAM, then that&#x27;s another story. That&#x27;d make it a ratio of 153600 &#x2F; 2000 = ~77:1.<p>Quite in line with the AWS I3en.<p>But then it would baffle me why you would only get 40 TPS out of such a beast.<p>Check my logic. Did I miss something?')
