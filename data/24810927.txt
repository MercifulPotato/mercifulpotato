Will they be around here for our multi-year project vision?&quot; Someone who job hops likely won&#x27;t be around long enough for you to execute on the big picture and you&#x27;ll be back to hiring&#x2F;training a replacement too soon.<p>Exactly. Bringing someone onboard, getting them up to speed, training them, etc., is an investment, and one that you want to be confident of seeing a return on.<p>When it comes to leadership with lots of job changes I become even more wary: I start to wonder what kind of havoc somebody might have left in their wake and, with this stuff, often references only get you so far.<p>I find myself trying to figure out if I know anyone who&#x27;s worked with them in the past so I can get a viewpoint from somebody who no longer has a dog in the fight.<p>There are sadly a minority of people out there who have a habit of changing jobs, with increasing seniority, just frequently enough that they avoid being &quot;found out&quot; whilst in role. I don&#x27;t want to hire one of them.')
