Item(by='kevingadd', descendants=None, kids=[25577620], score=None, time=1609284800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575840, text='I get what you&#x27;re going at, but I think it fundamentally misunderstands something.<p>If the writing is bad, there&#x27;s nothing that can really &quot;improve&quot; it other than the original author cleaning it up with the help of an editor. A bad translation is effectively a <i>new work</i>, at best <i>inspired by</i> the original bad script. You could replace a bad Japanese script with a &quot;good&quot; English one - this has happened before - but at that point it&#x27;s questionable whether any translation has happened at all, you&#x27;re mostly writing new content inspired by the original work or adhering to broad constraints. What I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re doing here is improving <i>the experience of playing the game</i>, but you haven&#x27;t done anything meaningful to the writing or script.<p>In a few cases western companies have licensed Japanese works and spliced them together with entirely new plots for overseas audiences - Robotech is one infamous example where arguably there was nothing wrong with the source material and the result wasn&#x27;t just a liberal translation.')
