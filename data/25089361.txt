Much cheaper to implement. Any hardware engineer will understand what does it mean by that ;-)<p>A feature is broken? Just update the documentation and say it&#x27;s broken, problem fixed! No need to fix the actual problem... An even more evil variant: still claim the feature works in the datasheet, but hide the problems in the erratas.')
