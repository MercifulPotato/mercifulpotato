Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608687906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25512452, text='&gt; Segwit has failed to reach even 50% adoption<p>By what metrics? The node count has increased since then and the hashrate keeps increasing to record highs, you have no way to prove what you just said and it borderlines absurd hyperbole&#x2F;total BS. Block size wasn&#x27;t the issue to solve the issues Bitcoin was having, if it were BCash would not be an entire waste of time&#x2F;resources as no one uses it and it has no volume to speak of. And this is all after Ver&#x2F;Jihan (speculation) were spamming the network to clog the mempool with low fee txs, and it still didn&#x27;t work as that made Bitcoin hit its first 20k ATH mark.<p>&gt; Small blockers hijacked the network via block stream and ruined bitcoins scalability at the behest of their $400 mil investors.<p>&#x27;Small blockers&#x27; also known as the Core Developers understood that Jihan and Ver were corrupt imbeciles with nothing but greed driving their motives, and it was clear Roger had no idea about the tech in question and his arguments fell apart under basic scrutiny. Bcash is living proof of that reality and has no tx volume and a only a percentage of of BTC&#x27;s value despite taking Jihan&#x27;s majority hash rate with them. And both STILL mine Bitcoin anyway...<p>&gt;  &#x2F;r&#x2F;Bitcoin is one of the most censored subreddits, ironic for a centralized platform.<p>I&#x27;m not disputing that, I&#x27;ve had several posts of mine censored since I joined in 2012, its hardly where I would say anything but meme shix-postin takes place with the occasional useful post, like the one from Andy who is pilot testing his LN Tesla charging system. Theymos and his Mods are not who I would trust to be the arbiter of &#x27;free speech&#x27; that much is correct. Only uninformed tourists go there to get their information about BTC.<p>&gt; Your smug “we can&#x2F;have done nothing wrong” attitude literally caused the BCH&#x2F;BSV forks...<p>Not true as I may be an early adopter I had only reluctantly put myself in the spotlight due to my startup when it was necessary and turned down many more offers to speak after I exited my startup so I hardly have &#x27;influence,&#x27; but lets say I did: and if it did I&#x27;m glad it did, because Bcash Ver&#x2F;Jihan were cancer and we were stagnating with people like Gavin, the Foundation, Hearn etc... They&#x27;re all dead weight and I&#x27;m glad we excised them before they all brought us down with them. I&#x27;m not satisfied where we are in terms of progress after so many lost years, but I&#x27;m glad to see Bitcoin has made as much progress as it has.<p>I&#x27;d say that we proved what we sought out to do, and still have more work to do. Mistakes were definitely made, we still do not have privacy features on by default like mixing to enhance security on the mainchain. Something that I thought we should have been focused on and implemented long ago. LN is coming along nicely, too, but still needs way more work to accommodate the influx txs to operate at the level we all feel it should, but again, progress takes time.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to touch the ETH non-sense you spouted off about. The fact that Cryptikitties is the most notable thing to have ever come from ETH proves why smart contracts was always Vitalk&#x27;s vaporware de-jour and I cannot comprehend what it sought or will ever do after so many years meandering in obscurity and countless hacks.<p>But Solidity is total garbage and having it forced on me was what made it so easy for me to leave tech as things had gone incredibly wrong if corps thought that made any sense. IBM had so much anti-Bitcoin propaganda in its course material, and was so often repeated despite most there (including the higher up execs and CEO) not knowing more than buzzwords.<p>When being empirically proven correct to detractors is seen as &#x27;smug&#x27; that is one of the points of validation and metrics I use when we proved the impossible. I&#x27;ve seen it enough times in various Industries to know that, so interpret all of this as you will.')
