I was so worry about it because I did not want to broke anything. I even bought more RAM because my machine only had 128 Mb. It was not enough for Ubuntu. After installing it, everything was new for me. Directories are now called places, anything is a file, multiple desktops, compiz, etc. I was very impressed at that time.<p>Now, we have reached a point where it is difficult to be impressed not because technology is not impressive itself but because we are so used to it.')
