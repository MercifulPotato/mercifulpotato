When you borrow a share and sell it, you’re really renting it to find one much like someone rented it to you. It’s like subletting an apartment you’re renting from a landlord.<p>In the end there’s a chain and if the person who lent you the share wants it back then the person you loaned it to will need to produce it for you, etc.<p>This is why we have margin accounts (and limits to how much margin we get&#x2F;can support).')
