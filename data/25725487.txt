I&#x27;m trying to bring up that, for every problem you&#x27;ve just defined, the literal exact same problem exists for colo&#x2F;managed servers, except it is now also your problem to keep the lights on and the machine running.<p>&gt;  literally every small business I have ever worked in as a tech worker has had several people at the office who were perfectly capable of buying a switch or firewall or router and spending the few minutes required to configure it or buying a server and installing Linux&#x2F;Windows and then whatever server software it needed again very quickly.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, if you believe that building and deploying production-ready server infrastructure is as easy as &quot;Just going out and buying a switch and spending a few MINUTES installing linux&quot; (emphasis mine) - I feel like we aren&#x27;t talking about the same thing at all.
