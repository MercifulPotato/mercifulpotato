There may be multiple rounds of review but a significant majority of papers submitted by professional astronomers doing serious research to journals are ultimately published. It is not the norm in astronomy to be rejected outright from a top journal and then submit to a lower tier journal, instead almost everyone publishes in a few popular journals. This is a tradeoff, but definitely in astronomy at least this means some iffy papers are ultimately published, even in ApJ, and you must always be aware when reading the literature that the paper you are reading is not infallibly correct just because it was published in a journal.')
