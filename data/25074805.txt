The implication being we shouldn&#x27;t care so much because someone died only a year earlier?<p>I don&#x27;t think this is what they&#x27;re saying. I think the point is that those people&#x27;s actual times of death weren&#x27;t far enough from their expected times of death given their preexisting conditions to be able to confidently say that they died of Covid, rather than just having died with it. In other words, that there&#x27;s a good chance they would have died at the exact same time even without Covid.')
