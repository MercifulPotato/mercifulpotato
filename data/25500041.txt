Sometimes it seems like we are way too good at out-smarting ourselves rather than keeping it simple. Food is really the simplest thing in the world - humans survived on this earth for tens of thousands of years before anybody knew anything about gut bacteria, vitamins, macronutrients, etcetera. I think it&#x27;s best not to overthink nutrition and just try to eat good, whole foods like our ancestors ate. It also so happens that those foods are the most delicious and satisfying. I like Pollan&#x27;s other principle of, &quot;If your grandma wouldn&#x27;t recognize it, don&#x27;t eat it!&quot;.')
