It&#x27;s now something like 25 years since I first installed Slackware off floppy discs, I&#x27;ve <i>been there</i> and no longer regard it as a useful use of my limited time.<p>The thinking environment of choice of the most productive, smartest person I&#x27;ve ever worked with was .. a notepad. Not Notepad, a physical A4 ruled paper notepad and an ordinary gel pen. The actual development inevitably required some typing, but the <i>thinking</i> process and its associated diagrams, calculations, and scribbles for the kind of maths-heavy work he was excellent at worked best on paper.<p>(I currently have vscode open .. and actual Visual Studio, and IntelliJ, and notepad++, each with a different set of files open in different languages.)')
