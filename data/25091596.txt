If Google locks your account, you can now move your email hosting to another provider and won&#x27;t lose access to your entire digital world.<p>Be aware that doing this now means your DNS provider and domain registrar become vectors for hackers to take over your email account, so make sure these are companies your trust and your access to these accounts is as secure as possible (ie strong unique passwords and app-based, not SMS-based two-factor authentication)')
