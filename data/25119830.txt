If you say &quot;oh by&quot;, a vanishingly small amount of people will translate this to &quot;0x&quot;. And you can&#x27;t say &quot;oh ex dot co&quot;, because the URL has both a 0 and a O in it - which will also always be ambiguous when written down. So you have to say something like &quot;zero ex dot co&quot;, which I suppose is fine, but it has a lot of extra syllables.')
