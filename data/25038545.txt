To get it to work well, it requires set up, and when I start a project, I don&#x27;t want to waste time setting anything up. Also, doesn&#x27;t work for interesting things, like code generation. I realize most programmers rarely do anything like that, but I do.<p>2. Customizability -- emacs is super-customizable. Lisp is easy to understand and you can basically do anything.<p>3. No mouse -- I&#x27;m faster just using keyboard shortcuts<p>4. Runs in terminal or graphical -- When I ssh into a machine, I want to be able to use Emacs through the terminal<p>5. Orthogonal user-interface -- In Emacs, everything is a buffer. I can use the same interface to navigate through Emacs &#x27;configuration&#x27; as I can through my code. I can use the same interface to navigate through the Emacs terminal emulator as my code as well. This is amazing. Contrast this to &#x27;newer&#x27; editors like Sublime or Eclipse, where the configuration dialog, git interface, etc, are all custom UIs. To understand why this makes a difference compare and contrast the experience of using a Web-based App via a browser to the feeling of using a Native App. The native app may &#x27;feel&#x27; nicer when you look at it, but nothing beats the consistency of the browser interface (back button, copy&#x2F;paste integration, links, etc.). There&#x27;s a reason HTML based interfaces are so popular<p>6. Universal support -- emacs runs on basically everything. So does VIM (Probably more than emacs)<p>7. Support for large numbers of libraries, languages, etc -- I&#x27;ve rarely found any new language, framework, etc, which doesn&#x27;t have support in Emacs. With some changes to my init.el, the package is installed (thanks to use-package), and I&#x27;m done.<p>8. Easy dot files -- I have several computers. To set up emacs on a new computer, I just copy my .elisp directory.<p>In other words, the advantages of Emacs and VIM over other editors are:<p>1. Text-based interfaces\n2. Universal support\n3. Customizability\n4. Adherence to the UNIX philosophy (everything represented as text)')
