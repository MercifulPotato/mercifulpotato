Being able to understand and identify logical fallacies has helped me critically evaluate the information I consume many times over.<p>Of course, any program like this has the problem that it needs to be implemented by a trusted source, or it will be attacked as &quot;indoctrination&quot; (whether or not that is the truth). I can see that as a major challenge in the US where 50%+ of the population is convinced that the government is out to get them at any one time.')
