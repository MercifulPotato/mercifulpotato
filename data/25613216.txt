Property out of state has zero cost to the people of the state.  It&#x27;s a pure money grab and it&#x27;s only affecting the middle class (because anyone who can justify the cost of estate planning will not be subject to this tax).<p>Edit: I&#x27;d be curious to see why people find this comment so disagreeable?  Or is it just ideologically inconvenient to point this stuff out?')
