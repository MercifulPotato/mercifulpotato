Property out of state has zero cost to the people of the state.  It&#x27;s a pure money grab.<p>There are all sorts of little gotchas like this when it comes to dealing with an estate.  I guess government has figured out most people don&#x27;t have the extra energy to fight them while they&#x27;re doing that.')
