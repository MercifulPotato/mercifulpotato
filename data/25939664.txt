I was about to make my own custom controller when I found out that they made a version 2 which fixed the issues. I have 2 of the version 2 and have been using it for a few years now with no problems. I&#x27;d say it was improved.<p>If you email them, they might give you a discount or some kind of trade-in if you tell them about your previous problems.
