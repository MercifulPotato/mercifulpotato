So creativity seems superficial, which will also seem recycled.<p>The algorithms, be it computer or more universal marketing &quot;strategies&quot; (aka algorithms) are an interesting point. Marketing is a lot more prevalent, since you now carry a mobile advertising portal and happily consume it as much as possible.')
