What people believe mostly doesn’t matter, or people’s incorrect beliefs have been life or death matters often?<p>&gt; I believe procrastinating on HN makes me less productive and here I am still procrastinating. I&#x27;m not acting on my own belief<p>You are acting on it by talking about it to other people. But good job picking a belief so low stakes that you can try to pretend that your beliefs  that are literally your map of the world, don’t determine how you act in the world.<p>&gt; The idea of censoring of wrongthink is nothing new.<p>Neither I nor the parent comment talked about that. Just that what people believe is important and has real world ramifications. It isn’t being “insecure” in my science to worry about people that think physics isn’t real, or vaccines aren’t real, or that killing someone that doesn’t believe in their god is required, or people with certain skin colors are biologically predisposed to violence, or that there is a vast global conspiracy going back hundreds of years to trick people about the shape of the earth.')
