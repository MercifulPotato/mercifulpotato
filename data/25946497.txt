If the price starts flying around you just widen your spread.</i><p>People after the financial crisis liked to talk about fat tails. Risk models assuming narrow tails, reality having a taste for extreme events. <i>This</i> is a fat-tail event. We don&#x27;t have great models for stocks as volatile and as correlated as GME is right now. Which means for even cash equities trading, we don&#x27;t have a great sense around what the appropriate spread should be.<p>Market making has sometimes been described as vacuuming up nickels in front of bulldozers. These are bulldozin&#x27; times. You don&#x27;t want to fill a bunch of sell orders in GME right before it gaps down 80%.')
