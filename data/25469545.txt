Not a lawyer, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t even matter. Still, I&#x27;d argue that if you are selectively removing negative reviews in order to give a better impression of a product, while giving the customer the impression that the reviews are representative of people who bought the product, you&#x27;re no longer just publishing reviews. You are now engaged in promoting the product, and you&#x27;re doing so through dishonest means.<p>Now is that illegal? I sure don&#x27;t know. Is it provable? That could be tough, too. But if someone asked me if it&#x27;s legal to doctor reviews of products, I&#x27;d tell them to consult a very good lawyer or two.')
