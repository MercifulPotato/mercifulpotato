Item(by='dkarl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607121640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308676, text='<i>At no point have I ever said &quot;I no longer want to wear this, I&#x27;ll sell it for a buck and buy something new&quot;.</i><p>Me either, but I do get to the point where my closet and dresser are full, and I have clothes in them that I haven&#x27;t worn in years.  The pipeline starts to get clogged right after the &quot;nice enough for going out and&#x2F;or work&quot; stage, because everything lasts so much longer in the &quot;comfy in the house&quot; stage than it does in the &quot;nice&quot; stage.  Plus things change from year to year:  how nicely I dress at work, how often I go out, where I go when I go out.  Some people have changes in location and climate or in their body size.  And sometimes you just look at something and realize it isn&#x27;t you anymore.  Am I ever again going to wear the barn jacket my parents bought me twenty years ago?  Maybe, under circumstances I can&#x27;t foresee right now, but in the meantime it&#x27;s warm and has a ton of life left in it, so why not pass it on?')
