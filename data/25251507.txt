Item(by='jahaja', descendants=None, kids=[25251597], score=None, time=1606721687, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250081, text='&gt; Institutional racism is &quot;racism that is embedded as normal practice within society&quot;, which only occurs through the mechanism of systemic properties like its laws or rules, or its social contract, just as I explained.<p>Come on. You&#x27;ve cherry-picked a single vague line from the preamble of that article because it&#x27;s so general that it also fits your narrow definition. The rest of the article goes on about the established definition.<p>You&#x27;re redefining an entire concept <i>coined</i> to mean what we are talking about. Instead your clutching at straws adamantly sticking to the textboox definitions of the each word. That&#x27;s just childish and have to place in any adult conversation.<p>Just in the last week you&#x27;ve redefined the following to fit your unsupported narrative here on HN and called everything else objectively false and refused to even discuss the other definition:<p>* Institutional&#x2F;System racism, ignoring ~50 years of history (for the term itself, the practice itself is obviously much earlier).<p>* Soclal Democracy, ignoring ~200 years of history<p>* The concept of personal property and it&#x27;s distinction from private property. Ignoring ~200 years of socialist history.<p>You do realize that you don&#x27;t have to agree with the concept to at least discuss it? Something like &quot;Yes, if we use established definition, which I disagree with, there&#x27;s systemic&#x2F;institutional racism against black people in America&quot;.<p>Because what definition do you even think people are using when asking you if it exists? &quot;Do you like the color blue?&quot;, &quot;No! there&#x27;s no blue color&quot;. That&#x27;s just childish and will never generate any constructive discussion at all, and is for all purposes just trolling or at least sabotage - answering a question that contains an established concept&#x2F;definition with an entirely new one that only you know about.')
