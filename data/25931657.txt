I did the assumption that regular human has 250ms visual reaction (some people can achieve 120ms). So, we need just a mobile app with two buttons - RED (NSFW detected) and GREEN (the image looks good). We can skip the learning phase because people already know what is wrong (porn, murder, etc). Three independent people can rate the same image at the same time for error correction (this may lower the advantage by ~3 but still good).<p>At the same time, AWS Rekognition charges $0.001 per image. This is 280 times more expensive.<p>Am I did a mistake in my calculations? Is this a fundamental advantage of biological species? Is &quot;silicon&quot; NNs can reach that in the near future?<p>P.S.<p>moral questions of this topic are interesting too ...')
