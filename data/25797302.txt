Further, women swipe less often. 1 out of 2 people are at least unattractive, 1 out of 3 are outright attractive, and 1 out of 5 are hot.<p>The top half is typically seen as viable by males when they stretch (and women explicitly seek the top 20%). That is, all viable 50&#x2F;100 women are gobbled up by the top 50&#x2F;200 (ie, 25%) males. Not even out of &quot;attractive&quot; males and the viable women are already gone. The top 20% of males then end up being enough due to the swipe skew.')
