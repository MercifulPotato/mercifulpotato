I&#x27;m a TA this term as my new funding is being being worked out because it takes 6 months to do. So I&#x27;m TAing a class on assembly which I have no experience and don&#x27;t even have a CS undergraduate degree. It sucks for us too as a have one class that expects 30hrs&#x2F;wk of work (+another class), my research (what I want to spend all my time on), and TAing takes 18hrs&#x2F;wk.<p>You&#x27;re only going to get a good TA when that professor is teaching a class that&#x27;s their focus and has a grad student that has that fucus AND that student isn&#x27;t on other research funding. The system is far from optional for either undergrads or grads. Believe me, I&#x27;m not happy either')
