No, because a SSL connection is transient and you can&#x27;t replay it to show that Google&#x27;s certificate digitally signed that email in GMail.</i><p>A TLS session replay is unnecessary. If you&#x27;ve got the email with its headers intact then you can prove that you received that email.<p>You might want to learn what email headers are available to you. You&#x27;d be interested in learning about ARC-Seal, ARC-Message-Signature, ARC-Authentication-Results, and DKIM-Signature. Those headers will let you cryptographically validate that a message is authentic -- that the email is unaltered as Google received it from whoever sent it.<p>You&#x27;ll also be interested in learning about Key Transparency: the signatures are created using Google&#x27;s PKI which should be listed in any public key transparency log. That will let you prove that the signatures you validated were created using something that only Google knows.')
