Because society has shown that we don’t value their work enough to pay them enough to attract people to the job.  Nursing homes are run on shoe string budgets, those people changing bed pans  are well in their moral rights to strike and demand better pay.  I don’t see anyone lining up to do their job.<p>It’s also a bit rich for people who don’t work these important, getting your hands dirty jobs to judge people walking out on them.
