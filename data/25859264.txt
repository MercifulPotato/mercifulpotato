It only has byte strings which can accidentally also be text strings encoded in utf-8.<p>This is a very, very sloppy way to handle text, and will inevitably lead to a huge number of mistakes and broken software.<p>Any well-designed modern language really should make a strong separation between raw byte buffers and text strings. They are very different things, and one can definitely not trivially be converted to the other.')
