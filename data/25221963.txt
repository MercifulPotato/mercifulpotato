A friend of mine edits videos on her iPad for 2 reasons.  The first is that there seem to be more easy to use video editing apps there than on Windows, and she found one she liked (by testing them on her phone).  The second is that the video editing performance is actually really good compared to what you can get with the same money in a Windows laptop + editing software.  So getting an iPad mostly for video editing was an easy decision for her.')
