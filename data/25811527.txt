Item(by='Jon_Lowtek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610897943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810639, text='&gt; This authentication exploit bypasses the login screen despite BitLocker, so it&#x27;s technically a BitLocker bypass<p>No. No, it is not. Let me give a similar example: lets say the drive requires a PIN and i ask the user to enter the PIN, then i still get to the starting conditions of this article.<p>Technically i could argue it now includes a social engineering variant of a bitlocker bypass, but it should be very obvious there is no actual bypass, only an &quot;assume it is open&quot; precondition. The article has an &quot;assume the device is configured in a way that i can walk right past bitlocker to the lockscreen&quot; and then calls it <i>&quot;Bypassing BitLocker in 6 easy steps&quot;</i>. No, just no. Not technically, not theoretically, just no.<p>Not to be unfair to the author, the lockscreen bypass is clever and teaches a lot about defensive coding. It is a good finding. But the article gets dragged down by the sensationalist title, because the content is not what it says it is.')
