Maybe its a process you didn&#x27;t care about, maybe its a process you actually are communicating with and suddenly you&#x27;re now in a weird deadlock state. Etc. etc.<p>Even if YOU touch all your memory like you&#x27;re supposed to, there&#x27;s no guarantee that OTHER processes have touched their memory.<p>So you touch memory unnecessarily: which means you&#x27;re now officially reserving RAM (wasting it). Then, some OTHER process touches their memory and runs the OOM-killer. That wouldn&#x27;t have happened if you just didn&#x27;t touch your RAM.<p>-----------<p>If Linux Overcommit is on default, you live with it and die with it. No point trying to fight OS-policy. Change the policy (aka: Overcommit to 2), and then carefully select applications to run with that follow the same overcommit policy as you.')
