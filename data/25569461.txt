I&#x27;ve tried to optimize how good it feels and the biggest &quot;innovation&quot; was to take coffee to go at the start.<p>Right now the usual pattern is to take a train (30min) to a smaller historical town, buy coffee to go, and then walk and think or do something on the phone, then return by train. There are various combinations, e.g. start and end the hike at different train stations.<p>The combination of walking, coffee, train and getting to a different (and nice) environment makes it feel really good and relaxing. I&#x27;m lucky to live in a place with a high density rail and hiking trails.')
