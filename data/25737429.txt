I live in a town with a major university and there are plenty of cyclists on the roads leading to and from campus as well as on campus itself.  This is the case at many universities I&#x27;ve been to.<p>Also, as far as I&#x27;m aware, there are no protected bike lane installations anywhere around campus or in town, but we do have a nice rail trail.')
