This used to be prohibitively expensive, but now is fairly cheap too, the price went down six (!) orders of magnitude since 2000,<p>c) ask specialized software to find the optimal protein set to express. This software can be used for all the patients around, so cost of development will be split among them,<p>d) synthetize the correct messenger RNA and embed it in lipid nanoparticles. Not cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either, this is basically a biological equivalent of a printing job,<p>e) check the resulting drug and send it to the clinic where the patient is treated.<p>This all together is a much more straightforward and automatized process than extracting tumor-invading lymphocytes from a patient and babying them in vitro with a lot of attention from human scientists and use of fairly expensive reagents. The price tag for this process per se should be at least two orders of magnitude lower.<p>Then you must add the original development and testing costs, amortized equipment cost and profit. This is where the total price tag may balloon.')
