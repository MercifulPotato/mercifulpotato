The #1 thing that I think about when I&#x27;m looking at some code or feature (and recommend others do the same) is how malformed or intentionally malicious input would break it, but it seems like their developers clearly didn&#x27;t do so.<p>This is also compounded by the drive to artificially complicate software stacks (microservices, etc) and &quot;silo&quot; developers into their own little bubble where they only work on a small aspect of the system and never have a need (nor the mental capacity - due to intentionally complicated stacks with dozens of microservices in various languages) to look at the big picture.')
