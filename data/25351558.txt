It’s possible to run free software with a paid support contract backed by a corporation - thats what RHEL offers, and Ubuntu with their Ubuntu Advantage program.<p>CentOS offered free software, but with unpaid community support, which isn’t guaranteed at all as there’s no contract.<p>This is an unpopular opinion but this is why I prefer Ubuntu over Debian - there’s a corporation on the other end that’s being paid to update software, and if you choose, you can always upgrade to paid support that is backed by a legally binding contract.')
