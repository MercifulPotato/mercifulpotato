We are running a short business survey to study the phenomenon and looking for founders&#x2F;employees to complete the survey.<p>Incentive and eligibility: Participants who completed the survey will automatically be entered into a lottery of several $1,000 Visa gift cards. We do not have any requirements regarding the industry&#x2F;size of the venture - the only requirement is that participants need to be founders&#x2F;employees at a U.S. business that identifies itself as an entrepreneurial firm.<p>Data privacy: All responses are confidential and will only be shared after aggregation. As a thank-you, we will send all participants a summary of results so that they can benchmark their business practices against trends in the startup space and gain insights into the effectiveness of alternative remote work models.<p>Principal investigator: This research project is led by Jiayi Bao (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publicpolicy.unc.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;jiayi-bao&#x2F;), an Assistant Professor of Public Policy and Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
