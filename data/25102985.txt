Too many people are churning out low quality content because they think it will give them a career or hiring advantage.<p>These days, many of the best programming tutorials can be found by going straight to the source documentation. Many popular projects and vendors are providing volumes of useful examples to get people started. Beyond that, many of the companies offering low-cost training courses are significantly better than what random people are offering on the open internet.<p>That said, your platform suggestion feels overly complicated. The more complicated the platform, the more the tutorials become the centerpiece of the experience rather than the code itself. In an ideal world, users would allocate as much mental energy as possible to the code and learning, without being bogged down by dealing with the tutorial platform.<p>A platform that is self-hosted by random people across the internet with tutorials that are cloned, forked, versioned, and modified across different websites sounds like a step in the wrong direction. In an ideal world, beginners would be able to get started on a good tutorial right away. If they instead have to sift through endless Google listings of slightly modified, forked tutorials while I search for the most updated or &quot;best&quot; fork, they&#x27;re going to waste all of their energy on the tutorial process.<p>In a perfect world, the best tutorials would be mated as closely as possible to the source project documentation. Keep it simple and obvious.')
