Its replacement also arrives just in the cardboard box such as what you get with 2500 sheets of paper, so no huge polystyrene packing and no plastic in the printer housing, that being cardboard.<p>In this design double sided is not going to happen or any other paper sizes apart from A4. It no longer competes in aspects of versatility, nobody cares about its printer driver, no ink cartridges have to be bought, the internals are only good for 2500 sheets and it just works.')
