The SolarEdge thingies on my panels don&#x27;t invert at all, they just modulate the voltage&#x2F;connectivity for the panels so that malfunction&#x2F;shade doesn&#x27;t pull the whole array down.<p>What I&#x27;m personally waiting for is a grid-tied inverter that can also be used to directly charge batteries as well. Nobody seems to make one that doesn&#x27;t involve some important compromises. For now it seems that if you want grid-tied <i>and</i> a battery system, you charge the batteries through a double DC-&gt;AC-&gt;DC conversion (i.e. charge the batteries from your regular house AC system), and somehow solve the instant-cutover problem separately.')
