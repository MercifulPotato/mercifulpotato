They also have a vast need for engineers.<p>So they have to make a business case to continue to fund engineers, and I don&#x27;t think one exists for the type of development we&#x27;re wanting.<p>To be clear, there is some development they could justify.<p>If they are replicating new features that Elastic releases, so they&#x27;re not falling behind the market, the business case is retaining customers. But that&#x27;s playing catch up.<p>If new features optimize the service, the business case is being able to advertise lower TCO, which attracts customers. That could be quite beneficial, but there&#x27;s usually not a ton of optimization you can do.<p>There is a business case for new features that increase integration with other AWS services. That increases customer usage of AWS. But AWS is so proprietary this would likely be useless outside AWS.<p>So none of that, I think, is the development people are looking for.<p>What we&#x27;d want are features a software business develops to differentiate their product in the market. If the features go into the open source version, however, then by definition they aren&#x27;t differentiating.<p>This is the key business contradiction in AWS trying to fund open source development.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something and they can make the business case for continued differentiating feature development. So, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m wrong if after two years we&#x27;re seeing such features being released to the commnuity.')
