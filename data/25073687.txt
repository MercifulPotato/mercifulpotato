And it worked just fine no matter what the HN crowd would have you believe.<p>conda had minor usage in the last one for building a handful of special projects mixing C++ and Python code (highly specific code in the finance industry), after build the artifacts could go into the python repository (internal pypi) and be usable with pip. Everything was down to pip at the end of the day. As a matter of fact, the guys who used and pushed for conda were also the ones pushing the hardest for pip because pip is the answer to everything.')
