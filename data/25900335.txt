It won&#x27;t come again.<p>Physics suffered from the same problem: &quot;action,&quot; &quot;work,&quot; and so on, are unrelated to their usage. But we&#x27;re stuck with them.<p>Both &quot;loss&quot; and &quot;learning rate&quot; are confusing, and neural networks are so confusing that I think it&#x27;s worth undoing as much as possible.<p>I would s&#x2F;loss&#x2F;penalty&#x2F; and s&#x2F;learning rate&#x2F;step size&#x2F;, after giving it much thought. At least, I haven&#x27;t thought of better names yet.<p>The reason &quot;step size&quot; is important is because it represents what&#x27;s actually going on. You don&#x27;t increase the learning rate to make it learn faster. You increase the step size to make it take longer steps towards a goal. And when it&#x27;s close to the goal, it circles around the goal, like water down a drain. You decrease the step size (learning rate) towards the end of training so that it doesn&#x27;t keep dancing around the bowl, and can finally reach its target in the middle.<p>Slight modifications like that can give lots of insights. For example, now that you&#x27;re thinking of learning rate in terms of water spiraling down a drain, you can see why averaging the last N model checkpoints increases accuracy: if you&#x27;re spinning in a circle around a target, then the average of your last 5 positions must bring you closer to the center. In fact, that&#x27;s true of any convex shape. Therefore the loss landscape seems mostly convex.<p>And so it goes. It&#x27;s very much like compound interest. The more you understand, the more you <i>can</i> understand. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to be determined and patient.<p>Also, ask lots of questions on Twitter. In my opinion it&#x27;s one of the most crucial resources for learning ML. The ML community there is phenomenal, and I don&#x27;t know why. All I know is that everyone is super friendly and eager to help you out. Start with @pbaylies, @jonathanfly, @aydaoai, and @arfafax.')
