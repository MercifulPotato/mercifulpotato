I’m not hunting down original sources for everything I think I know, I’m mostly relying on gatekeepers (experts) to tell me what is true.<p>Unfortunately, in social media, everybody gets to be an expert! How can the average person tell?<p>As much as it goes against my grain, I have to admit that society works better when the gatekeepers decide what the truth is, even though we know they don’t always get it right.<p>Our current technology allowing any kind of garbage to be amplified to the masses is making things worse, not better.')
