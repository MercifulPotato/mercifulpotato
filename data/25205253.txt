There is actually a fairly narrow slice of the financial world that you don&#x27;t like, specifically central banking and fiat currency.<p>Currently, crypto traders are busy learning that all the rest of the financial world, including things like credit and financial derivatives (encapsulated in smart contracts), can still apply to cryptocurrencies.<p>Things like consumer credit and fractional reserve banking will show up in crypto soon (if they haven&#x27;t already).  It&#x27;s just a matter of trusted entities offering specific smart contracts.<p>The one thing I really dislike about most crypto is the traceability: unless you use privacy coins (which themselves have dubious security claims), every transaction is 100% traceable.')
