The US is very good for solar in general, compared to Europe. Also many of these wide open areas are also great for wind power.<p>And what &quot;extreme and unexpected weather&quot; are you talking about? Climate change has increased the severity of hurricanes but I&#x27;ve heard nothing about tornados which is all you would have to worry about. The western parts have to worry about fires to some extent, but that&#x27;s not a problem for the eastern parts (even intentional fires put themselves out). Also even in the western parts, it&#x27;s hard to create a firestorm without trees, a simple fire break can stop many grass fires.')
