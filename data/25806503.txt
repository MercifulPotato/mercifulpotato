Normal phishing is broadly targeted and fairly generic - &quot;You just won a cruise&quot;, online parking ticket due, etc.  It&#x27;s usually easy to spot once you&#x27;re aware of it.<p>Spear-phishing, in contrast, targets a specific audience with a message that includes specific details that make it more convincing - your boss&#x27;s name, company, job title, bank account number, mortgage loan start date, health provider name, etc.  The more specific, the better.  These can be very hard to detect.  If I&#x27;ve just been to the doctor, I&#x27;m expecting to get an email about a hospital bill, and I&#x27;m pretty confident that the hospital&#x27;s online payment site will look like it hasn&#x27;t been updated from the 90s.  TBH, half the time I&#x27;m paying a medical bill online, I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it&#x27;s actually going to the right place...')
