Their total market share is now 0.5 percent. It’a definitely encouraging to see growth here, but there’s still a long way to go.<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that the numbers for electric vehicles often include plug-in hybrids. They’re a neat idea in theory, but in practice, they often serve as a hybrid car and never get plugged in. The gains from those vehicles are somewhat limited, except that they are included in the subsidies for electric cars in Germany.')
