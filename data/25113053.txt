I don&#x27;t see how this is contradictory to freedom of speech.<p>&gt; What about a property on a busy road - a sign there has more impact than a sign at a house off the beaten path. You&#x27;re essentially arguing that because that property has more visibility, it is unfair to the other who doesn&#x27;t have that same location.<p>In US there were a couple of court cases that ruled that free speech applies to places that are technically private.

If we don&#x27;t do <i>something</i> about this, we might very soon find out how truly dystopian capitalism can be.')
