However, these are the actions that cause the most issues for me due to being used most often (JIRA datacenter, MBP 2019 with i7 + 32gb ram):<p>1. Viewing a board. This can take 10+ seconds to load.<p>2. Dragging an issue from one column to another. This greys out the board, rendering it unreadable and unusable for 5-ish seconds.<p>3. Editing a field. I get a little spinner before it applies for 2-3s for even the simplest edits like adding a label.<p>4. Interacting with any board that crosses multiple projects. A single project board is bad enough, as in point 1, but we have a 5 project board that takes 20+ seconds.<p>Actually, I found an action that&#x27;s pretty ok: Search results are fast, even if clicking into any of them is not. I&#x27;m not sure why rendering a board is so different performance wise.')
