To work more like AlphaZero, AlphaFold would have to be able to synthesize arbitrary proteins and run the experiments on them to verify and correct its predictions. Therefore it’s conceivable that AlphaFold is biased by the existing training data and doesn’t fully generalize to all proteins we would want to apply it to. Maybe that won’t be a problem in practice, but nevertheless it makes for a significant difference from what AlphaZero was about, being solely self-trained.')
