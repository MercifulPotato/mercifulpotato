In our use case the thread would wake up, check if there was any work to do, if not then sleep(1). If you&#x27;re doing it continuously(there is nothing to do) the thread would be sleeping for 16ms pretty much exactly every time - which meant that any time any work came in it wouldn&#x27;t be picked up immediately, but anywhere between 1-16ms(which was unacceptable for this use case).')
