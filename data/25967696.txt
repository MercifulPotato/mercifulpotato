Yes, it is yet another Soulver&#x2F;Numi&#x2F;etc clone. What is the difference? It&#x27;s designed to work on the Web and mobile phones. This allows you to easily share your calculations with anybody just by sending them a link!<p>Stuff already implemented: Currencies, Crypto, Percentage, Sum&#x2F;total, Inline JS<p>TODO: Variables, Unit conversions, Date&#x2F;time calculations, Checkbox lists, Dark theme. Any suggestions?<p>I also contacted the original Soulver author to show my work. He was so nice that added Numbr to the list of alternatives: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.soulver.app&#x2F;faq#is-soulver-available-for-ios-windows-or-android" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.soulver.app&#x2F;faq#is-soulver-available-f...</a><p>Also, I have a plan to open source Numbr later on after all TODO stuff is ready. (BTW I have a bunch of other open-source projects, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medv.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medv.io</a>)<p>I would love to hear feedback from the community.
