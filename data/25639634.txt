We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#x27; scan&#x2F;copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.<p>No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#x27;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.<p>I can die happy. Thank you.')
