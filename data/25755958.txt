You&#x27;ve given me food for thought.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to say the rules are vague, a statement I agree with. In my understanding of how the big social media players have finally applied their rules against Trump it was for inciting violence and spreading disinformation. I&#x27;d suggest the latter is pretty clear-cut, with the former being somewhat more challenging. Trump&#x27;s tactic of inciting violence while calling for peace is the pinnacle of examples. Even in this case, however, the fact he calls for peace doesn&#x27;t nullify his call to arms.<p>In your example however, Harris surely has other wide-ranging channels to spread her message. She would also likely be able to bring a legal case that her alleged breaking of the terms was not the case - but I&#x27;m sure this would be decided on much to far down the path to be relevant. The damage would already be done.<p>Witter would likely already be known to have an axe to grind against Harris or her politics - would she even deign to engage on the platform at all?<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m splitting hairs and&#x2F;or cherrypicking. It&#x27;s not my intention to discuss this in bad faith. Just the thought of an organisation not being allowed to apply its rules really does shock me.')
