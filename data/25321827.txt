FTA:<p><i>&gt; On land, life tends to spring from the ploughed lines of a field, but in the deep sea the trenches are relatively barren. The creatures that relied on the nodules, now removed, cannot re-colonise. And others, which require soft sediment to burrow and find mobilised food, cannot live on the artificially compacted surfaces.</i><p>The nodules were harvested 30+ years ago on a small scale and local life still hasn&#x27;t recovered. Given the time scale required for them to build up (millions of years) they are effectively non-renewable.<p>There&#x27;s a tipping point at which the global ecosystem will be too screwed up to bounce back to a point where it can sustain us. We won&#x27;t know where that point is until we&#x27;re past it. I&#x27;d rather avoid going that far.')
