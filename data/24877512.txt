When I’ve phoned in my signature (read just a line instead of something even vaguely resembling my usual mess) it has been challenged. I also forgot to sign&#x2F;drop my ballot one time and had my wife sign it. That one was also challenged.<p>When challenged you have to reaffirm you submitted the ballot. You only “lose” your vote if you fail to respond.<p>YMMV but it seems to work pretty well here.')
