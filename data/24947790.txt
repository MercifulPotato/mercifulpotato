Look at how much they&#x27;ve got here. The pedestrians are pushed to the side and squeezed. Why do we accept that?<p>And why do we talk about pedestrians &#x27;crossing the street&#x27;? How about instead we call crosswalks an extension of the sidewalk and talk about cars &#x27;crossing the sidewalk&#x27;?<p>How did we let cars get the upper hand on people?<p>And why is anyone driving through a freaking city in the first place?
