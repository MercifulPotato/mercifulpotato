In the 32 nm technology that would likely need much more than 1000 square mm,<p>Where are you getting that scaling from? Intel&#x27;s 32nm is reported at 7.5Mtr&#x2F;mm2 while TSMC&#x27;s 5NM is 171Mtr&#x2F;mm2. 30 sqmm of TSMC 5nm in 32nm would therefore be around 660 sqmm. That&#x27;s definitely on the large side, but yet again chips nearly that large were manufactured &amp; sold in consumer products.<p>&gt; A very large part of the die is not labelled and it must include some blocks that cannot be omitted from the CPU, e.g. the PCIe controller and various parts from the memory controller, e.g. buffers and prefetchers.<p>You need those things to have a functional modern SoC, but you don&#x27;t need as much or of the same thing to have <i>just</i> a desktop CPU without an iGPU, nor to have <i>just</i> the raw compute performance of the M1. It&#x27;ll be a heck of a lot harder to feed it on dual-channel DDR3, for sure, but all those canned benchmarks that fit in cache would still be just as fast.')
