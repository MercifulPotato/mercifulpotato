But even null results are valuable guides for theory development. They teach us that some ideas—for example, that spacetime might be a regular lattice—are simply incompatible with observations.[1]<p>So this is really mostly about a &quot;you had your chance with the toy, now it&#x27;s time to let others play&quot; argument, though she&#x27;s very adamant that it&#x27;s not. This is really the large problem with her criticisms: the case that exists is for particle physics getting less priority, but her argument is that it should stop completely, the collaborations disbanded, and everyone goes to find a new job because they can&#x27;t be trusted to think clearly.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nautil.us&#x2F;issue&#x2F;45&#x2F;power&#x2F;what-quantum-gravity-needs-is-more-experiments" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nautil.us&#x2F;issue&#x2F;45&#x2F;power&#x2F;what-quantum-gravity-needs-i...</a>')
