All of the above have expressed their compatibility guarantees in clear terms. No one advertises Python as suitable for life-critical applications. It&#x27;s the responsibility of the person who choses to use it for life-critical applications to understand its change lifecycle and put that into their evaluation.<p>While I agree that in general we should care more about backwards compatibility, don&#x27;t put the blame on the maintainers for bad choices in life-critical domains. Most domains are not life-criticial and it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to make and meet a set of compatibility guarantees which applies to the domains you&#x27;re working in.')
