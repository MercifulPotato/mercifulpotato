Maybe aliens are the same. Maybe they don&#x27;t have the political will to send anything. Maybe they have their own climate change, or insane leaders to deal with. Or maybe not, maybe they&#x27;ve developed a virtual universe and are living in that instead of exploring the physical one.<p>I find the assumption that aliens have the same drive or desire as some humans to explore the universe rather crazy. It seems like we want a better versions from the heavens somewhere to tell us, it&#x27;ll be okay, don&#x27;t worry, here&#x27;s the blueprints to fix all your issues. It&#x27;s easily possible that aliens are opposite, wanting to focus on their issues and fix them rather than looking out to the stars for some hypothetical better version of themselves.')
