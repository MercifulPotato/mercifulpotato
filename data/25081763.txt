But they aren&#x27;t paying to add one new user. They&#x27;re paying for all users.<p>If each user&#x27;s storage cost 1 dollar a month then yeah adding an individual new user is basically free. But if they&#x27;re supporting 100 million users then it&#x27;s a hundred million dollars a month. Which isn&#x27;t free.<p>If you still don&#x27;t quite get it - try this thought experiment. If storage is free then could you afford to set up a storage data centre? If not, why not? It&#x27;s free after all, in your mind.')
