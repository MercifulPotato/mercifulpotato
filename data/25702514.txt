I did not know the website but it does not look to be an extremist website also.<p>So, as far as I can see, this was just an opinion on the corporate censorship of free speech, and it looks like that the flagged&#x2F;censorship of it here is kind of a proof of the point of the author...<p>So, please, I would really like to understand if there was something particular I did not see that would legitimately justify the ban of the post.<p>Thank you!')
