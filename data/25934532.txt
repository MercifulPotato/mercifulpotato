Last weekend I drove from Portland to Spokane and back (almost 400 miles each way). I entered my destination on the Tesla&#x27;s giant touchscreen. The car figured out the route and the one charging stop. I drove to the freeway, turned on autopilot, and let the car do its thing. Then three hours later the car took an exit. I drove from the offramp to the charging station, plugged in, and had a snack&#x2F;coffee. By the time I was back, the car was ready to go. The only issue was that automatic lane change was occasionally disabled due to snow obscuring cameras. The whole experience was far less tiring or stressful than any road trip I&#x27;ve taken with a gas car.')
