Rather it looks as if they are good at showing me what I already have.<p>While that&#x27;s definitely true (I get ads from Amazon for stuff I&#x27;ve already purchased all the time too), in that case Amazon is leveraging their own marketing channels to support their own business -- which has, effectively, zero marginal cost to them.<p>However, when advertisers buy space from Google or FB, that&#x27;s not the case.  There is a definite external cost to such ad buys.<p>As such, being able to identify the &quot;value&quot; of such expenditures is (or can&#x2F;should be) important to the advertisers.<p>That said, much of advertising is based upon the idea of &quot;top-of-mind awareness.&quot;[0]<p>The idea being that if you are considering a purchase, the brand that comes to mind without prompting when considering that purchase will be preferred over brands of which you aren&#x27;t immediately aware.<p>Purchase decisions made on a whim or without any research are usually those which are low cost.  Which is why companies like P&amp;G, Coca Cola and   like companies focus on &quot;top-of-mind awareness.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re going to buy a washing machine or a riding lawn mower, you&#x27;re much more likely to do research than if you&#x27;re going to buy a soft drink or a bag of chips.<p>That said, the same &quot;top-of-mind awareness&quot; can be helpful even for big ticket items, as those brands may well be the first ones about which research may be done.<p>Identifying how such advertising may impact purchase behavior is a complex topic, and unless you can quantify specific ad-views to actual purchases, doing so is generally speculative and is the subject of a great deal of quantitative market research[1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Top-of-mind_awareness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Top-of-mind_awareness</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantitative_marketing_research" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantitative_marketing_researc...</a>')
