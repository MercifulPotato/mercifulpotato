Basically, the idea is to be able to automatically apply filters on your data before building your model in an ML pipeline. This version of Lisp comes with data structures and pattern matching expressions, to detect some regular patterns in your data... This is the reason why we also have implemented a Python library so that your sieves can be called from within your Python code beforehand.')
