And he provides facts in support. Linux &quot;next generation technology&quot; would certainly alert users of insecure application. This does not. The story of themes and dbus shows how hard it is to contain all dependencies.<p>Also there were a lot of claims here that Linux distributions makes no good, static linking is better and libraries would be patched.<p>Now lets switch perspective. Windows users are perfectly fine running closed source software which may contain outdated dependencies. Most of them are not updated anyway. And it has gallery, something Winget still lacks. Looks like next gen. What is cry for open source developer may be fine for consumer.<p>Personally I&#x27;m fine with Flatpak, Appimage. There should be some way to install proprietary software. And some starting point to make it safe.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.org&#x2F;</a>')
