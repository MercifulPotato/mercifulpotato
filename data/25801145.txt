So I’ll give you an example, I know I can’t really date certain people that post prolifically on Instagram (you can extrapolate a little more from what I just said). This is not a hypothetical, I’m genuinely very insecure about whomever I’m with doing it.<p>Anyways, what’s a polite way to say that to a new person that you just got involved with? You just avoid it to begin with, nothing personal.<p>Someone in leadership also has needs. They need a team that respects and looks up to them. If they hire someone that clearly has a better resume, this is just not going to work. They can’t tell the recruiter ‘no, I can’t interview this person’ because usually the resume is good enough for a phone screen, so they go through the process.<p>But the answer is always simple.')
