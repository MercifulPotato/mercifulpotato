Just SUSE&#x27;s vanilla supported setup, and user data on smb&#x2F;nfs filers. I tended to forget that btrfs was even involved. I can&#x27;t remember a single time btrfs gave us any trouble. But snapper snapshots saved a customers ass on one or two occasions.. That was several yeas ago. I also imagine that btrfs has only improved since then.')
