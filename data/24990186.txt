Mom runs away a month later when the junkie she moved in starts OD&#x27;ing and beating her. Everyone forgets about the kid. At best he&#x27;s someone who just lives in a house of a couple dozen people dumped on society roaming feral neighborhoods. At worst he is a living moving toxic wasteland leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake until he&#x27;s killed in prison under a commuted death sentence, leaving one more murderer and murder victim in the world.')
