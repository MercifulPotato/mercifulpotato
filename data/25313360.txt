I&#x27;ve been meaning to read it for ages and ages, reckon this story has spurred me on to add it to my next book order.<p><i>Amadeus</i> was certainly entertaining albeit annoying for its inaccuracies. It&#x27;s saving grace was F. Murray Abraham&#x27;s wonderful Oscar-winning performance of Salieri.<p>Another aspect of the film worth noting was the fact that it was filmed in Prague before Communism finally fell, this really added to the visual character of the film. The reasons for filming there were mainly that there were no advertising billboards or hoardings anywhere to be seen across the city and the fact that under Communism there had been very little modern development in the old city which meant that its architecture was still authentically of the Enlightenment periodâ€”it&#x27;d been preserved par excellence (which was amazing given the ravages of war and the onslaught of the 20th Century).<p>I can attest to that, my first visit to Prague was before Communism fell and it really did look like like that.  Some years later when I visited again after Communism&#x27;s demise there were billboards and hoardings everywhere.  The visual change came as damn horrible shock.  If you want a lesson in how to make a city ugly in one easy lesson then Prague&#x27;s the quintessential example.')
