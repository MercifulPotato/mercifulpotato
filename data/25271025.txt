You&#x27;re kidding.<p>Python? Scala? R? Julia? Java? Rust??<p>I mean, SQL is fine and all, and folks keep trying to unseat it which I feel is folly but to call it the most expressive language... Not even close.<p>SQL is rigid and structured. Basic math and string operations are frustrating at best. It&#x27;s a small, easy to learn and powerful language. But it&#x27;s far from expressive.<p>edit: a lot of replies are implying I took the quote out of context, allow me to apologize:<p>For manipulating and querying data, SQL is <i>not</i> the most expressive language ever, I wouldn&#x27;t even call it expressive. It&#x27;s baroque, rigid, and structured. Spark (with e.g. Scala) is far and away a more expressive framework&#x2F;language than SQL ever will be. Python with pandas is far and away a more expressive framework&#x2F;language than SQL ever will be. The list goes on.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to shit on SQL -- I live and breath it and I wouldn&#x27;t be making money doing what I&#x27;m doing without it -- but it&#x27;s not <i>expressive</i>.<p>Take a look at the first lines of the Wikipedia article[0] for <i>Expressiveness</i> (referred to as <i>Expressive Power</i>):<p>&gt; In computer science, the expressive power (also called expressiveness or expressivity) of a language is the breadth of ideas that can be represented and communicated in that language. The more expressive a language is, the greater the variety and quantity of ideas it can be used to represent.<p>I get what the author is trying to say, but expressiveness is the wrong term. Datalog is arguably more expressive than SQL.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Expressive_power_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Expressive_power_(computer_sci...</a>')
