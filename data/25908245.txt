Additionally, Birdwatch can proactively seek ratings from contributors who are likely to provide a different perspective based on their previous ratings.</i><p>&gt; <i>Further, we plan for Birdwatch to have a reputation system in which one earns reputation for contributions that people from a wide range of perspectives find helpful.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.github.io&#x2F;birdwatch&#x2F;about&#x2F;challenges&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.github.io&#x2F;birdwatch&#x2F;about&#x2F;challenges&#x2F;</a>')
