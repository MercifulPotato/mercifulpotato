Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609353520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582174, text='&gt; There&#x27;s still a lot to be said for established brands.<p>Thus the loop comes full circle.<p>Originally the idea of a brand (&quot;burned&quot; -- burned into the hide of an animal or a piece of wood) was a way to label the provider in the hope that people would learn which providers were trustworthy and had high quality.  This extended into manufactured products once printed packaging become popular (logos and labels, starting with low-input goods like tea).<p>Then sometime in the 20th century people figured out that they could use mass advertising to build the brand (by then just a label) itself, sometimes even rendering the product itself almost irrelevant. I remember articles in the paper (80s I think) expressing shock and&#x2F;or bemusement that someone would wear a shirt with &quot;Tommy Hilfinger&quot; printed boldly across the front.  At that point such brands become an expression of stance rather than product quality, or perhaps the product was merely a way to broadcast the brand.  For example Diesel jeans which can only be worn a small number of times, compared to levis which last much longer.<p>And now it&#x27;s come back to the starting point: seeking the brand, but for some level of quality assurance rather than lifestyle adherence.')
