Making a function and applying it on a vector is a simple way to boost performance. Also recursion seems[1] to be faster than iteration.<p>Seeing the code in article, it can be that a part in that speedup is because R is used and not only of a better algorithm.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictivehacks.com&#x2F;a-comparison-between-iteration-reduce-recursion-memoization-in-r&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictivehacks.com&#x2F;a-comparison-between-iteration-r...</a>')
