Gas stations will keep serving gas as long as there&#x27;s even some vague demand for it, so they would start disappearing rather at the end point of such an s-curve, than at the beginning.<p>And they&#x27;ll still be around, they&#x27;ll just serve electricity. Fun fact, a lot of gas stations used to serve as stables. When cars arrived, they served both and gradually stopped being stables.<p>Though with electricity being overall so much easier to distribute than gas, I&#x27;m guessing a significant amount will indeed have to close, especially inside cities; no point going to a refueling station if a charger is available at nearly every corner, when you&#x27;re parked while eating at the restaurant, or when you&#x27;re home asleep and charging from your garage.')
