There are a great deal of &quot;I&#x27;m not touching you&quot; type behaviors that society collectively despises and often falls under these catch-all categories.<p>Legal doctrine is rife with &quot;reasonable person&quot; standards as a result that would be impossible to codify thoroughly and properly. Obviously, the mythical &quot;reasonable person&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist and is often a judge or jury left to subjectively decide.<p>For example, harassment laws sometimes rely on a &quot;credible threat of violence&quot; based on something that would &quot;make a reasonable person afraid for their safety&quot;.
