I expect to see lawsuits around the labeling of beef and chicken about being genetically modified (yes some of this is already happening).<p>The world will be profoundly different on the far side of generalized understanding of genetics and the means to manipulate them. At least as different as it has become pre-internet+computer to post internet+computer.')
