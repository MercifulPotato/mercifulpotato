And after seeing their parents get knifed in the back by believing in the &quot;job for life&quot; concept that worked for their grandparents, the two-way loyalty of that system is completely absent in the current generation. It&#x27;s been replaced with cynicism and mistrust.<p>So it&#x27;s kind of a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. If you&#x27;re a company and you invest heavily in junior talent, they&#x27;ll probably leave for greener pastures ASAP. And if you&#x27;re an employee who stands by an employer who gave you an initial leg up, you&#x27;ll probably get fired after an aquisition&#x2F;re-org&#x2F;etc, and you&#x27;ll find yourself with very narrow work experience.<p>FAANG companies manage this with &quot;golden handcuff&quot; stock vesting schedules, where you&#x27;ll leave 6-7 figures on the table if you ever walk, but that&#x27;s kind of the problem. It&#x27;s hard for small orgs to compete for decades on pure cash compensation, and they can&#x27;t be trusted to provide stability for decades.')
