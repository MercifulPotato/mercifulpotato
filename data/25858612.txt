That must be the stupidest idea I have ever heard!&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t know about that. Before the invention of the airplane we already had balloon carriers - ships that carried balloons for observation in naval engagements.<p>The first flight of a fixed wing aircraft happened in 1903. By 1910 a plane had already taken off from the armored cruiser USS Birmingham.[0] The French converted the Foudre to be a seaplane carrier in 1911 after the invention of the seaplane in 1910.<p>Planes launched from ships were used in World War I.\nFor example, HMS Engandine was a freight ship that was converted into a seaplane tender and commissioned in 1914. In 1916 she took part in the Battle of Jutland. HMS Ark Royal was a purpose built seaplane carrier and was commissioned in 1914. She also took part in World War I.<p>Later we got the flat-deck carriers. HMS Argus was converted in 1918, USS Langley in 1920. The first purpose built flat deck carriers were the Japanese Hōshō and British Hermes. They were commissioned in 1922 and 1924 respectively, but the Hermes was laid down first in 1918.<p>Funnily enough, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 cancelled the production of more battleships and battlecruisers. This led to the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga being converted to carriers. And eventually carriers made direct surface combat ships obsolete.<p>Planes on ships probably wasn&#x27;t a crazy idea.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USS_Birmingham_(CL-2)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USS_Birmingham_(CL-2)</a>')
