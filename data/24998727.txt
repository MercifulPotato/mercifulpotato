Sometimes the access gets gated for whitelisted VPN&#x2F;office IPs only, but especially with so many people working from home currently, they end up having to just open things up completely.<p>I would not have expected that based on the majority of my career, but I shifted into an agency environment with many Starbucks-like clients a few years ago, and it was like stepping into a whole new world. Our agency doesn&#x27;t actually do dev work, but tend to be part of large inter-agency teams working on those sorts of projects. And that seems to be par for the course for 70%+ of the clients I&#x27;ve been involved in.')
