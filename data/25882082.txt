Item(by='Daho0n', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611408935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873387, text='&gt; Even large cities in North America have no more than a few dozen gas stations (and the UK likely fewer still due to things like London&#x27;s congestion pricing reducing vehicle count).<p>That&#x27;s quite funny reading from my chair. I live in a small town in Scandinavia (~50.000 people in all of the county) and a quick count at Google maps show me that apparently there are more gas-stations here (<i>14 in a 5km radius from me - 5 inside the city limits itself</i>) than in &quot;large cities in North America&quot;.')
