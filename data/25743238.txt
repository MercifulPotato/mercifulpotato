It may be so in Analytic Philosophy but that&#x27;s far from the only way of philosophy.<p>Many great philosophers are famous for being terse and that only adds to depth because of the possibility of interpretation and further thinking, which is what philosophy is all about (not to deliver answers).<p>Compare Heraclitus and Parmenides for two ancient philosophers who may be understood as two fundamentally different ways of thinking with their famous quotes &quot;panta rhei&quot; (everything flows, Heraclitus) and &quot;and it is all one for me&quot; (Parmenides).')
