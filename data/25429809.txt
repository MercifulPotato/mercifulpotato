Item(by='jamil7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608036798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429434, text='&gt; Cross-platform never meant &quot;just an iphone and a mac os with the correct version&quot;. SwiftUI looks like a very cool tech, but it isn&#x27;t &quot;cross-platform&quot;, period.<p>It might be crappy marketing spin but it&#x27;s hard to call anything other than the web cross-platform by that definition. It&#x27;s not just iPhone and a Mac either, it&#x27;s every Apple platform that has a screen. I don&#x27;t think Flutter or React Native can claim that despite being called cross-platform.')
