Is that because given the same <i>reference</i>, the function could yield different outputs? Or because it could be mutated concurrently? Would that imply  every function that takes a mutable data structure will be impure?<p>Edit: I just noticed that `List.toArray` -- which just returns a new array, so no concern over references or mutation -- is also marked as impure. This seemed wrong to me, but then I noticed that even `Array.new()` is marked impure. To my mind, a function that allocates a new mutable collection is itself not inherently impure.')
