The typical ones you&#x27;ll find are very energy inefficient, intentionally loud, but move relatively little air. They&#x27;re also probably caked in dust further reducing effectiveness. While you&#x27;re at it, make sure the fan is not venting into your attic space (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any climate where that&#x27;s still acceptable, but could be wrong).')
