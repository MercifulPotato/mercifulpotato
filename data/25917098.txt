And they are pretty stable. They are measured via the Zeeman effect, and show complex very strong magnetic fields (0.1 Tesla and higher). These fields require gigantic electric currents to be sustained. ( I= M*R^2 , with extreme large radius I= +-10^10 Ampere)<p>According to the mainstream astronomers, the magnetic should point outward. And this means that the currents must go around the sunspots. And we do not see any of such surrounding currents, nor do we have any idea where they could be.<p>Magnetism near moving conductors causes eddy-currents, which reduce the magnetic fields. So moving neutral plasma can never be the driver of such magnetic fields.<p>Yet, there is a clear solution.  \nThe sunspots have lines of plasma moving outwards or inwards.  \nAnd these plasma lines are able to conduct strong currents easily.<p>So instead of a vertical magnetic field, we have a horizontal magnetic field around the plasma currents. And these plasma currents are conducting large amount of electricity like lightning.<p>It is also in line with the behaviour of solar flares.  \nSome flares behave like plasma rail guns.  \nWhich works exactly as I explained.')
