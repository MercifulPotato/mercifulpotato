Which is generally going to be the benefits&#x2F;results rather than the features&#x2F;artifacts.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s very easy to talk about benefits that no one really cares about. Or to talk about them in such a way that they don&#x27;t see how it applies to them, or why it might be important or impactful in their lives.<p>So that&#x27;s why I prefer my way of thinking over &quot;benefits &gt; features&quot;. To me, it&#x27;s a more complete way of looking at it.<p>With regards to funnels, you&#x27;re 100% correct of course. But they&#x27;re not always available, and many different groups of people with different needs, interests, and beliefs can (and do) end up on the same funnel path. You can keep breaking your funnel into every more refined steps, to be as specific as possible, but then you run into the issue of people giving up because you&#x27;ve asked too much of them before asking for the sale.<p>For example, the landing pages for those M1 Macs. What would you do to make sure you know more about your audience before telling them about the product? Are you going to put a series of questionnaires ahead of the content? The content there has to work for pretty much everybody.')
