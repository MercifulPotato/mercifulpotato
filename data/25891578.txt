You&#x27;re right for some people but you&#x27;re missing a much bigger voter block: the lazy and jealous.<p>A shit tonne of brits haven&#x27;t done much with their lives. They&#x27;ve just sat and grumbled that their job doesn&#x27;t pay enough (while refusing to work harder or change employer or get a qualification).<p>At the same time, for the last 30 years anyone who worked hard, invested, got skills, started businesses etc has been rewarded.<p>The first group are really upset they&#x27;re being left out. That&#x27;s why you get all this talk about mysterious &quot;elites&quot;.<p>The first group voted for brexit to fuck with people just trying to get on. They&#x27;re actually very pleased that those companies are struggling and their workers are suffering. The first group would never have started a small business exporting to the EU. They&#x27;d have stayed in the pub moaning over stale lager.<p>This is result (and many more to come) is exactly what many brexiteers wanted and voted for: a fuck you for trying hard.')
