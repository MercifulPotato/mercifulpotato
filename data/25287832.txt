Now where that price point is, I don&#x27;t know! (25%? 50%? no idea)<p>It seems the smart meter issue is almost unrelated though. Where I am (UK, potentially where you are too as it looks like a similar issue), the old feed-in tariff subsidised the energy _generated_ by a system, regardless of if you used the energy yourself or exported the energy. That&#x27;s great to kick-start an economy but doesn&#x27;t scale at a national level.<p>I understand they are trying to push to pay for what is exported by houses only. I&#x27;m a bit sad to see the old subvention gone as it made solar panel uneconomical in lots of situations, and there&#x27;s a lot to say about timing, but in principle I think it&#x27;s sound reasoning.')
