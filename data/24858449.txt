The problem is that some random YouTube channel, Facebook page or a lone idiot screaming on social media is not going to be less biased and partisan.<p>Trust is not an all-or-nothing proposition. I know that institutions and established media have systematic blind spots and an agenda, and I think everyone with some critical thinking skills should know that, too. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that there is no value to news, it means that maybe you should read from multiple sources, try to correct for known biases, ask critical questions etc.<p>Amplifying vox populi isn&#x27;t the solution here.<p>(Also, empirically, while trust in media and institutions has eroded, I don&#x27;t believe that &quot;most&quot; people don&#x27;t trust institutions. Maybe that&#x27;s the case in the US, but certainly not everywhere.)')
