The hay day of build happened starting in 2005 and ran for the last 15 years leading up to where it is now.  I lived in the Northloop on the front of the trendiness (pre-Target Stadium) and Uptown was still the land of said &quot;hipsters&quot; (such an unfortunate moniker).  I can tell you that in 2010 I was paying more than $2000&#x2F;month for a 2 bedroom there because supply was much more constrained.  Now there&#x27;s easily 20x availability of options.
