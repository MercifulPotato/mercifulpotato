It&#x27;s an ad hominem distraction from the substance of the argument.<p>As for the claim that Borat is &quot;nearly the most racist movie in history,&quot; that shows the author&#x27;s ignorance of film history and the thousands of very racist films that have been made worldwide. One could argue that Borat is racist, and there would be plenty of points to debate, but there are many many more racist movies in American film history (Birth of a Nation, Song of the South, the entire blaxploitation genre) - not to mention plenty of racist non-American films.')
