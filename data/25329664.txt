They were salves for symptoms by people who drastically underestimated the scope of the problem. They also seemed to have no idea how to engineer lasting solutions (because those are expensive and boring).<p>Vaccines are an actual solution, though. They, in part with huge amounts of boring, un-sexy political action, can end the pandemic.<p>So no, vaccines aren&#x27;t solutionism, because they actually solve the problem, in a big, expensive and boring way')
