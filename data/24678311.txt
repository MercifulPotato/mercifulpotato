Item(by='foldr', descendants=None, kids=[24678553], score=None, time=1601812514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678034, text='There is clearly no technical reason for Scott&#x27;s involvement in the first place, as Troy could just have created an account himself using any photo whatsoever. The whole post is structured as a joke about the idea of Scott being gay and having a Grindr account.<p>Do I think Troy is a raging homophobe? No. But his initial response to my comment was to claim that he chose the photo because it looked like a typical Grindr profile photo (!), rather than to just admit that it was a joke. That doesn&#x27;t increase my confidence that the photo was chosen with good intentions. You apparently think that there is another explanation for the choice of photo relating to some inside baseball between Troy and Scott (which I frankly don&#x27;t care about, not knowing either of these guys). If that is the real reason then Troy could just have said so himself.<p>In general, making in-jokes in public blog posts that anyone can read doesn&#x27;t always go over so well. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;Troy is a class A homophobe and must be deleted from the internet&quot;. I&#x27;m just registering that I&#x27;m one gay dude who is bored of this kind of gay joke.')
