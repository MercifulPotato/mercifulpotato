I was ad-blocking anyway, but if we only consume free things, then we should expect to be exploited in some way by the websites we consume.  The family subscription is $18&#x2F;month, and I am also spending about $30&#x2F;month on patreon support.<p>I&#x27;m hoping as a paying customer the company&#x2F;providers will take my needs more seriously than the people who they have to milk for attention. It very likely won&#x27;t make a bit of difference unless enough people do the same, and I have little hope of that happening. Most people would rather complain about free stuff than pay for anything.')
