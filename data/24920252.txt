There&#x27;s apparently 144M podcast listeners in the US, so you need 0.34% of that population to purchase your product each year. That may be an aggressive assumption, but investors also may think &#x27;podcasts are a huge and growing market, even if this idea isn&#x27;t the one that works out, there&#x27;s a lot of potential in the &quot;podcast creation&quot; space&#x27;')
