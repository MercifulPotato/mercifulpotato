In particular, he complained about the large number of packages that require patches to work with LibreSSL and the constant stream of regressions that the project must deal with.</i><p>That about sums it up.  The LibreSSL developers decided not to maintain even source compatibility, let alone binary compatibility.  If application authors don&#x27;t want the maintenance burden of supporting extra code paths for both, and distribution maintainers aren&#x27;t happy keeping patchsets up to date, then that&#x27;s about it.<p>And it sounds like OpenSSL is in much <i>much</i> better shape (both the code and the community around it) than when LibreSSL forked.  This is a good thing!  It means all the concern raised after Heartbleed actually functioned as intended, and turned OpenSSL into a healthy project.<p>I think it&#x27;s also a good thing that LibreSSL continues to exist and that it is used in some of the BSDs.  Having competing, well-maintained implementations is great, even if they&#x27;re not drop-in replacements for each other.  If OpenSSL falls into disrepair again, it means that an alternative is already available, even if there are switching costs.')
