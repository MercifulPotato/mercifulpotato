You need shift for numbers. I can do the numbers fine but it took a while.<p>Not sure I’d recommend it though, need to learn normal Dvorak for use on other computers where you can’t install a keyboard.<p>I can’t look at the keyboard. If I do I’m instantly confused. And I can’t use a Dvorak view on mobile - just looks too different. Maybe I should try again...')
