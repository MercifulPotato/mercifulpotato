The rest of my family still has Fitbits and I still prefer Fitbit for what it does (and the battery life).  That said, in the wake of this announcement two people just got an Apple Watch ordered as an upcoming birthday gift because I don&#x27;t think having Fitbits is a good idea anymore.<p>Google is not a company that respects their users.  It&#x27;s that simple.  Apple doesn&#x27;t respect developers, but it does respect users.  Google respects neither.  I&#x27;d say the current situation in tech is not especially positive for users generally, but having a product tied to Google, Facebook, or Amazon would be your worst case scenario, and I&#x27;m actively trying to excise these products from my life.')
