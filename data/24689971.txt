(I&#x27;m a newbie at CT.  Sorry if that&#x27;s a dumb question.)<p>FWIW, I suspect that Joy is as good way as any to provide (2).  You could implement a basis set of primitive functions and combinators in each different programming system.<p>As for (1) part of what got me into Prolog was the work done on compiling using it.  I&#x27;ve actually come to believe that syntax is a macguffin, a kind of blind alley.  I have no idea what to use though, C?, LLVM IR?, etc.  I&#x27;ve been toying with Prof. Wirth&#x27;s Oberon RISC CPU as a target.<p>I&#x27;d like to go the other way too: translate existing code into categorical forms.  (Then do fun things like refactoring, etc...)')
