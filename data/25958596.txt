I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s Facebook or Bob the window washer, they shouldn&#x27;t be tracking me this way without permission.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t agree that this is going to broadly affect small businesses. I accept that it&#x27;s possible a few businesses in some places will be hit, but there isn&#x27;t a ton of evidence that it&#x27;s going to have a broad impact. Facebook still has massive profiles of users to provide a broad set of ad targeting tools.<p>The hair dresser down the corner isn&#x27;t going to lose sleep over this. Nor is my favorite taqueria or sandwich shop.')
