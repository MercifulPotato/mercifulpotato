Rarely do people get banned for going after &quot;the other&quot;. Most of these people get banned for going after mainstream journalists and politicians. Many don&#x27;t get banned for going after anyone at all. And many get shadow banned without any notice or explanation.<p>Secondly, I don&#x27;t think people on the right consider what people like Milo (for instance) do to be performative cruelty. They see it as exposing hypocrisy. They see it as exercising their god-given right to free speech.')
