What you write in this post is too general, sure if you have to release your microservices as one mega monolith, then it feels like an easy choice. When your application is not suited for microservices there are still things that can be easier:  updating dependencies because of security is usually easier if the whole code base needs it. So it all depends on the application, what kind of development work does it need in a ten year frame, etc.<p>I really do not recommend big monoliths, but the most important this is that it should be easy to start development, that is usually easier with microservices. I feel your pain the automation really only starts to matter when you are above 40 services in my view.')
