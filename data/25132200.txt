If that&#x27;s the sentiment on a community with downvotes and a strong culture of &quot;we just care about the technical issues&quot;, imagine the sentiment on a team considering adopting it.<p>FWIW I will never proactively advocate for this DB or try it out because I don&#x27;t want other coworkers to feel squicked. I&#x27;ll do my job if I find myself on a team using it, of course, but in my many years working on software, I&#x27;ve found that you can&#x27;t make the computers happy unless the people typing into the computers are happy. Limiting the pool of people who can be happy reading CockroachDB docs when they&#x27;re paged at 2am for an outage seems not worth the chance that it might page us at 2am slightly less.')
