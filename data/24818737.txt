If we don&#x27;t treat a company like the collection of adults they should be, and hold them to a higher standard of collective action, then it&#x27;s no wonder why the world looks more like a corporatocracy every day.<p>The fee extracted should not only be much higher, but should also be leveraged to provide relief for the wronged.')
