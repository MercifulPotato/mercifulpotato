While memory management is important for the latter, the former doesn&#x27;t like any dynamically allocated memory at all.<p>Also many processor manufacturers have hundreds of different models with similar but different port mappings. They often supply C-header files which helps making your software compatible with numerous different processor types. So even while Rust has a macro system, it would need to be adapted by those manufacturers or C will likely stay the more convenient choice for the time being.')
