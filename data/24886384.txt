Instead of trusting each company to implement their own billing system with some payment processor, just have the payment processors and banks provide &quot;apps&quot; that support these protocols, and users can chose which one to use to complete their payment.<p>One interesting follow up question in who covers the processing fee (e.g. the ~3% or so that Braintree or Paypal currently take)? Today, processing fees are mostly hidden to the user. If the user can chose their own payment processor, will they be required to cover the processing fee instead of the merchant?')
