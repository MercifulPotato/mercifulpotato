So it&#x27;s not much use as a thought experiment, other than to show that it might be interesting to study it in the real world.<p>I.e. it might be &quot;obvious&quot; to you that focus on quantity over quality leads to better quality as assessed by another in the thought experiment.  But it might be equally &quot;obvious&quot; to someone else the other way.<p>A real study would be interesting, because there might be a real world consistent pattern.  It might actually be useful to know which one works best for real.')
