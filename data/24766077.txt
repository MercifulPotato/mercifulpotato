This entire article is a classic example of Computer Science failure. It&#x27;s someone who knows program optimisation in the abstract and nothing about the actual target problem from a domain knowledge perspective. They went about optimising bad code as in quality of thought level, rather than actually getting to grips with the true requirement first. Though perhaps a computer science win, but a software engineer fail.')
