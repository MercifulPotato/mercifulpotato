I&#x27;ve ditched Chrome for good as Firefox is just as good and I feel less creeped out.<p>I think the era of &quot;free stuff for your data&quot; is over. People have witnessed the true cost of a zero barrier social network services which is the division of society and people creating their own realities and clashing with others (ex. flat earthers, trump etc.)<p>Going forward I expect lot of these decentralized, run-by-donations services to trend upwards.
