I recently did a two-day workshop on negotiation as well, and it was invigorating and really got me jazzed up about my job. I&#x27;m a manager, so I spend a lot of time negotiating with other teams and with external vendors, and negotiating with my employees vs my peers vs my superiors is also a skill I needed to hone. The workshop itself really let me see what was happening under the hood.<p>It was a really great thing and I highly recommend it to everyone.')
