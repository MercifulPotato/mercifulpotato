Any help to game players is typically an unintended side effect and often results in changing the rules.<p>For gamification to actually provide benefits to game players, the game designers need to first be truly vested in improving aspects for the players of the game, not for meta goals outside the game. The second you see a process turned into some game&#x2F;point system, ask yourself how that system could benefit the owner&#x2F;designer of that system. Chances are, a meta goal exists and some sort of resource extraction from players exist (time, money, effort, knowledge, etc.).<p>If you understand a game very well and a weakness exists, it&#x27;s possible for the players to extract winnings outside the game back to themselves but they need to understand the metagame and a weakness needs to exist that is realistically attainable. Game designers&#x2F;owners are at an advantage because the game designers are often positioned to patch the rules of the game as weaknesses are discovered and exploited while the game players have no such power to adjust the rules.')
