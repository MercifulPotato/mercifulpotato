Sucks for them I suppose, it&#x27;s of course an easy mistake to make.<p>People have sat by and watched for 4 years and did nothing whilst Trump worked to erode institutions, culminating in the American people democratically voting in a free and fair election to oust President Trump.  The reaction to that was an attempted fascist coup.  Clearly doing nothing has failed catastrophically.  Perhaps there are more optimal solutions to this attack on democracy, but the posters here clutching their pearls over what is a relatively light response to an attempted coup should spare the rest of us the faux outrage.')
