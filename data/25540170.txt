If complex systems were impossible to model science wouldn’t be a thing.<p>Sure, the “new variant” narrative is an easy one to pick up because it’s superficially understandable; but what other complex interactions are resulting in a new strain becoming dominant over an existing one?<p>Do we just sit on our hands and go, well gee, better do nothing? Guess it’s just too hard to know what to do at this point...<p>There <i>is</i> a typical government fallacy that to be seen doing <i>something</i> is better than nothing, even when it’s the wrong thing... I get it, that’s bad.<p>...but this is a case where doing nothing has been a colossal disaster so far; and it’s extremely clear what the result of doing nothing different will be if the new variant hypothesis is correct.<p>So it’s a risk game. Is the cost * probability of A vs B a better choice?<p>You’re saying the probability is not known at this point because systems are complicated.<p>So what? It’s still clear to me that it’s <i></i>very likely<i></i> that something is happening, even if exactly what it is, is unclear.<p>You can still build a risk matrix taking that into account.')
