Item(by='msabalau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606152000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185468, text='I&#x27;m a volunteer for this vaccine, in the first month I have three in-patients visits, involving two inoculations, 6 blood draws, 2 Covid tests, and three nasal absorption tests. My first visit lasted a little over three hours including a very comprehensive medical history and physical exam, and time taken to ensure that I was giving truely informed consent. I interacted with three medical professionals on the first visit, sometimes in the exam room, and sometimes via phone from the exam room to protect each other from long in person indoor exposure. Like any medical visit this year, a considerable amount of PPE was used.  I was given an app use daily to record my health, and a digital thermometer so that all subjects are using the same calibrated equipment. Having reported a headache two days in a row in the app, there was a remote phone call follow up by a research clinician, in addition to the planned check in phone calls that I haven&#x27;t mentioned.  They <i>do</i> pay me a very modest ammount, so I&#x27;ve bought myself a couple of ebooks after paying for big city parking near the research clinic.  They need to pay for that office space.  Before I entered the study I needed to interact with recruiters, to qualify that it was safe enough for me to participate and to ensure that they were getting people from a variety of backgrounds. They needed to be ready to respond if I had a severe adverse reaction to the the trial vaccine.  There is an entirely separate independent  review board that I can go to with questions. In the event that I had Covid symptoms, there is an entirely separate set of assessments, visits and samples taken.<p>Given the amount of work being done by this and other research labs hired Astrazeneca, and comparing this to quotes I&#x27;ve received for a very modest UX usability studies, it&#x27;s hard to see see this an sort of money grab.')
