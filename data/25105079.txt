I think there are a lot of reasons why electronic voting is preferable to paper ballots, just that the reasons disqualifying electronic voting are complicated problems to solve.<p>In my county, paper ballots are used (used to use electronic booths) and the form is printed in English, Spanish, Korean, and Vietnamese. Hypothetically an electronic ballot has no issues with localizing to an infinite number of languages without regards to costs of printing out separate ballots. Electronic voting isn&#x27;t impeded by the restrictions of paper. It could have rich media, sound, videos, etc.<p>Accessibility is another potential advantage. Right now with paper ballots the expected procedure for voting as a person who is unable to use the ballot is to have a family member fill it out for them. Electronic voting means that you can make accommodations for all sorts of disabilities and special needs while still allowing the person to vote without the need for a proxy.<p>Electronic voting could be more convenient than in person paper ballots. Hypothetically if a person could vote online on their phone, the process would be more convenient and more people may vote. It also makes it easier to vote for people that are traditionally disenfranchised due to time constraints of voting in person (they can&#x27;t afford to go to the polls, even if there exists laws that require employers to allow for time to go vote on election day). It also limits avenues for voter intimidation.<p>Finally, electronic voting would (hypothetically) be instantaneous and accurate. It isn&#x27;t dependent on humans for counting. There isn&#x27;t really a potential for &#x27;hanging chad&#x27; incidents. We&#x27;d know the victors of an election as soon as polls close.<p>The issue is unfortunately all of these advantages don&#x27;t really outweigh the issues that we don&#x27;t have good solutions for (yet, or maybe ever).<p>Electronic voting isn&#x27;t tamper proof. Having open source voting software doesn&#x27;t really help verify that the software that you say is running is what actually is running. If it is exploited, it is much easier to tamper with electronic votes than it is paper ones. If it is online, that opens it up to even larger issues of exploitation.<p>There&#x27;s no way to verify that what you intend to vote for is how you actually voted according to the machine. With a paper ballot there is tangible proof of how you voted, while that doesn&#x27;t exist on a purely electronic vote.<p>Paper ballots have their own set of issues, but they are manageable compared to the current limitations we have for dealing with electronic voting.')
