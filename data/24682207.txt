Large and delivery based companies will have the capacity to survive, whilst smaller companies don&#x27;t. I see small companies &amp; stores as proving some of the variety &amp; creativity which drive innovation. Larger companies can be creative but often have uniformity in their approaches.<p>But I&#x27;m trying to be positive as some large companies are under pressure to adapt and in the recovery there may be new opportunities which smaller businesses are best placed to fill. At least until they&#x27;re bought up by the big companies.')
