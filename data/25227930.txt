It is so insanely expensive and complicated to make quality cheese on scale that we might as well not bother. You need a specific cows which cost as much as a Mercedes, eating a specific food which may not be available or available too far with prohibitive transportation cost, living in a specific conditions (where a personnel entering looks more like entering an Umbrella corp facility), requiring a specific highly regulated facilities around (e.g. butchery), you need to have all production line sterile and clean, nothing can be reused even from another line, and all that&#x27;s just the milk part. Then we need some extremely complicated facility to grow cheese and it may fail anyway because some parameter was off.<p>PS: the takedown notice is stupid of course')
