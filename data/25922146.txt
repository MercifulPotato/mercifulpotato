Things like metal detectors are used to more or less guess that a detected object is in fact a gas line or something, GPS location is recorded, then someone plays connect the dots in CAD. It&#x27;s unreal. So many opportunities to introduce error, and the initial locating of the underground object could easily be incorrect.<p>I know newer infrastructure is more diligently recorded, but there is a TON of old crap in the ground ready to be ripped up.')
