It&#x27;s juste the perfect amount of lightweight but with just all the features I need to be productive.<p>But at the end of the day there are always those 10+ people projects, or hard debugging case, where a heavy computing-intensive IDE figguring stuff out for you is worth every cent.<p>Anyway my general point is make sure your tool suits you, if you spend more than 5 minutes fighting against it every day it doesn&#x27;t, you either need training on it or to change it.')
