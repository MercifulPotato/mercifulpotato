I was that guy who quit Facebook back in 2008 when it was <i>really</i> uncool to do so. But I really don&#x27;t understand why they are being blamed for recent events.<p>What, in particular, has Facebook done to encourage this kind of behaviour? Are we really going to blame them for making it easier for people to be heard and to find other like-minded people to communicate with?<p>What we are witnessing is a societal problem. It&#x27;s possibly a new problem, or maybe just one that has never been seen at such large scale. But all that&#x27;s being done about is the oldest trick in the book: scapegoating.<p>I get it. It&#x27;s a huge and complex problem and it&#x27;s easier to focus one entity and call it the enemy. But we can do better than this. All we&#x27;ll achieve by blaming Facebook is less free speech. Is that really the best solution here? Again? This has been tried so many times before.')
