I&#x27;ve read big chunks of the Environmental Impact Report for the major downsize that happened in SF in the late 70s. That EIR specifically called out that the downzone would make SF much more expensive in the future if we didn&#x27;t shift to redeveloping much of the industrialized parts of SF.<p>That redevelopment didn&#x27;t really happen, and now we&#x27;re left with this result.<p>The really unfortunate thing is because of the artificially restricted housing supply (and commercial, thanks Prop M) it ends up creating these perverse incentives. I would think that normally if you have an industry that&#x27;s growing really well, and creating tons of high paying jobs, you&#x27;d want them in your city.  But, because we combined a strictly limited supply with great growth in high paying jobs, the reaction is to be hostile to those high paying jobs.')
