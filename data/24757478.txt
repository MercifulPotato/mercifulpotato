I think it’s interesting to compare and contrast the two countries that have done best with this: China and New Zealand. China is high control and high trust (mostly) and well controlled border , New Zealand is like mid to low control but <i>very</i> high trust, and it has a perfectly defined and controlled border.<p>US is (broadly) low control, low trust, net importer with large land borders and neighboring countries by sea, so it’s a much harder problem even if you had consistent messaging and planning from the top.')
