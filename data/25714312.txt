I don&#x27;t know what you mean.<p>Government&#x27;s goal is to implement whatever governance is decided to be best to manage people.<p>You say a mob stormed congress.  I saw a dramatic event, that justifies a lot of authoritarian actions to be undertaken on others.  Including de-platforming the president!  Isn&#x27;t that amazing?<p>Other dramatic events are perfectly fine, of course, such as the BLM protests.<p>Why is that?  The answer for me is that some protests suit the governance agenda, and some don&#x27;t.  A message needs to be given to indicate rightthink and wrongthink.<p>I think you must believe that the government (lights, camera) &#x27;action&#x27; you see on TV are far more than a simple soap opera intended to distract you.  Perhaps you believe that one side is &#x27;good&#x27; and the other &#x27;bad&#x27;.  If that&#x27;s it, you are falling for the good cop&#x2F;bad cop routine, and being sold down the river by both sides.<p>(I don&#x27;t mind moderation - but what we have on HN is no room for free thinking, consensus opinion wins the day.  Was I really posting too much, was I undertaking a DDOS attack?  Or was my opinion, if reasoned, unpopular and not to be heard.  Let me know.)')
