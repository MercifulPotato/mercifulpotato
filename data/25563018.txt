They added them back with the A13, and then improved them for the M1. These are primarily focused on machine learning <i>training</i> where you do backpropagation through huge matrix operations.<p>They provide a very wide coverage library set that works on all supported platforms optimally. You interact with AMX through those libraries, and direct usage is considered unsupported. Apple may completely change it with the next iteration, where they can just change those libraries and every arm&#x27;s-length application will get those benefits for free.<p>Apple sells whole systems. They aren&#x27;t selling CPUs for third parties, and there is no reason they need to encourage their own proprietary extensions. Indeed, it would be more evil if they were asking people to pepper their own code with this, instead of just using libraries that abstract you from the magic.<p>As a tiny, tiny vendor in the computing space -- as HN often assures us -- I&#x27;m not seeing the great evil many are claiming.')
