By structuring your code properly.<p>Per your example, your Client instance still has to be passed around everywhere it&#x27;s needed, and you call client.push_data() on it; in FP or imperative approaches, you would pass around a Client struct or tuple or similar, and call push_data(client).<p>OO just bundles state and functions together, as fields and methods on an object. Which has its pros, and its cons.')
