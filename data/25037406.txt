Seriously, we need to start aiming much higher.   If this was &quot;My 1hr a day side project hitting $1kMRR in 12months&quot;, then it&#x27;s impressive.   But I often see these non side projects and I just want to voice that it&#x27;s absolutely not impressive.<p>If you started a business mowing lawn, cutting hair, you better be way past $1K revenue in 6 months.   If you&#x27;re fully committed to building a startup and 100% vested in it, even $10k a month isn&#x27;t impressive after 24 months.  MY OPINION.    If you&#x27;re that skilled and can&#x27;t figure out how to make money fast, you really might be better of leetcoding and getting a job at one of the FAANGs or well paying SV companies.')
