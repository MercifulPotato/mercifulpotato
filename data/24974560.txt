For basic set up like getting a few servers done behind a load balancer and a database - sure - and I&#x27;d argue that services like DigitalOcean and Linode are actually easier to set up than AWS for basic services.<p>To actually do more advanced stuff (the thing that AWS is good for) and utilize tools such as Terraform, you&#x27;d essentially need to hire engineers that are experts in AWS in addition to engineers who can do devops, as there&#x27;s only so much &quot;magic&quot; AWS can provide.')
