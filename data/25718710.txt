This would mean, say, that if the Soviets rightly criticized the US, we ought to assume the criticism was founded on a lie or invalid for other reasons.<p>Itâ€™s this error in my opinion we see just as much of. Just as much as Trump is able to influence the beliefs of his followers, he is able to induce beliefs in his haters, by causing them to become certain of the truth of the opposing claim. We should address both problems: ignoring one or the other will just lead to further destabilization.')
