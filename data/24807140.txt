That only makes sense if the company’s alternative is to hire a <i>new</i> employee at the Kansas City wage rate - but that option was never on the table. The choice is between retaining an existing employee that you’ve been happy to pay a current NYC wage.<p>If you could have hired a Kansas City employee to do the same job for less pay, that would have already been reflected in the previous salary negotiations when you instead decided it was worth it to pay more to hire the NYC person.<p>That person choosing to live in a different location has no effect on anything - everything that led you to the original choice to pay them a higher wage remains true.')
