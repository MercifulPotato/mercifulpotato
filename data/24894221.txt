Item(by='jmiskovic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603703960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893183, text='Writing is huge help for me. One issue I have (a perfectionist streak?) is that I tend to treat written things as a wiki-style knowledge garden system. This is a huge time sink. Whenever I want to add some detail I have to re-read whole structure and figure out where I want it, and I have desire to correct or restructure dozen things I wrote before. The pay-off I get from such system is not great because it&#x27;s just mirroring the information I already know.<p>I now use a system that&#x27;s more like diary. Some notes are relevant for single day, others for a week. Anything older than that, I treat mostly as read-only. I&#x27;m ok with repeating myself over and over. It sets the context for thinking and decisions, and allows me to modify and correct assumptions over time. At the moment I use Trilium Notes for this, but still exploring other options. I would love something that includes diagrams and mind maps.<p>Unexpected benefit is that when I work while distracted and unmotivated, writing down each step and outcome allows me to stay on track and slowly make progress. Context switching becomes easier.')
