In reality though, speed can only ever be measured relative to some other point, so if you&#x27;re an astronaut freely floating in space, you can&#x27;t make any definitive statement about your absolute speed because there is no such thing.<p>Another thing that we are used to experiencing is a uniform flow of time - you and I can both synchronize our watches and believe that we&#x27;re reading the same time even if we&#x27;re on opposite sides of the globe. This is in fact only true in a very limited set of circumstances, and generally speaking not the case. Just as there is no such thing as absolute speed (or more properly, velocity), there is also no such thing as absolute time.<p>Special relativity stipulates that light always travels at c in every reference frame; this is not a discovery of relativity but a prerequisite of it, and a key insight that allowed Einstein and friends to explain things that had previously been inexplicable. The explanation for this, as others have commented, comes from general relativity, and is due to the interconnection between space and time - space-time - such that every non-accelerating thing is moving at the speed of light through time (whatever that means). The speed of light is therefore not so much the speed of photons, as it is that photons move at the speed of time. Something like that I think - this is beyond the scope of my brain to explain!<p>So why aren&#x27;t your photons moving at &quot;190% the speed of light&quot;? In our normal life, we think of time as fixed, and velocity as variable; in reality, the speed of light is fixed, and time is the variable. What changes for a &#x27;stationary&#x27; observer is not the speed of the incoming photons, but some time-related factor - their frequency. This is (a simplified explanation) of redshift, that led Hubble to theorise that the Universe is expanding. Everything is moving away from us emitting light, and since the velocity of light is fixed, it&#x27;s the colour that appears to change.<p>A note about the notion of velocities adding up - in fact they don&#x27;t ever, exactly. That they appear to is an approximation due to the enormous velocities needed before you would notice any difference. This is another consequence of relativity. Likewise synchronizing clocks - we can get so close that we couldn&#x27;t measure any difference, but it would be insanely impractical to set and keep totally synchronous time.<p>(source: physics-related undergrad some years ago - I stand to be corrected on any of the above :-)')
