Don&#x27;t write any line of code before getting payment.<p>You can accomplish very much with current available tooling.<p>If your project requires some sort of implementation, don&#x27;t spent more than two weeks on it. You could create landing and forms using services as typeform and others. Then gather several hundreds of signups and talk to this people.<p>The failing rate is high and last thing you want is to spend 2 years on validating your idea.<p>As a technical founder it&#x27;ll be hard to avoid hacking right away but the coding skill is required only if you get after validation stage.<p>Try to come up with idea per day, then at the end of the month pick most promising and validate it.')
