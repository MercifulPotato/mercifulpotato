It would leave intact google&#x27;s ability to provide useful services that Tim Bray and others like, whilst redressing the economic tidal wave that flows google&#x27;s way, for the better.<p>How would this work?  There are many possibilities.  Here are just 2, one of them individualistic and consumer oriented, the other social and community oriented:<p>1.  Google gives coupons to users as compensation for harvesting their metadata.  So if a user performs say 5000 google searches per year, google gives them coupons for say $500 which they can redeem on purchases made with vendors who advertise through google.<p>2.  Google funds journalism by paying the metadata harvesting fee into a trust administered by an independent org that facilitates journalism.  Like PBS or the BBC but not owned by the British Government, owned independently by a worldwide org that is affiliated with journalists associations.<p>The logic behind #2 is that pre-google, advertising revenue funded the news business.  Post-google, the news business has shrunk by more than 50% of journalists and so the quality of the 4th estate has suffered.')
