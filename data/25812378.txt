Please note that there are various things you pay for, let&#x27;s take a look at several of those:<p>- provisioned resources (instances, including the ones under relational databases or other stuff like that)<p>- usage of on-demand resources like AWS Lambda and API Gateway<p>- infrastructure such as load balancers (kind of mix of provisioned and pay-per-use)<p>- persistent storage (which is all over the place in terms of payment methods)<p>While you could shut down the first three to save some money, would you like to remove your data permanently?<p>So far all mechanisms that are available are mostly reactive (billing alarms etc) rather than proactive (service quotas although they are meant to shield from poor design rather than a typo in terraform).
