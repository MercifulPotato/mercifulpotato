They can actually write well, spell correctly, etc, so the ‘technical’ aspects were very easy – there were very few typos, ungrammatical sentences, etc. Instead, I found myself looking for things like<p>* situations where the PoV character knew things that were actually hidden from them in the plot (e.g. something happening simultaneously in a different location)<p>* situations where characters acted unexpectedly out-of-character for no obvious reason<p>* places where the timeline or scene jumped unexpectedly (e.g. in successive paragraphs in the \nsame chapter)<p>* phrases that were overused<p>* whether something that was supposed to be a surprise for the reader had actually been signposted.<p>I’d love to know if there is a checklist of issues for fiction writing in general: not standard plots &#x2F; characters &#x2F; etc, but mistakes like those above to look out for. (I certainly didn’t find it in the article).')
