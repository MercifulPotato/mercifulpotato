It is also meant to prevent you from spreading COVID to others. Hence an argument &quot;It&#x27;s my safety so it should be my choice&quot; is wrong, because it is not just your safety at stake here.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that it shouldn&#x27;t be your choice, but it does mean that there is a public stake in whether people get vaccinated. Certain people have medical reasons for opting out. I could see you having psychological reasons for the same. But that doesn&#x27;t necessarily extend to &quot;anyone can refuse vaccines for any reason&quot;.')
