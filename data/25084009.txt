Finally, perhaps, the program is outfitted with bindings to existing languages such as C.<p>&gt; An alternative to this is adopting a standard language as the macro language for a product. After our initial foray into the awful menu macro language that still burdens us, AutoCAD took this approach, integrating David Betzâ€™ XLISP, a simple Lisp interpreter which was subsequently extended by Autodesk to add floating point, many additional Common Lisp functions, and, eventually, access to the AutoCAD database.')
