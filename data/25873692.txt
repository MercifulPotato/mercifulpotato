No.  It&#x27;s going to be how are you going to get work&#x2F;school&#x2F;etc everyday (assuming you don&#x27;t work in Indianapolis).<p>EVs have an issue where most drivers have to own their own gas-station equivalent.  And people without the space to put a personal &quot;gas station&quot; can&#x27;t really own one.  At that point, they don&#x27;t give a damn whether they can drive to Indianapolis.<p>Solving the day-to-day charging problem for people without the space for personal charges will, as a side-effect, also solve the issue for driving long distances.  Because the issue with going long distances in an EV comes down to availability of charging.')
