For example, if a group A forms a union against working conditions at X, X makes concessions to a subset A&#x27; of A by highlighting arbitrary differences. This can result in conflict between A and A&#x27;. If A and A&#x27; cannot reconciliate, X wins. The standard divide and conquer tactic.<p>You can pick your example yourself, but race, sex, age, nationality, religion are prime examples of arbitrary differences not relevant to the topic or goals that brought a group together in the first place.<p>We evaluate public political discourse differently and I am not saying I am correct about it, but I do think that &quot;identity politics&quot; has caused massive rifts between political camps formerly working together.<p>I don&#x27;t have or want to produce formal evidence because it would just be counterproductive against my political position, but I think the picture is more clear than blurry.')
