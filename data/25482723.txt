A suggestion: support alternative payment processors besides Stripe.<p>I paid with cryptocurrency for the first time today when I realized my webhost accepted it in lieu of cash and that it had the lowest fees among all payment options.  For example, right now my webhost&#x27;s calculator says that for a $10 deposit there&#x27;s a 20 cent fee for a net deposit of $9.80 if I use &quot;Bitcoin&quot;.   (I actually have no Bitcoin and managed to pay anyway, because my webhost is using BitPay as a processor, which seems not to limit you to Bitcoin only.)<p>A product on Flurly right now using Stripe at the same price looks like it would be $10 - (2.9% + $0.30) - 1% for a net of $9.31 after net $0.69 fees.  Considering the example on Flurly&#x27;s homepage is $1, for this and the $10 example I gave and for other small payments, it&#x27;s obviously a better deal for sellers if buyers avoid using Stripe.  And it turned out to be easier to log in to Coinbase and pay with some giveaway coins I&#x27;d received than it would have been to pull out my credit card and fill in the info.')
