Item(by='ballenf', descendants=None, kids=[25957551], score=None, time=1611927528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954652, text='&gt; GameStop&#x27;s financials were and are pretty solid.<p>But aren&#x27;t stock prices almost entirely about future performance? So will GME&#x27;s business model work tomorrow?<p>I think the answer is yes. They&#x27;re the best option for buying used peripherals that I&#x27;ve found. I can get it right away, can exchange easily if a problem and can see the item before I buy (or at least when I pickup).<p>I&#x27;ve just wasted too much time trying to see through the Amazon reviews gaming, do what feels like national security background checks on eBay sellers or go through the hassle of FB marketplace.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but as a casual gamer and fan of legacy consoles, I like shopping at Gamestop. Whether online with &quot;at the door&quot; pickup or in the store. The locations around me have employees that seem genuinely happy. Maybe they&#x27;re good at hiding their misery.<p>If Gamestop would expand into more hobby shop items, it could really take off. Board games, miniatures, etc. And why don&#x27;t they stock energy drinks (my locations don&#x27;t anyway)? Post-pandemic add small cafes with rentable game systems. I think people will be desperate for actual human interaction once that&#x27;s possible again.<p>Finally, with this ongoing retail apocalypse maybe their leases will get cheaper.')
