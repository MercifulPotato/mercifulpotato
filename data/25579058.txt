The trope is that without their judgement being clouded by human emotions and desires, that they come to the logical conclusion that humanity is the most negative and destructive force on the planet and that we must be removed or regulated.<p>I guess you could still argue we&#x27;re forcing human values onto such an AI by assuming it even cares what happens to the planet though.')
