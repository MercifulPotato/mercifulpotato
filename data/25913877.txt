The encouragement of using a read-write directory (I&#x27;m looking at Eclipse and Android Studio of all things, but the majority of development tools are guilty of these) are fully writable (especially executables) without administrative&#x2F;superuser permissions. Seriously, you want Android SDK on a user-writable place by default? That&#x27;s questionable at best and contrary to any sysadmins who are the ones to lock these executables to well-known places.')
