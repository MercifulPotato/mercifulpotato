Complexity isn&#x27;t all that different here; personally I&#x27;d find something like the following to be simpler (I imagine others might disagree):<p><pre><code>  remove_list_entry(entry)\n  {\n      for (p = &amp;head; *p; p = &amp;(*p)-&gt;next)\n      {\n          if (*p == entry)\n          {\n              *p = entry-&gt;next;\n              break;\n          }\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nHowever, what the choice does objectively impact is performance. Being able to assume the object exists allows you to avoid checking against NULL, which removes instructions in the loop. I&#x27;d guess they anticipate this code might be called from performance-critical code, and that might be why they coded it like this.')
