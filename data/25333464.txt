Modern processors are extremely fast.<p>I disagree. At least in the datacenter there are still lots of workloads that are CPU bound. And many of these workloads are not easy to parallelize. Right now there are about a bajillion startups in a Python codebase that are hitting scaling limits, where the single-core GIL limits are starting to hurt responsiveness.<p>Yes, they could re-write into Go and get higher performance and better concurrency at the same time. But most orgs don&#x27;t have the bandwidth for re-building their software stack from scratch. They&#x27;d much rather throw money at hardware.<p>My guess is if you had a datacenter CPU with 2-3X the single-core threaded performance of top-level Xeons, it would sell like hotcakes.')
