Item(by='leobakerhytch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603064533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821292, text='GMBN has a couple of great videos on buying a mountain bike [0][1], but I can really recommend a direct to consumer brand such as Canyon or YT — especially if you’re not sure whether you’ll commit to the sport. You get a lot more bike for your money compared to the store brands, and you’ll have an easier time getting into the sport the better your first bike is.<p>The major choice to make, irrespective of brand, is what type of bike — which is dictated by the terrain you have available and would like to ride. There are subcategories, but a useful rough split would be: a cross-country (XC) bike for good pedaling performance both uphill and on the flat, but not so capable going downhill and in the rough stuff; an enduro if you want to ride rougher downhill terrain (roots, rock gardens, etc.), but still have a bike that pedals well enough up technical climbs and fire roads; and a downhill bike if you want to ride the roughest, most technical terrain, with the steepest descents, and you have access to lift-served mountains (not recommended to start with ;).<p>FWIW, I’ve had a such a great time riding the Canyon Torque this summer. It’s a long-travel enduro, really capable on the descents, and perfectly fine to get back to the top.<p>As for motivation, I would echo the sibling comment. Time in nature, good exercise, a ton of techniques to learn and master, a really sociable scene, such a rush riding tough and steep stuff. You won’t regret it.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EX1Kb6TEyn8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EX1Kb6TEyn8</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Y_xiq2mczX4A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Y_xiq2mczX4A</a>')
