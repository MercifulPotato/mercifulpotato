For example, if you tried to walk up to yourself in the past, would it feel like some force field stopping you? Or will it be false sense of agency, where you suddenly make the decision not to do something? Or will some event happen to simply kill you? Or will you suddenly vanish from this timeline to live out a life you over-wise would have based on the consequences of your actions?<p>If we are a result of a series of tiny influences from our environment, will the entire past refuse to be changed? Or will you be able to live out a version of a timeline where a different set of tiny influences add up to the same future where you make the same actions? As a result, does that also limit what you are actually able to do in the past without changing so much that one of these alternative states is impossible?<p>If the past doesn&#x27;t want to be changed, how about the future? Just because we perceive the clock running in one way, doesn&#x27;t mean that it actually does. I would think that if the past must happen in some specific way, then the present will always occur and so will a specific future. Whilst we claim to experience free-will, we have so far not measured it. I guess this is really the idea that the quantum realm simply consists of hidden variables that are only perceived as &#x27;random&#x27;, rather than actually having any form of random element.')
