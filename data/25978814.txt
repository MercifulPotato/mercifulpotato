Item(by='lhnz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612101169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969384, text='<p><pre><code>  &gt; &quot;Within the EU&quot; in this particular paragraph encompasses\n  &gt; the UK, so my reading of this is that if AstraZeneca \n  &gt; can&#x27;t deliver the Initial Europe Doses as it plans, \n  &gt; the Commission can propose alternative manufacturing \n  &gt; sites that include UK sites. Which seems to cover the\n  &gt; Commission&#x27;s current request that AstraZeneca use UK-made \n  &gt; doses to honour its commitment to deliver the \n  &gt; Initial Europe Doses (to its best reasonable efforts etc).\n</code></pre>\nYeah, I understand this mostly the same way, but my read is that while they can make such a request, AstraZeneca can choose not to do this and isn&#x27;t forced into taking away vaccines from one country contractually as part of &quot;best reasonable efforts&quot;.<p>IANAL also, but I have tried my best to avoid making my own interpretations, and have generally been relaying my understanding of comments by lawyers on Twitter (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ShipBrief&#x2F;status&#x2F;1355134952405397508" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ShipBrief&#x2F;status&#x2F;1355134952405397508</a>). Writing my initial comment kind of forced me into a rabbit-hole of reading what people were saying...')
