The GP described this scenario as being realistic, and the parent comment said that this seemed preferable to Big Tech acting without extensive regulation.<p>&gt; We have a system of justice ...<p>That&#x27;s irrelevant here, and there are probably far more people who are likely to lose their livelihoods if they post unpopular stuff about politics under their real name. I think that political content creators on YouTube supporting their family through money from their advertising program are an extreme edge-case, and they can always move to a new platform, whereas people in the former category would risk their non-political day-jobs and this would have a broader chilling effect across society at large.<p>And tell me how the solution to this problem could possibly be to give the government access to and control over the internet activity of every member of the population? What kind of dystopian nightmare would we be trying to create? Do you think that access to this level and breadth of data is likely to make future governments more or less authoritarian? Do you think it might attract more authoritarian figures into politics? Of course governments can surveil people currently, but in relatively limited numbers or with the cooperation of service providers, but I can&#x27;t imagine people seriously thinking that this would be a good idea, or maybe they haven&#x27;t thought through its practical implications.')
