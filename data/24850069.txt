They did do work on having clients with Internet access just bootstrap a roughly correct time from first principles, but I don&#x27;t know if Chrome&#x2F; Android do this out of the box.<p>Public Issuers generally backdate certificates by a small amount of time to allow for that one hour. This is permitted (unlike backdating to avoid other rules) by the Baseline Requirements, so you should find you don&#x27;t need to wait before using the certificates you are issued.')
