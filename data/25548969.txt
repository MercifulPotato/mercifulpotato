You could probably distinguish by running traceroute. Or doing something like curl <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;186.2.163.219" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;186.2.163.219</a> --header &quot;host: sci-hub.se&quot; -k (which should not send an SNI that can be sniffed but still send the corect host header inside the encrypted http stream so the connection would work minus a cert failure, but DPI by the isp wouldnt be able to detect. If that curl fails they are probably doing ip address hijacking. If domain-fronting request works then they are probably sniffing SNI)')
