Interestingly I recall the devs mentioned Trump&#x27;s win and the subsequent political tension caused a big change in the way the game was developed and the themes they wanted to include. So I don&#x27;t know if the wait was so bad- I don&#x27;t know what the last episode was originally meant to be, but the way it is now is a beautiful examination of the most painful, human, vulnerable pieces of the american dream.')
