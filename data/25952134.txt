Almost seems like a domino effect, revealing step by step how much control these companies have, at least beyond the tech sphere[1], and how interconnected they are.<p>I mean, not that I&#x27;m really surprised by this happening with Google[2], but still I didn&#x27;t expect them to get involved; don&#x27;t see what they have to gain by this other than sharing on the bad publicity. Wonder if Apple will step in too.<p>Hopefully these events will actually lead into more adoption of decentralized protocols and platforms (and more support for open hardware development, maybe), and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this week will go into the history books.<p>[1]: I mean  to say that I know that many in the tech sector were already aware of it. But everyone at large was just kind of okay with it, so this is revelatory from that perspective.
