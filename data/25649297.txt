Sending a babysitter to everyone&#x27;s house for one hour in the morning between when the parents leave for work and when the kids leave for school?<p>&gt; The reality is otherwise, of course. So, if businesses really depend on public schools babysitting children to have workers or exist, then it&#x27;s proper that they suck it up and work with the school schedule if they are really that subordinate to it.<p>So then you&#x27;re starting everything an hour later anyway and there is no point in setting clocks the other way.')
