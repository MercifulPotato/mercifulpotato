It would be <i>fun</i> to have an EV, but from both a $$ and eco point of view, I think if you&#x27;re already committed to a low car lifestyle, your best option for some time yet is to carry on buying lower-efficiency vehicles that are at least 4 years old.<p>This prevents an existing vehicle (for which the carbon cost to manufacture it is sunk) from being abandoned, but using it as a backup vehicle means it won&#x27;t be driven more than a minimum, and having your gas be &quot;expensive&quot; on a per-km basis creates the proper incentives to avoid driving except where necessary.')
