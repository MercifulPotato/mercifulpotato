Item(by='markus_zhang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607629606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376714, text='I work in a mobile gaming development house, so maybe I can share my 2 cents.<p>From the look of it, the landscape of mobile gaming is pretty competetive nowadays. I&#x27;m not sure which genre you are targeting, but from what you are describing I think it&#x27;s a casual game? I strongly recommend Deconstructor of Fun to you as it covers mobile gaming pretty extensively and we have been using it for industry information from day zero. Subscribe to the newsletter and try to figure out the landscape for your genre, and see where you can find an edge.<p>That said, unless you have been going through a full scale mobile gaming dev from begining to end, you might overlook some aspects. For example, you didn&#x27;t mention method of marketing (but do have a market target), but that&#x27;s one of the key areas that contribute to the success of a mobile game (and pretty much every indie game), and could be pretty expensive if you go through some channels.<p>Another thing to think is how easy it is for others to copy your game. It&#x27;s almost fair practice that companies start copying other games, not only the gameplay flow, but even the look and style of it. Big companies do that as well, so be careful.<p>Your financial looks good, 12-18 months should be good (I&#x27;d target for 2 years though), and about the engine, we are using Unity, but I guess it depends on the project and your experience. If you think the gae won&#x27;t have top graphics and you don&#x27;t have a solid C++ background, maybe Unity is easier?')
