As others have said:<p>- You say &quot;some domains don&#x27;t lend themselves to rapid prototyping&quot; - yet SpaceX&#x27;s results speak for itself<p>- You say &quot;unusually prone to safety incidents&quot; - can you list 5 of them so that we know what you&#x27;re talking about? &quot;testing incident where a fuel tank exploded&quot; - that&#x27;s literally their designed operating mode, nobody was put in harm&#x27;s way, you&#x27;re basically disagreeing with how they operate (should have the humbleness to consider that their impressive results so far might indicate they&#x27;re right and you&#x27;re wrong)<p>- You say &quot;they can&#x27;t even take a rocket out safely, how are they hoping to achieve anything&quot; just after even their competitors praised them for the impressive results.<p>etc. Is it really surprising that you get downvoted?')
