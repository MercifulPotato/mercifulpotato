And they, once again, break existing playbook&#x2F;role syntax? m(<p>Seriously, it is beyond me how this glorified paralleized shell-loop spewing gzipped python can get away with something like this time and time again... Ansible really is a steaming pile of ill-thought-out ad-hoc decisions, endlessly retrofitted and then retrofitted again, in all tangible qualities and regards.
