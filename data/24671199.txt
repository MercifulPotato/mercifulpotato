It&#x27;s like those startup success blog posts.<p>It&#x27;s also quite idealistic.<p>For other people open source might start as a desire for better software or just a desire to help but then it doesn&#x27;t play out the same way. The project doesn&#x27;t have as much success, the effort is high and the positive feedback low, the user demands or costs unreasonable. Then you draw a line and realise you just created yourself a sort of unpaid internship position where the globe is your boss.<p>Having experienced something like this my conclusion is that open source in any continuous form is to be seriously avoided.')
