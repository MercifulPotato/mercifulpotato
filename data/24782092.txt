And the underlying process is the same.  Conservatives often think they are doing the lords work, and anyone who opposes them is evil and not worthy.  And liberals often think they have the market on virtue cornered, and anyone who is opposed is a nazi&#x2F;racist&#x2F;xenophobe.  And I&#x27;m only slightly exaggerating.<p>Edit:  And I should add, that I did pick an example that was unfair to the right since it is worse than what is typically described as cancellation.  So i apologize for that imbalance, but my basic point is still that the real issue is illiberal authoritarian elements that appear across the entire spectrum of left-to-right -- regardless of the degree to which they&#x27;ve so far been able to flex their muscles.')
