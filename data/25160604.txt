Why is this a major flaw?<p>2. As stated by the title.<p>Remark: (Well conducted) RCTs introduce way too much variance.<p>As a statistician I care about a good trade-off between bias and variance.<p>OTOH, you don&#x27;t need RCTs when you measure a physical property of a system.<p>3-6,8. Valid points. Especially as of publication date.<p>As of today, they updated the study with 3000+ patients.<p>7. This is not ethical.<p>9. Object of the study: measure viral load. After the cytokine storm, you don&#x27;t care much about the virus.<p>10. We should ask DR directly about it, this is grave.<p>11-13. Irrelevant. They did PCRs to everyone, the important measure is the CT.<p>14. This is not good indeed.<p>15. PCR tests are reliable.<p>16. Why is it a flaw?<p>17-18. They published a lot of other papers on their work, and updated the early study.')
