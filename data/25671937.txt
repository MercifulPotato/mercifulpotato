Item(by='eitland', descendants=None, kids=[25672007], score=None, time=1610032359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670960, text='&gt; As a reminder, Telegram groups are not encrypted at all, and 1:1 chats are not encrypted by default<p>This isn&#x27;t just misleading but actually plain wrong.<p>Unless you want to tell my your internet banking is unencrypted too ;-)<p>Edit: as seen downthread there a number of ways to make this more or less correct, but as it stand, and particularly with the &quot;at all&quot; at the end of one of the claims it is just plain wrong.<p>&gt; Telegram can see most of your messages.<p>This part is technically correct however. Telegram says they taken steps to prevent rouge admins from seing it and to prevent themselves from being able to produce copies for governments, however there&#x27;s no way for us to know if it was true then, if it is true now, if it is true in the future or at any point in between so worthless if you don&#x27;t trust them.<p>If this is a problem for you generally I recommend stop using email, stop sending letters etc and rely only on Signal or Matrix.<p>For many of us however this is acceptable: we send letters or even post cards fully unencrypted fully aware that they might be read.<p>We send mails fully aware that it can be read at any server from we send it to the one the recipient download it from.<p>But for some reason the same level of security is deeply problematic when Telegram is mentioned.')
