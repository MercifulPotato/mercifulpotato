However, they are <i>similar</i> objects: they have exactly the same structure. If we had a function for structural comparison which handles cycles, that function would have to conclude that foo and bar are structurally equal. This is because of symmetry in the cycle: bar[0] is foo and, symmetrically, foo[0] is bar. Both foo and bar are one-element lists whose elements are, respectively, bar and foo.')
