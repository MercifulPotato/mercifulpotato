Item(by='rectang', descendants=None, kids=[25113677], score=None, time=1605539174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112152, text='&gt; <i>Does copyright law end with HEAD on master?</i><p>With regards to copyright law and &quot;distribution&quot;, there&#x27;s no distinction.  The tests are still being &quot;distributed&quot;, just from a different URL.  If youtube-dl was in violation before, they still are now.<p>This is a confusing result.  I would not expect <i>any</i> copyright litigant to sacrifice legal advantage for the sake of an adversary&#x27;s convenience in maintaining complete version control history.<p>Could there possibly have been a miscommunication over what &quot;remove the tests&quot; meant?  Or an offer of compromise outside of legal necessity?  Or a bad-faith fulfillment of a promise to &quot;remove the tests&quot;?')
