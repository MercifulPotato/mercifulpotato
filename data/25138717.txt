Unions take money from R&amp;D and shareholders, and put it in their own pockets. That&#x27;s totally fine, but it is a tradeoff. The negative side is it creates opportunities for other companies  that aren&#x27;t unionized to innovate with that capital. Or sometimes it just results in returning capital to shareholders. Tesla is a good example of where paying union members instead of investing in R&amp;D offered Musk an amazing opportunity to outcompete some of the most entrenched and subsidized companies in the US. We are actually quite fortunate that this even happened in the US, because the opportunity was there for any company in any country to seize.<p>As an aside, I don&#x27;t get why deng tolerates comments like yours, but will mod an equivalent comment that even moderately right wing. If we want real discussion here, it doesn&#x27;t start with a reshashed Eugene Debs speech.')
