You must also disable 1.1 in your server config. It&#x27;s both actions that fix the insecurities: first enabling a secure method of communication; and then cutting off anyone trying to communicate insecurely. If you simply enable 1.2, but leave 1.1 working, then you haven&#x27;t fixed the problem.<p>SRI is the equivalent of just enabling 1.2. You haven&#x27;t disabled access to browsers that dont support SRI.<p>You 2nd sentence sounds remarkably similar to my first post that maple responded to: SRI can help mitigate the damage, but it cant fix it.<p>You seem confused about the difference between mitigation and fixing.<p><i>Mitigation: the action of reducing the severity, seriousness, or painfulness of something.</i><p>Key work there is <i>reducing</i>. A fix actually eliminates the issue.. like enabling 1.2 + disabling 1.1 eliminates the potential for communicating insecurely.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand the difference because anything short of actually fixing the issue leaves some users exposed to the vulnerability.')
