There used to be a LOT of them, they all got ripped out to make more room for cars. There were rail tracks on the bay bridge!  Those got ripped out in 1956 apparently.  Everything was converted to buses so yeah, there&#x27;s still public transit but I definitely feel like something valuable was lost there. I&#x27;d also argue that much of the bay area was built for street cars (they existed after all!) and we could always put them back if there was a compelling cost&#x2F;benefit to doing so.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfstreetcars.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfstreetcars.co</a>')
