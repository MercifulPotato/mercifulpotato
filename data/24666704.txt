I recommend scheduling meetings a bit long on either end to facilitate chit-chat. An always-on voice channel is kind of nice sometimes as well (something like Mumble or Discord). Also, scheduling regular social hours with coworkers is pretty nice -- it can be as simple as playing a video game or a virtual happy hour.')
