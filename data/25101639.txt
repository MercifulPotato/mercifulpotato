I have no horse in this race other than the systemic outcome.<p>Censorship (or official annotation, let&#x27;s call it) was an attempt to curb the tribalism or put some controls on the spread of it; I&#x27;m certainly saying that it will not work.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine alternative solutions at this time, but we need to. It will likely be some sort of system we can&#x27;t yet imagine, and it will likely need to be at the societal level of mutual agreement. Think less of controlling speech, more &quot;wow cars can kill people, we should probably agree to some rules around driving them around.&quot;<p>I expect things will get much worse before those types of systems are put in place.')
