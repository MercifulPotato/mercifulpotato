I use Julia from the REPL, running mostly self constructed algorithms. Only fairly basic modules are used.<p>My main project is a backtesting framework for algorithmic stock trading. A typical run took more than a month of runtime on my computer when the code was in optimized Numpy and now takes less than 1 minute in optimized (but likely far from optimal) Julia code. The only way to come at all close to the speed of Julia with Python would probably be something like Numba, which I figured would be more immature than Julia. Python is only usable for heavy computing on large data when the glue can be in the outermost loop so to speak.')
