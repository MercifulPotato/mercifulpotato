(This was related to the team I worked on, so I have a soft spot for it)<p>... and probably more that I&#x27;m forgetting.<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s really nice that there&#x27;s so much Rust these days that it&#x27;s easy to forget all of the cool stuff. And there&#x27;s a lot that I&#x27;d consider meaningful that may or may not be &quot;large,&quot; so I was shooting for only the largest. 1Password and Discord are huge for me, but maybe others don&#x27;t think so.')
