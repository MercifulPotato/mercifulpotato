No citation or data... are we just suppose to blindly follow the scientific method? Preposterous!<p>Reading through Fowlers &quot;Good Environment&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Bad Environment&quot; lists... I can use my own critical thinking to see why one is good, or bad. Fowler while he doesn&#x27;t really get his hands dirty with these problems he is very good at rounding up the current zeitgeist and common sense in ThoughtWorks and publishing it to the world. He&#x27;s rarely been flat out wrong. (I don&#x27;t mean this as an appeal to authority, just how I look at this article, and Fowlers publications in general).')
