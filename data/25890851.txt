They arenâ€™t meant to raise money or because of scarcity. They are designed to coerce behavior. The assumption is that you are stupid and need to be coerced. But first comes the narrative fed through the media.<p>Examples: soda tax, alcohol tax, tobacco tax, gasoline tax, candy tax, decreased state funding for school districts in higher income areas, state requirements for higher density housing lest the city lose state funding, ban on gas cars, ban on gas stoves, tiered electricity and water costs, elimination of magnet schools.<p>I would expect far more social manipulation through laws in the next few years.<p>Here are a few that I can dream up:<p>- decreased state funding for schools if your housing is below a certain density, or below a job&#x2F;housing ratio<p>- make water and electricity far more progressively expensive<p>- additional property tax based on land area<p>- additional road tax based on number of miles in an area<p>- higher sales tax on cars')
