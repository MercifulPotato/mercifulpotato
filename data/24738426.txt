Then John Young published the decrypted unredacted documents on Cryptome, the day after which Wikileaks also published them in order to warn anyone involved that they had probably been compromised by the earlier leak. This has all come out during his extradition hearing, and is uncontested by those directly involved. It also came out during the hearing that the USA could not provide evidence of a single person being harmed as a result of the leak, despite spending millions on an investigation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commondreams.org&#x2F;views&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;guardians-deceit-riddled-new-statement-betrays-both-julian-assange-and-journalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commondreams.org&#x2F;views&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;guardians-dece...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sep&#x2F;24&#x2F;us-never-asked-wikileaks-rival-cryptome-remove-leaked-cables-court-told-assange" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sep&#x2F;24&#x2F;us-never-asked...</a>')
