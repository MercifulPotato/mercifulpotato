After the gunnery advancements of the early 20th century, engagement ranges could be long enough for plunging fire. Battleship shells coming down at 40Â° off vertical aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> different than an AP bomb.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that these defences were sufficient. Battleships were designed with an &quot;immunity zone&quot; - a range where incoming fire of the designed caliber (generally the same caliber as the main battery) would be at a high enough angle and low enough velocity to fail to penetrate your belt armor, and <i>shallow</i> enough angle to not defeat the relevant deck armor. 2000lb AP bombs at terminal velocity were very much not within the design specifications.<p>&gt; carriers today are significantly more advanced in both technology as well as doctrine than those, though.<p>For that matter, even other carriers in that same battle show that damage control by a carrier against bomb hits was possible - the Yorktown survived several bomb and aerial torpedo hits before eventually being sunk by a submarine. She was able to make sufficient repairs to launch fighters again after the first set of bomb hits, too.<p>Modern carriers are probably better represented by the Yorktown than the Akagi, but no one will really know for sure until the shooting starts.')
