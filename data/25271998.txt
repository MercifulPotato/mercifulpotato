In the liner notes[0] for &#x27;Ambient 1: Music for Airports&#x27;, he writes that &quot;Ambient Music must be able to accomodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.&quot;<p>But, speaking for myself, I wouldn&#x27;t relegate Eno&#x27;s music to the elevator. :)<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audioweb.sitehost.iu.edu&#x2F;T369&#x2F;eno-ambient.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audioweb.sitehost.iu.edu&#x2F;T369&#x2F;eno-ambient.pdf</a>')
