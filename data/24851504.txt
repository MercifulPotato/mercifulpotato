For a recent project I started with Caddy but ended up needing some functionality it didn&#x27;t have, and didn&#x27;t need most of what it did have. I&#x27;m currently using a custom proxy layer, but I&#x27;m concerned I might end up having to implement more than I want to (I know I&#x27;ll at least need gzip). Curious what your experience at fly has been with this.')
