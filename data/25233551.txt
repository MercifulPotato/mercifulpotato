The idea that it extends to employee 200 is a fantasy because you are asking them to commit to a degree that you will never be able to commit in them.<p>Give a shit about your employees first, and you will find employees that give a shit about you.  Asking them to centre their lives around your company when you will easily sacrifice them at needs is deeply flawed.')
