Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25616944], score=None, time=1609623900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616349, text='&gt;&gt;When autonomous vehicles halve the cost of an Uber&#x2F;Lyft journey, many more people will weigh up the costs&#x2F;benefits of private vehicle ownership and decide it’s not for them.<p>That&#x27;s kind of my point - this won&#x27;t happen, because Uber is already at rock bottom prices. For me to take it to work is about £10. That can&#x27;t cover anything about the journey and is clearly heavily subsidised by Uber. That cost isn&#x27;t going down to £5, it&#x27;s just not going to happen. Just like when people predict that since flash memory prices keep falling down, you will be able to buy a 1TB pendrive for 5 cents. That&#x27;s not going to happen because you do have the minimum costs of production and transport that aren&#x27;t going anywhere even if the chips themselves are free.<p>And if people aren&#x27;t taking Uber instead of their own cars for these frankly ridiculous prices then I don&#x27;t see why they would simply because the cars drive themselves.<p>&gt;&gt;Different services will compete based in part on the luxuriousness of the interiors and the frequency at which they are cleaned.<p>The same principle should apply to taxis and it just doesn&#x27;t. I live in a medium size UK city and every company, every brand, has crappy cars. Only price matters, nothing else and Uber Lux is not an option because you&#x27;re waiting 40-50 minutes for one, that&#x27;s just not acceptable.')
