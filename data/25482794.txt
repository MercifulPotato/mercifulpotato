I&#x27;m not actually a linux&#x2F;sysadmin type person, but I was pretty keen to achieve my goal of being Google free by 2021 (which I&#x27;m happy to announce with this migration that I did :), though I still watch youtube anonymously sometimes). But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll be the most ideal solution for the long term. I&#x27;ll see what the maintenance burden actually is like through next year. Some folks have suggested looking at the docker installation options (as opposed to the snap package, which I use here), since it&#x27;s apparently really easy to maintain. We&#x27;ll see.')
