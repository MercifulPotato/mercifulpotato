Not sure I&#x27;d recommend using emacs just for EXWM, as some people seem to do with magit or org-mode.<p>The main problem it solves is that emacs <i>is</i> a tiling window manager (in a loose, non X-specific sense), so if you spend the majority of your time in emacs it gets quite annoying that you&#x27;re having to use two different paradigms to manage windows: one for managing emacs &quot;windows&quot; and the &quot;buffers&quot; that they &quot;visit&quot; and one for managing X windows, of which emacs itself is one. EXWM makes X windows behave (mostly) as if they are emacs buffers, so you can use the same powerful tools to manage them.<p>As an example, I use ivy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abo-abo&#x2F;swiper" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abo-abo&#x2F;swiper</a>) so for switching between buffers I get a nice incremental fuzzy-matched buffer list. With EXWM that same buffer list also contains my web browser and other X applications.<p>I&#x27;ve written a toy window manager so I have some sense for what making a real one would entail. I&#x27;ve been using emacs for 20 years or so, so have some insight into that. I am in awe at the dedication and attention to detail it must have taken to turn EXWM from a crazy idea into a solid WM that is completely usable as a daily driver.')
