For many years, one of the defining characteristics of Macs was the high quality native apps, all with consistent look, feel and behavior. Mac users would refuse to use apps that weren&#x27;t sufficiently Mac-like. Developers of Mac apps had a similar passion and perfectionism for good UX and UI.<p>Somewhere along the way, this part of Apple culture got lost. I think Apple&#x27;s commercial success is part of the reason. The traditional Mac user base got diluted by lots of newcomers who didn&#x27;t have the same high expectations and requirements for good and consistent user interfaces. The traditional Mac developers got diluted by programmers from other platforms, who – although not being technically inferior in any way – did not have the same passion or understanding of Apple&#x27;s UI philosophy, often not even bothering to study the Human Interface Guidelines.')
