Item(by='vinay427', descendants=None, kids=[25988015], score=None, time=1612181492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987097, text='I think the actual &quot;problem&quot; that this article brings up is German law, and ProtonMail in Switzerland would be no better from what I can tell (and I live here). From the article:<p>&gt; Tutanota said it plans to appeal the November ruling from a regional court in Cologne, arguing that it contradicts an earlier decision from another German court.<p>&gt; “This decision shows again why end-to-end encryption is so important,” Pfau said via email. “According to the ruling of the Cologne Regional Court, we were obliged to release unencrypted incoming and outgoing emails from one mailbox. Emails that are encrypted end-to-end in Tutanota cannot be decrypted by us.”<p>It seems like this openness of the CEO about the warrant and their actions taken indicate that they are trying to do everything they can without brazenly breaking local laws where they operate. &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; if you use an email provider based in a country with a system of judicial proceedings and warrants this will always be a concern, and if you use one in a country without these things you instead lose any semblance of checks on these powers. They offer end-to-end encrypted emails that cannot be decrypted, and their clients have long been open-source to verify this unlike ProtonMail.')
