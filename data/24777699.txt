Right now some areas have early voting available. Early voting is available in most areas every day of the week for several weeks prior to election day, including weekends.<p>During early voting you can choose to vote at any location in your county which often include convenient places such as the grocery store, instead of being required to vote at your assigned district polling center, which is usually a public school, but is sometimes another government or community building.<p>I cannot remember waiting in line to do early voting even once. Sometimes I would go to the grocery store two or three times during early voting and see a line to vote, and I just wait until I see no line. There are always surges in the first and last days of early voting, but a big lull in the middle.')
