These videos pass by in feeds and people think &quot;that looks cool&quot; or &quot;aww cute&quot; and keep going. They don&#x27;t open up photoshop and analyze the parallax and object seams. People do not have time nor cause to investigate every video or news item that comes up. Even the investors of Nikola didn&#x27;t have time to do a full due diligence before investing! Most of this fake-content is largely banal (cakes, speed records) as for the non-banal, platforms need to step up and hinder or stop its spread.')
