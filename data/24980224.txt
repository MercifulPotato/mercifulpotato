It feels weird to get upset about something that supposedly has no meaning, though. When I see something that&#x27;s &quot;written in X&quot; and I don&#x27;t care about X, I just move on with my day. If I post about how much I don&#x27;t care about X, it really seems like I do actually care about X, otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to complain about it.<p>(The OP of this thread said that they <i>did</i> care, negatively. And you didn&#x27;t explicitly say you don&#x27;t care either. But this attitude is common and is also elsewhere in this thread so, let me just finally jump off this soapbox real quick...)')
