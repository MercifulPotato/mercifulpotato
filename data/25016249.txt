He has deinstitutionalized pretty much any institution, sowed deep hatred in the country and did absolutely nothing good in last 4 years. He is and was unfit for any public office, let alone presidency. HN loves to be neutral and thoughtful, but Trump needs to be condemned in the strongest way possible. It is orthogonal to say &quot;Oh the people voted him in&quot;, in the same way we <i>don&#x27;t</i> say &quot;Hilter rose because of the people, so blame the people&quot;. Unchecked broadcasting of hatred, misinformation, lies and breaking down the republic bit by bit with deception needs to be reviewed.')
