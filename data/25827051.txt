There are plenty of counterexamples, and I’d say MuseScore’s competitors (Finale, Sibelius, Dorico) are good examples of apps that are not tailored towards first-use experience as much as they are tailored for heavy users. They <i>heavily</i> rely on keyboard shortcuts and are modal (often to the point of being arcane, but UX is hard).')
