However you&#x27;re understating the problem for storage. Besides cost, there are far more complex regulatory and political hurdles. Just read about the public response to &quot;smart meters&quot; when they were proposed a while back.<p>We&#x27;ll likely have price-competitive storage technology by the middle of the next decade, maybe even sooner, but it will take another two or three decades to deploy it thanks to the patchwork of regulatory complexity we&#x27;re left over with from the 20th century.')
