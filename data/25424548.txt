But not supporting SAML is going to be a problem as you move into the big enterprises.<p>Many big companies run on SAML, and expect to auth with vendors over SAML. That&#x27;s why russell_h&#x27;s comment is probably futile; it&#x27;s the enterprises with the big SaaS budgets that keep SAML relevant, and they don&#x27;t care if HN doesn&#x27;t like it.<p><i>Maybe</i> in about a decade SAML will be less important to enterprises? SAML 2.0 is only about 15 years old.')
