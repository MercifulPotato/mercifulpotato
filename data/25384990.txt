Various distributions (e.g. Ubuntu and Fedora) already use secure boot to verify the bootloader - kernel - module chain. There is no reason that this couldn&#x27;t be extended to e.g. only running signed Flatpaks too. And yet, at the same time, you can boot these distributions without secure boot, load unsigned kernel modules, etc.<p>It is true that a combination of code signing and sandboxing provides a lot of additional protections. But a less consumer-hostile flavor could be where by default the system is restrictive, but the user always has the power to disable certain or all security mechanisms.<p>The problem is that it is not only about security and protecting against malware for these vendors. It&#x27;s also about funneling applications and subscriptions through their app stores, so that they can take their 30% cuts. They don&#x27;t just want to profit from the initial sale, but also the continued use of a system. The security argument is just used to trap users in their app store ecosystems.<p>What makes this more unfortunate is that a large contingent of the Linux community is opposed to better security measures by default. This is why many Linux distributions are still stuck in a 90ies threat model where gaining UID 0 access is what one should protect against, while applications can freely roam in users&#x27; home directories. Consequently, there are only few Linux distributions that are competitive to iOS or macOS when it comes to desktop security.')
