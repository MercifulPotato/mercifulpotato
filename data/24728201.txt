One of the common ideas of the trope is that an immortal sooner or later becomes problematic to have in one place, they must wander of people will attempt to experiment on them to figure out the secret of immortality. Of course the second bit of the trope is the wandering immortal leave traces, and  more intense searchers after immortality will follow them and attempt capture. If diversity decreases in the future based on present trends the story then becomes that it becomes increasingly difficult for the wandering immortal to wander without everyone being aware of them.')
