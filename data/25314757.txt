Just after I had the problem with the Galago, the Darter came out It way my choice to get a repair, or to return the machine and buy something else. Since I ALSO didn&#x27;t like the 4k screen on the Galago, I opted for the Darter. I paid shipping, just as would have happened had the Galago screen not been defective.<p>I was actually in the process of arranging the repair of the Galago when the Darter was released, and they then told me about their return policy.<p>Also: the yellowing on part of the Galago screen was extremely subtle. It took me a couple of weeks to even notice it. But there were no questions asked, they just immediately said it was a warrany repair.<p>Go clean up your coffee.')
