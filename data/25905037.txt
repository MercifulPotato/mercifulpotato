They clearly were sincere in their statement, and given that the 6S was released in 2015, everyone who bought one at a later date knew that it was an older device, and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> supported and will continue to be supported.<p>Another way to put it is that <i>no one</i> does better than Apple at keeping their devices useful and valuable (easily demonstrated in resale values). Maybe Apple could do even better, but it&#x27;s in a market where it is far and away the standout.<p>As an aside, people say &quot;well look I can put some completely unsupported, random ROM on my old device!&quot; is not a counterpoint. iPhones and iPads continue on as our kid&#x27;s devices, resolve for a handsome resale price, etc. Competitor devices collect dust in a drawer. This is empirical truth.')
