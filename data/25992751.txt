We keep throwing money at homelessness but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all because a lot of the problem homeless really need to be involuntarily committed for long term treatment of mental illness or addiction. Not many people want to go down that route, because we still don&#x27;t really trust or are comfortable with that.<p>People are going to compensate the only way they can.
