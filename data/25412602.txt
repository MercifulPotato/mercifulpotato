Employees in those teams determined to do it anyway end up doing 120%.<p>There is absolutely no requirement at Google to put in time on a 20% project.<p>That said, what happens in practice is that 20% projects are the way that Google engineers are able to move across teams: You pick a team you want to join. You do something for that team as your 20% project with the goal of getting that manager to request your transfer to their team.<p>So if you&#x27;re desperate to get off your team without quitting Google, you could get backed into committing 120%.')
