Item(by='joeblau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606832407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265042, text='<p><pre><code>  I can do all these things already.\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;re absolutely right, but just like you can send a letter in the mail, email does the same thing but is digitally native to the internet.<p>Up until the invention of Bitcoin, there was <i>ZERO</i> scalable way for me @joeblau to send you @louwrentius money the way I send an email. By that, I mean the only thing I need to rely on is a protocol (like SMTP) and you&#x27;ll receive it.<p><pre><code>  What problem &#x2F; which problems are being solved here?\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that money (paper money&#x2F;currency) is not the only thing that has value which human beings transfer among each other. We share music, art, poetry, equity in companies, ideas, code, etc. What Ethereum does is take the idea of &quot;Digital trustless money transfer&quot; and expands it to &quot;Digital trustless value transfer&quot;<p><pre><code>  I don&#x27;t understand what this means. What does this do for real-life applications?\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s say I own TSLA stock and I want to sell it to you. I can&#x27;t, <i>without</i> going through a middle-person. I need to send my shares to a brokerage (they take cuts and fees and do insider trading crap that they disguise as legal) then you buy the shares from then.<p>If it&#x27;s mine, why can&#x27;t I just transfer the shares straight to you for the listed price (Currently $567.60)? Because there is no platform digital trustless value transfer that will ensure that we both get what we want: Me getting the money, and you getting the shares.')
