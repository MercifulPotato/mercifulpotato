Item(by='thephyber', descendants=None, kids=[24725362], score=None, time=1602199883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724768, text='&gt; Apple doesn&#x27;t let you make a free app that references a paid service outside the App Store<p>Counter examples: Audible. Amazon. Netflix.<p>The contract nuance is more subtle than what you described. Iirc the app can’t directly link to the payment system on the website, but Audible (for example) has an intermediate currency (“points”) which can be transacted in-app. Real world currency transactions must be made on the website, outside of the app. Without the website account and transactions, the app is pretty useless.<p>The Netflix app is perhaps marginally more useful without logging in and Amazon is marginally more useful than that.')
