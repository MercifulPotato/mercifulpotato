The problem is that the word &quot;racism&quot; has meant a lot of things over the decades continues to be used to describe many gradations of behavior and outlook.  It&#x27;s used to describe brutally beating a black man to death in the street, it&#x27;s meant denying housing opportunity, and it also describes moving to the other side of the sidewalk when a black man is on your side, or picking a white candidate over a black candidate in a job interview.<p>The spectrum that the word &quot;racist&quot; covers is simply too large.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve pointed out that it used to just be called &quot;stereotyping&quot; but there&#x27;s been a concerted effort on the part of those pushing identity politics, to make this about power.  It&#x27;s to the point where they&#x27;ve redefined &quot;racism&quot; to mean &quot;at a minimum, stereotyping another person from a position of power or authority&quot;.<p>The implications of that new definition are that many people who were previously guilty of stereotyping, are now racist.  In fact, basically any white person who stereotypes, because they generally have privileges&#x27; and power in society, are now &quot;racist&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the redefinition, and I think it&#x27;s an example of a pendulum that has swung too far.')
