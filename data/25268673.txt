I do this with a very small config file with BitBucket Pipelines. It&#x27;s easy to set it up with GitHub Actions or any other CI&#x2F;CD solution.<p>The core process is:<p>1. Build your code<p>2. Zip the build<p>3. Upload to S3<p>4. Tell Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the S3 file<p>The BitBucket Pipeline I&#x27;m using is already configured with the code to do this, so you just specify some build commands and branches.<p>&gt; <i>To be clear, I am looking for a way to click through some setup stuff in a user management console then set some configurations and never have to manage anything again other than pushing to git.</i><p>That&#x27;s exactly what I want(ed) and was able to achieve with Elastic Beanstalk + BitBucket Pipelines.')
