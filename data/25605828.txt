It&#x27;s even translated into French I noticed. So northern Europe is borrowing three times more (per capita) than the US? That goes against everything I know.<p>One question: did you separate out consumptive credit from mortgages? The amount is so high that it seems to me that it includes mortgages.<p>Because in that case, is it not the cases that it is simply because norther Europe is wealthy and has more expensive houses and more home ownership.<p>Those mortgages are backed by houses, and are a sign of good financial practices, allowing gradual increase of wealth. Where consumptive credit is backed by nothing and is generally a sign of bad financial practices.')
