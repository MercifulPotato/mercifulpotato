In their Youtube video at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LeaA66WUaaM&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LeaA66WUaaM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> they&#x27;re saying however you&#x27;re doing &quot;patch compliance&quot; whether it&#x27;s orchestration or by-hand it is still essentially being done incrementally by hand possibly one package at a time. So instead of using Terraform&#x2F;Ansible&#x2F;Vagrant to connect to GCP you can use their VM manager to perform bulk updating of OS packages. Their VM manager relies on agent software to connect directly to your VM to issue system commands via your OS native console.')
