I don&#x27;t have a quote, but I seem to remember coming to the conclusion that tdp is the max temp threshold, not the consistent power draw. If you have a computer idling I believe you won&#x27;t see a difference in temp between cpus, but you will have the performance when you need it.<p>These days, a quiet, pwm fan with good thermal paste (and maybe some linux CPU throttling) more than achieves my needs for a &quot;silent&quot; pc 99% of the time.<p>I would love to be told my above assumptions are wrong if they are.')
