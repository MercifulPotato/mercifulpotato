I&#x27;m 22 and have a prior heart condition, and all week I felt like someoned had taken a baseball bat to my chest and was very tired. What was I doing during this time? Dealing with crammed in homework for 4 high level engineering classes that didn&#x27;t keep up with the shortened length of this semester well. I think not experiencing dread and depressive symptoms in my situation would be weird.<p>Universities and Colleges right now are pretending to be accommodating, but the stress on students is outright dangerous right now.<p>Oh, and the cherry on top? My university is going to have a football game on campus the same day as many of us are taking on-campus finals. Brilliant.<p>So, I&#x27;m both depressed and pissed off. Running on fumes of rage? Motivated by the existential dread of my impending student loans for a semester of education worse that I could have gotten off of YouTube? I don&#x27;t know man. I just want to not feel like death and have time (and the ability) to breathe.')
