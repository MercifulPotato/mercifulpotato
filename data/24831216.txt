My elderly relatives use Signal now instead of Skype.  This drew in other family members who just wanted to video chat with grandma and grandpa.  Matrix will never win markets like this.<p>When tech nerds nit pick Signal&#x27;s implementation, they ignore that the unfederated nature of Signal limits the damage these decisions can cause.  Thanks to Signal&#x27;s security posture, global protection from weak ciphers, buffer overflows, and even SGX, is just one software update away.  This even protects you from faults in your contact&#x27;s clients!  Like the key agility that makes the Axolotl Ratchet so superior to GPG, update agility makes Signal infinitely superior to every existing or proposed federated network.<p>The Signal group has an uncompromising commitment to user privacy and a poignant security philosophy.  Signal has no competition in its usability class, making hypothetical protections from other products worse than useless for user cohorts who will probably switch back to skype or sms.  Signal&#x27;s detractors do a terrible disservice to the people they dissuade from using it.')
