So I think that is a plus... saying &quot;your park sucks because people cannot camp and do drugs in it&quot; also sounds like lunacy to most people, so it&#x27;s extra nice because you cannot make it sound like it&#x27;s a bad thing, like some other exclusion policies that can be twisted and made into a strawman.')
