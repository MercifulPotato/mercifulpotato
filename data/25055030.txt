I doubt entirely Trump will prevail, but there&#x27;s no question he&#x27;s entitled to due process. Votes are still being counted. If the situation was reversed, I doubt Biden would concede until the last vote was counted either.<p>In any case, when he loses--and then looks like a sore loser--it can only possibly help democratic turnout in the GA runoff.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s arguing the finer points and missing the forest for the trees. The point is about the vitriol of the MSM toward Trump, and the role it plays in driving support <i>towards</i> Trump.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to report that the election is over and Trump refuses to concede without calling him Hitler, but it sells more clicks when you do.')
