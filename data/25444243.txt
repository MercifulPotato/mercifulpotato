Data, which I didn&#x27;t explicitly give FB permission to have, nor did I know they would or could track me on said store&#x27;s page. Still, their magic algorithms can combine my browsing activity on pages containing their tracker with my identity on FB and target ads based on that.<p>It may not be &quot;immoral&quot;, but it&#x27;s really disturbing.')
