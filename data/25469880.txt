I love free software.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against the various business models that surround free software, such as vendor support contracts.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that GNU seems uncomfortable with what seems to me to be a self-evident truth: As soon as I grant you the freedom to use my software in whatever way you like, including for distribution, that software is effectively free-in-price moving forward.<p>And that&#x27;s not a bad thing! What I DO think is bad is going to great lengths to avoid accepting that truth, or to avoid talking about it.<p>Free software is free in every sense of the word, no matter what GNU wants to believe.')
