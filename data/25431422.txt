You can get around the limitations with how to run an algorithm on encrypted data because the data is not encrypted with respect to the program itself.<p>Theoretically it would work like this: you download a docker image, you load your data into it, you encrypt the entire image with data inside, you send that whole package to the cloud where it is run and it produces an output.')
