Folks want to carry on and not live in a world with a pandemic (or climate change, or slavery).  But they also don&#x27;t want to implement austerity at a personal level.  They also don&#x27;t want government to implement austerity at a larger scale.  So the pandemic will rage on, climate change will continue to accelerate, and commodities will be produced by child and slave labor.  All this will continue until the externalities bite us and revolution or collapse takes it all away.<p>The US could have handled this better if the politics weren&#x27;t so polarized; but as it stands, the country is all too happy to cut its nose to spite its face.  Perhaps economic collapse of the country which consumes the most resources in the world will reduce that consumption, and hence pollution and slavery.  Maybe it will create a vacuum of power where another nation will take over; one which puts a greater focus on the environment but doesn&#x27;t mind slavery.  Or maybe we&#x27;ll just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and start tossing bombs.')
