Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25643301], score=None, time=1609816866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637542, text='&gt; It&#x27;s just very strange to me that the US and UK explicitly agreed to arrange for extradition on certain terms, but that those terms are now deemed by this judge not to apply in the UK.<p>The Treaty does not <i>limit</i> extradition permitted under other law, it creates an obligation. If another law requires extradition, the terms of the treaty are immaterial.<p>&gt; In the US, treaties are law.<p>They are a kind of law, but unless they are “self-executing” treaties, they aren&#x27;t law with much practical force until and except to the extent that implementing legislation is adopted.<p>Now, IIRC, extradition treaties have generally been held to be self-executing in US law, but it&#x27;s simply not generally the case that treaties are automatically judicially-enforceable laws in the US without separate legislative action.<p>&gt; The political offense exception absolutely applies when extraditing people from the US to the UK.<p>The US statute law governing extradition also allows extradition outside of any extradition treaties, but in far more limited circumstances (mostly,for non-US citizens&#x2F;nationals who are alleged to have committed crimes against US citizens or nationals) than UK law does. I&#x27;m not sure what point you are trying to make here except that the domestic law of the United States is not identical to that of the United Kingdom, which is unsurprising.')
