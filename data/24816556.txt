And the need to have &quot;serverful&quot; operational expertise is replaced by the need for serverless expertise.<p>I totally agree. As a consultant working with multiple companies, I see a slowly increasing number of Serverless applications. The code always looked bloated, with no chance of ever being migrated off the original cloud platform due to all the proprietary APIs in use. There was also no way to run any of them locally without extensive configuration. Serverless has a future, but this is not it.')
