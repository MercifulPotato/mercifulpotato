It&#x27;s an eye-opener how clear, transparent and well-intertwined good code and comments can be.<p>I&#x27;ve used such a literate programming style with scientific python once in university classes and it was a breeze to prepare and hand in exercise sheets (rendered with Latex to PDF). My feeling was that today people use Jupyter&#x2F;IPython notebook to archieve something similar (especially with embedding results), but a jupyter notebook is much more complex than a traditional, clean and terminal-readable literate programming source code.')
