One argument against mine, is that “people need and want ‘appliances’ “ that only have one function.<p>This was in response to a more widely known quote of his:<p>&gt; Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible.<p>The only people who need specialized personal workstations are people working with large data. But, even with that the cost of the cloud has made workstations a poor investment in most cases. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d agree with the notion that the demise of the workstation is &quot;untimely.&quot; Maybe in a retro, nostalgic or, cultural way it&#x27;s demise is upsetting but, in the larger pragmatic sense it&#x27;s quite welcomed. Workstations always felt like a stop-gap solution for what we have now.')
