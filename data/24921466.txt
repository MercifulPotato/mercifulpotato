Starting with the interface, it seems like everything I could want to do is 1 or 2 clicks away. Maybe I&#x27;m just familiar with everything, but considering the density of the navigation, I&#x27;m usually very pleased how easy it is to find functions I&#x27;m looking for, even if rarely used, like Order History, Wish Lists, etc.<p>And I&#x27;ve been pleased with product discovery as well. Their search algorithm seems to provide me with the things I&#x27;m looking for, even if I struggle to find the right query. Just a few days ago, I wanted to buy something to keep squirrels out of my garden. I just entered &quot;squirrel protection for plants&quot;, and it returned exactly the kind of products I was looking for, even if the product name did not contain the words &quot;squirrel&quot;, &quot;protection&quot;, or &quot;plants&quot;. I compared this to a couple of gardening supply sites, where nothing came up.<p>And there is absolutely nothing I&#x27;ve experienced that beats the user experience for returning an item from Amazon, which IMO is one of the most important things for any ecommerce site. I have no problem buying multiple items on Amazon with the intent of keeping just one because I know the return process will be extremely easy. Just click a button in the order history, then take the product to a UPS store and let them scan your phone - no printing, boxing, taping, or anything else to do. I would never do that with any other website. When I have had to return items elsewhere, I eventually received a refund, but only after having to email someone several times, take photos of the merchandise, provide extra information, box it up and tape it myself.')
