(4) is critical. Any whiff of ineligibility by payment is completely unacceptable, and rightly so, or we&#x27;d end up with the US disaster. From a political point of view, we have to defend the existing system because otherwise the US one will be forced on us. Nobody in UK politics will give us the Swiss system.<p>&gt; tax funded status means the private health sector is seriously throttled in the UK<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense? Bupa exists?<p>Private health insurance is quite cheap in the UK compared to America because anything complicated or expensive can and will be dumped back on the public sector.<p>&gt; this is achieved partly through building up large maintenance backlogs which is hardly sustainable: true cost of the NHS to the UK should probably be higher than is actually reported. The government has tried several times to force the NHS to spend money on maintenance and upgrades but usually fails: the NHS takes whatever money was granted to it for this purpose and immediately spends it on daily operations in violation of their agreements. Nothing happens because to Brits the NHS is a holy religion, so NHS management don&#x27;t really feel accountable.<p>Unsourced Tory propaganda.')
