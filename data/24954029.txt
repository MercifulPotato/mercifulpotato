It&#x27;s more that (each book focusing on a different planet), science is the vehicle for human moral corruption to play out on Earth.<p>Orwell obviously didn&#x27;t find anything worthwhile in that, but I think it&#x27;s more of a matter of Orwell not finding the theme compelling rather than a problem with how the book is put together.')
