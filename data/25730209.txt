I recall that there were allegations at the time that Chinese business were dumping solar panels onto the market and that meant Solyndra couldn’t compete. Though I’ve also found some news sources saying that  the high prices for polysilicon caused a bunch of players to enter the market to produce it, causing prices of poly silicon to crash and  Solyndra couldn’t compete. Either way it seems to be bad luck unless the CEO and board knew those were huge risks and intentionally downplayed them.<p>Edit: It just seems unclear to be what the supposed fraud was.')
