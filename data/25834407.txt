Solar cells may degrade, but keep providing power for decades, if not centuries.<p>So a long-lasting <i>satellite</i> which just needs to keep its orbit may be better off with a low-thrust engine not ejecting any reaction mass. A long-range mission with a finite travel time towards the outer reaches of the Solar system may be better off with a high-Isp jet engine.')
