Bruh... And who substitutes that with a 2006 version laptop? <i>face-palm</i><p>Like another comment down below mentions, companies toss away perfectly good laptops after a year or two, which can be bought in the ballpark of 150-300 quid&#x2F;euros&#x2F;USD. They&#x27;ll last 2-3 years on average, and even longer if you aren&#x27;t into intensive activities. Just go to some IT guy in a multinational - I remember my old firm had stacks of ThinkPads piled all the way up. Some companies even have old MBPs at hand.')
