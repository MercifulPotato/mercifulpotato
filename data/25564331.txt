I&#x27;m sure many arguments can be made around what&#x27;s fair, but it&#x27;s intuitive that income from labor, investments, etc should naturally go to who performs the labor, who makes the investments etc.<p>The (unimproved) land itself is a bit different.  It can&#x27;t go to who created the land, since no one did.  In the US, the closest thing is maybe who first took it from the Native Americans.  The moral argument for strong property rights (on the land without improvements) to begin with seems weaker than the other cases, since there&#x27;s no contribution to society tied to making the land (of course switching from one tax regime to another is another matter, since people certainly buy land that is valuable under our current system with their hard-earned money).<p>That also leads to its (relatively) small effects on incentives for a tax.  Taxes on labor and investment income of course discourage labor and investment, but the amount of land does not decrease no matter how much it is taxed.  Even a huge tax probably does not affect the monthly payments to use land very much (since the supply and demand still remain similar), it would probably just lead to lower land values and more of the monthly payment going to taxes instead of interest.<p>&gt; Now the reason I bring this up is because if a tax were enacted for the express purpose of shaping public behavior and the resulting revenue was greater than what the government needed, what ought to be done with the surplus revenue?<p>I think this is an interesting question especially with things like carbon taxes being considered seriously.  It seems like two natural things to do would be to either reduce other harmful taxes that exist only to raise revenue, or to distribute the funds to everyone equally.  I could see an argument for the latter if the incentive-shaping tax was something that would raise living expenses for most people (for example, a carbon tax that increases electricity costs), since otherwise it would negatively affect people living off savings or others with low incomes.')
