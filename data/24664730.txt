The README file on their repository didn&#x27;t expound on this. (I have a very fast parser and lexer for JavaScript written in C++ that is very compliant in Cycript--the main issues I sometimes see are in my hacky &quot;try to do everything in a single pass&quot;semantic optimizer pass I am doing to generate code, but that is of course optional--though I haven&#x27;t pushed updates to its repository in a few years despite my doing a lot of work on it... I kind of decided at some point I hated users. But I don&#x27;t have a &quot;compiler&quot; unless the meaning is &quot;compile from JavaScript to JavaScript&quot;, in which case it would be fun to benchmark it against boa and I might start doing that. It is just that it sounds a bit like boa is also executing the JavaScript?)')
