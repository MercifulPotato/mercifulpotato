When I bought the TV there was no mention of Adverts included.<p>Amazon sold two versions of their kindle, one with and one without ads, not an issue for me. As customer the pro&#x2F;con relationship is clear. I get what I pay for.<p>These ads slow down my TV, waste electricity, waste my time more importantly. It&#x27;s not my problem as a customer if other people mis-configure their TV and have to call support, that&#x27;s a UX problem, I&#x27;ve never met anyone who has mis-configured their DNS on their phone. If you&#x27;ve updated your DNS on your TV before it&#x27;s a very long process, using arrow keys to select characters, it&#x27;s not something you accidentally do.<p>I paid for a TV and I didn&#x27;t get what was advertised. The argument that they do it to protect dumb users is non-sense because the TVs that don&#x27;t have this configurable in the settings are the ones mainly bundled with ads.')
