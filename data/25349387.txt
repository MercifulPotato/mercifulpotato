But only using my bed for sleeping is part of what lets me now fall deeply asleep within 5 minutes of shutting my eyes.<p>I hope your sleep health is good, but if anybody reading this wonders why they have such a tough time falling asleep or waking up on time, I would recommend giving this strategy a shot.')
