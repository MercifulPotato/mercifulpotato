Scalar level<p>Various benchmarks (including those in the paper) show NiLang is much better than Zygote. And Zygote is much faster than TF and PyTorch.<p>2. Tensor level<p>Zygote, TF and PyTorch are much better than NiLang, because NiLang&#x27;s matrix multiplication is not fully optimized, it is much slower than BLAS. (One can wrap BLAS into NiLang, but that does not measure NiLang&#x27;s programming language level AD performance anymore)')
