If security researchers wanted to try and collect more they could in theory form some kind of union to keep up the price of bounties, with like a middle agent pricing the bounty and disclosing the vulnerability if the price isn&#x27;t met. Maybe combine with some kind of insurance, such that if a company doesn&#x27;t pay out the bounty the researcher can still collect. I don&#x27;t know if this would count as extortion though, so it might not even be legal.<p>Really this seems like a shady security company when I describe it like that.')
