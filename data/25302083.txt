Once that happens we can more or less consider classical asymmetric crypto unsafe since we can assume deep-pocketed adversaries (NSA, FSB, China, etc.) may be ahead of what is publicly disclosed. That&#x27;s why classically computable but quantum resistant asymmetric cryptography is one of the hottest areas of crypto research right now.')
