Android app is available, the iOS app is due to enter beta in a month or two.<p>This is a personal thing for me. This year I migrated my family to XMPP from WhatsApp (at least for communicating with each other), and I want others to be able to do the same. Trying to make it a sustainable project (it&#x27;s 100% open-source).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snikket.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snikket.org&#x2F;</a>')
