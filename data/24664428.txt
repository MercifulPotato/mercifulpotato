While I do think the US is more than just a capitalist oligarchy, from a certain perspective you can see America as being the world&#x27;s main laundry service for capital.<p>However, the cat&#x27;s out of the bag. The only historical precedent for limiting capital&#x27;s ability to flow are periods of societal collapse and feudalization. When capital gets going nothing seems able to stop it (considering that IBM did business with the Nazis, even horrible things like war only seem to slow it down). I think the evidence is strong that capital has never been more powerful relative to the state than at this moment in history (the IRS freely admits it has become too expensive to audit the wealthy[1]). So the idea that we have any advantage over the past in being able to limit it seems ludicrous on its face.<p>The best (only?) approach is to try to manage the negative externalities that the free flow of capital creates (rapidly accelerating wealth inequality, etc). Personally, I&#x27;m on the UBI bandwagon for this reason.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;irs-sorry-but-its-just-easier-and-cheaper-to-audit-the-poor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;irs-sorry-but-its-just-ea...</a>')
