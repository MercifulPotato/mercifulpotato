Each rendering command you get back from Dear ImGui comes with a block of vertices and indices. Typically those are stashed into 3D-API vertex- and index-buffers for efficient rendering, but they can just as well be &quot;unrolled&quot; to glBegin&#x2F;End calls, it&#x27;s just not as efficient. With a good GL driver this probably doesn&#x27;t matter much though.')
