But I&#x27;ll often use Amazon to find the specific thing I want and grab the model number. Then I can search the manufacturer&#x27;s website to see if they&#x27;ll sell it to me directly. If not, Google it (or ebay or Cragslist or Mercari or...) which is much easier once you know exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.')
