Is the group clearly defined on a list somewhere or are those sending money supposed to use their judgment? If you’ve been defrauded is that also illegal, making you a criminal as well as a victim? Or is only ransom prohibited? If my local car dealership commits some environmental crime by pouring motor oil down the drain, does this make it illegal for me to pay them to service my car there? What about if your neighbor’s kid is in a gang, but you want to set him straight and give him opportunity, so you pay him to mow the lawn: is that illegal too? What if the whole gang mows your lawn? And if the mafia is shaking down your business for extortion payments, does it make you more or less likely to talk to the cops if that makes you a criminal too?<p>There are answers to these, but it’s inherently a fuzzy area.')
