Him, his family, his lawyer Giuliani urged things like &quot;trial by combat&quot; for Trump&#x27;s enemies.<p>He timed his rally to end at 1pm, when the tally started down the road. He then sent his followers to pressure &quot;weak&quot; Republicans within the Capitol building for the purposes of urging the overthrow of certified votes in favor of replacing them with unilateral votes for Trump.<p>They brought zip ties. They called for Pence&#x27;s hanging.<p>Trump called Pence during the siege trying to pressure him, and the call had to be cut short because the insurgents were already inside the building.<p>This was a legislative and violent coup. Cry more about liberals in reaction to a literal coup attempt. Please, I want to hear more about how this is all antifa&#x2F;BLM&#x27;s fault some more. How the liberal agenda is a boot upon your neck while Trump&#x27;s followers attempt violent and legislative coups against the citizens of this nation.')
