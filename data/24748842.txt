In both Python and Julia if loading your data from CSV is a bottleneck you&#x27;ll do something else. If it&#x27;s not a bottleneck it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>If you&#x27;ve got a Python code base it would cost far more in terms of effort and dollars to convert it all to Julia than to just find a better way to load data. If you&#x27;ve got a green field project and CSV reading is a big portion of the task load then it makes sense to pick Julia I guess.')
