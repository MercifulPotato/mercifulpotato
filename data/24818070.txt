Like add up stats on frequency and severity of errors, maybe by time spent either developing or repairing per desired product, and use that as a metric of overhead.<p>For the language to be useful, it has to be useful to humans not just ais.<p>Otherwise the only use we could get out of something like that is maybe an ai could use it to write down a portable version of itself or anything else, which we could &quot;use&quot; only to store, replicate, &amp; reconstitute whatever the ai wrote.')
