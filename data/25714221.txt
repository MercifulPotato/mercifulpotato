Everyone pretty much needs to get this one correct. If you don&#x27;t it means you don&#x27;t know the subject matter.<p>b is a question to test what you have been taught. If you were paying attention and studying you should get most of the marks. It will still be difficult though and there&#x27;s potential to lose marks.<p>c is a harder question. The students that are advanced in the subject will be able to tackle it. You might be able to get full marks in some of the c questions but probably not them all. In most you will be able to get some marks for effort shown.')
