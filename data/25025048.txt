FishEye for one but also custom stuff like our customer database (so we can assign customers to issues), and in our build process (issues gets updated with built version automatically).<p>Not sure if those integrations would translate well to the cloud version.<p>There&#x27;s also something about owning your own data...<p>Besides, I found Jira ok enough speed-wise, but judging from all the comments on HN each time Jira is mentioned, the cloud version seems not fun at all.')
