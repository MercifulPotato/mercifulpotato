It is their code, they are free to license it however they want to. I love that they have already contributed open source software, and that they have committed to continuing to contribute CRDB after three years!  I probably won&#x27;t be using the BSL licensed version anytime soon, just like I avoid using the &quot;enterprise&quot; licensed versions of open core products.  But every person&#x2F;business has to decide what their business model is going to be.<p>I don&#x27;t think they should be stating that their license decision (versus the open source license they used before) doesn&#x27;t have any impact on most users, because I don&#x27;t believe that is a truthful statement.  It has pros and cons, like the the various open source licenses themselves have.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is fair to wave away the countless examples of profitable open source companies. Sure CRL and CRDB are unique.<p>I hope CRL is successful!  Perhaps one day they will figure out how to make their CRDB open source from day one again.  Perhaps one day I will be able to run a large, successful venture using open source software (and supporting it!).<p>No doubt business and software development are both challenging, regardless of what license or business strategy you choose!  I think that is part of what makes them fun!')
