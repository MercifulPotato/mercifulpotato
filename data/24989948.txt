The company told The Verge that there are additional variants for the Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Portuguese, and Japanese markets on the way. The Raspberry Pi is available in the US, UK, and France initially, with availability in Italy, Germany, and Spain starting next week. The company also plans to bring the Raspberry Pi in markets like India, Australia, and New Zealand by the end of this year.<p>So maybe there will be some Indian layouts? Note: I have no idea if that is a thing.')
