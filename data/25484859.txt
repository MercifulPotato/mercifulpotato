For others, the 5800X is slightly faster, with the exception of Monte Carlo Integraton scored 2.7% lower than M1.<p>&gt; Java DaCapo: 5800X is mostly faster by a significant margin, except for the H2O benchmark which is more than twice slower.<p>&gt; Python PyPerformance: Overall, the execution time is roughly the same, with the 5800X slightly faster. Probably a faster Python implementation like PyPy can highlight the differences better.<p>&gt; golang.org&#x2F;x&#x2F;benchmarks: The 5800X performs significantly better in all benchmarks, around 30% faster in most benchmarks and some are twice as fast.<p>&gt; Redis: The 5800X performs significantly better in all benchmarks<p>&gt; JavaScript Web Tooling Benchmark (v8): The 5800X is significatnly faster in most benchmarks<p>&gt; JavaScript Octane 2.0: Same story as above<p>I&#x27;d like to think my parent is a troll.')
