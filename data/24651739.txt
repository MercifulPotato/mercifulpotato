Programming &amp; creating software is not only my job but also a passion of mine. So far, I&#x27;ve done a little bit of everything and a lot of web - I’ve built websites (and CMSs) for various small businesses (15+), an HR system tracking employees’ time &amp; vacations &amp; more, an awesome RSS reader called Rosselo, several CRMs systems &amp; e-shops, co-delivered a large CRM system to a new customer and further extended and maintained the system, co-created an app for notes &amp; tasks called Notello and plenty more. At the moment, I’m maintaining and extending an RCS marketing platform at Hewlett Packard Enterprise but am looking for a change.<p>If that sounds interesting, let&#x27;s talk!<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; I have an EU company for invoicing, I speak fluent English and I know how to exit Vim :)')
