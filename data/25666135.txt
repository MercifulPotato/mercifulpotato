Item(by='prucomaclu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609983661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661629, text='I do believe the election was stolen.<p>This is because I have yet to see any honest attempt to refute the claims that have been made.<p>Refutations in the media generally boil down to &quot;its been dismissed by dozens of judges and is therefore baseless&quot;.<p>Very rarely have I seen the media try to address specific claims.<p>The courts likewise generally have dismissed on procedural grounds and not merits.  The rulings that have looked at the merits provide very limited rationale for their findings.  The claims are dismissed as baseless conspiracy theories without explaining why.  It does not provide confidence that the claims were honestly considered.<p>AG Barr likewise has not provided any transparency into his investigation.  It does not appear there even was an investigation.  Again, it does not inspire confidence.<p>Media likes to tour the cybersecurity official&#x27;s statement that &quot;this was the most secure election in history&quot;.  They fail to mention that he was specifically referring to electronic threats, and not fraud or other irregularities.<p>When you take all of the above into context, the media doesn&#x27;t feel like they need to address the claims being made.  The claims have already been addressed, they say.<p>But they haven&#x27;t.  There are hundreds of testimonies illustrating that entire counting centers were behaving contrary to law.  There are reports that adjudicated ballots were fraudulently assigned to Biden, and the challenges were ignored.  By law, challenges have to be recorded, and they weren&#x27;t.  It was escalated to supervisors and their supervisors who also ignored.  Again, by MI law, challenges have to be recorded.  Its not something where discretion comes into play.  The fact that fraud was happening and the people running that election center were ignoring challenges is evidence, to me, of widespread election laws being broken, if not fraud.<p>In court, their testimony has been dismissed as either hearsay (but won&#x27;t let them testify in court) or just dismissed as wild conspiracy theories.<p>The substance of their claims have not been addressed.<p>Then you have things like the State Farm video in GA.<p>What happened there may be legitimate but it looks suspicious as he&#x27;ll and the SOS&#x27;s explanations do not make sense.<p>We are told repeatedly that they did not tell the observers that counting was done for the night.<p>But that is contrary to:\n1. The affidavits of the observers\n2. 3+ media outlets reporting that night that counting there was put on hold\n3. The video which shows the woman telling people to leave\n4. The SOS&#x27;s own explanation for why ballots were placed under a skirted table.<p>For #4, the SOS said that election officials placed ballots under the table because they thought counting was done for the night.<p>He wants us to believe that the election officials thought counting was done, but the observers were to have just left on their own accord?<p>He should just admit that a mistake was made and they were told to leave.  It wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, but covering it up makes it worse.<p>Then of course the ladies are on video running the ballots, with no observers late at night, repeatedly being tabulated 3 times.  I don&#x27;t think the SOS ever did explain that part, and it happened at the same time there was a massive spike in Biden votes.<p>It might be a coincidence and be fully legitimate.  But the lack of transparency and investigation does not inspire confidence.<p>There are many categories of claims being made:\n1. Constitutional issues of SOS&#x2F;gov acting outside authority\n2. Poll watchers not allowed to do their job\n3. Individual observations of fraud and ignored challenges\n4. Dead people voting, nonresident voting, etc\n5. Statistical anomalies\n6. Hacking<p>Number 6 is baseless as I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence of hacking.<p>Number 5 is suspicious but doesn&#x27;t prove anything by itself.<p>Number 4 happens in every election.  Probably not enough to flip but hard to say with general lack of transparency.<p>Numbers 1, 2, 3 do have a legitimate basis and are fairly well documented, and account for 100s of thousands of possibly illegal votes.<p>Right or wrong, agree or disagree, these are serious issues that need transparency and resolution.<p>Sweeping them under the rug as wild conspiracies does nothing except create division and distrust.')
