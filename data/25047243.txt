The typical engineer got maybe a quarter of a percent of options on common stock. You’d think that would net out to $62.5K but we had a messy cap table. Various investments’ preferred status ate deeply into what remained for common stockholders.<p>Even if there were no cap table issues, the engineers wouldn’t have been happy, because they hung their hopes and dreams on a multi-hundred-million dollar exit. We experienced 90%+ engineer turnover over the next six months. (We got by just fine.)<p>Rule of thumb: do not join a startup for the money.')
