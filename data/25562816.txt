For that reason alone it won&#x27;t last.  But anyhow to talk to the subject matter:<p>I&#x27;m a recruiter.<p>I understand the feeling that this comes from.<p>Recruiters and recruiting don&#x27;t have a great reputation in general.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in WHY ghosting happens it&#x27;s pretty simple:<p>Recruiters have a vast flow of inbound information (resumes).<p>Recruiters are contingency paid - they only get paid if they successfully place a person into a job - this focuses time and effort down a very specific path.<p>Recruiters manage many many recruiting processes simultaneously, each with varying likelihood of success.<p>Employers are part of the process.<p>The whole process is lumpy and drawn out.<p>Eventually the recruiter gets to hear if a candidate is successful or not.<p>I personally try to get back to anyone who does any sort of interview, because it&#x27;s polite and I appreciate it cost that person time and effort.<p>Sometimes I don&#x27;t - that task falls through the cracks.<p>That&#x27;s all - that&#x27;s why it happens.  Perhaps some recruiters never get back to people but it&#x27;s not really in their interests to behave like that.<p>AND FYI - recruiters get ghosted too by employers for various reasons - I just try to be patient and understand and focus on the future.<p>ALSO I&#x27;m a recruiter and also a programmer - I once got ghosted after doing 12 hours doing a coding test ... never heard from the company again.  I know how it feels.')
