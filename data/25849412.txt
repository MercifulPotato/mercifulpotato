Keep in mind that there is the whole &#x27;profit margin&#x27; factor. At $699, the mac mini offers much better perfromance than the outgoing model while costing $100 less. Why chop even more money off it?<p>Apple&#x27;s cost in manufacturing has always been rooted in quality components and Software Engineering. They just don&#x27;t build low end models and likely never will. The fact that you can buy a $300 iPad is actually kinda weird for Apple.')
