Instead of choosing a longer, well maintained primary road to our destination, it chose a slightly shorter secondary road <i>through a high mountain pass</i>, where it was snowing like hell and obviously no ploughs were around.<p>I was a passenger and wasn&#x27;t involved in route selection, but the lesson is that it might be good to take time to discuss this before. Also, zoom out before driving and see high level plan instead of blindly following first-person view of the road. Or, you know, old school low tech solution: call the locals and ask for best road.')
