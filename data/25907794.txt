For example, Namecheap offers hosted email started at just $12 a year (with higher prices for more features).<p>Based on your experience or thoughts, do you think hosted email with your domain registrar is a good idea? Or do you think this is something to avoid? Could mail delivery be a potential problem?<p>The alternative is to buy a domain and then set up email forwarding (from your domain registrar) and create an alias with your current personal email account (Gmail, Outlook etc) for sending replies. This is free but it also means mixing business and personal email in a shared inbox. (Depending on your opinion this can be seen either as an advantage or a disadvantage).<p>So overall, which option do you think is preferable and why? Also any recommendations for domain registrar + hosted email providers much appreciated. Thanks')
