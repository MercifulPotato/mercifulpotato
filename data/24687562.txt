There are two possibilities:<p>- the official docker solution which is extremely complicated<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dani-garcia&#x2F;bitwarden_rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dani-garcia&#x2F;bitwarden_rs</a> which is extremely simple and just works. It includes everything for 0 EUR.<p>I still sent money to both projects because I think they did a nice work.<p>I find Bitwarden better than LP in handling Android (seems to be better at recognizing places it can fill in) and it is very complete in terms of what the product itself offers. I considered moving mu OTP (currently on Authy) there, up to the moment where I realized I need OTP for Bitwarden itself :)<p>Otherwise I have no complaints. The sharing part is excellent (much better than LP) - the only thing to be aware of is that once you &quot;share&quot; with a group, the elements is not &quot;yours&quot; anymore. It becomes truly shared within the group. Specifically you cannot &quot;take it back&quot;. While it was a bit disconcerting at first, I find it very logical in the long term. And use it extensively with my family.')
