Video or Photo?\nIt&#x27;s largely dependent on the task - you kinda have to balance speed&#x2F;quality&#x2F;postproductionrequirements.<p>For high-speed photos a popular choice is the Kodak Ps50&#x2F;ps80 -but it was discontinued like 2 years ago so you have to get it second hand. TBH, I&#x27;ve used the Epson FastFoto series for fast scans at 600dpi (useful when you have literally thousands you want to get through - a shoebox will hold 1500+ photos) and it has great quality if you set it up right (read: turn off any image post-processing and do manual correction). But beware of a few caveats: the rollers are garbage once they heat up and glossy photos will &#x27;stretch&#x27;. You can mod the rollers (kinda). The rolling action also causes some static buildup (thus: dust) and there&#x27;s no Digital ICE (image correction&#x2F;enhancement) to remove it.<p>For video, check the youtube video above for one option. I&#x27;ve found that you can get really good results with a Digital8 camcorder with a good Digital&#x2F;Analog converter. They existed in this weird sweet spot of the transition of analogue to digital. They often have RCA&#x2F;SVideo connections out to Firewire (yes.) Use it as a pass-through for a really good VCR (which are getting harder and harder to find).')
