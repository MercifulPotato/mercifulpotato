It is verbose because (a) C++ is verbose and (b) it insists on everything being inside a class. The latter is a reasonable choice given that the underlying VM needs some unit of linkage and scope ... sort of like criticising C and C++ for requiring that everything be inside a function, but there <i>are</i> reasons for doing it that way.<p>It&#x27;s true that Java&#x27;s designers are very conservative, and this is partly because there are many users who appreciate that their skills don&#x27;t get obsoleted all that fast (a lot of whom are in enterprise roles). But that&#x27;s more of an accident of a commitment to backwards compatibility and historically long release cycles. It&#x27;s not like they set out to make an &#x27;enterprise language&#x27;, they didn&#x27;t. It was originally meant for the embedded TV set top box world.')
