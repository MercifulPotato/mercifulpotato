The reality for not-so-well-doing families is a very different one, starting from there being no quiet place in the apartment, let alone for multiple kids at the same time, no equipment for home schooling, and parents being busy with work and not able to take care or help. These problems being amplified by the pandemic is tragic, to say the least, for a whole generation. It&#x27;s also extremely frustrating for those who&#x27;ve fought for inclusion and against social determination in elementary schools for all their professional life. This problem will definitely come back biting society.<p>There&#x27;s no lack of schooling software. In fact, preparing high quality digital materials for education in a &quot;literal&quot; style such that attendees could comprehend and change those themselves has been a major use case for 1990s (HyTime and SGML) media authoring systems, with high profile figures (TechnoTeacher&#x2F;Dr Macro) being editors or sitting on the board of said standards. But the truth is that as long as public schooling doesn&#x27;t get properly funded to pay many more teachers, there&#x27;s no chance to maintain education standards. Right now, in my country teachers are expected (or at least were expected in the latter half of last year) to be present in school <i>and</i> organize home schooling at the same time, all the while being exposed to Covid, which can&#x27;t possibly work. The priority of the school administration&#x2F;government seems to be to avoid giving any legal reason for a right to repeat years or appeal final exams because that would break HR and financial means.')
