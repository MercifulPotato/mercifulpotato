I seem to recall that a 35 mm slide contains around 10 megapixel data. If correct, is it at all useful to digitize at a higher resolution for general purpose usage, eg display on a computer or showing slideshows with a digital projector.<p>Otherwise I&#x27;m currently leaning towards digitizing at 4K resolution as a default, given that 4K is 8.2 Mpx.<p>How does dynamic range come into play? I seem to recall that slide film has a high dynamic range in general.')
