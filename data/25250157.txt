I imagine this is unpopular in HN, but what matters to me is just running on a good solid unix.  I don&#x27;t really care if it is a unix or Linux.  What I want is shell scripting, pipes, forks, make, python, awk, grep, find, du, df, etc...  Most anything that doesn&#x27;t come pre-installed can be built from source.  This wasn&#x27;t true in the early days of OS X, but now the only things I find that don&#x27;t work (that I care about) are tools that depend directly on devfs or other very Linux specific system APIs.<p>Unix command line driven tools are a big part of my work and the native OS unix does everything I need it do.  It seems a lot of people became committed to Linux coming from Windows with no unix system under the hood.  I suspect if Windows had been unix based like Mac OS, Linux would not have become quite so popular.  I&#x27;m sure avid Linux users will disagree, but for me the unix model command line interaction is what matters.  Go easy, I&#x27;m not trying to make an argument for one unix over another. Just arguing that the need for a capable unix is already met by the native OS.')
