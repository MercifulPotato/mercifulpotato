The security model of Bitcoin comes from proof of work, which most people complain as being waste. But it&#x27;s not actually waste. It&#x27;s secure because miners have to keep working hard and &quot;wasting energy&quot; because the network is worth protecting (and only if the network is worth protecting). With proof of stake, the stakers only need to make an investment once in the beginning, so it results in rich get richer, and the network is essentially &quot;protected&quot; by those who do not keep working hard to protect the ledger. This suffers from the same flaw that exists in the real world financial system. The whole system could collapse overnight like a domino if something goes wrong. It&#x27;s much more unlikely for something like that to happen for Proof of Work because miners invest heavily in constantly innovating and investing back into the network. To summarize, in theory Bitcoin is secure exactly because miners &quot;waste&quot; energy. Without wasting energy, all the protection is just a mirage.')
