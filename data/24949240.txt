No one is arguing that pharmaceutical companies should have to give their product away. We just donâ€™t like them preventing other people from manufacturing those same drugs.<p>&gt; Would you be happy to be forced to keep producing it at a loss to yourself?<p>This is also not what is being suggested.')
