GCC will happily not just optimize away your counter variable but perhaps even replace your whole loop with an SIMD operation; I suspect the Go compiler will do the same.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re trying to optimize for performance then looking at what code gets executed is (to first order) useless; the dominant factor is cache efficiency and you can&#x27;t see cache hits&#x2F;misses by reading the code.')
