If it sent a high output, change the weights so it sends an even higher output. Weaken connections that were inhibitory and strengthen connections that were excitatory. And for a neuron with a low output, make it even lower by doing the opposite.<p>If on the other hand prediction was wrong, then try to make the neuron do less of what it did.<p>Do you know if something like this has been tried?')
