I&#x27;ve been under the impression that NiMH batteries can deliver higher current than alkaline, but I&#x27;ve never tried them for something like a camera flash.<p>EDIT - higher end chargers can measure the internal resistance, which I think is the number you need for issues with limited power draw. With a BC-700 you can apparently approximate this by using its discharge mode and seeing how a battery&#x27;s voltage changes when you&#x27;re drawing power from it.
