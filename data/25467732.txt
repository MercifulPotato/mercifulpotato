In fact, a strong contender for the absolute worst codebase I&#x27;ve worked on was in Go. No type system is going to save you if you if you don&#x27;t follow pretty much any good practice. Conversely, well modeled systems can be coded in any language, as long as good practices and good communication are continuously enforced.<p>There are even studies on this and, so far, there&#x27;s no strong correlation between type system (or paradigm, for that matter) and number of bugs in a codebase.<p>In fact, one recent study on the matter ended up turning into a flamewar between two different groups of scientists, the ones who first published the study and the ones trying to replicate and double check the data... As discussions on type systems and paradigms are won&#x27;t to do. Evidently not even academia is safe.<p>I <i>wish</i> there actually were empirical evidence to support one&#x27;s preference in that area, if only to get rid of those flamewars that have been going on for decades. Alas, until that happens, what language one prefers mostly remains opinion or personal experience.')
