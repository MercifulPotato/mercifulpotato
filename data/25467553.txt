I&#x27;ve finally got one on order but it&#x27;s a pre-order and its earliest ETA is Jan 12th. I guess this gives me time to try and order the GPU I want.<p>It isn&#x27;t just CPUs and GPUs though. The cooler I want won&#x27;t be in stock until July per the manufacturer. I had to get lucky to get the PSU I wanted. People are employing crazy techniques to get each piece of their machine, not just the critical components.<p>Scalpers are magnifying the issue. The scalping problem will be solved eventually when supply catches up, but the longer that takes, the more stock the scalpers will obtain, thus prolonging the time window scalping will be profitable.<p>I didn&#x27;t know what I signed up for last month when I decided to do a build but I sure as hell wasn&#x27;t expecting this. I only need the GPU now so at least the end is in sight.')
