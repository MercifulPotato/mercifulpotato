Keep in mind, Tesla didn’t design or build the computers.<p>Cars use many more off the shelf parts, they have far easier supply chains to tap into.<p>Designing and building the CPU, GPU, camera systems, neural chip&#x2F;software, touchscreen, FaceID, etc. All of these components require way more competence to build than any single part of an electric car using an off the shelf computer.<p>Cars have more parts, but they are dramatically bigger, less intensely complex, less intensely integrated. Just the CPU alone of a phone puts an entire electric engine to shame in terms of difficulty of engineering.<p>So it’s an interesting comparison. But I’d put money on Apple making a great car before Tesla made a great computer.')
