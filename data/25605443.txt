It&#x27;s also a risk in that building on top of this design leaves you open to being de-platformed (like, for example with the iOS Store if Apple doesn&#x27;t like your application).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think Roblox or Zynga <i>are</i> immoral because of this, just that on this particular topic they are morally faulty.<p>My bar for what should be acceptable as a recourse is also not very high. Providing any form of alternative like LAN play, closed-source server software, specifications or interoperability with other software would be enough for me. The problem I see with the current situation is the &quot;last resort recourse&quot; there is now in most cases, reverse engineering, is legally shaky, generally against the terms of service, terribly complicated and expensive and not guaranteed to succeed if critical parts of the application are server-side.')
