Especially when I see what some people complain about.<p>There&#x27;s tons of legitimate criticism, pretty much pertaining to bugs but damn... I remember Skyrim being just as &quot;buggy&quot; but I don&#x27;t recall the reaction being nearly as bad.<p>I&#x27;m bias though as I&#x27;ve played on PC and had a phenomenal experience.  Last gen players should 100% get a refund.  Beyond that though, I just don&#x27;t see it.  There&#x27;s some other viable critisim but when I weigh that against what the game is I just don&#x27;t get it.  Its objectively the most detailed city in a first person action&#x2F;RPG.  It objectively has the most detailed quests:quantity.  I can excuse the bugs... again though, talking from a PC experience with 0 real bugs.  I can see how it would be annoying with bugs but I&#x27;ve played GTA and Skyrim, I can survive them lol')
