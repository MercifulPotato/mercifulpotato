They&#x27;re not bad once you clean them up with a sander and potentially planer and finish them, and they have a certain industrial aesthetic raw. They&#x27;re cheap enough that if you mess up or change your mind, you can throw them away and try again. And if you want to redo a piece of furniture, you can do that too. If you want to make a custom mount for something, just drill a hole.<p>Homes look surprisingly good when all the furniture is custom -- floor-to-ceiling wall-to-wall bookcases, desks designed for what&#x27;s on them, etc. -- even if it&#x27;s just cheap construction wood.<p>From there, you can move upscale. You can go quite far with Home Depot plywood sheets. Done well, they look great.<p>I have a mix of fine woodworking pieces (which take a month or two to do), to things which take a couple hours to throw together. And it feels awesome once most of the furniture in your home is handmade. And it&#x27;s a much better use of space.<p>Get a few 2x4s, a pair of cordless drills, some nice screws, a circular saw, a carpenter&#x27;s square, a tape measure, and safety glasses and you&#x27;re good to go to get started.<p>If you want to step it up a notch, get a random orbital sander, proper guides, (GOOD) clamps, a router, and a jigsaw. If you can at all afford it, buy NICE tools. Better beats more. I&#x27;d rather have a good Bosch cordless circular saw and drill than a full kit of Walmart toolkit. And they&#x27;ll cost less in the long run, with less damaged work pieces, and fewer broken tools.<p>Also, Youtube videos are great. So are online woodworking forums. Classes are nice if you can afford them, but hardly necessary.')
