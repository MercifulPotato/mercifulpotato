That has been going on since forever (_not_ a statement on the validity of the past election).<p>Foreign agent hacker compromised machine stories are more interesting and shocking maybe.<p>Still, after the Georgia recount you&#x27;d think they would have dropped the machine claims but they kept at it.<p>Where did those stories originate in the first place though? And why? Maybe some of this will come to light during the lawsuits.<p>Powell and Giuliani&#x27;s behavior and claims seemed pretty far out to me.
