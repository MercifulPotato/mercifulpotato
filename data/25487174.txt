But a lot of that commercial activity, e.g. most newspapers, simply wasn&#x27;t online at all at first. And the pioneers in that space found that they had to find ways of monetizing if they were to remain in business. (Which most of them weren&#x27;t really able to do so they went out of business or radically downsized.) I&#x27;d argue that, overall, people have access to way more information than they did 10-20 years ago even if some of that information is paywalled, geoblocked, or in some other form of walled garden.<p>The Internet (including the Web) of the mid to late-ish 90s may have been refreshingly non-commercial and open relative to today but it was also much smaller.')
