Those couple years where it was required to have unlocked bootloaders &amp; alternative Android OS spins were getting popular were so neat.<p>There is a Server Base Boot Requirements specification that should make installing os&#x27;es much more normal, requiring acpi support &amp; uefi, the x86 standards. Alas it has the word &quot;server&quot; in the spec. A pity. We can only hope consumer devices end up with similar user-respecting treatment.<p>I&#x27;m shocked to find that the maiome kernel situation is getting better. Few devices that, like x86, are general purpose computers that will let us install our own os or kernel, but kernel support has been getting much better.')
