Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=[25146586], score=None, time=1605763822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145396, text='&gt; In older versions of pip, it is possible for pip to install a package which does not satisfy the declared requirements of another installed package. For example, in pip 20.0, pip install &quot;six&lt;1.12&quot; &quot;virtualenv==20.0.2&quot; does the wrong thing, “successfully” installing six==1.11, even though virtualenv==20.0.2 requires six&gt;=1.12.0,&lt;2 (defined here). The new resolver, instead, outright rejects installing anything if it gets that input.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t there be a --force flag of some kind? I know there&#x27;s another flag, but the name &quot;legacy-resolver&quot; makes it sound like it won&#x27;t be around forever.<p>The situation isn&#x27;t so much asking PIP to revert to an old resolver, so much as it is telling PIP that I know what I&#x27;m doing and it should get out of the way.')
