Because the answer &#x27;not flawlessly&#x27; and the critique &#x27;sample size 4&#x27; (when there were &lt;100 cases in the country at the time!) support the answer you already had before your even read the article.<p>This is the conservative (and to be fair most people&#x27;s) response to information that disagrees with whatever narrative hold.<p>Coupled with the amplification of a conspiracy presented with no evidence &quot;masks are an exercise in political theatre and political control&quot; and you have the right&#x27;s playbook on pretty much every issue these days.  Climate change, abortion, economics, disenfranchisement - experts say one thing, the right pulls out slivers of factoids &quot;what about volcanoes and methane from cows&quot; &quot;what about pregnancies that have gone to 24 weeks&quot; &quot;what about communism&quot;, all micro-facts with almost no relevance to the overall discussion, designed to distract, enflame and stall in order to preserve the status quo.<p>On the left, there are similar issues, but at the end of the day, the left acknowledges and defers to experts on the subjects. The right has propagated such distrust and anti-intellectualism we have reached Trump as the ultimate demonstration of idolizing agreement over effectiveness.')
