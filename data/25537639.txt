I was thinking more that we can&#x27;t make a PC or server-style computer that would actually last 100 years, while in regular operation.<p>Also, 1980s calculators have much, much fewer moving parts than today&#x27;s computers. They don&#x27;t have any kind of active cooling, they don&#x27;t go through rapid heating and cooling cycles, they probably have three orders of magnitude less electrical components than a modern PC.<p>For me at least, all of the PCs I have had so far have had a few electrical components giving out after at most 10 years (usually some condensers leaked).')
