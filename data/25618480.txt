I absolutely don&#x27;t like the European Union and where it&#x27;s going.<p>The problem is that if you don&#x27;t have any incentive to make ends meet because you&#x27;re spending someone else money, slowly but surely you&#x27;ll have inefficiencies in the system.<p>Too many employees, someone making sure a public contract goes to a friend for more money than it should, politicians expensing flights right and left, a service being provided which nobody uses (think about some bus lines).<p>The same happens in large organizations where who&#x27;s footing the money doesn&#x27;t have visibility. The government is the ultimate giant corporation - with the added bonus of not having to make a profit!<p>We can&#x27;t say for sure how much money we&#x27;re wasting, but government spending always grows bigger and I don&#x27;t see public services improving or providing more value over time.<p>The last pandemic highlighted how much worse public health got in many countries in Europe. How did that happen and where did the money go?<p>An inefficient government starts eroding public services, spending the same and offering less, until there&#x27;s a big crash and then there is nothing.<p>We saw a bit of that in Greece, we&#x27;ll probably hear more from Italy soon.<p>I think we&#x27;re years away from a collapse similar to the one experienced by eastern European countries post Soviet   Union.')
