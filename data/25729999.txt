Google does remove websites from it&#x27;s listings.<p>There&#x27;s no relationship in what you&#x27;re saying. Parler is responsible for content on it&#x27;s platform. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s supposedly &quot;neutral&quot; or not.<p>Parler is a social media app, not a messaging app like signal. People don&#x27;t go to signal for their latest fake news, they would go to parler and be swayed by a mob of people that continually build off of each other&#x27;s aggressive behavior. It was a closed loop of people that didn&#x27;t like being told they&#x27;re wrong.<p>There&#x27;s nothing neutral about parler either, their user base is no mistake. It&#x27;s entirely intentional, you can&#x27;t hide behind &quot;freedom of speech&quot; when you&#x27;re marketing your platform for this behavior.')
