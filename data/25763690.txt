There&#x27;s a somewhat humorous running gag right now of conservative thought leaders suddenly complaining that their follower counts are going down.<p>And as far as Parler specifically: it didn&#x27;t &quot;suddently get popular&quot; in a vacuum.  Parler absolutely was functioning as a kind of &quot;ban evasion mechanism for Twitter&quot;.  People who got tossed from Twitter (generally, yes, for violent rhetoric) would find a home there, and bring there followers.  There was very little organic growth, it was effectively all cannibalized from Twitter.')
