The price that a consulting company can demand is only tangentially determined by the quality of the developers they have.<p>The people actually hiring these consultants usually don&#x27;t care much about the skills of the individual developers.  They&#x27;re concerned mainly about resolving the issues that led them to hire those consultants in the first place.   These often include things like:<p>1. Timeline.  Can this consultant start work immediately?  Do they have expertise in my tech stack, my industry, my regulatory environment, my particular business problem?<p>2. Politics.  Does this consultant have sufficient reputation that I can use it as leverage in my internal business politics?  Can this consultant navigate my company&#x27;s business politics in order to further my business agenda?  Can they produce the strategic documents&#x2F;guidance to help me support my business goals?<p>3. Flexibility.  Will this consultant work under terms that work for me?  Will they put a consultant on a plane Monday?  Or will they work remote?  Are they willing to adjust the contract to meet a level of risk I find acceptable?<p>The process of choosing a consultant is mostly a business transaction between business professionals.  The director of ACME&#x27;s marketing department is typically in no position to evaluate the resumes of the proposed consulting development team.  They&#x27;re interested in getting their project done on time and on budget while minimizing risk.  They&#x27;re not stupid, they just have a wildly broader set of concerns than code quality.')
