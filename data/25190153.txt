As soon as I see a pre-roll ad on Twitch I close the tab. Then I search for how to get around it and typically update uBlock Origin. Recently this happened regularly for about 2 weeks and then it stopped.<p>If they ever succeed I’ll just go elsewhere. I’m not spending one minute of my time getting brainwashed by ads.<p>I’ve also stopped Chrome from auto updating in anticipation of Google enforcing Manifest v3, which will cause uBlock Origin to break. That should give me enough time to figure out my next move.<p>This is a fun game for me :)')
