Knowing the initial design decisions, and being comfortable changing <i>anything</i>, allows me to be orders of magnitude more productive than when I&#x27;m diving into existing code designed by someone else.<p>I saw this perhaps most acutely with a company I sold - for a couple of years I was more productive than on nearly any other large software project I&#x27;ve worked on, because I knew the ins and outs of everything. The developers who bought it and took over are probably better developers than I am, and they are unquestionably excellent coders, yet it took a couple of years for them to get productive at making even medium sized changes. It became incredibly obvious to me how handicapped you are diving into something someone else made, especially if the original designer isn&#x27;t there anymore.<p>Meshing really well with managers &amp; PMs is probably the next biggest factor in my own experience, but it doesn&#x27;t come even close to the gap between being there from day 1 vs coming in much later.<p>&gt; Productivity tracking tools and incentive programs will never have as great an impact as a positive culture in the workplace.<p>I&#x27;m a fan of <i>choosing</i> to use time management apps and productivity tools to manage my own budgets. But I admit that I hate it when I have to do it for someone else.')
