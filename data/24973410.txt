We had some nimrod spend 8 months trying to get oracle to run on bare drives for our 100 tps (max) website.<p>They refused to let us use mysql or linux even tho the owner was very familliar with them from the ISP.<p>I think we spent 3x headcount on the hardware and software, eg we could have run for another 2 years had we been more scrappy. Not that the business idea was all that good.<p>We also got .3 on the dollar iirc.')
