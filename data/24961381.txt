We used to try and write complex macros to format the text properly (not sure if we didn&#x27;t know about RTF, or whether it was supported?), but it was always slow and painful. Then we found that if we used Find&#x2F;Replace to put something like a [BeginItalics][EndItalics] code at the end of the title, followed by a [BeginItalics] code at the beginning of the title WP 5.1 would ignore the second [BeginItalics] code and format everything properly. We immediately figured out that we just needed to add tokens in the text and then could format hundreds of pages of text in just a few seconds. Happiness ensued.')
