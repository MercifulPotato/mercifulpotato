Tell them to wear a mask and they wear a mask, they don&#x27;t organize protests instead. They also take hygiene seriously in their day to day life.<p>Another thing is that despite the population density, the Japanese naturally keep their distances. Not much handshakes, hugging, and touching each other unless it can&#x27;t be helped.<p>As for a &quot;different virus&quot;, it is very unlikely, but a different population, that&#x27;s possible. As I understand it, the Japanese population is relatively homogeneous, and they may have a genetic advantage.')
