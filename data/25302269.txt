This would be a nightmare for me. The high salaries and prestige of these companies definitely would not be worth it. I&#x27;m not neurotypical. I met an older man when younger who recognized this when he hired me so he left me alone. I worked at home and provided him programming solutions on my time schedule, which turned into millions of dollars for me and much more for him. I&#x27;m happy to let the fast programmers do the speed programming.')
