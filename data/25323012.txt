I like Swift but it seems the consensus is that&#x27;s nowhere near ready for server-side stuff. I&#x27;m leaning towards Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix&#x2F;LiveView for a project I have in mind, largely because I&#x27;m a (very) amateur developer and Elixir&#x27;s way of doing things clicks with the way I think more than Node, which is the only other language I&#x27;m basically competent with. Plus, I guess with BEAM, the Erlang underpinnings, and Ecto&#x27;s excellent PostGreSQL support, Elixir counts as &quot;boring&quot;, well-tested technology.')
