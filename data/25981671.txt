I understand that the odds are against me,  but really, the expectation even when accounting for variance, and adjusting for risk tolerance are a no brainer to me.<p>I made &gt;40% of my net worth in the first 2 weeks of January alone, and with GME I have multiplied my net worth by (&gt;tenfold). Yes I understand that these are &#x27;extraordinary times&#x27;, but accounting for everything. I have literally nothing to lose. I can fast for a week if I need to, I can walk instead of taking the metro. Whatever. I am not going to lose a lifestyle that I never had and I never had a safety net to begin with because being a 4 digit net worth student doesn&#x27;t give you any safety net.<p>Keeping track of my bets even before getting into this, I was right more often than not, and I am aware of survivorship bias and confirmation bias. In the limit, it makes more sense to spend 4-5 hours per day learning about market analysis,  observing trends close to me and making decisions about sectors&#x2F;fields that I know about.')
