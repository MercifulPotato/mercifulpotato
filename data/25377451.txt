Item(by='jschwartzi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607628471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377108, text='NWS is an amazing resource for pre-trip planning for a variety of different people. I frequently consult it for weather forecasts prior to hiking. I&#x27;m not sure a company like Accuweather could provide me with access to such great forecasts or sensor data as NWS does given how reliant they are on NWS data themselves.<p>The other problem here is that Accuweather charges huge fees for access to their forecasts and I&#x27;m not sure that I, as a private citizen, could afford that. So my choices go from pay a little bit of tax to get access to high-quality, reliable weather forecasts and warnings, to being totally unable to get access to this information without paying exorbitant fee. Or alternatively just not knowing these things and having to pay higher insurance costs for my ignorance.<p>This is a really good example of how making government smaller makes a lot of peoples&#x27; lives much crappier.')
