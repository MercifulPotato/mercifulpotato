It&#x27;s likely that in one place or another, some dev made an assumption about your `sub-container` class or whatever, which causes your change to break their layout.<p>Most large codebases thus end up with a TON of very specific class names (often used in one place), so the dev can be confident in their layout; this is the biggest contributor to unmaintainability that I&#x27;ve seen in large applications.<p>If everyone is forced to use e.g. d-flex justify-content-center .....  it hugely improves readability as any developer can quickly look at any layout and see what is going on without building a mental index of semantic class names that the original dev chose.')
