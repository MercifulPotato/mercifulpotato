I&#x27;ve been a remote worker for most of my career (2005-2020) with a 4 year stop in silicon valley where I worked in an office.<p>Those 4 years truly showed what I was missing and in 2019 I decided I was going start my own office and 5 of us started working out of it.<p>Since we were fully remote already we were already buying everyone nice desks, monitors, keyboards, chairs, etc.  at their home but not every home was great for home work even though we did our best.<p>I have a dedicated office space with 4 monitors, a standing desk, nice chair, ergonomic keyboard, etc.  but I still miss working out of the physical office.<p><pre><code>    - Morning chatter and basic social stuff is nice in a neutral area.  We do socialize over video calls too but its in your home where your dogs might be barking, your kids might be crying, your neighbor might be mowing his lawn, etc.   The mute button has become an extremely important part of work and that ruins the experience\n\n    - Separation of work and home. Doesn&#x27;t matter if its the holidays and in-laws are in town or your friend from high school is visiting for the week. Or you&#x27;re watching your friends dog for a week.  You still have a nice work environment to go to.\n</code></pre>\nIts nice not having a commute and being able to work from home but in general its only nice if you dedicate a large portion of your home <i>to work</i> and that isn&#x27;t always do-able.   How many people have a spare bedroom in their home that is quiet enough that children, dogs, and neighbor lawn work don&#x27;t disturb it?<p>I think everyone of our team misses the office even though we only had one for 1 year of the 4 for we&#x27;ve been in operation.')
