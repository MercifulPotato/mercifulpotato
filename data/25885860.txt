I opened up Github&#x27;s sponsor page, and stopped there.  There were thousands of projects, but I have no idea which ones are important to me, other than a few big ones.<p>It would be great if a tool existed that would look at everything I&#x27;ve installed via Brew(or your package manager of choice) and all the imports in my own Github projects, and follow all the dependency paths to the bottom, and then give me a report of how often a dependency shows up in that graph.<p>For example, I know ffmpeg is at the bottom of a few of my stacks.  But what else?  There might be a library that I rely on 12 different ways, but it&#x27;s so fundamental and deep in the stack that I have no idea.<p>It would be even better if this magical tool could then directly link me to the support page (or figure out if one even exists).<p>My other problem with all of these open source sponsorships is that it seems for some reason none of them support one time donations.  They all want me to sign up for a monthly gift (and I don&#x27;t even get to chose the amount).  I understand that that helps their cash flow, but that&#x27;s now how I donate.  I look at my income at the end of the year, set a target percentage, and then make all my donations at the end of December until I run out of budget (except for various fundraisers during the year).<p>And I know I&#x27;m not the only one who donates that way.  December is always the biggest month of gifts for charity.  They really should have an option for people like me.')
