Item(by='Diederich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608048647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431297, text='&gt; stop using them<p>Very quick thought experiment.  FB had about 70 billion in income in 2019, and 2.7 billion monthly users.  That&#x27;s $25&#x2F;user&#x2F;year.<p>So maybe transition FB to a paid platform?  In return, no advertisements, no tracking, no &#x27;adversarial&#x27; feed algorithms.<p>I know that a large chunk of monthly FB users would not pay, and that a lot of the problems aren&#x27;t from the algorithms, but rather with the groups and communities people form themselves, and what people share with each other.<p>I post pretty rarely on FB, and when I use it, I only look at particular people&#x27;s pages, so I&#x27;m not (directly) subject to the dreaded feed.<p>As some others have said, using it as described, my personal FB experience is pretty positive.  To be clear: I do manually follow a wide variety of people, across the socio-political spectrum.  There is a certain amount of noise but the signal is much higher.  And I will naturally tend to stop following people who primarily share&#x2F;reshare toxic crap.')
