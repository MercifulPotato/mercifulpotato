Item(by='devenblake', descendants=None, kids=[25385174, 25385217], score=None, time=1607691198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384689, text='1) Why is this an archive.org URL rather than a direct URL to the website, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;xscreensaver-5-45&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;xscreensaver-5-45&#x2F;</a>, when the content on each match each other?<p>2) The title seems editorialized. Correct title should probably be `XScreenSaver 5.45`. No way comes to mind to do a direct link to the content the original title (`Apple Censors XScreensaver`) references because it doesn&#x27;t have an element ID.<p>Also (and this is my opinion), this doesn&#x27;t really seem like malicious censorship. Apple&#x27;s just trying to curb misinformation surrounding the pandemic, it makes sense to do manual reviews for apps referencing it. Almost being unable to release the app from an older version of macOS is stupid but this kind of stupidity is par for the course with Apple.')
