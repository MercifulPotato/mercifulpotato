My opinion is that this is actually docker&#x27;s primary value-add. Yes, it enables who hosts of orchestration benefits, but it also makes it actually possible to just package these runtimes in a reasonable-ish way.<p>For platforms which support more self-contained binaries, I&#x27;m going to keep trying to avoid docker as much as possible.')
