I don&#x27;t really have any stats, but it seems plausible the logistic chains he oversees saved a fair number of lives in the current pandemic because it reduces the need for people to contact each other.<p>Given that record, I think there is a better argument for putting him in charge of the US healthcare system than putting the people in overseeing the healthcare system in charge of Amazon.
