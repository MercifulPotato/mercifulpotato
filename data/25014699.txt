Outside of JS, the tooling seems non existent.<p>What&#x27;s so amazing to me is that it is really easy to spin up a server that talks graphql in any language. But there is no client support.<p>And hand crafting queries is a million times worse than reading the rest documents<p>Oh, you want to get a list of items by owner, you can do that but you&#x27;ll also have to paginated the inside and outside list. And the client will have to follow these pages while also having a deep understanding of your model.<p>Without good client tooling, graphql is a nightmare.')
