NoSQL is not boring tech. As soon as you need to scale, it is MORE likely, not less, that you will end up in a weird state in your app, user enrollment flow etc. NoSQL makes scaling MUCH harder in my view. SQL tools give you a common interface many folks can engage with, and many tools.<p>I really want to talk to people building piles of spaghetti on noSQL because &quot;it scales&quot;. At some point you&#x27;ve just go to start tearing your hair out.<p>Postgresql can do 1.5M queries (read&#x2F;write) per second on OLTP loads on one box just to get started. If you really need more you can get extremely high with replicas. Then application design comes into play.<p>I&#x27;m tired of folks picking &quot;noSQL&quot; so things can scale. Dealing with all the edges cases as these things scale is a nightmare (plug mongodb and friends seem to fall over MUCH more often, recovery is miserable with them etc).')
