One of the POV&#x27;s is right and one is wrong. There&#x27;s no need to say &quot;some people say &lt;wrong thing&gt;&quot;. It&#x27;s just wrong.<p>That depends on what your goals are.<p>Let&#x27;s continue with the above metaphor, and assume &quot;rain skeptics&quot; make up half of the population.<p>If you want a chance of convincing them that things are more moist than would appear so -- then you get to invite their most credible voices to a stage which <i>they</i> agree is fairly moderated.<p>Not which <i>you</i> declare to be fair and as-unbiased-as-is-possible.<p>One which <i>they</i> agree is such. And, yes, that means both sides get to sacrifice in equal number several sacred barnyard animals.<p>Because if not, it doesn&#x27;t matter what is true or not true. Those rain skeptics will increasingly polarize against you, to the point where you simply can not reach them at all.<p>If you are fine with this, then you are presumably okay with green-lighting extreme measures to &quot;solve&quot; the &quot;rain skeptic problem&quot;, because that&#x27;s the road the United States is on right now.')
