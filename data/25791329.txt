I would love to have an integrated environment where client&#x2F;server doesn&#x27;t matter, but I don&#x27;t think this gets far enough. Working in a spread of html.erb with special tags plus some Javascript doesn&#x27;t feel great to me compared to React.<p>I like their TodoMVC app, since that gives a simple, minimal starting point. Getting persistence in that few lines of code is nice.<p>However, it has also at least one bug compared to canonical TodoMVC. I think the problem of this kind of too-clever binding is that it makes this kind of bug easy to introduce; whereas something with clear one-way data-binding like React, for all it can be verbose and annoying, tends to make it easier to get this sort of thing right.<p>(The bug? Click an existing todo to edit it, start typing, then press escape. The edit is meant to be discarded, but instead you&#x27;ll see a flash of the old value and then the new value is persisted. It&#x27;s not the worst bug ever, but shows that even in a simple app, experts can subtly screw up important behaviour.)')
