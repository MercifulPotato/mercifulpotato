The documentary made me realize that it is actually not him but all those Napoli fans that grasped him that caused his demise. If he were able to leave Napoli for a calmer retirement perhaps he would not become what he eventually became. It was the greed of Ferraino (Napoli FC President) which kept him in Napoli and caused him to become infamous, according to the documentary.')
