Bad-but-tolerable fiction gets ruined forever when you get better at spotting what they do and what it gets wrong...<p>I haven&#x27;t read the book you mention, but when I&#x27;ve read similar type of books before it&#x27;s definitively been annoying for a while, but then it goes to the background and it seems to usually just pop into my mind when I either spot particularly good or bad examples.
