This is why I think taxing advertising revenue is a good first step. It&#x27;s not banning things, it&#x27;s not stopping the industry from working. But it maybe will make people think more before spamming us all with irrelevant crap - the margins on advertising will change, and it&#x27;ll get more expensive, and so will need to be more focused.<p>Also, all the businesses that are real margin-calls on an advertising model if they clickbait the shit out of us will have to find something better. They&#x27;re going to have to do this anyway - the revenue from advertising is shrinking. This just speeds up the timeline. Oh, and newspapers are in that group.')
