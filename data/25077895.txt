Based on your flu data, those deaths are for 11 million symptomatic flu cases, vs maybe 1 million Covid-19 cases in May. And that doesn&#x27;t include asymptomatic flu cases (less often but still happen).<p>2. The numbers you&#x27;re showing for Covid-19 deaths are just for NY. The flu ones were at US level.<p>We&#x27;ll have to wait and see but I don&#x27;t see why the flu would be deadlier than Covid-19, for any age group.')
