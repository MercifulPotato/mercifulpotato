Using one SSO portal to handle mobile, spa, web apps and code auth with evolving techniques like PCRE. That&#x27;s probably why some customisations are not available too because it breaks the standard. You will just end up with the same models once you&#x27;ve implemented all the same features. Okta, Auth0 and others are all really similar because of the standards behind them not because they thrive to be complex.')
