You could say that during WW2 Germans weren&#x27;t particularly brutal compared to Soviets. Aside of death camps (which weren&#x27;t really Wehrmacht&#x27;s thing) you could probably even say that it was Red Army which was more brutal and committed more war crimes (if only by virtue of Wehrmacht&#x27;s better discipline).')
