I don&#x27;t recall). You can tag bits of content pretty easily (IIRC you prepend a # to any word you like). You then explore the contents of tags like channels. Public posts with tags then show up under those tags.<p>The SSB&#x2F;Patchwork creators were discussing a while ago that the network was actually content-centric. They described it as &quot;islands of content&quot; around which people navigated. I&#x27;m not gonna try to defend that, only to repeat it.<p>Anyway... I <i>think</i> this is distracting from the main point. It doesn&#x27;t _really_ matter if SSB wins out over HTML+CSS+JS+HTTP+RSS+ActivityPub+WebMentions or not. What matters is encouraging people to leave social media walled gardens by giving them tools and reasons to do so. Or, at the very least, somehow giving the content they create an easy means of escape, and bullying the gardens to open windows onto the wider world that don&#x27;t involve one-way tactics like OpenGraph.')
