What&#x27;s more, we all kind of know it - about ourselves, and about others.  But the difference is, people thought that rationalism was <i>possible and desirable</i>, and now they think it isn&#x27;t.  (Isn&#x27;t possible, at least, which renders moot the question of whether it would be desirable.)<p>We used to think that there were objectively right conclusions, and, if people were careful, they could be rational enough at least some of the time to reach those conclusions.  And now we don&#x27;t.  We now think that all truth claims are <i>only</i> about power, and <i>not at all</i> about actual truth.  There&#x27;s no point in even <i>trying</i> to reach the truth, because it isn&#x27;t there to reach.  It doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>And that&#x27;s a <i>radical</i> difference from the previous mind-set, whether or not the rationality of individuals changed.')
