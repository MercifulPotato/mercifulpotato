Like, okay, yeah, &quot;control my own data&quot; is a nice pitch in this day and age I guess, but... what can I do with it? &quot;Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid pod, including normal files like you might store in Google Drive or Dropbox&quot; - that sounds kinda useful, where&#x27;s the link to SolidFile? <i>Is</i> there even a SolidFile app or is that just a thing someone <i>could</i> make with this protocol?<p>Hell, where&#x27;s the front page link to check out the list of <i>any</i> apps using Solid? It&#x27;s like two or three random clicks to find this page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidproject.org&#x2F;apps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidproject.org&#x2F;apps</a>) if you are curious, and it&#x27;s super uninspiring - why does one of the apps in the &quot;Showcase&quot; section at the top not even have a <i>description?</i><p>Solid always just feels like a solution looking for a problem.')
