I won&#x27;t be surprised if they have teams that basically look at this part of making it difficult to alter core Android framework.<p>There&#x27;s LineageOS (been around for sometime; even more if you count its earlier avatar) and they are usually one or two version behind Google. OEMs are catching up with Android release schedule now because they usually don&#x27;t touch the core Google features and services (the privacy nightmare land) and usually just add to it and in some cases (unfortunately at that) tweak the UI (for the worse - Samsung has been at it since the day one).<p>One problem with Purism&#x2F;PureOS I see is, it is too small and started alone. I hope I am wrong but it may end up not going anywhere other than remaining a vanity phone - that &quot;other&quot; phone - the &quot;privacy&quot; phone.')
