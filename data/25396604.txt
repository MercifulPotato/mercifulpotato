At our company our network provider decided that it&#x27;s better for us to use ipv6 from now on. For one day the customer support couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong with our network. They even suggested that the recent heavy rain might have damaged the lines. Finally after a few struggles they mentioned in one sentence that they switched our region to ipv6 only, and that was when we, the customer, realized what&#x27;s wrong. And obviously, we have a business plan. So that was one day of work without any internet.')
