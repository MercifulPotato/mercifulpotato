Within certain groups, yeah, but that has been true to an extent for decades. AAA video games still skew to largely male audiences, and people don’t build their identities as much around casual games. Social media and music as a whole have more traction across cultural groups. If the argument is economic, then I guess Starbucks is equally important to human culture as recorded music is.')
