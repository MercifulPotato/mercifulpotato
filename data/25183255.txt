Quality in guitars (and other instruments) is wide enough that one might play well, while another of the same model plays like a worse, cheaper instrument. Buying a guitar untested&#x2F;online (even the same model you tried in store) has a large amount of risk that decreases with the instrument price, but not always and not as quickly as you might expect.')
