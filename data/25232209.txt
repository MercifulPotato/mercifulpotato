A couple things that crossed my mind...<p><pre><code>  Stress testing technology in the context of the worst moments in history might have illuminated what social scientists and propagandists have long known: that humans are wired to respond to emotional triggers and share misinformation if it reinforces existing beliefs and prejudices. \n</code></pre>\nMaybe the largest problem here is the appeal of popularity.<p>The effects of internet-brain used to be theoretical in my life. Over the past couple years, though, internet-brain has started claiming people near and dear to me. I have seen that reactionary propaganda, on social media, can persuade smart people whose personalities are not at all reactionary.<p>This has taught me that which, and how many, people share a message is more important than the actual content of the message. If enough of my family and friends are certain that sugar is a health-food, I&#x27;ll likely come to believe it is, too.<p><pre><code>  Trust in institutions is falling because of political and economic upheaval, most notably through ever widening income inequality.\n</code></pre>\nThe internet popularized cynical narratives about the world that remind me of Noam Chomsky or Hunter S Thompson.
