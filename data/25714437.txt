Although he had freedom of speech, he had no means to get his ideas out in front of more people. He had to resort to extreme measures<p>So like, Ted Kaczynski was basically victim and world owned him millions of views? And when Ted Kaczynski cant get those millions of views, he &quot;has to resort&quot; to killing people?<p>And if Ted Kaczynski had youtube channel and the channel would be ignored, would he still be entitled to kill people to get more views?')
