Its the same look those women get when they realize, &quot;Oh shit... it turns out someone who&#x27;s got 150 lbs. of muscle over me can fight off my puny attacks.&quot;<p>If guns were truly the ultimate force multiplier, military and police would never train for close quarters hand-to-hand combat.
