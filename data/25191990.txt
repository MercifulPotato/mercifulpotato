Item(by='JPKab', descendants=None, kids=[25192142], score=None, time=1606166009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191749, text='I support wearing masks, but have seen the science on outdoor transmission and don&#x27;t wear one on the very empty trails I hike on.  However, I saw a big flaw in your logic:<p>So it&#x27;s &quot;extremely obnoxious&quot; when the OP &quot;imposes their estimates of safety on others&quot;, and the correct response is for the OP to allow the misinformed estimates of safety of the others to require a mask be pulled up.<p>Why stop there?  Some people think that a neck gaiter or cloth mask isn&#x27;t enough.  Why not wear an N95 outdoors since some people &quot;wish to avoid having to pass people who aren&#x27;t wearing [N95] masks, even outdoors&quot;.<p>Who gets to draw the line between obeying the science vs obeying the theatrical needs of the anxious ignoramuses?  Surface transmission isn&#x27;t a factor with this virus, and yet I know a few folks who still insist on disinfecting every box they come in contact with.  They are welcome to do that, but it&#x27;s certainly not following the science.  Am I to cater to these people to?')
