These days the 1GHZ 32-bit AM3358 (BBB RevC) is comparatively much slower and with only 512MB RAM, that&#x27;s a lot less than a stock RPi 4.<p>Having said that, the BBBs are a great device!  They&#x27;re rock solid and have far better I&#x2F;O options than the RPi:  4 UARTS, multiple I2C, SPI &amp; CAN buses, EHRPWM, a ton of GPIO, 2x PRU processors, LCD driver, both USB and USB Gadget, oh and of course, the onboard eMMC is great compared to booting from an SD.<p>So I&#x27;m psyched about the Beagle-V.')
