Item(by='ssivark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602437192, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746577, text='&gt; Why can&#x27;t people just settle on some tech, let it mature, and enjoy reaching higher and higher in capability? Why do we have to always tear things down and start from scratch?<p>At what level of language improvement does it warrant rebuilding things? Eg: What if there has actually been a change as revolutionary as multiple dispatch based on a good type system, which cannot be backported to Python, and provides huge advantages for a diverse set of applications? For many users, it would be crazy not to switch... especially given that it’s actually much easier to write performance and flexible libraries in the Julia ecosystem (writing Julia code) than in the Python ecosystem (writing C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Cython code).<p>You might be succumbing to a bit of the blub paradox here... Python might be good enough for all your needs, but people are justifiably enamored with Julia because it brings some really exciting capabilities to the table which allows them to solve serious impediments they experience, not just because it is a shiny new thing.<p>Rhetorical question: Now that we have all this infrastructure for gasoline based cars, is that reason enough to hold back the “churn” to electric cars?')
