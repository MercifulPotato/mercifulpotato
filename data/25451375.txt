It&#x27;s just a slap on the wrist, and these people will just continue screwing the rest of us over because there are no personal consequences for them.<p>Any fines that Google and Facebook pay will just be extracted from the consumer.  Breaking up the companies won&#x27;t actually keep them from doing the same in the future, nor will it actually penalize anyone who was involved.<p>So, yeah, I do think jail time and asset forfeiture from those responsible (if they are guilty) is fair and just.')
