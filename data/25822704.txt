The total mass is essentially irrelevant, what matters is the mass of individual objects.<p>&gt; <i>Or, at least they are in orbits where danger from natural debris is vastly greater than from space junk.</i><p>Are you sure? A quick online search reveals only two satellites appear to have been destroyed -- an Iridium satellite was destroyed in 2009 when it was hit by a junked Russian satellite, while in 1993 the European satellite Olympus was destroyed by a meteor.<p>So it would seem that so far, natural debris and space junk are tied 1-1. Why do you think natural debris is that much more of a risk?')
