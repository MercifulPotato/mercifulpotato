We found it very hard to accurately answer the questions for a SAAS company that collects data in an obvious way to provide service. It should not be a surprise to anyone that companies are taking some time to answer, and also see if Apple makes any relevant changes post launch, and also to let customers get used to seeing these notices in other apps.')
