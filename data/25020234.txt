Thankfully it was rejected but it’s concerning so many people seem to accept such repugnant behaviour if the general policies align with their own politics.<p>I mistakenly thought the line was way further back than it actually is and I just wonder where the line actually is.  Trump wasn’t the line, the population could stomach worse.<p>Either way, I think voting for Biden on the “not Trump” basis is fine, and ultimately the blame for the what some voters see as an empty dichotomy lies flat at the feet of the short sightedness of the Republican Party.')
