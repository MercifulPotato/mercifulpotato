On Intel, the firmware itself is verified by the Management Engine. Measurements of these roots of trust may be passed to the TPM, but the TPM isn&#x27;t in a position to do much with that information other than report it back at a later point in time - otherwise firmware updates would invalidate your root of trust.')
