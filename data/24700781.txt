I thought the point of a PaaS was getting a Platform - as a Service. I don&#x27;t interpret that to mean having no control or limits on potential costs. To me a PaaS is about not wanting to manage a the metal or infra under the app. Which i don&#x27;t think is misguided or inaccurate.<p>To look at it differently: I am a customer to someone. I am a customer who wants to buy a product that manages all of the infra for my application. I also have a limited budget, and the notion of an unlimited budget is an instant no for me.<p>Call the XaaS whatever you like, but my motivation is clear. Maybe DO doesn&#x27;t want me as a customer (if what you say is true about PaaS), but i think there&#x27;s opportunity there for a new XaaS.')
