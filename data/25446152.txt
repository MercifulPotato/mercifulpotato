That may not sound much, but it is a significant fraction of the 9.36% of women in the sample who did become third-time mothers.<p>&gt; The authors also made two other pertinent observations. The reduction they saw was confined to households that did actually have access to a car. And it was larger in households where a man was living with the mother. The latter point is relevant, they think, because this man would take up space in a vehicle that could otherwise be occupied by a child.<p>Yikes. The front passenger seat is not an acceptable place to put a car seat anyway.')
