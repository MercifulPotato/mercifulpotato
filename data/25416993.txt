It seems today if persons &#x2F; groups have an ideological opposition in anything, they must treat their opposition as if they are immoral and completely banish them from their lives</i><p>When was this mythical time? It wasn&#x27;t too long ago when abortion clinics were being bombed and abortion doctors were gunned down at their homes and places of work. In living memory are periods when anti-war and civil rights protestors were set upon by dogs and firehoses. Gun companies were boycott for cooperating with gun-control measures. There was the whole South Africa divestment movement. PMRC was doing it&#x27;s best to &quot;cancel&quot; rock &amp; rap, Terry Rakolta was doing her level best to get Married with Children kicked off the network.
