LaTeX kind of sucks (which is not really Knuth&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot;, since he only invented TeX and not LaTeX), the syntax errors can be very annoying (trying to hunt for that one missing paren or $...), packages constantly break other packages and totally absurd ways, and worst of all, the maths commands are entirely non-semantic (I&#x27;ve tried parsing maths expressions from LaTeX, it&#x27;s not pretty), etc.<p>It&#x27;s just that there is nothing better for maths right now, and even if there were, good luck fighting all the institutional inertia.')
