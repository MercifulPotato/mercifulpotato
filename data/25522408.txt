NO GOOGLE that&#x27;s not what I wanted at any point...thanks for assuming you know what information I want, again, even in incognito. &quot;directions to work campus&quot; always sends me over a toll bridge when I have no tolls selected as my default!<p>Maps, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is a dead product already. It won&#x27;t show me the closest local places at times, or refuses to show me other locations. It editorializes my searches, and gives me bad directions. I quite honestly cannot wait for a better alternative in an app. I wish HERE Maps had survived the Nokia acquisition.<p>MapQuest got my back though. :)')
