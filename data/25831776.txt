That certainly gives it some more context, I appreciate it - shame that even community created &quot;covers&quot; need to be covered by copyright now, since they&#x27;re often quite transformative, but I guess this is the world we live in.<p>The articles I read on this at the time were putting it in quite a negative light, that must have had an impact on my judgement - either way, I&#x27;m happy that you&#x27;re successful with this model and that you can make scoring music more accessible with your open source software. (I&#x27;ve used musescore from middle school through university, so it&#x27;s definitely had an impact on me!)<p>Apologies for making unsubstantiated comments and thanks for clarifying.')
