I don’t really virw security cameras as a smart home thing.<p>Anyway, most people I’ve seen try to create a smart home end up spending a crazy amount of time managing it, while rarely using the stuff. I see it as adding complexity to my home, rather than making it simpler. Want to watch a movie? Close the blinds. Just set the timer on the washing machine, you don’t need it to be internet connected.<p>Interoptability is still low between manufacturers, price are to high and life time to sort. I was at a Microsoft presentation where they happily told us that their IOT OS woul get 10 years of security updates, great, but that it the absolute minimum I would expect for something like appliances, and no where near what I would demand for something built into my house.<p>It’s a gimmick because you need to interested in managing it and keeping it updated, which I am not. There’s enough complexity in our life, let’s not add more.')
