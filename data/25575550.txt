Sometime even earlier. More strange is that this is with kernel panic. Sometime it freeze and i can&#x27;t SSH to it, but i can ping device! I couldn&#x27;t figure yet why. Maybe i finally should get some RS232 USB connector and connect with serial.<p>On other side - i have few RPi&#x27;s that works with month without issues.')
