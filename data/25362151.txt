Item(by='wglb', descendants=None, kids=[25364625], score=None, time=1607539019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25354188, text='&gt;my gripe is that they are implying, like every other company that gets breached, that only a nation-state has the resources to pull off such an attack with their wording.<p>I feel that with respect to FireEye, that it isn&#x27;t just an implication; more that they would claim this with strong evidence. They are about attribution.<p>I think this argument is making some false equivalence. Just because every other company that was breached (e.g. Equifax) claims &quot;Wow State Actor Sophisticate Beyond Anything Before Seen By Man&quot; for something as simple as failure to update your software leaves a yawning hole has tarnished the dialog for those who know what they are doing.<p>While CSO at Relativity, and now for my clients, I strongly suggest that you don&#x27;t use the phrase &quot;Security is Very Important to us&quot; since that is the first thing out of the mouth of companies who didn&#x27;t until they got hacked.<p>&gt;Do you think a penetration test of 3 engineers working fulltime for a year would fail to materially breach FireEye&#x27;s corporate systems?<p>Bluntly, yes. I expect that their defenses are much better than most companies, including security companies.<p>&gt;I have literally never heard of a single person in enterprise security who has ever dared to make such a remark on the record<p>Enterprise security is in a different category altogether. Few non-security enterprises will withstand much of an attack. FireEye is in a different category altogether.<p>If you are interested in the topic, a useful book to read is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Incident-Response-Computer-Forensics-Third&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0071798684" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Incident-Response-Computer-Forensics-...</a>. I think this is more informative than these BOEC cost calculations.')
