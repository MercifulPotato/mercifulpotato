With the same notions of dendron operating only in VSCode. Long story, it didn&#x27;t fit well for me. While dendron operated and was structured well, VSCode was just too slow to launch and not widely available enough for my use case. May be important to note though that I don&#x27;t &#x27;live&#x27; in VSCode like many others do. I settled on other applications which allow me to directly interact with the files inside and outside the application.')
