The former is even hosted in privacy-friendly Norway, and its 5 TB unlimited with going over that you get upload-capped. So I pay 90 EUR&#x2F;year for Jottacloud. Which is approx 10% of your projected 1000 USD.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jottacloud.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jottacloud.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zfs.rent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zfs.rent&#x2F;</a>')
