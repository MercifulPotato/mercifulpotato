Conservatives are normally champions of corporate freedom, they never had a problem with the extreme bias on cable news or talk radio, but now that big tech companies have eclipsed the platforms they dominate they cry foul. AWS isn&#x27;t an ISP, but if conservatives hadn&#x27;t destroyed net neutrality they might have a legal leg to stand on when ISPs inevitably refuse to give them a business contract so that they might house their own servers. I think they deserve this outcome for being persistent bad faith actors in this regard, but I&#x27;d be happy to see a restoration of net neutrality now that conservatives are selfishly motivated to support it.')
