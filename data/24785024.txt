Item(by='jecel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602737030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24780482, text='In late 1981 I built a computer around the Z80, TMS9918A (actually 9928A as I wanted PAL-M output) and the TMS5220 voice synthesis chips. I called it &quot;Einstein&quot; and only found out decades later that there was a computer from Tatung with the same name, processor and video chip that sold in the UK in 1984. Great minds think alike, it seems...<p>I was not able to get a datasheet for the 9918 and had to abandon the project. In early 1983 I did get a nice book from Texas Instruments by asking them to send it to an address in the US, but I only skimmed it. That was a huge mistake. A few months later I started a new computer project for the Logo programming language and remembered that Logo in the TI99&#x2F;4 kept &quot;running out of ink&quot;. There were only 256 different characters which could be redefined but the screen was 32x24 = 768 characters in size. So 2&#x2F;3 of the screen had to be blank as the turtle moved around it. So I went with the Motorola 6883&#x2F;6847 combo instead (the same as the TRS-80 Color Computer).<p>It so happens that the TMS9918A used in the TI99&#x2F;4A has a new mode that the TMS9918 didn&#x27;t: you can divide the screen in 3 with a different character set for each part. That would have given me Logo with infinite ink.')
