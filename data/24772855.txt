What is the meaning of that term? I couldn&#x27;t find it explained anywhere.<p>I found that both of my accounts gave nearly identical results. Interestingly enough my wife&#x27;s account also is nearly identical to mine through the first half of the results and the last 6 entries are in identical order and similar percentages. Did I accidentally find my match all those years ago?<p>Maybe something in the way this algorithm is designed pigeonholes everyone into similar groups. It&#x27;s pretty hard to trust something when so many people from such different backgrounds get similar results.')
