R was the dominant open-source language for data science, with Python very close behind (and already gaining ascendancy among folks who identified with &quot;machine learning&quot; rather than &quot;data science&quot;). I remember Matlab&#x2F;Octave being more associated with academics&#x2F;students in EE (signal processing, wireless communications, and the like); if you want clear insight into matrix operations, Octave is great.<p>I think Ng made a very conscious decision at the time to eschew built-in functions and not get distracted by trendy languages - hence the use of Octave to learn how to implement algorithms at the most basic linear-algebra level.<p>Even at the time his decision was not well understood nor popular - way back then I remember people asking &quot;Why Octave instead of R or Python?&quot;')
