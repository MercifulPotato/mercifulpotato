You want to be a &quot;platform&quot; like Amazon, but you don&#x27;t want to build everything necessary for a &quot;platform&quot; to be a platform. That is the crux of the problem. If what you really want is simply free speech, well that&#x27;s free. If all you really want is a website, well that&#x27;s pretty cheap too, but maybe not free. But when you start talking about <i>platforms</i>, you have to pay to build the platform you want. Even a soapbox is not free, someone somewhere had to pay for it.<p>You&#x27;re complaining that building a platform is too expensive the same way someone a hundred years ago may have complained that buying the presses is too expensive. It makes no sense. If you want to print your own paper, you need the presses.')
