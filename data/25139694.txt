The idea that moderate alcohol consumption is &quot;healthy&quot; or beneficial in some way is a misunderstanding of their data.<p>What we see is the following:<p>People who drink no alcohol at all <i>and</i> people who abuse alcohol have, generally, poorer health outcomes than people who drink, but do not abuse, alcohol.<p>The poor health outcomes for the alcohol abusers needs no explanation.<p>It is the poor health outcomes of the abstainers that is misunderstood:  they&#x27;re simply not robust, or constitutionally enabled, to drink even small amounts of alcohol without feeling bad.<p>So my conclusion is that the abstainers are not having poorer health outcomes because of the absence of alcohol - <i>they&#x27;re having poorer health outcomes anyway</i>.')
