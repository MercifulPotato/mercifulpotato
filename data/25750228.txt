However anecdotally it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve observed to be true. In my above mentioned example, the people with the most and strongest relationships throughout the org were not the most upwardly mobile, nor was there a correlation with positive attitude.<p>Rather, aligning yourself with the correct (choose wisely) new executive and being a yes-person even to things that you know might have long-lasting negative impacts on the company (and thus your peers) was too often the winning strategy. Even then, it&#x27;s navigating a political minefield, and one misstep could spell disaster.<p>The approach tends to put personal gain ahead of the well being of the company.
