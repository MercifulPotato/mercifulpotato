You could of course say that they just did that to achieve the best results, but that would be precisely my point. They employed the Kroomen based on what worked best, by the merits of the circumstances and not some arbitrary racism.<p>Later on, the use of the Kroomen was abandoned, for mostly non-sensical reasons, to which the author surmises was most likely due to the rise of pseudo-scientific race superiority theories. In other words, they no longer employed people in their navy, despite their usefulness, because the merits weren&#x27;t enough to overcome their bias.<p>But I do agree with you about the daughter thing.')
