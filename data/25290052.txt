There&#x27;s always a bit in the boilerplate that&#x27;s akin to &quot;you agree to everything here, even the unenforceable bits. If we&#x27;re ever challenged on the unenforceable parts after the fact, you still agree to be bound by everything else here.&quot;<p>IA[very_much]NAL, but to me this always sounds like &quot;We can and will stick whatever nonsense we want in this contract, whether the terms are illegal or not, and you will be bound by them for as long as we can get away with it. If you do ever discover the illegal bits, that doesn&#x27;t void anything else (including any other illegal bits you haven&#x27;t found yet!) and you can&#x27;t sue us- you&#x27;ve given up that right and can only use a mediator from our approved list. May the odds be ever in your favor.&quot;')
