Item(by='GiggleLiu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602443195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746459, text='NiLang requires every instruction being reversible, e.g. `SWAP` and `y += f(args...)`. The back-propagation is implemented on a limited instruction set. It is different with Neural ODE because neural ODE does not back propagate the program step by step. Some time reversible integrator can utilize the reversibility (with NiLang) to save memory. e.g. the leap frog integrator for symplectic systems.')
