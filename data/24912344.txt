The trick is then to NOT accept that as input, but instead demand that they remove the separator and jam it in as just digits. &quot;<p>It&#x27;s easier to just strip non-digit characters than to parse the input for them and respond accordingly. This is a confirmation step with basically a checksum, so you&#x27;re not going to get many false positives.')
