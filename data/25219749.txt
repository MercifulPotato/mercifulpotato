I want the state to focus on programs that reduce the need for individuals like me to have to focus their energy on anything else.<p>In practice, this is stuff like equal access to healthcare, education, childcare, social security, time-off...<p>In the US, access to these things is not a given, and they often end up as rewards, distributed very unevenly.  ...Even worse, this leads to anxiety&#x2F;worry&#x2F;focus by individuals like me to try and fix or mitigate those problems.<p>As you mention, the scale of change in the way the US operates seems unlikely anytime soon; at least for me, removing myself (my skills&#x2F;labor&#x2F;knowledge) seems like as good a way as any to try and coerce change.')
