If I were a child and could choose, it might make sense to choose Canada.  But children don&#x27;t usually get to choose.  When do you choose?  For many people, when they graduate from college.  At that point, you&#x27;re from Canada and don&#x27;t have student debt.  Great!  Wonderful!<p>But the salary is still higher in America.  So you can go to America without the student debt, and <i>still</i> get the higher salary.  And why not?  (You could think of this as arbitrage between two ways of structuring society economically.)<p>But maybe the thing to do is to go back to Canada when you have kids, so that <i>their</i> university won&#x27;t load them down with student debt.')
