I am left to wonder how &quot;please don&#x27;t call me that&quot; is not sufficient to end these discussions.<p>For non-Germans reading along, &quot;Neger&quot; used to be a common word, but is not anymore. Language is changing, society is changing, but as always, some will be left behind. If your grandpa says &quot;neger&quot; you gently correct him, if your peer says &quot;neger&quot;, you are in bad company.<p>&quot;Zigeuner&quot; is less extreme, because awareness for the term is more recent. I was told in high school 15 years ago to avoid it, so everyone should have gotten the message by now. It shows a lack of education, mostly. Germans killed 200k+ Romani in the last century, so it not a wild claim that when our grandparents cautioned us about Zigeuner, that might have had something to do with racism.<p>(20 years ago I had friends who called Schokoküsse &quot;Negerküsse&quot;, and my parents told me not to do that. I simply do not understand why people insist on calling them &quot;Negerküsse&quot;, when they know it&#x27;s hurtful to some. It&#x27;s a shitty sweet targeted at children).')
