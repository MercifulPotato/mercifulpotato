We&#x27;re using F# in prod (about 200K LOC) and it has been great so far.<p>We also use F# for two react front ends with fable (F# to JS compiler). More new alternatives for using F# in the browser (FsBolero&#x2F;Blazer) via web-assembly or running it server side like Phoenix live view also exist.<p>One issue we had with Fabel is how .NET DateTimeOffsets are handled on the Client side.')
