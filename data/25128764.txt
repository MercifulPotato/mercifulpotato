You might consider it just sad...<p>Preface: my style could be considered wanting when it comes to picking out my own clothes. Many years ago, I did a complete refresh of my clothes because nothing fit and everything was well-worn. So I took a buddy whom I considered stylish to Nordstrom&#x27;s and he, along with the salesperson, took what I gave them as my budget and general requirements to pick out a complete wardrobe. They did so. However, there were so many different items and colors and I didn&#x27;t know how to mix and match. So my friend devised the following list which I still keep:<p>Matching:<p>Yellow Polo goes everything but black (blue and mocha best)<p>Blue check goes with gray and stone (blue and stone best)<p>Dark tan herringbone goes with black, camel, tan, stone (olive and mocha ok)<p>Camel (shiney) goes with tan, black, mocha, and olive<p>Camel (short-sleeve button down) goes with mocha, olive, and black (tan is average)<p>Eggplant&#x2F;Plum button down goes with blue, black, gray, camel, mocha, and tan<p>Taupe goes with tan, stone, black, and camel (not blue)<p>Purple goes with tan, stone, black, camel, blue, and mocha (not olive)<p>Blue&#x2F;Gray (slate) t-shirt goes with tan, black, and navy (stone is best and camel is ok)<p>Sky blue t-shirt goes with everything but olive (tan and stone are best, black is ok)<p>Burgundy t-shirt goes with everything (olive best)<p>Olive&#x2F;Green t-shirt goes with stone, tan, black, camel, and mocha (olive is ok)<p>Black pants always black belt<p>Tan (with black) -&gt; black<p>Tan (with lighter&#x2F;softer) -&gt; brown<p>Yellow -&gt; brown<p>Tan goes with either<p>Herringbone goes with either<p>Green -&gt; brown<p>Mocha will almost always wear brown (except if black pants, then either)<p>Black and blue pants will be black shoes except for light shirt (e.g., yellow)<p>Stone will more often go with brown except with purple and black shirt (though not necessary)<p>Treat gray as black<p>Socks always match pants or darker<p>Earth tone pants with black socks ok in bind<p>Don&#x27;t mix belt and shoes<p>Served me many years. Sadly, none of those clothes fit me anymore. So here I am again...')
