He is an EV fanatic and that was his first car.<p>There is a private network of charging stations in our area. He has a few stories about them.<p>One time he arrives at a station that disconnects him after 5 seconds. He calls them. Customer service says it&#x27;s functional and nothing is wrong with it. He asks them to look up the previous charges. They all disconnected after 5 seconds. Coincidence!<p>He goes to another broken station. He calls them. Apparently they&#x27;re not aware of it being down right now, but tell him it&#x27;s a recurrent problem with this one. Nothing else is done.<p>He breaks his own rules and takes his chances on a charging station without having enough charge to go to another one in case this one fails. Sure enough, it&#x27;s broken. He call them. He has to get towed to the next station, and they will pay for it, but that doesn&#x27;t include his own transport. He has to pay for a cab himself.<p>He gets to another non-functional charging station. He calls them. They tell him it&#x27;s a compatibility issue with his car despite him having used the same ones for the past 5 years. There is nothing else they can do for him. He asks to speak to someone higher up and to pass on his complaint. He never hears back.<p>He wasn&#x27;t even discouraged by the long recharge times. In the end, it&#x27;s because he was tired of being late to appointments and having to worry about this crap all the time.')
