Get rid of zoning so people and build whatever they want and get rid of   registration BS.<p>If someone pays money to register something it shouldn&#x27;t be the state&#x27;s concern whether it&#x27;s a car or a fork lift, moped or a bike, as long as it fits in the lanes and has the right lights they should be able to drive it on any road on which they can keep up with traffic.<p>Nobody wants to do 40 on a moped on the interstate with traffic speeding by.  Market solutions for both these problems have been proven to work well.')
