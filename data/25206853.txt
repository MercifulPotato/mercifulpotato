Public people that routinely engage in good faith arguments, with carefully considering opposing viewpoints, scrupulously and honestly analyzing evidence and making conclusion based on the strength of the argument presented - are routinely attacked for being harmful to whatever cause the activists prefer, not seeing the larger point, enabling the $BAD_GUYS, playing into the hands of $MORE_BAD_GUYS, being motivated by $ISM and $PHOBIA, and get whole online communities organized with a sole purpose of bringing them down, deplatforming them, de-employing them and generally getting them to stop what they are doing.<p>OTOH, the bad faith arguers are getting praise in the media, adoration from their peers, popularity, well-paid speaking opportunities, pompous awards and get their bad argument - which is usually much simpler and palatable than a good one - endlessly repeated and praised. Sometimes even taught to large groups of people as the paradigm they have to conform to from now on.')
