A long-ago summer job was running those machines to make things like mirror rims and taillights. I still have a couple of the fantastic blobs produced when changing over from one job to another.<p>One of the things that struck me then is how much the line workers were treated like furniture, when many of them were quite sharp. They took such pride in getting things done well and at speed, in continually improving. I really wish I could put that kind of data in the hands of a couple of the people who trained me. Just an app on their phones. Spending 40+ hours&#x2F;week on a machine means you really get to know it. I&#x27;d love to see how many of them would get great first-pass analysis and remediation.')
