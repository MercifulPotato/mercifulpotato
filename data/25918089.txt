You might improve median performance,  but people don&#x27;t &#x27;experience&#x27; median performance in most cases (it goes by too fast for them to actually experience it),  they &#x27;experience&#x27; the 5% of requests that are the 95% worst,  and if they make 100 requests to do a task,  5 of them will go bad.<p>People are miseducated to think caching is always a slam dunk and sometimes it is but often it is more nuanced,  something you see in CPU design where you might &quot;build the best system you can that doesn&#x27;t cache&quot; (and doesn&#x27;t have the complexity,  power and transistor count from the cache -- like Atmel AVR8) to quite a bit of tradeoff when it comes to &#x27;computing power&#x27; vs &#x27;electrical power&#x27; and also multiple cores that see a consistent or not view of memory.')
