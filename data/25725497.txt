The part that scares me is this:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a mistake for the Democrats to obsess over blaming and castigating those people, instead of focusing on convincing them, swaying them, educating them, peeling away voters and ultimately delivering real life improvements (the big part of that) if they truly believe they have a better path to offer for their future.<p>What if there simply <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a better path? Between automation and foreign competition, it might simply not be possible to return to an economy like the one we had post-WWII.<p>This is where everyone comes along to tell me about UBI, but I think this is not addressing the problem. A lot of people don&#x27;t want to be handed free money, they want opportunities to work and <i>improve</i> their lives. A slower treadmill is still a treadmill. I wonder if it is simply impossible to provide that, and maybe the current reality is close to the best this is going to get.<p>I think maybe the best possible future is one where many (and eventually most) people live out their lives hooked up to an opiate IV and a VR headset.')
