I&#x27;m a software engineer that has always loved working on side projects (alone or on teams) and developing products.<p>I&#x27;ve always loved collaborating with people, and in the past I would use my physical and spatial connections with people to share my projects, join in on new ones, and get help (e.g. work friends, coffee shop chats etc.). That doesn&#x27;t really work anymore, and I&#x27;ve found myself in a bit of a slump and honestly quite lonely recently.<p>Where can I find an online community (forum, Discord, anything) of people working on projects, sharing&#x2F;discussing ideas and trading advice?<p>I really need a community like this right now; to work on some sort of team. Feeling a bit lost working alone.')
