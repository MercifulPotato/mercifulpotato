That said, I don&#x27;t think this works like buying a lot of lottery tickets. A breakthrough isn&#x27;t random, even if it is unpredictable.  It also isn&#x27;t just a function of who the scientist inherently is. Circumstances may be the bigger half of the equation.<p>If a patent clerk shows up with relativity, there is no shortage of places that will provide him a desk and some pencils. Newton emerged out of aristocracy, as did Darwin and many others. Tenured professorships are&#x2F;were an attempt to replicate those circumstances in many ways. Einstein came out of a patent clerk job. In today&#x27;s terms this is a wfh with lots of bullshit time. We have a lot of math educated people today with these circumstances.<p>It&#x27;s just a really hard question.. how do we get more &quot;one offs.&quot; IIRC pg named it black swan farming. &quot;Employ&quot; is a broad term and I suspect how its defined matters here.')
