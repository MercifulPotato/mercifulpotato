The &quot;people&quot; of the town are the few giant service providers in the country. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what the law says, if the town consensus is that you are not welcome, then they can make it very hard or impossible to live there.<p>And yet an entire town ostracizing someone for a non-protected attribute is actually protected speech and behavior under the first amendment.\nIf you can&#x27;t participate in polite society, there&#x27;s very few things the government actually guarantees you.')
