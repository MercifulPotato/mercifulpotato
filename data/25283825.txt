I moved from PHP to Ruby and Rails eight years ago.  I _really_ enjoy writing Ruby (I love the syntax) and Rails servers all my web dev needs perfectly.  I&#x27;m now learning about the joys of functional languages though Elixir&#x2F;Erlang (a common next step for Rubyists).<p>The question is: so what if PHP even has caught up?  What could I possibly gain from going back to it?  I would have to rebuild context and learn a whole new web framework in a language whose syntax I personally do not enjoy.  So no matter how good it&#x27;s become, it&#x27;s totally not worth my time and energy to switch back to it.')
