Some manager have trouble to handle the full remote situation, some engineers have trouble too, all that combined can create small hole, so some outrage.<p>How many migration they do way more complex than this one without issue?<p>I don&#x27;t think engineering culture is degrading, but shit happen and in extreme situations we see problems easier.<p>if this outrage was due by a feature or &quot;massive hardware&quot; , we can be very worrie about it')
