Item(by='ChuckNorris89', descendants=None, kids=[25270802, 25270461], score=None, time=1606857675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269500, text='I&#x27;m still rocking my Bip even though I don&#x27;t use most of the <i>smart</i> features(heart-rate sensor doesn&#x27;t seem very accurate). I just wear it as a regular watch because it looks good, it&#x27;s slim and discrete, visible in the sun, has customizable watchfaces and shows me notifications from my phone(via Gadgetbridge, no cloud account BS). That&#x27;s all I need, I don&#x27;t want fancy interactive smartphone features on my watch to provide an endless source of distractions for the whole day at an easier reach.<p>Oh, and the battery lasts forever and because of the low pricetag I won&#x27;t cry if I break it or scratch it during sports or household chores.<p>I feel like the Bip is the unofficial successor to the beloved Pebble.')
