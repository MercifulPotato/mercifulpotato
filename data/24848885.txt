The basic process I used was the same as OP: dremel a pocket, slowly drip nitric acid to dissolve the package, and an bath with ultrasonic cleaning. Although I thought we used isopropyl alcohol instead of acetone. It&#x27;s been a few years so my memory may be incorrect.<p>Looking at dies under a microscope is fascinating, especially if there is anyone around who can help explain what you&#x27;re looking at. Sort of like exploring an alien robot civilization. :-)<p>In this case it turned out someone had taken one of our competitor&#x27;s dies (probably a test reject), packaged it, and labeled it as ours. I&#x27;m not sure why they bothered with a die at all since it wasn&#x27;t like it was pin compatible or even functional.')
