But their FAQ already states that he will &quot;be able to&quot; look at what students are doing and &quot;may occasionally [..] give feedback&quot;, so most likely he won&#x27;t be around to run the course.<p>Also, from watching the videos, I had the impression that the technical work is mostly done by other people, e.g. the famous glitterbomb was built by Sean Hodgins: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IpMxOmUcfOI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IpMxOmUcfOI</a><p>So first and foremost, it appears that Mark Rober is a great showman and a great narrator. Plus he&#x27;s collaborating with people like Mr Beast who have the power of a skilled agency behind them (nightmedia.co) to produce just the right narrative to go viral. And his first videos appear to be sponsored by a marketing agency.<p>So I&#x27;m not surprised that this course is hyped up and not actually done by Mark Rober. I&#x27;d treat this more as a case study on how to perfect your social marketing ;)<p>That said, their core promise of building 3 own projects within 30 days sounds reasonable if they have skilled instructors running the course. And the price seems reasonable for such a learning experience. When I was younger, my dad built some technical projects with me. Over the course of a weekend, I would learn more about electrics and physics than in a year in school. And once you built something that actually works in the real world, you&#x27;ll never go back to observing technology as a passive bystander. That attitude change alone might be worth the $250.<p>Plus, I believe Mark Rober to be a great showman. This course will likely be entertaining to watch, and paced just like a good movie.')
