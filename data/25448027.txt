Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608150078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447082, text='&gt; It&#x27;s too inconvenient to need to block out everything around you with a headset.<p>Is it? That&#x27;s the main selling point to me. I don&#x27;t want to stare at a screen, I want to look around a cockpit.
