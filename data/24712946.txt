Unions are often seen as a step towards developer commoditization which, like hour tracking, puzzle-based interviews, and other practices that de-individualize devs, is frowned upon by many. Some people just don&#x27;t want to have to bargain collectively.<p>Granted, while some unions allow all sorts of single-employee exceptions, one can bet a company would choose to treat the goose and the gander the same when given guidelines on what the lowest common denominator is.<p>&gt; Many in our industry are quite jaded about the poor behavior of large corporations<p>Yeah, but not _their_ organization, or they&#x27;d go elsewhere (jobs are not currently very constrained).')
