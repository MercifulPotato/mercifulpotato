Especially with eye tracking that will enable virtually looking the other people in the eyes.<p>Think about as optical waveguide technology becomes more affordable enabling very lightweight comfortable headsets that actually are close to normal glasses in comfort.  Combined with pose detection from cameras with fast AI.<p>Things like VR Chat are already pretty good.<p>And actually I think the potential to create perfectly tailored 3d workspaces in VR could make those spaces preferred in some cases over real ones.
