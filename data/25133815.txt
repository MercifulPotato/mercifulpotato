It may not be overt pressure but it&#x27;s consistent, delivered in countless expectations (do job|college and move out|away) and assumptions (gone yet?)<p>My parents died when I was 14 &amp; 21 respectively. Decades before, my dad moved my mom away so we grew up w&#x2F;o any extended family nearby. When my first child was born, my wife and I were on our own - which would surprise zero Americans.<p>Objectively I was good parent and a terrible parent. With no ongoing guidance, the terrible wound up outweighing the good (because w&#x2F;o exp, what we have are hunches, anecdotes and ill equipped reasoning).  My kids and I will spend the rest of our lives repaving my bad roads. This result would have been different with extended family nearby and - critically - some on hand.<p>Some American ideals (eg:individualistic independence) come with an unreasonably high price.  We would be a far better people if we elevated keeping 3+ generations together and normalized housing that would support that.')
