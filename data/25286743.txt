Item(by='josephg', descendants=None, kids=[25296107], score=None, time=1606983332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286474, text='&gt; Why would a developer be in charge of testing the user experience from the user perspective?<p>I can count on one hand the number of companies I&#x27;ve worked at in the last decade who had in-house QA teams. Most companies just rely on the developers to test their (our) own code. The exceptions are banks, gamedev companies and big corp products (like Windows).<p>Most web software I&#x27;ve seen - especially in the startup world - just assumes that &quot;it works well enough on the developers&#x27; specced out mac&quot; means it works. The most tragic version of this I saw was our app looking awful on a ‘normal’ 19” desktop monitor. The problem was our designers did all their work from 27&quot; imacs. They never thought to design and test on smaller displays. Or the designers placing adjacent colors that look great on color graded displays but are almost indistinguishable on the trashy 6 bit TN displays that were ubiquitous in offices a few years ago.<p>Even in companies with dedicated QA I haven&#x27;t seen many tickets of the form of &quot;the program runs slowly on this old computer we have&quot;. Sadly the creeping performance rot is mostly invisible.')
