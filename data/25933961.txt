The interesting thing to me is how this fire is continuing among blisteringly cold surface temperatures - but then again those fires have very little exposure to the surface and earth insulates extremely effectively.  It only takes a few feet of earth to effectively dampen surface temperature changes - which is why ice houses were such a commonly used tool.')
