We&#x27;re seeing years of work and investment paying off (AMD, Apple, ARM, Nvidia, Amazon), new process nodes (TSMC), and new tech (Ray Tracing, DLSS, machine learning) all hitting at the same time.<p>And that&#x27;s the big stuff!  There&#x27;s also the steady incremental improvements such as battery technology, SSD and RAM that are ongoing.<p>You also have an incumbent (Intel) who&#x27;s lost their way.  If they were as scrappy as they were 15 years ago this wouldn&#x27;t feel like such a banner year.<p>Yeah, I think we are in a new era of computing.')
