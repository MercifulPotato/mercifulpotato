All interactions between the client and the broker are performed in transactional units. If the transaction in which messages are sent fails to commit, then the messages are not sent, and all work is rolled back. Once a message is successfully send (that is, sent and transaction committed), it will be delivered once and only once to the receiver.<p>Likewise on the receiving side, a message is delivered and the encompassing transaction is committed once and only once. A message may be delivered more than once if the encompassing transaction is later rolled back due to say network failure. But a message delivery in a transaction that does not commit is not a delivery.<p>The benefit here is that application programmers don&#x27;t need to concern themselves with message duplicate checking and the risk that duplicate checking is done incorrectly leading to bugs that are very difficult to identify.')
