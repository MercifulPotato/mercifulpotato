Every industry and every company will have different solutions to what they need and they&#x27;ll know best how to set their employees for success. This is all done in a mutual agreement. A better strategy is having everyone understand their options in order to make better decisions when it comes to choosing an employer&#x2F;employee, and again all of this is specific to the industry.<p>The problem with fighting worker rights is that not all workers are the same, and having a small group of people decide all the intricacies of the system for all industries is unrealistic. At the very least there would be a concerted and visible effort to adapt solutions for each industry, but that&#x27;s not what happens, it&#x27;s always some global abstract mandate that has unintended consequences. Politics is the ultimate solutioning by committee, so it&#x27;s always inefficient and often hurtful to use politics to solve societal problems which are really the collection of the decisions people are making. Encouraging businesses is one thing, but deliberately blocking actions and forcing decisions on ALL business is almost never a good idea.')
