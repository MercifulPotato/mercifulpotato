In the end, the only way to find out part of the answer is to exercise the relevant codepath via some test data (if you&#x27;re lucky) and use IntelliJ&#x27;s excellent debugger to help you move forward. Even this just reveals the &quot;what&quot;, not the intent.<p>No amount of consistent linting or formatting can make this better. And no, ExpressivelyVerboselyNamedFunctionsInAidOfSelfDocumentingCode don&#x27;t help either.')
