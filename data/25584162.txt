Item(by='andrew311', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609351622, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583397, text='This argument falls into the trap of comparing the <i>average</i> home to the stock market. If I was primarily concerned with returns, I would never buy the average home. That would be a home in the middle of nowhere. I would only buy in major metro areas with diverse, heavily entrenched industries and a strong desire among people all over the world to live there (places like NYC). If you look at the numbers in those places, the story is very different. On home value alone, you see appreciation of 8-12% per year on average since 1990 (despite at least three recessions during that time). Covid will impact the desire to live in major metro areas but not enough to seriously impact these returns.<p>If I wasn&#x27;t concerned primarily with returns and instead on just saving money over renting, the math is still way better in any of the top metros in the United States so long as you plan to reside there for 5+ years. And if you aren&#x27;t living in a major metro, you still need to find a place to live, so you might as well make 1% annually on that money as opposed to just giving it away in the form of rent.<p>In my experience, renting makes sense when you need to pay for flexibility, because you aren&#x27;t sure if you will stay rooted in one place for 5+ years. Otherwise, buying for many people is a win financially and has been for decades.')
