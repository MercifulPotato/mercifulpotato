And yes, you got me, I&#x27;m not a professional cryptographer. But can you address the point? You said &quot;once counterparties have authenticated each other&#x27;s messages, the legitimate need for authentication is gone&quot;. I provided a counter-example to demonstrate that your statement was an exaggeration. You clearly dispute some part of this, but it&#x27;s unclear to me what the disputed part is.<p>Edit: Hacker News doesn&#x27;t allow me to post replies to the posts under this post, so I will answer by editing this comment. I&#x27;m addressing the following comment:<p>&gt; Which counterexample is that exactly? Your counterexample involving a store is incorrect -- the store&#x27;s email would still be authenticated for a smaller amount of time which would allow your server to verify that it is a valid email that came from the store&#x27;s servers.<p>If you actually read my counter example, you will see that I wrote: &quot;if a third party (like a court) can authenticate the message&quot;.<p>Yes, my email server can authenticate the email when it arrives, but that will be of little help later when I try to dispute claims in court. If the court can authenticate the email, that will be helpful to the honest party in the dispute.')
