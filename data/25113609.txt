There are great little islands&#x2F;towns all over.   If you end up on an island with only one restaurant, it makes it real easy to decide where to eat.  Dodging all the lobster buoys is a real challenge to navigation, but eating lobster every day is worth it.   If you see and island on the map with &quot;haven&quot; in the name, be sure to check it out.')
