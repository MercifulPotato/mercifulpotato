He isn&#x27;t going away and neither is the rest of the Soviet team.  It&#x27;s pointed out earlier that the Soviet Union pays its players, while she is going to have to scrape by on tournament winnings and Christian charity offers with strings attached.<p>There&#x27;s no way she&#x27;s recovered from her addictions, she bought sedatives while in the USSR and only just managed to keep herself from taking them.<p>She has a cold, off-putting personality which is probably going to loose it&#x27;s luster once her novelty has warn off. Her mother probably suffered from mental illness and there seems to be a reasonable chance she inherited it.
