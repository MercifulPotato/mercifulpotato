For example, how many people write applications in low-level languages like assembler today? Not many - but at one point that was the only option and anyone who complained about it would be labelled as a lazy worker.<p>The signalling aspect of this certainly distorts the discussion, but bear this in mind:<p>It is simultaneously true that <i>git is a tool with a poor interface and a bunch of warts</i> AND <i>every aspiring developer should do the work and learn it in detail</i> so they can use that knowledge to signal to people that they&#x27;re not lazy and&#x2F;or dumb (and the lazy&#x2F;dumb people - even knowing this - will not do it, so the signal works).')
