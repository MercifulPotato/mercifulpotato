If we were still behaviorists, we wouldn&#x27;t pretend this was news. This is declaring a full remission of depression after four weeks in half of the subjects. This is pretend science, I absolutely guarantee that an all expenses paid weeklong camping trip (or trip to Paris for those afraid of bugs, or trip to Japan for those sick of Paris) would do the same thing.<p>Asking depressed people whether they&#x27;re depressed in four weeks during which they&#x27;ve had two good, safe, legal drug sessions, and considering it meaningful, is moronic.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve been reading lately about saying things directly. <i>Of course drugs feel good, that&#x27;s why people do them.</i>')
