If you sell popular software and don&#x27;t provide a cloud service, you are basically opening up an opportunity for somebody else to do it. Public clouds tend to jump on this because it sells underlying infrastructure in addition to the management value add.<p>OSS companies like Mongo, DataBricks, and Confluent run popular cloud services. They all seem to be doing fine for this reason. I don&#x27;t see a lot of proof that changing their licensing was a root cause of their success.')
