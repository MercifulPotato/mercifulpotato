Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25622065], score=None, time=1609676045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621223, text='To answer your question &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t the content of the paper be paramount?&quot; directly, NO!<p>If the conclusions of the paper have already been demonstrated to be incorrect, but the authors both know those objections and leave out discussion of them, then it&#x27;s a seriously flawed paper.<p>Reviewers and editors cannot catch all merit-less papers. The acceptance system is based on a system of trust, including trust that the authors have highlighted possible flaws in their argument. There&#x27;s also the post-publication review process, including retractions.<p>Moreover, most reviewers will not have experience with creationist literature (because it&#x27;s a pseudoscience with no predictive ability), so are not likely to notice a paper which uses certain terms which only have meaning to creationists.<p>For example, &quot;design&quot; could mean &quot;the result of natural evolutionary processes&quot;, but to a creationist it might mean the design of a creator, that is, as short-hand for &quot;intelligent design.&quot;<p>Had they used &quot;intelligent design&quot; at the start, it would have helped the reviewer understand the context. Leaving that out until after the review process ended makes me suspicious that this omission was deliberate.')
