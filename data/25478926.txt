If methods really do one simple thing and are properly named, it&#x27;s easy to tell if they should be re-used or not.<p>A lot of the time, side-effects are not mentioned in method names or params (or the params are optional, that&#x27;s where the issue comes in).<p>E.g.<p>SaveCandidate(Candidate candidate);<p>In reality, SaveCandidate does two things, saves the candidate and updates their &quot;ProfileCompletionStatus&quot;.<p>If someone sees SaveCandidate and not SaveCandidateAndUpdateCompletionStatus<p>or<p>SaveCandidate(candidate, SaveSideEffects.DO_UPDATE_COMPLETION_STATUS)<p>they will re-use SaveCandidate in places here completion status shouldn&#x27;t be updated (contrived example - data migrations).<p>The problem, of course, is that these overly-clear, overly-detailed methods are a pain to read. The common advice is &quot;it&#x27;s separate&quot;, but then we are repeating<p>SaveCandidate(candidate);\nUpdateProfileCompletionStatus(candidate);<p>everywhere, despite them being generally one process. I guess this is all pretty pedantic. When you spend a ton of time on this, you are missing out on getting stories done, but if you don&#x27;t, the code eventually becomes umanageable.')
