Nintendo has a very differentiated market of game offerings on their platforms, and that&#x27;s the reason people buy it. They don&#x27;t buy Switch for the (underpowered compared to competitors) hardware, or something else.<p>That&#x27;s imo the biggest problem Xbox console is facing. Does it have good third party games? Plenty. Does it make sense to buy Xbox if you already own a PS4&#x2F;PS5 or a gaming PC? Not really, since the overlap of third party games available on all of them is giant. The only game I know people care about that is Xbox exclusive is Halo series. I don&#x27;t know a single person who owns a PS4&#x2F;PS5+Xbox or even gaming PC+Xbox. I know tons of people owning a PC+PS4&#x2F;PS5, and I know a ton of people who own either a PS4&#x2F;PS5+Switch or gaming PC+Switch (or all 3 of them). And that&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s unique offering, being an incredible complement to other consoles, not a direct competitor, while also being a great product of its own that doesn&#x27;t just function as an add-on.<p>Mind you, I am not saying that Nintendo shouldn&#x27;t increase the number of third party games present on their platform, quite the opposite. The increase of third party games on Switch is a really welcome development. However, under no circumstances should they decrease the number of first party games, otherwise they would end up in a losing position.')
