This was some 18 months ago.<p>He struck me as absolutely forthcoming and genuine. He fixed the issue and gave me a year&#x27;s subscription for free for reporting the bug and helping him figuring it out.<p>I really wish Evan wouldn&#x27;t be so hard on himself. His product actually helped me a lot, and he seemed to me like he was both empathetically capable and morally competent.')
