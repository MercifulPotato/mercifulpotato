For you, music&#x27;s been all downhill since Orden Ogan made The Things We Believe In.<p>Now I wonder if this is because my account is old, or if I really listen to that much old stuff, or if my favorite bands just don&#x27;t release that much. Weird.<p>But I&#x27;m entirely fine with the other assments:<p>&gt; Your spotify was renaissance-faire -too-much-power metal bad.<p>&gt; Thank your obsessions with medieval rock and power metal (e.g., Sabaton and Dreamtale) for that.<p>&gt; Based on your listening habits, I can also tell you your spotify was...<p>&gt; hail-satan bad<p>&gt; You are 0% basic. Ewigheim and Winterstorm? Where do you even find this shit?.<p>And I think winterstorm and ewigheim aren&#x27;t even the most obscure bands.<p>Oh but there is a new stribog album. nice.')
