(Should it also answer my question if John McClane was seen at the scene?).<p>It&#x27;s a video showing a 3D model&#x2F;timeline from publicly released videos. If I claim &quot;my friends saw Aladdin flying on his magic carpet before the explosion&quot; but there&#x27;s no video&#x2F;photo of this claim, they can&#x27;t use that claim for their reconstruction. And they&#x27;re not going to talk about Aladdin because that&#x27;s not the point of the video.')
