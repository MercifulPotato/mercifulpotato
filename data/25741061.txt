We had tons of lines like:<p><pre><code>    while true; do .&#x2F;runserver; sleep 10; done\n</code></pre>\nin a shell script that would start a new server with one window per process. It got called from &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.local on boot IIRC.<p>Deploys meant pulling the new code on the server (or maybe just editing it in vim right there), then just Ctrl-C in every terminal (or when I got lazier, `killall runserver`).<p>This was back in 2010 or so... I have professionally come a long way in the intervening decade, and no longer have any PROD services running in tmux panes, but I definitely learned to love that tool.')
