By simply rewording that as &quot;times of the attempted coup,&quot; you remain an objective observer and carry more authority from the reader&#x27;s perspective.<p>This said, I know it&#x27;s difficult and that things are tough when it comes to Turkey. Hopefully things will get better at some point, nobody lives forever.')
