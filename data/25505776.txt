Item(by='hirundo', descendants=None, kids=[25507544, 25505811], score=None, time=1608641834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492475, text='&quot;Today, many residents rent semi-permanent space for such homes from land owners, creating an unfortunate side effect: an incomplete form of ownership.&quot;<p>That applies to apartment rentals too. But if you can&#x27;t afford to buy or to get a mortgage it&#x27;s a feature, and not a trivial one. I lived in a trailer park for many years, and the savings over an apartment made a large difference in my lifestyle and cost of living, which helped me eventually become a home-and-land owner. If someone had &quot;helped&quot; me by preventing this unfortunate side effect of incomplete ownership, it would not have been helpful. My ownership of the trailer but not the land was much better than owning none of it.')
