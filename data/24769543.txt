Item(by='silicon2401', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602618506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767184, text='yeah, that was pretty much my point. The article wasn&#x27;t trying to show what language is easy to guess for K&#x2F;J speakers, it was trying to show what language X sounds&#x2F;reads like to speakers of languages A and B, where X was a major influence on A and B. In the article, A and B are K&#x2F;J and X is Chinese. In my example, A&#x2F;B is English, and X is French&#x2F;German.<p>I study both Korean and Japanese and I agree, knowing some Korean helps with learning Japanese. My korean friends who speak both fluently say about as much as this article: it&#x27;s almost a replace-in-place similarity, so that seems to line up with your account as well.')
