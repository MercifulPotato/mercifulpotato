You have a producer and a consumer of that field that communicate over the wire. (or instead of the wire, imagine a database).<p>You send or store an instance of that protobuf. Now let&#x27;s say that you want to make the field optional (or remove it). With an already-optional field, this is easy. You stop setting it, and maybe eventually you clean it up.<p>With a required field, however, you can&#x27;t do that. If any of your <i>clients</i> don&#x27;t have the newest schema version, you can&#x27;t unset the field (so imagine that you support mobile clients who may never update). Or if there&#x27;s middleware you don&#x27;t know about that introspects your proto. Even if you do the dance right and update your server and client before not setting the new field, you could crash outdated middleware that you didn&#x27;t know about. Whoops!<p>Or with the database, you now need to dual write or something complex because if you need to roll-back to an older version, you&#x27;d be unable to <i>read</i> the protos that don&#x27;t include the required field.<p>Required doesn&#x27;t do well over time. It has nothing to do with setting the values.')
