While the things he&#x27;s trying to measure are not easy (for instance he uses the number and dates of found coin hoards as a relative measure of instability in England), the amount of data is pretty impressive.  I actually gave up after he did all the data on England and skipped France, the Islamic Empires and I think there was one other society, and went to the conclusion.  I haven&#x27;t read &quot;Age of Discord&quot; yet, but it looks like he has a pretty detailed summary here.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;peterturchin.com&#x2F;age-of-discord&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;peterturchin.com&#x2F;age-of-discord&#x2F;</a>')
