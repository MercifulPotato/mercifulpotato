I remember spending a good 30 minutes trying to work out how the example worked before giving up and doing the classic “let’s just run it and see what happens” approach.<p>The example code from Microsoft turned out to be a fork bomb and it quickly crashed my machine.<p>It took me a long time to trust Microsoft documentation again after that incident.')
