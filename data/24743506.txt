HN is a wild place hah.<p>&gt; I would really have liked more perspective in the story from the music producers POV<p>This is pretty much how I feel about every piece of media on music&#x2F;artists&#x2F;bands&#x2F;etc. Song Exploder is one of the few that puts that process &amp; the accompanying story front and center. It makes the content far more interesting IMO.')
