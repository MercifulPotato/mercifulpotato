Having the protobuf schema itself use optional or required doesn&#x27;t change that, it just makes the dependency explicit there, instead of only in the code at the endpoints.<p>Changing required to optional isn&#x27;t a magic fix for protocol compatibility. If it were (for your limited use case) you can just make that change to the protobuf client side as it doesn&#x27;t affect the wire representation&#x2F;interpretation.')
