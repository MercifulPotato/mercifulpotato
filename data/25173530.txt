I&#x27;d generally go a few months without updates, and large batches of updates were often painful, requiring manual steps... like the move to systemd, merging &#x2F;bin and &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin, and others I&#x27;ve forgot.<p>I have also had update issues with Ubuntu. There was a bug with Ubuntu 20.04 where a server would lose its default route when it had multiple network interfaces. And another bug where, after an update, network interfaces were renamed on a reboot rendering the server inaccessible.  Is having a server with more than one network interface that unusual?<p>I have yet to find a distribution where updates are not problematic.')
