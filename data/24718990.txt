The man of genius who essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public credulity, merely stated in his prospectus that the required capital was half a million, in five thousand shares of £100. each, deposit £2 per share. Each subscriber, paying his deposit, would be entitled to £100 per annum per share. How this immense profit was to be ob-tained, he did not condescend to inform them at that time, but pro-mised that in a month full particulars should be duly announced, and a call made for the remaining £98 of the subscription. , Next morning, at nine o&#x27;clock, this great man opened an office in Cornhill. Crowds of people beset his door, and when he shut up at three o&#x27;clock, he found that no less than one thousand shares had been subscribed for, and the deposits paid. He was thus, in five hours, the winner of £2000. He was philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never heard of again.')
