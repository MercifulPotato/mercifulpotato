It&#x27;s simply a category error to say that free will does not exist because constituent parts of a system are deterministic, in the same sense as saying that consciousness does not exist because you cannot find it at the level of a neuron, or that the car cannot drive because none of its parts can.<p>Also on the issue of causality which is important, complex systems don&#x27;t just exhibit bottom-up causality, but the reverse, the system can only made sense of if one takes into account the downward causality from the macro to the micro level which explains why the system functions the way it does and that is what &#x27;will&#x27; is in the context of a human to begin with. It&#x27;s because the system cannot be reduced to bottom-up processes that it is complex, and it is for that reason that concepts such as &#x27;freedom&#x27;, autonomy&#x27;, &#x27;intentionality&#x27; and so on make sense.')
