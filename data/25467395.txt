Secure (single user) text processing (etc.) is not a hard problem at all and there is zero reason it should create any security risks.<p>Crap passwords (and security practices) are not pertinent at all here, unless you also argue that Boeing shouldn&#x27;t really bother to make airplanes with non-lethal autopilot interactions because being killed by a mis-designed airplane is the least of risks to the typical US citizen&#x27;s life give how obese he or she is.<p>The pertinent question is: if you are to design a wordprocessor, should you avoid baking sqlite into the design because of security concerns? I think you should. Sqlite is written and tested very well, but it is written in not formally verified C, and using a memory unsafe language for reading potentially hostile databases poses a completely unnecessary and avoidable security risk.')
