(Dunning-Kruger effect)<p>The Dunning-Kruger meme needs to go away. The popular understanding of it demonstrated here is wrong. Contrary to popular opinion, Dunning-Kruger <i>did not</i> demonstrate that some people are too stupid to judge their own abilities, nor that confidence is inversely correlated with ability. In fact the data in the experiment show the opposite: the main figure in the paper shows a <i>positive</i> correlation between confidence and ability, and the whole thing is just speculating about why the correlation is less than 1.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talyarkoni.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;07&#x2F;what-the-dunning-kruger-effect-is-and-isnt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talyarkoni.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;07&#x2F;what-the-dunning-...</a><p>I do not believe stupidity is increasing, and there are measurable social indicators that back this up, such as rate of education, re-normalizing of standardized tests, global use of technology, etc. The post I just linked to has a plausible explanation: regression to the mean. More samples as you grow means your samples are getting more average over time.')
