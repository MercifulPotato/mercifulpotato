Corporate laptops allowed logging in to your corporate gmail, but I never saw anyone use IMAP and I have a feeling it wouldn’t be allowed. Once I left Google I had no access to my old corporate emails and I’m sure that’s the way they want it. I did thought experiments about data exfiltration and it would certainly be difficult. They control the OS on your system, they control the network, and they authenticate everything so no anonymous access is allowed. That’s why people get caught - they can see basically everything you’re doing on corporate machines or corporate networks and they know who you are.')
