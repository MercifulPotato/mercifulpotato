Item(by='majormajor', descendants=None, kids=[24949121], score=None, time=1604108767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948445, text='&quot;Congrats, you have won the lottery, now you have to move somewhere way cheaper - probably because it doesn&#x27;t have many of the features that drew you here in the first place!&quot;<p>&quot;All because a bunch of people with more money than you are now willing to pay a bunch of money for your neighbors&#x27; places.&quot;<p>I think laws and policy should <i>exactly</i> be focused on protecting those who have less from the impact of those who have more. Not because they&#x27;re morally superior or anything, but just to try to keep things balanced because the people with the money <i>already</i> enjoy so many other advantages.<p><i>Moving</i> is hugely disruptive to people&#x27;s life, so the ability to plan expenses - both for property tax and in terms of rent control - has a lot of <i>non-financial</i> appeal as a policy. &quot;Make people move when folks with more cash want to come in&quot; is at best a somewhat heartless position, and at worse a major driver of homelessness.')
