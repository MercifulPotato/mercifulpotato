I see a lot of arguments in the comments here that seem based on the same assumption.<p>At top tier software shops (that pay US and immigrant employees the same) you&#x27;re  lucky if you can find enough US employees to fill the available roles by the time the next fiscal year starts. There are plenty of people applying who call themselves &quot;Software Engineers&quot; but most of them aren&#x27;t very good. There is also a limit to how many new grads you can take on while having the bandwidth to train them. Once every team of 3-7 has a new grad you can&#x27;t really take on any more. And the places I&#x27;m talking about already pay the highest salaries and bonuses in the world for SWEs.<p>Doing an L1 transfer or H1b is a lot of work. Dealing with PERM is a lot of work. If there really were a glut of super capable US engineers no one would bother going through that hassle.<p>Just what is supposed to happen here when you&#x27;re already paying 2-3x (or more) average comp, hiring hundreds or thousands of US engineers every year, and you still can&#x27;t find enough people?<p>I guess the government thinks somehow you should use the PERM process to find a replacement for your immigrant employee when you already can&#x27;t find enough qualified US candidates to fill the brand new positions your company created this fiscal year? That chain of logic just leads to an even bigger deficit in unfilled positions or a government mandate to lower hiring standards. Neither of those is good for the company&#x27;s competitiveness.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this case is politically motivated but surely the Justice Department&#x27;s time would be better spent going after the many well-known H1b body shops, where mega corps are abusing the system to replace US workers with cheaper immigrants?')
