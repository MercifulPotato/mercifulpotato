It provides a sort of tele-interface - tunneling a value from the top level scope to the bottom where it is used.<p>Imagine a larger CLI application. You get all of the command line flags at once at the beginning, but some of them are used at the bottom of the implementation. Passing them all across all the layers gets tedious so you would invent some sort of &quot;context&quot; object passed through your functions. Another example is Flask&#x27;s global request object.<p>If done correctly, it may be much cleaner than passing the values through the stack. You must not overuse it and you have to think about thread safety. It&#x27;s useful to ensure the values are set once and then they&#x27;re immutable to avoid surprises, and you must ensure the global value is cleaned when no longer valid.')
