Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607520796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25353814, text='<i>&gt; browsers have a thing called XSLT built into them</i><p>I don&#x27;t think they actually do anymore, not all of them for sure.<p><i>&gt;  web standards folks in the early 2000s thought the future was XML all the way down</i><p>Yes. What fools, to think that machine-produced content transmitted from machine to machine and displayed throw other machines would be better handled and more accessible if formatted in machine-friendly ways that were still readable to humans...<p>But it wasn&#x27;t to be, not just because XSLT was somewhat botched (way too hard, way too many enterprise-looking warts...) and probably insecure, but because people are too lazy to produce readable markup (who wouldn&#x27;t get tired of reading &lt;prst&gt;&lt;artdd&gt;&lt;!CDATA[[ all day long...) and to make sure tags appear only where they should and get closed properly. Add the inevitable touch-of-death of enterprise vendors (&quot;let&#x27;s use xml in such a way you&#x27;ll only be able to deal with it with <i>our</i> tools!&quot;), and the game was up.')
