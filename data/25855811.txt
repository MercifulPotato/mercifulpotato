If you have a device with the Intel ME, you&#x27;ve already got some closed-source component running on your machine. Is getting an updated closed-source firmware from Debian <i>worse than</i> using whatever closed-source firmware was shipped with the device?<p>Obviously it would be delightful if you could avoid using the closed-source firmware at all. But the question is, if you can&#x27;t - if you have a laptop with closed-source firmware pre-flashed onto the EEPROMs, and also Windows shipped from the factory pre-installed onto the disk - what should you do?<p>If Debian takes the stand of saying &quot;No, we&#x27;re not going to run on that laptop, keep using Windows,&quot; is that the stand you want them to take?')
