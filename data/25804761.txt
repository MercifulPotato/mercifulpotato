Insane beliefs have existed long before Internet-enabled information spread.  Over half of the US believes that astrology is real.  I remember reading in the early 2000&#x27;s a survey showing a majority of Americans believing angels exist.  Should we talk about religion?<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what&#x27;s happening, here.
