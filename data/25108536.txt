Back in my youth I would still bike everywhere, I would just plan my bike route to hit every public pool possible, like the main character in John Cheever’s ‘The Swimmer.’ And then I would eat some amazing Tex mex on a patio and then hit the springs for a night swim. Of course, nobody is doing that kind of thing these days anyways. I miss Austin. I miss my youth.')
