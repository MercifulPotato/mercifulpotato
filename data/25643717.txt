That data is recorded for the purpose of sharing with various institutions and agencies, and you do not know who will see that data or how long it will be shared for.<p>There is basically no privacy for transactions above 1000€.<p>Worse, that data can be hacked and leaked to the internet. Eg. Criminals will be able to see that last summer you bought an expensive watch, and know that you may be a good target. Such data has often been leaked to the internet before.<p>There was a recent incident where the sales data for the Ledger cryptocurrency hardware wallet was hacked and leaked to the internet. Including names and addresses of people. I guess this stort of stuff will happen more frequently in the future.')
