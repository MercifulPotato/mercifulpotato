The two tenants underneath have fled. One lost a job and the other kept the job, but decided to lose the California tax rates and mask&#x2F;shutdown protocols. Both units are now vacant.</i><p><i>&quot;I asked how much rents have fallen and he responded with &quot;30 percent.&quot; Why not rent the units out at the current market rate? &quot;If you ever rent to someone in San Francisco,&quot; he replied, &quot;you can never raise their rent more than about 2 percent per year after that. You&#x27;re locked it at whatever rate you start with. So I am waiting until the shutdown ends, hoping that market rents will come back closer to what they were when I bought the building.&quot;</i><p>Tax property more when it&#x27;s vacant.<p>Problem fixed.')
