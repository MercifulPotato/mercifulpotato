Item(by='santa_boy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602136223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715148, text='&gt; I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.<p>That seems like a pretty normal experience to me. Slightly confused and have a hard time with the definitions keeping the social stigma aside!. Would be great to gather some perspective from HN.<p>What is depression? How does it compare to stress, or anxiety in itself due to unfulfilled needs of hardwork, rewards, ambition, wants and desires?<p>And ... How is diagnosed? And how medical help is useful? :-) (I know I perhaps need to RTFM)')
