I tried it last fall on 2 different servers. (Hosting an own server is not possible on a small root server you can get for 5 EUR&#x2F;USD a month, it requires signifcant resources.) My experience was a bit disappointing. It seems pretty overloaded already, especially the irc bridge. And we are talking of thousands of users. I&#x27;m pretty convinced that with millions signing up it would collapse completely.<p>Yes, I&#x27;d hope federation of many servers is the way to go. But it seems so resource demanding that not many free servers are available and even running your own one is not cheap or easy. No idea whether it will ever scale.')
