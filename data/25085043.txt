I&#x27;ve seen 6 people since march 15th and those were just 2hr walks outdoors with masks on. That&#x27;s it.<p>But, it&#x27;s reasonable question to ask, what&#x27;s the acceptable number of casualties. The answer is not zero. We have plenty of other diseases that kill lots of people. COVID is more but we still have to pick a number.<p>Is 1 in 100 ok? 1 in 500? 1 in 1000? 1 in 5k? (the car rate), 1 in 10k? (the flu rate).<p>I heard about this thinking on the Sam Harris podcast. He mentioned some people claiming if we lifted all restrictions by their estimates deaths would be 1 in 300. He and his interviewee dismissed out of hand without giving it any thought which was very disappointing. Whether or not it actually would be 1 in 300 we still have to pick a number below which we&#x27;d accept the losses. Is there a reasonable way to decide that number? Flu is around 1 in 10k (or at least my 30 seconds of searching seem to put it in the same order of magnitude) so apparently that&#x27;s an acceptable number and we don&#x27;t apparently get upset as a society that people go around spreading the flu. (though I get super upset personally)')
