And it would seem the language designers agree.<p>I believe it&#x27;s important to expose the fact that an asynchronous(potentially parallel) task is doing something for you. The runtime semantics of an assignment would appear the same in code by be very different behind the scenes otherwise. Also, a lot of code is written to manage those tasks in use-case specific ways. How would you race or cancel transparent futures?')
