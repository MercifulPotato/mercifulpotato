That is to say, you click &#x27;install&#x27; as if you were installing a Native game and then when you click &#x27;Play Game&#x27; it shows you a quick warning that Steam will be using a compatibility tool and then will boot up without any more fuss.<p>The caveat is largely that not all games are solved by this [0], and the official Valve whitelist needs to be turned off in settings to use it for all games, but even with these it&#x27;s still a marked improvement in Quality of Life and barrier to entry for running Windows games on Linux.<p>I&#x27;d give it a go if you have time&#x2F;inclination. I can recommend it as someone who is now Linux only as a result of this.<p>[0] - www.protondb.com')
