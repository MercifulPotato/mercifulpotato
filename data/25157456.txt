Be very careful of what home you buy in places like Florida where construction type can have a huge impact on your premium. (I’m talking 2-3x on an already high cost) Even just the years your home was built can have a 50%+ impact on your premium! (Some years regulations were strong, years later the regulations were taken down, and then came back... etc)<p>If the cost between a 2002 and 2003 home is nothing and they’re basically the same, you might find one is much cheaper to insure... (I don’t recall exact years but I can look it up if people care)')
