I&#x27;ve ran Nomad since 0.7 and it was usable but pretty rough in those days.  1.0 is such a good, smooth thing.  Super awesome even if you don&#x27;t want to use Docker at all, you can just execute random stuff through exec&#x2F;raw_exec, or straight Java.  Heck, run it in a BSD homelab and use one of the jailshell executors.<p>It&#x27;s not Kubernetes but it doesn&#x27;t try to be at all.')
