I’m not saying all are so let’s not get our knickers in a twist - there are plenty of altruistic non-profits out there, and many that only exist thanks to the wealthy.<p>But the default reaction to large sums of money being given to a foundation named for a wealthy, politically entangled person or family should not be, “oh, it’s a non-profit, it’s helping the children”. More than likely it’s that person’s way of putting assets they enjoy daily into a trust to shelter it from taxation or legal seizure (think tax man or divorce court), to get monetary consideration for services rendered (foundation pays high salaries to family members or self while on payroll as nominal employees), and to accept gifts to support the above under cover of a donation. Write a check for a few worthy charitable operations, do some appearances, publish a few reports, and it’s a net positive legal financial strategy.')
