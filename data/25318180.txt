I&#x27;ve seen some Switch games that&#x27;s ditching their stylistic UI and going for generic flat UIs, e.g. Pokemon Sword&#x2F;Shield, and this makes me very sad, I hope they&#x27;re just bad art direction. For app UI it&#x27;s reasonable to go flat to maximize content readability, but for video games, where the goal is &quot;fun&quot;, UI should also be fun, or at lease visually consistent with the game aesthetics, or even be a part of the game itself.')
