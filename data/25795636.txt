It&#x27;s great for lots of things, but it does have some weirdness I find makes some tasks a little more difficult. The lack of &#x27;batteries&#x27; has never really been something that&#x27;s bothered me with lua. A few other things though:<p>The starting arrays from one thing, while not that big of a deal, can be a bit annoying, especially if you&#x27;re using lua and c together. You&#x27;ve just always kind of got to be aware of it.<p>Tables and metatables are great, until they&#x27;re not.<p>Lack of true integers(at least when I used it) made at least one task I tried to use lua for unfeasible and I had to use a different language in the end.<p>In the end though, lua&#x27;s still probably my favourite scripting language to write in.')
