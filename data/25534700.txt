But if you couple them with search (MCTS) then you can do logic and reasoning with them, like AlphaGo.<p>You can also put any algorithm you want inside a neural net as long as you have a mechanism to pass gradients back - for example in the final layer you could have a complex graph-matching algorithm to map the predictions to the target, or you could put an ODE solver as a layer, or a logic engine, or a database.')
