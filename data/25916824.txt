Does that really help?<p>I know that the tech crowd exists in a bubble and that the hatred for the tech giants on HN doesn&#x27;t really reflect the feelings of the general public... but even outside the tech sphere, are there really many people who <i>like</i> Twitter as a company?  Most people just seem to tolerate the companies behind their preferred platform.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to me like there would be many who would be more likely to engage with a new brand as a result of its association with Twitter.  If anything, I&#x27;d expect the opposite effect.')
