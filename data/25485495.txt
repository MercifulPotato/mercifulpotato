If, for some reason, you like not having indigenous racial minorities sent to re-education camps while you&#x27;re not looking, then those options aren&#x27;t really available.<p>If there were a country with the nerve to have no &#x27;measures&#x27; at all, they would have herd immunity, a pile of corpses, some long-term health conditions from covid (that we will have, too- everyone&#x27;s getting this thing), no long-term health conditions from everyone being locked in their homes for a year, no year+ fucking of the economy, less consolidation of wealth into the hands of a few, less of an immediate risk of an increase in authoritarianism via increasing the power of the local government...<p>For some size of &#x27;a discrepancy in the pile of corpses (from this year)&#x27;, I would, if I could push a button and switch to the world where people were left to do as they may, push it.  A lot of people would, too, it&#x27;s just too callous and inhuman to admit that yeah, sorry, if you&#x27;re 85 and going to die in 3 years from the flu anyway your continued life might not be worth the price of greatly inconveniencing a 25-year-old for a year.')
