The initial goals of the project are:<p>* Design for cold data only. Stuff that is done changing and won&#x27;t be accessed regularly if at all: completed projects, annual financial records, RAW image files organized by month, etc.<p>* Store items in flat collections, not in folder hierarchies. Store directories as compressed archives. I&#x27;m not a librarian and I find folder hierarchies difficult maintain.<p>* Store everything such that the data will still easily accessible even if the index is lost or the software stops working. Use well-known formats and human-readable file names.<p>* Automatically store data in multiple locations, including S3-compatible services, Amazon Glacier, file servers or locally. Allow each collection of items to have its own mix of storage locations.<p>* Organize within collections using tags and metadata.<p>* Provide a simple checkout system to download items when needed.<p>I have the core features working and I am now building the desktop application, which I intend to be cross-platform. However, I&#x27;ve never written a desktop application before, let alone a cross-platform one, so development has slowed while I learn and experiment.')
