In most cases they were bad because they didn&#x27;t really know what they were doing and they felt they couldn&#x27;t look &quot;weak&quot; or not be in charge. There&#x27;s always the urge to authoritarian leadership because it&#x27;s the default (for some reason).<p>If the MBA course is any good, it will at least have exposed such a person to other leadership styles and some management theory. They might reject it, of course, but at least they&#x27;ll know it.<p>So, yeah, I don&#x27;t think having an MBA makes you a better manager or leader automatically. But I think a manager who wants to get better could be helped by doing an MBA.<p>Of course, there are lots of managers who are convinced they don&#x27;t need to get better, and so won&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t be helped. And there are lots of people who get MBA&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a ticket to promotion and don&#x27;t really care about the learning.')
