Many of my neighbors have models that cost $50,000+. You need to factor in renting out the campsite for a week, fuel to tow your camper there (it might be 100-200 miles away), and the fact that you need a large pickup truck to do the towing.<p>You could rent a lot of hotels for that kind of money, or rent a cabin to stay in, and drive there in your car. &quot;Roughing it&quot; seems expensive.')
