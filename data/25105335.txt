I ran 2 CAT5 and 2 RG6 to every corner of every room.  Some areas got more.  For example the garage has 12 CAT5  feeds distributed between three walls.  Everything goes to a standard 19 inch EIA rack in the garage and is terminated and labelled on patch panels.<p>Rather than bring out the connections in each room, I use a toner to find the feeds and only bring out what I need when I need it.')
