That&#x27;s a lot of money and a lot of depreciation on the flip. Granted, I&#x27;d been about to spend Â£5k on a laptop, which is a lot, but I&#x27;d expected it to last me 5 years or more. I&#x27;m not about to spend that money on a machine that seems to have been substantially rendered obsolete before it&#x27;s even left the factory.')
