Nobody said there is a single solution to every problem.<p>Don&#x27;t pick up a fight because you are satisfied with <i>your</i> solution that is different from somebody else&#x27;s solution.<p>I personally like docker-compose and Vagrant for my private services and development environments.<p>I use Vagrant for when I need a complete VM. Think in terms of VM for doing embedded development where I need a large number of tools in very specific versions and I need them still working in 3 years without maintenance even if I change a lot about my PC setup (I run Linux <i>everywhere</i>).<p>I create separate Vagrant for every project and this way I can reinstate complete environment at a moments notice, whenever I want.<p>I use docker-compose for most everything else. Work on an application that needs MongoDB, Kafka, InfluxDB, Graphana and so on and so forth? Docker Compose to rule them all. You type one command and everything&#x27;s up. You type another and everything&#x27;s down.<p>I use the same for my other services like mail, NAS, personal website, database, block storage, etc. Containers let me preserve the environment and switch between versions easily and I am not tied to the binary version of the Linux on the server.<p>I hate it when I run a huge amount of services and then a single upgrade causes some of them to stop working. I want to be able to be constantly updated and have my services working with minimum maintenance. Containers let me make decision on each of the services separately.')
