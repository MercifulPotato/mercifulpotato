Like the other day, I couldn&#x27;t watch NYTimes video in fullscreen mode without Chrome crashing. Ok, so, I installed Firefox. Fullscreen video goes to my vertical monitor. No way to change this behavior.<p>Desktop Linux is developed by people who love CLI. It&#x27;s not built by people that try to address problems of common mundane people off the street.<p>I&#x27;d rather use Windows than Linux for daily driver. Atleast UI will not freak out like in Ubuntu.<p>Half the time I read people saying have you tried Linux Desktop, I either see people who are tasteless and love being nerdy with tmux environment, or people who are expecting others to be like themselves.<p>As Linus Torvalds would plainly put &quot;Desktop Linux sucks.
