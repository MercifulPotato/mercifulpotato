Junk items should have disclaimer labels stating that daily consumption of those items will shorten your lifespan and&#x2F;or cause health problems, just like cigarettes.<p>Obesity is our #1 public health epidemic and nobody’s doing anything about it. I think I read that obesity is a factor in 6 of the top 10 most common causes of premature death in the United States.<p>Over 80% of Americans are overweight and close to 40% are obese.')
