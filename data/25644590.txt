Why have all measures in California been completely voluntary this whole time? I can get a ticket if I jaywalk or leave my car parked somewhere for too long, but if I walk into a Walmart with no mask on and start yelling at everyone in the store potentially exposing dozens of people to covid I’ll just get politely escorted out with no penalties.<p>Something so ridiculously simple we could have started with is just ticketing for not wearing a mask in public. If we needed to ratchet it up further, ticketing gatherings with people outside the same household, which is obviously more difficult to enforce but just start with the ones that happen in public. Maybe do a “see something, say something” campaign to encourage people to report private gatherings they see in their neighborhoods and police come and break up gatherings and give tickets.<p>What we’ve been doing instead with all these ever-changing vague optional guidelines is just so stupid. Either leave everything open, or actually enforce the so-called “orders”.')
