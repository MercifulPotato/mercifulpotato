Computers are orders of magnitude more complicated than anything mankind had built as of 1970 so really it&#x27;s more amazing that they work at all than that there are bugs.<p>The real difference may be one of intelligibility - in the 50&#x27;s your car wasn&#x27;t very reliable, but when it did break, you could understand and quite possibly fix what had gone wrong.  Now, the world is way too complicated and nobody can possibly understand more than a small fraction of how anything works.')
