E.g. you might buy a 500Mb&#x2F;s base rate over a 1 Gb&#x2F;s link, and then end up with a 95% percentile value of 600Mb&#x2F;s at the end of the month, so you pay an extra fee for the 100Mbit difference. Whereas if you use the link fully for 2 % of the time, but then stay under the base rate the rest of  month, you only pay the base price.')
