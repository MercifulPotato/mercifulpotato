If they were only offered a measly number of options on being hired, well they can just decide to bail - it&#x27;s the percentage gain that is the unknown and variable part of the equation.<p>&gt; Why would you expect options to pay big for a non-unicorn?<p>I think the idea is that there <i>should</i> be a good swath of successful startups between &quot;failed&quot; and &quot;unicorn&quot;. Indeed, the whole name unicorn came about because they used to be incredibly rare. So the parent is really asking &quot;If you were in a moderately successful startup, did you get anything out of your equity?&quot;')
