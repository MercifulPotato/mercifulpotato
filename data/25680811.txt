I find it very hard to believe that, if these protests had been relocated around the corner to the Supreme Court -- or maybe to the DOJ building, or the Lincoln monument -- yet producing the exact same results, that you or anyone would just shrug their shoulders and write it off.<p>But that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m reading from your comment. And if that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s fucking insane.<p>Political violence is political violence, full stop. If your instinct in this moment is to rationalize how the violence  going towards ends you support is different from that which goes towards other ends, put your phone away and seek help. You&#x27;re part of the problem.')
