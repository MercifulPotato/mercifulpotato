Pro provides twice the TBW value.<p>&gt; My internet connection also makes downloading a large docker image no bigger of a deal than downloading Chrome, YMMV.<p>Not everyone of us has pipes that fat to our homes which provide sub 10ms pings and almost LAN-speed access to rest of the world. My office workstation&#x27;s network is limited by my network card but, my home has a much slower connection.<p>I wish that internet on this planet to be a full-fat-tree network but, we&#x27;re not there yet.')
