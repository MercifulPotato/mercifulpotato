Same thing with container ships - buy a ship, go into business (don&#x27;t know about port berth complications)<p>So with rail, the rail owners get in the way.  It&#x27;s like if someone owned the roads or the ocean and worked on collecting rent.<p>I wonder if there were a model where anyone could use the rails, like anyone can use the highway system, and then rail shipping&#x2F;use would go up.')
