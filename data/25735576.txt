Very bad name, too techy for the average folk and it doesn&#x27;t have the same network effect as Signal or Telegram. I disagree that it is ahead of Signal for usability in fact it is still behind.<p>Although I do praise it for not requiring and collecting my phone number and being a bit more future-proof and decentralised, unlike Signal and Telegram.<p>But in terms of getting my friends grandmother over it, it completely loses on usability and its name is so confusing to them you just <i>had</i> to also mention the Matrix protocol, when it is just <i>Element.</i> which even that by itself is very ambiguous.')
