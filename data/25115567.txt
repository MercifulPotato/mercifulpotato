Without UHV lines, much energy is lost to resistance during electrical transmission. Bitcoin mining can, in theory, transfer the equivalent value of the energy to the main cities in the east of China, avoiding loss due to resistance in the lines. If you think of a transaction over the blockchain network as the movement of stored energy it is frictionless and akin to sending an email.<p>This is just one example of how the bitcoin blockchain could be used to harness energy in a more efficient way. And it’s a good example of how the world of energy and the world of the blockchain are beginning to blend together.”<p>Does anyone else find this argument dubious?')
