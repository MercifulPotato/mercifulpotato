Usually it can get you before you are &quot;looking at it&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Face ID since the xs, and so far my experience is, outside of mask wearing, much better than Touch ID. But I also try not to touch my phone when I&#x27;m out (and as such am wearing a mask).\nI even occasionally can&#x27;t use Touch ID on my MacBook because of a damp finger, and that sees far less usage than the phone.<p>I think early on low light (or rather barely any light) was a problem, but I can unlock it in a dark room these days... not sure what that means for accuracy... but it works well.')
