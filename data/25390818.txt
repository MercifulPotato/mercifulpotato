It turns out that smaller changes are quicker to ship. Lead to better code and tests. Have lower risk of cancellation and problems in production. And lead to earlier and better feedback.<p>Inspired by Goodhart’s Law I&#x27;ll propose the following: A measure that when it becomes a target improves productivity. ~Sijbrandij&#x27;s Law')
