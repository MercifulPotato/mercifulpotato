It generates a melody which is all-but-impossible for a listener to focus on actively.<p>That can be useful in certain scoring contexts where you want the music to be background while dramatic on-screen elements occupy the foreground.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty limited use case, though... which is basically my point.  In most circumstances, the twelve-tone technique doesn&#x27;t produce results many people find compelling.')
