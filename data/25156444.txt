I had extremly long running usenet discussions back then. My usenet reader was giving me a tree view of all topics were I could:<p>* See all news messages since the last time. I could see all the threads, news messages were marked in bold.\n* Cycle through them, i.e. show me next unread.\n* Make whole threads as read (when the topic is not interesting to me)\n* Ignore a thread or subthread (when it&#x27;s going offtopic or completely uninteresting to me)<p>And it was also super easy to filter out idiots, without anyone moderating the stuff.')
