The general public have been hearing it for decades now, and are probably just sick and tired of hearing about it. As far back as I can remember, it&#x27;s been nothing but &quot;Nuclear weapons are gonna kill us all&quot; &quot;Acid rain is gonna kill us all!&quot; &quot;Smog is gonna kill us all!&quot; &quot;Drugs and crime are gonna kill us all&quot; &quot;The ozone hole is gonna kill us all!&quot; &quot;Global warming is gonna kill us all!&quot; &quot;Terrorism is gonna kill us all&quot; &quot;Climate change is gonna kill us all!&quot; Yet, here we are, still going on towards these various cliffs. I can at least put myself in the general public&#x27;s shoes for a bit and empathize with their crisis fatigue. Economic crises are felt immediately--you lose your job. It&#x27;s no surprise that it&#x27;s politically easier to favor economics over other crises that are perpetually happening Real Soon Now.')
