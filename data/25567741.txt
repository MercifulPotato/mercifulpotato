But I strive to make less of them.<p>For instance, after I&#x27;ve reached programming maturity (i.e. the stage at which I&#x27;m not attached to a specific language, but are proficient in several, and can do basic work in any language you ask me to), I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate and make use of strong typing, precisely because it lets me add more (compiler-checked) rigor to my code. Even my Common Lisp code is as typed as the type system will allow me to (which is quite much). Programming this way is still difficult and fuzzy, but a little <i>less</i> fuzzy. Same with embracing certain styles and patterns of programming, that all help to narrow down the scope of things any piece of code could be doing at runtime.<p>I stand by my point: the more difficult your field is, the more care and rigor should be used in approaching it, if you care at all about making some kind of definitive statements about something that can survive the test of time.')
