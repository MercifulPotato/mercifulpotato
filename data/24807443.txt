Maybe the opposite is the way to go. A radical shift in power towards the states gives every subculture their own laboratory to live or die in. Liberal values can be protected in liberal states, and you&#x27;d see the opposite in conservative states.<p>Maybe we could stop fighting for the federal right to shove our ideologies down the throats of states that don&#x27;t want them. Different places would do different things, and that would be alright.')
