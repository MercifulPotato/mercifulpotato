And the company that offers something you care about a lot may also do something you hate a lot.<p>For example:<p>iOS: Better for privacy than Android but less open to sideloaded apps<p>Android: Sends tons of data to Google about all kinds of things. Furthermore Google bricked one of my old Android phones by disabling the DNS for the authentication server so I could no longer sign into the phone. (It was too old to support Cyanogen).<p>Samsung: The last Samsung S-series smartphone in my house had apps pre-loaded on it including Blockbuster (it wasn&#x27;t that many years ago) that could not be removed without loading new firmware or something. I guess Tizen is open source so theres that? But then again Samsung is one of the most cruel companies on Earth with a long track record of polluting, worker abuse, and blatantly copying others products and inside deals with the government to look the other way.<p>Microsoft: Abandoned the entire space. Was basically a copycat product with a UI based on squares anyway.<p>Essential Phone: Dead on arrival<p>Palm: Got left behind. Missed the whole app store wave<p>Blackberry: Wasn&#x27;t really designed for non-business users with all kinds of upcharges for Blackberry data services. Missed the whole app store wave. Pivoted into automotive software after they couldn&#x27;t keep up<p>So sure its easy to critique Apple for this or Google for that but ultimately what are the other options that can realistically compete with the above megacorps?')
