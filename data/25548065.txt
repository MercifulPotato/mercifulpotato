Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609033165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545204, text='&gt; few have much energy for fighting the idea that literature should be studied for itâ€™s own sake<p>I agree with your post, except that statement is a bit of personal choice. From my perspective, knowing how airplanes work and how they fly makes my life richer, but I doubt lit majors would feel the same way.<p>(For example, when my house was built, I noticed a weak spot in the structure holding the house up, and had it reinforced. Without engineering training, I never would have noticed. Does this matter? In my previous house, some of the doors wouldn&#x27;t close properly, and in the crawl space I noticed the main loads were not supported directly by a column on a concrete pad. The structure there had been gradually sinking. Jacking up that section of the house, installing a pad and a column, fixed that and the doors all worked again. I missed another structural fault until one day a window just shattered from the stress of the distorting wall.)')
