I&#x27;ve not thought of a better term. u&#x2F;edejong uses the term &quot;sequential programming&quot;, which might be the right (best) answer.<p>u&#x2F;rgoulter wrote:<p><i>&quot;I&#x27;d note that the recipe used in the post doesn&#x27;t include a list of ingredients.&quot;</i><p>Yup. Also missing are preconditions, assumptions, defensive programming. Maybe forgivable omissions from a blog entry. But those &quot;ingredient&quot; steps are what allow the &quot;recipe&quot; to be simple.<p>u&#x2F;contingencies wrote:<p><i>&quot;decouple your ingredient prep from your cooking algorithm.&quot;</i><p>This is The Correct Answer[tm].<p>But I don&#x27;t see anyone explaining why: It makes the code testable, directly.<p>Stated another way:<p>Decouple all the async, blocking, I&#x2F;O stuff from the business logic. And do not interleave those tasks.<p>How you know you&#x27;re doing it wrong:<p>Any and all use of mocking, dependency injection, inversion of control is wrong. Therefore, the presence of Spring and Mockito (and their knockoffs) is strong evidence you&#x27;re doing things wrong.')
