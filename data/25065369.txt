My wife and I discussed paying the extra cost to &quot;upgrade&quot; to a tankless water heater.  In the end our frugal nature won and we put in another cheaper tank heater.<p>Then in August we were hit by a Derecho (an inland hurricane).  The entire city was without power for more than 10 days (some much longer) and temperatures in the upper nineties.  The one saving grace was I still had a working water heater since it&#x27;s gas powered.')
