CO₂ is disposed of by compressing it 1500 psi and injecting it underground.  Even small amounts of N₂ or H₂O will cause the gas to misbehave in the pipeline.<p>The obvious answer to this is<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amine_gas_treating" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amine_gas_treating</a><p>which is a well-understood process but it is not cheap.  The other is to remove the N₂ before combustion.

The hope with CLC is that you might be able to bolt it onto a fluidized bed combustion system and not raise the cost as much as the alternatives.')
