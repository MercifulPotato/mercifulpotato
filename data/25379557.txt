The results (valuation and whatever) speak for themselves and how they got there is irrelevant if the only question is whether the company is successful in dollars and cents.<p>Here in the comments I see concerns not just about whether the company is successful or not, but whether it has done any good.  That is, _good_ for people other than the owners of the company.<p>That is not about “attitude”, or some other self-help slogan.  You can’t evaluate the outside world based on what you read in Think and Grow Rich.')
