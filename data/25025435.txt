Alice only listens to track A 980 times. (Alice listens to the song less this month than last month)<p>The Bobs are now paying $20&#x2F;month. The Bobs only listen to track B 20 times total (Each Bob listens to the track 10 times).<p>Total revenue $30, Total streams still 1000. $0.03 per stream. Track A gets $29.40. Track B gets $0.60.<p>Track A just increased its revenue 48% despite being listened to less the second month. Track B was responsible for Spotify earning $10 more, but only saw $0.40 of what it brought into Spotify.<p>However, I&#x27;m not sure what the downstream ramifications of \nthe new incentives would be after hypothetically switching from pro-rata payment structure to a per-user structure. Would artists&#x27; &#x2F; music labels&#x27; strategies change?<p>I also wonder what would happen to the revenue from users who pay subscriptions for a month, but neglect to use the service at all. It seems it would make sense to either pay the artists that user has listened to over their lifetime&#x2F;past year, or distribute pro-rata across all of Spotify.')
