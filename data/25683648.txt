Don&#x27;t do the crime again, and you get to stay out of prison. Sure it might sting a bit until countries learned that doing things like that hurts them more than it gains them. But slightly longer term, the preventive effects should kick in, and we might get some semblance of civility in international affairs. So we wouldn&#x27;t wall off the G7 from the rest of the world unless they were very stupid and kept committing crimes.')
