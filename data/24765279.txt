You are getting downvoted because you are being condescending.<p>You can&#x27;t just ignore the hatred being spewed at you. It infects how you interact with the world. You start having panic attacks going into the toilet, because maybe you will be harassed today when you want to pee. The people who hate you latch onto the twisted news stories. They use it to deny progress, or to push through restrictions. Like the US politicians quoting JK Rowling for why we should restrict trans rights. The bullshit spreads. It doesn&#x27;t matter that JK Rowling almost never quotes any sources, and the one she does has been well disproven and largely retracted. People still read what she says, ignore the corrections and continue to spread the hate.<p>The number of times I&#x27;ve heard someone going on about how we are giving children surgery. It is ridiculous how ill-informed yet completely certain in their opinion people can be about trans healthcare. I&#x27;m not more intelligent than anyone else, I just have an invested reason (my very life) to be well informed on the topic.')
