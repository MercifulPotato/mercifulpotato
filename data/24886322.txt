You are obviously not Swedish, and you obviously have no idea what the situation is actually like in Sweden.<p>If you think you&#x27;re getting an accurate view of Sweden&#x27;s strategy, response, and outcome through non-Swedish media, you are completely mistaken. The amount of misinformation in foreign media has been absolutely off the charts this year.<p>Here is the official Swedish strategy, read it yourself and stop spreading crap:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.government.se&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;strategy-in-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.government.se&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;strategy-in-respo...</a><p>&quot;Point 1: Limit the spread of infection in the country<p>By limiting the spread of the virus, the Government aims to relieve pressure on the health care system and protect peopleâ€™s lives, health and jobs.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of &quot;letting it spread like wildfire&quot;.<p>&gt; Sweden&#x27;s population density is a fraction of Italy&#x27;s and Spain&#x27;s<p>The national average population density tells you absolutely nothing in this case, and the number is that low because Sweden has a whole lot of land where noone lives. You bringing this up in a corona discussion only shows even more that you know absolutely nothing about Sweden and obviously never been there.<p>For reference, Sweden is 87% urbanized, while Spain is only 81%, and Italy even less at 71%.')
