It’s relatively easy to drop stashes accidentally and lose them forever. I’ve seen people do this in production by not being careful when pulling while they have a dirty work tree. The man page for git stash mentions this fact:<p>“If you mistakenly drop or clear stash entries, they cannot be recovered through the normal safety mechanisms. However, you can try the following incantation to get a list of stash entries that are still in your repository, but not reachable any more:<p><pre><code>    git fsck --unreachable |\n    grep commit | cut -d\\  -f3 |\n    xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP</code></pre>\n”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;git-stash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;git-stash</a>')
