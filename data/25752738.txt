Where alphabet have vowels and consonants. Modern Arab, Hebrew and semitic languages have abjad.<p>Hieroglyph are pictograms&#x2F;logographic scripts. One word for one logogram to represent one word.<p>They mostly talk about the fact that the Phoenician may have come from illiterate worker in the Canaan mines. Unable to learn hieroglyphs, they may have invented a simplified writing system leading to the Phoenician. The main interest is that the Phoenician abjad is not a construction from savant but by illiterate workers.<p>What do you mean by count? Various writing system exists in parallel, none really prevails on the other.
