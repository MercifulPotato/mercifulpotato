The only real thing that many retail <i>sales</i> really does is contradict the &quot;we&#x27;re all HOLDING!!&quot; story.<p>It <i>could</i> be that very little of that was closing the original Melvin positions... but we don&#x27;t have evidence, do we? How can you prove that retail didn&#x27;t sell 75M to people closing short positions, and then retail bought 74M back from the brokers those shares were returned to, while meanwhile, a bunch of new investors went short because 300 bucks is a bonkers price and they&#x27;re betting they can wait it out a few months? Or anywhere in between?')
