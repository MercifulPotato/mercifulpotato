Here, macros are being used to generate implementations of a trait. If the trait bound is not satisfied, you have no way of knowing <i>why</i> other than that there was no implementation generated for it, hence the confusing error message. With variadic generics however, you could write something like:<p><pre><code>  Fn(..Args) -&gt; T\n</code></pre>\nwhich I assume would let the compiler know <i>why</i> the trait bound is not satisfied and output a nicer error message.')
