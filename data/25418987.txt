It can be expressed as a series of &quot;goto&quot; statements, same as for, while, do, switch. It&#x27;s just one they didn&#x27;t think of back when C was being designed. If it was in from the beginning, nobody would think it strange.<p>That said, it&#x27;s still debatable if it&#x27;s useful, given that you can achieve the same thing with the<p><pre><code>    struct some_resource resource;\n    do {\n        resource = allocate(...);\n        if (!resource) break;\n    } while(0);\n    if (resource) dispose(resource);\n</code></pre>\nI can see it as a good thing because you have the dispose statement next to the allocate statement, which makes the logic easier to follow, but the implementation may have caveats which make it actually harder to reason about, e.g. see the other thread about capture value vs capture reference - C will most probably need to capture by reference, which means that modifying &quot;resource&quot; later on changes the meaning of the deferred statement.')
