Item(by='Arcorann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606311187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206005, text='I remember reading a few years back an article about the most commonly shared views among voters (as in 90%+ agree rates), finishing with a political manifesto designed to incorporate as many of said views as possible (unfortunately I don&#x27;t quite remember exactly where that article was from, or I would link it). This, being the opposite of that article, is certainly more thought-provoking for obvious reasons, and I note that while there are likely people who agree with every statement in the other manifesto, there is almost certainly no-one who agrees with every statement in this one.')
