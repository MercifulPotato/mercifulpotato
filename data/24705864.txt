For example, I was born in the US, as were my parents and grandparents.  My great-grandparents immigrated from Italy, and if I can gather the proper documentation, I&#x27;m eligible for Italian citizenship.  If I ever get this done, then yes, I could indeed go back to my great-grandparents&#x27; country and do what you suggest is silly.  I believe quite a few other countries also have policies like this.')
