To state that such event may lead to total collapse wouldn&#x27;t be a new idea at all. It&#x27;s the mainstream hypothesis since the cold war.<p>To challenge those ideas by articulating the opposite (that it may not lead to total collapse) it&#x27;s new (to me at least) and good food for thought.<p>Can&#x27;t cite anything, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that the nimble investment in nuclear energy that society has made as a whole in the past decades were fueled by fear of total collapse as if it&#x27;s impossible for humans to play with fire without completely obliterating ourselves. And considering the new(ish) challenges we have (climate and others) I find it helpful to think that past demons&#x2F;fears can be managed in a constructive way.')
