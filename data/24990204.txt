I&#x27;ve done a decent amount of work with voice recognition for fire&#x2F;police and the technology just isn&#x27;t quite there yet.  ATC comms probably have a lot less variation than police&#x2F;fire calls, so you could probably train some custom models with a bunch of labeled ATC data to get you in the vicinity.<p>Couple other sources:<p>- Passive radar - Some pretty interesting results in this area <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtl-sdr.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;passive-radar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtl-sdr.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;passive-radar&#x2F;</a><p>- Sound detection&#x2F;recognition&#x2F;localization - Could correlate with ADSB to label sounds with known airframes to help train an identification model<p>- Video detection')
