There are a lot of low-information voters out there who don&#x27;t pour through the booklets and published rebuttals and rebuttals to the rebuttals. Media saturation works. It doesn&#x27;t always work, and you can always go back and find exceptions, even some very high profile ones, but if it didn&#x27;t work <i>in general</i>, we wouldn&#x27;t see so much money pouring into political advertisements. There&#x27;s a reason we track and measure campaigns by counting dollars spent.')
