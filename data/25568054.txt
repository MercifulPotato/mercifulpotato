There were even a few laptops in the past that did it sort-of-okay.<p>The trick is to have a bunch of microphones along the edge of the display, all the way around. This then enables beam-steering and noise filtering by keeping only the signal common to all microphones.<p>Mobile phones often do this kind of thing, but PC developers are stuck in this local minimum that they seem completely unable to escape.<p>Speaking of which, the iPhone 12 Pro has a HDR OLED display that goes toe-to-toe with a USD $35K Sony BVM-X300 Master Monitor: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n_czpXW3yKE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n_czpXW3yKE</a><p>Meanwhile... good luck finding a decent 17&quot; laptop with an OLED screen!<p>As far as I can tell, all OLED laptops made in 2020 used the exact same Samsung 15.6&quot; panels, and then all other OLED manufacturers also simultaneously agreed that no sizes above that need exist:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oled-info.com&#x2F;here-come-oled-laptops-sdc-start-producing-156-uhd-oleds-next-month" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oled-info.com&#x2F;here-come-oled-laptops-sdc-start-p...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oled-info.com&#x2F;boe-demonstrates-new-oleds-monitors-and-laptops" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oled-info.com&#x2F;boe-demonstrates-new-oleds-monitor...</a><p>Keep in mind that Samsung makes an OLED panel for Apple that is capable of 1,200 nits peak HDR brightness, but is incapable of making a laptop screen that exceeds 400 nits for some mysterious reason. I can&#x27;t prove, but strongly suspect that all PC parts are now being made in the supplier&#x27;s legacy plants, and the top-tier stuff is exclusively reserved for mobile device manufacturers...')
