Any suggestions?<p>How many firearms, and ammo you can buy, and how many politicians you can lobby? Even if you are a single digit millionaire, that&#x27;s just enough to arm, and feed no more than a single lightly armed battalion for a few months.<p>I see other option than a military solution, either limited, or not.<p>Even if any Western power decide on half hearted piecemeal solution like smuggling weapons into to China, and rile up the populace, it will only bleed China a very, very little. China easily endure waging a civil war the size of Syrian, and continue growing economically like if nothing happened.')
