The problem: It took &gt;20hrs for a direct duplication of the disk. The other problem: this was legal evidence from my spouses work on a harddisk provided by police, so I assumed this was the best approach. Ultimately she had to give it in late because of my genius idea which I told her wouldn&#x27;t take long.<p>Given a time constraint the next time this happened, we gave up `dd`, and did the old mounted disk copy&#x2F;paste via Finder approach... which only took only 3hrs to get 1.2TB of files across into the other HD - via usb-c interfaces.<p>I&#x27;ve been speculating why one was 5x+ faster than the other (besides the fact `dd` doing a bit-by-bit copy of the filesystem). My initial suspicion was options provided `dd`:<p>&gt; sudo dd if=&#x2F;dev&#x2F;rdisk2 of=&#x2F;dev&#x2F;rdisk3 bs=1m conv=noerror,sync<p>I&#x27;m not 100% familiar with the options for `dd` but I do remember a time where I changed `bs=1M` to `bs=8M` helped speed up a transfer in the past.<p>But I didn&#x27;t do it for the sake of following the instructions on StackOverflow.')
