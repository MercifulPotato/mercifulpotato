People pay for stuff that has a wall around it and can&#x27;t be easily pirated. (Note: most news we read (measured by page views) is pirated by adware websites after someone published original research.)<p>Maybe YOU block or just avoid ads and pay for non-spyware stuff, but businesses overall respond to the masses.<p>Even on the super private ad-restricting expensive iPhone, most users immediately rush to adbacked trash websites.')
