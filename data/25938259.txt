None of the point is new (Cannabis users in where it is illegal also showed strong correlation with other substance use), The strong claims are click-bait:<p>&gt;not be in a relationship at age 35<p>and it&#x27;s light on any details or insight. It&#x27;s a ridiculous hit piece with nothing but academic resume padding, but from none other than professors, that get amplified by shoddy journalism. Probably with some ulterior ideological motives (for funding maybe?)<p>Most of all: It&#x27;s not tech related. Why is this voted up so much?')
