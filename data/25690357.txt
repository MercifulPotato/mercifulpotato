I&#x27;m only twisting the facts about as much as &#x2F;u&#x2F;jakelazaroff did in the post I replied to.<p>By his rules, if somebody in a group was once involved in violence, no matter what the story of it was, you can claim that it has a &quot;history of violence&quot;. If a left-wing activist found a photo of somebody posing with somebody they call a &quot;far right extremist and terrorist&quot;, then you can claim that they have &quot;connections to various far right extremist and terrorist groups&quot;.<p>If somebody associated with the movement once carried some sort of weapon, then you can smear the entire group as carrying it. If some violent act, like planting a bomb, happened around their thing but nobody is sure who did it yet, then you can ignore that the true perpetrator is unknown and just smear the whole movement as being associated with it.<p>I don&#x27;t see you attacking &#x2F;u&#x2F;jakelazaroff for doing these things. Why should I believe you&#x27;re interested in having an actual debate? If his side is permitted to spread propaganda full of vague accusations and wild exaggerations, then why shouldn&#x27;t I respond in kind? Why should I accept the argument that &quot;most protests and protestors were peaceful&quot; when your side spends all its time trying to ignore anything peaceful my side does and smear everyone with the worst interpretation of the worst thing that happened?')
