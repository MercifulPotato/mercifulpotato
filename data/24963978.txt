We know from lots of experience that even with heavy enforcement, just reducing speed limits doesn&#x27;t have a big effect on actual speeds.  About 10% of drivers rigorously follow the signs, the other 90% drive what&#x27;s comfortable.  So the practical answer is to design roads to be uncomfortable at high speeds.  Makes them safer for cars and people both.  Just reducing speed limits is a feel-good non-solution.')
