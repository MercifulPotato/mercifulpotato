There was a time when game studios would just give Nintendo and Atari the middle finger and produce a cartridge that worked with their consoles anyway. Back in those days, the computers and consoles weren&#x27;t restricted to only running software signed and approved by the manufacturer.<p>You&#x27;re partially right.<p>In the case of Atari, there was no technical enforcement mechanism.  Third parties figured out how to make their own cartridges, but lack of control on the market led to a glut of new games in 1982.  That glut triggered rapid price reductions (as retailers were often stuck with unsold inventory that couldn&#x27;t be returned to the publisher), which eventually cratered the entire business, shrinking it by about 97%.[0]<p>For Nintendo, they did have a technical protection mechanism present in the NES (the 10NES chip).  They were allowed to enforce market restrictions based on the presence of the chip.[1]<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Video_game_crash_of_1983" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Video_game_crash_of_1983</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atari_Games_Corp._v._Nintendo_of_America_Inc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atari_Games_Corp._v._Nintendo_...</a>.')
