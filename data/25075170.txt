They never capture my customizations, and never offer the ability to replicate them. So I just live with non-modal editing when using other editors.<p>Speaking of modal editing, I&#x27;m really interested in Kakoune&#x27;s model. With Vim, you type the action, then type the motion, and it performs the action immediately. This often means I have to repeat actions a few times if I&#x27;m unsure quite what motion I want, or I have to pause and count things (e.g. if I want to delete from the beginning of a token until a close paren, doing that with a single &quot;d&quot; command requires me to mentally balance parens to find what count I want to give to the motion). Kakoune flips this around, you do the motion first, then do the action. Of course Vim has its visual mode which is similar, but that puts you into a different mode entirely that you then have to exit if you change your mind, and not all commands work in visual mode. Kakoune also has far better support for multiple selection than Vim. The problem with Kakoune is just that I can&#x27;t use it anywhere except in the terminal, which is a barrier to adopting it (whereas I use MacVim often). I&#x27;m also not sure offhand what the plugin situation is like (I know it supports plugins, but I don&#x27;t know how powerful they are; I recall when kakoune first came out all extensibility was done by shelling out to external commands but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still the case).')
