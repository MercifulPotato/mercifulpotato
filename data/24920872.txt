Because if not, then I wonder to what extent a human brain can become conscious on its own without any help from fellow humans and&#x2F;or animals.<p>There are children that have been neglected, but still had some capabilities of learning language because they weren&#x27;t <i>completely</i> neglected. I wonder to what extent humans pass the mirror test if all they got was food, shelter, a place to move around a bit and nothing else.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to ask this question though. While I think it&#x27;s scientifically interesting, it also implies the fate of several people that have suffered it.')
