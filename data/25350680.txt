I have the same visceral reaction to that word. And it&#x27;s not like I care about pink shirts or other cutesy things. It&#x27;s specifically that word, used by an adult.<p>Some people have similar reactions to words like &quot;moist&quot; or &quot;juicy&quot;. (Those would be context-dependent for me)<p>But &quot;yummy&quot; is just hard to hear for some reason. Except when it&#x27;s a small child expressing their like for cookies or candy. Then it&#x27;s totally fine.<p>Anyway, just thought you&#x27;d like to hear there are more of us out there :)')
