Xbox v1 borrowed heavily from Dave’s work on modular, stable-userspace NT. 360 was basically running a full-fledged NT iirc. Dave, like Eric, hated the Xbox project early on.<p>In today’s terms, it would be like Facebook deciding to make a search engine or mobile OS, so their reactions were hardly surprising. Word was that even BillG was hesitant, but Ballmer really wanted more product lines.<p>Eric will be dearly missed.')
