Physical memory is only reserved (faulted in) when you actually access a memory location. Memory fragmentation is much less an issue since Linux frees and reorganizes pages behind the scenes.<p>This paragraph is confusing to me.<p>- How would a MMU help for malloc to execute &quot;swiftly and reliably&quot; ?<p>- What does &quot;actually access a memory location&quot; implies exactly?<p>- &quot;since Linux frees and reorganizes pages behind the scenes&quot;: Is this not what people dislike from malloc? That it&#x27;s none deterministic?')
