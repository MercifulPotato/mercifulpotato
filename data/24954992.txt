I think this gets complicated, especially in the middle of heated discussions or on the internet, when this stuff is brought up ad-hominem. Or close enough. It&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t want to bring anger into this discussion and create another pro&#x2F;anti divide, because we&#x27;re all going to see it different ways.<p>I challenge anyone to come up with a person who was a squeaky clean legacy. I contend that it is impossible, because the goalposts for &#x27;cleanliness&#x27; change as the times do.')
