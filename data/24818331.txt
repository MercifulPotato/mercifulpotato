China has shared a lot of information around the pandemic that can be classed as &#x27;draconian countermeasures&#x27;, but they do seem to have the COVID situation under control.<p>If you want to argue the opposite then you should substantiate that with data and sources, rather than just with claims left hanging without support.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is going to be some discrepancy between the facts and what we get from official communications but at this point in time there are very few governments left that have been 100% transparent during this whole saga. China likely is no exception to that but I would not expect them a-priori to be worse than say Russia or some of the countries of the EU.')
