The problem is that in any single situation it is easier for expert to solve it alone then explain and when then there is sudden need to explain, expert can&#x27;t do it effectively. Because he was not explaining for years.<p>Plus, you end up being in a limited box and have harder time to grow by learning new things - project structure keeps you in box and you can&#x27;t easily expand it by taking tasks to learn something new.<p>Finally, expert is sort of fake expert - expert only because others are kept clueless.
