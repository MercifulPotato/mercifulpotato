The state has no credible mechanism to continue prosecution (along with a vigorous defense) once he&#x27;s dead. There was no way to do what you wanted.<p>Voting systems were audited, and all that happened was that Q people made up bullshit and moved the goalposts.  None of the conspiratorial-minded right-wingers looked at the 60 lawsuits or the many recounts and took them as evidence that their cause was incorrect.  They took it as proof that the truth was just even more oppressed.<p>Facts don&#x27;t work against bullshit.  This is an important lesson that people like you need to learn.  Wake the fuck up, you dumb son of a bitch.')
