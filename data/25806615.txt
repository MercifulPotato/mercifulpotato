Item(by='perl4ever', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610840451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25805276, text='&gt;I generally know if I&#x27;m doing a good job<p>Could you elaborate? I would agree that random praise from a manager is not an especially good way to evaluate how well one is doing. But to me, &quot;doing a good job&quot; inherently depends on things that aren&#x27;t purely determined by introspection.<p>Here&#x27;s a scenario for example: I do things for people, that are well received, my manager talks to other people, and it leads to people outside my department asking for special projects.<p>I create something, of which I&#x27;m reasonably proud, and it gets copious praise from the requestor. But it turns out, I learn through the grapevine, there are several people who I never came in contact with, who are the actual intended end users, who ultimately refuse to use it at all, because it doesn&#x27;t fit into their workflow, because the manager who asked me to do it doesn&#x27;t understand it.<p>Without external feedback, there&#x27;s no way to tell what effect I&#x27;m having on the organization and the world. And I would think that every employee at any level has to deal with this.')
