I believe I read that creating the 3D version of Toy Story ran at 24 fps, averaged across the entire film.  So, basically, we already crossed the threshold for Toy Story.  (But maybe that was only if you have a rendering farm?)<p>So, where are we at?  Could we render a plausible Toy Story in real time now?  Bug&#x27;s Life?  Monsters Inc?')
