I think language choice is a smaller part of the pie compared to Microsoft&#x27;s backing, networking effects within companies, and visual appeal and design.<p>However, I do agree with you that Emacs onboarding process can be difficult if you don&#x27;t know lisp, in that you have to now learn a new language and the API for interacting with the editor. That is why some friends and I recently decided to embed JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript into Emacs as a means of controlling the editor [1]. We will see if we can prove you right.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emacs-ng&#x2F;emacs-ng" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emacs-ng&#x2F;emacs-ng</a>')
