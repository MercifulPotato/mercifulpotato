They like being able to drive and park at things easily.<p>yeah people probably are pretty happy with their situation. it probably works pretty well for them. they probably respond extremely negatively to any other possibilities. they&#x27;d tell you they wouldn&#x27;t want to use public transit or bikes or whatever else. they couldn&#x27;t imagine how inconvenient that would be. that sounds terrible to them.<p>but like, people across broad parts of Europe don&#x27;t think of biking as inconvenient. people with good public transit don&#x27;t think of it as inconvenient. i far prefer getting on the bus to taking my car, negotiating traffic &amp; parking. at my last job, it took a couple months of trying it, but eventually i started to far prefer a bike commute to the bus, even though it was pretty long &amp; hilly.<p>so much of our preferences is comfortability with the known, familiarity. the expressed preference of society, often, it turns out, matter for very little, reflect primarily bias, not intelligence or wisdom or what makes us (individually or collectively) happiest. and all too often these things we imagine serve us, they hold back society. they feed our id, they feed our ego, and the deny a greater super-ego, a better way, that we could better enjoy.')
