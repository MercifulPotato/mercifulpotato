He does say, as you note, &quot;If I had suspected they might be building a spy engine, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have cooperated&quot;, but above that postscript, he says, &quot;If nothing else, this bit of news reaffirms my view that the Berkeley license provides the maximum amount of freedom to potential users. If they want to publicize what they have done, fine. By all means, do so. If there are good reasons not to release the modfied code, that&#x27;s fine with me, too.&quot; So I guess, &quot;license is working as intended, but I don&#x27;t like what you did with it&quot;?')
