If yes, do so. If not, go in to work and practice social distancing.<p>Try to apply some common sense, and a &#x27;reasonable&#x27; test - that&#x27;s what the law uses. Don&#x27;t look for &#x27;but what if&#x27; for the sake of it, and don&#x27;t try to armchair-lawyer it - work towards what the intent that is obvious to any reasonable person, using your own intelligence to achieve this.<p>Law like this isn&#x27;t code - it isn&#x27;t a set of &#x27;if, else&#x27; conditions. It asks if you were acting reasonably. Could you look a magistrate in the eye and explain your reasoning?<p>Please try to act reasonably rather than quibbling.')
