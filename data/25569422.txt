Their success rate on double spends can easily be &gt;90% and the marginal cost of the attack is approximately zero.<p>Other than the technical know-how to setup the transaction broadcasting and the risk that you might just pay for what you were buying, there is no cost to the scam.<p>Same story on Bitcoin and BCH (here is a tweet about making 2511 successful double spends on BCH: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;peterrizun&#x2F;status&#x2F;1051088866743017473?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;peterrizun&#x2F;status&#x2F;1051088866743017473?la...</a>).<p>The situation is somewhat worse on BCH in the sense that they only have ~1.2% of Bitcoin&#x27;s hashrate, so there are many single Bitcoin miners that can reorg bch, so even single confirmations aren&#x27;t particularly safe.<p>There are, of course, plenty of cases where 0-conf could be accepted-- e.g. you could credit someone assets but not allow withdraw until they clear, or if goods will ship the next day you need only check that they&#x27;ve confirmed before shipment.  Some places do this now.')
