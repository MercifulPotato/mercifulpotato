Buy a cheap Yamaha or Casio keyboard, which can be had for 80-120 used. Leave it on the floor, plugged in and on them to play with at any time.\n1. Buy color stickers, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00DRGXBIM&#x2F;ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_WTzmsHdhSSjNl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00DRGXBIM&#x2F;ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apip_WTz...</a>.\n2. Label each unique note in the twelve tone scale with a distinct color. The system I used was the one from welearnandplay.com: cdefgab=red,yellow,green,orange,blue,gray,purple.\n3. Play games with the kid’s favorite toys and the notes.<p>- Example: find a red and green toy. Introduce the red toy while singing red=C, like “this is the red truck&#x2F;doll&#x2F;fox&#x2F;whatever”. Then do the same with the other color you picked. Have them show you a toy, then sing a story about that toy using only that color note.\n- Point out the colors of things you see. Use a tuner or piano app on your phone to generate accurate tones. This requires that you memorize the note color system yourself, which will happen easily after about an hour of initial play.')
