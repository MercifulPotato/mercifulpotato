When hiking I didn&#x27;t see anyone for several days - so even the odd hiker I met seemed like a gift. In a way it also changed me from saying &quot;hell is other people&quot;, to &quot;I love company and being around people&quot;.<p>doesn&#x27;t mean that I never feel lonely, the difference today is how I respond to that feeling I guess.')
