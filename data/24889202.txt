Wow, I wrote this article back in college and I was really surprised to see it up here on HN! Pretty cool to see so many talented embedded folks reading my &quot;write to learn&quot; piece :)<p>This blog post was the start of me figuring out the love of diving in deep to embedded development. Since then, I built a patient monitor device using this makefile-driven build approach. Nowadays, I am re-writing this device using embedded Rust. It has been such a great experience watching the embedded Rust space grow and mature over the years; it wasn&#x27;t the case several years ago, but now I can build a complex embedded system using stable Rust! I&#x27;ve even got on-device unit tests working, and it&#x27;s still the same terminal-driven, vim-based workflow I&#x27;ve gotten so familiar with.')
