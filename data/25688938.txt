So progressives and liberals can take over &#x2F;r&#x2F;conservative and post anything they want without fear of being banned? No more &#x27;flaired users only&#x27;?<p>because that&#x27;s ALSO censorship, no?<p>Also, who&#x27;s stopping you from starting a reddit competitor and saying whatever you want? You have ZERO rights to THEIR customers, their users, etc.<p>I mean, can you go to the local news station and get on the air whenever you want? Because they aren&#x27;t saying what you want to hear? No. They control who they put on the air. Social media is no different in this aspect.')
