If you&#x27;re very small, you probably don&#x27;t need it, and DigitalOcean without surprise costs should do.   When you start getting large enough, AWS starts paying off, as you get really huge, then it might be cheaper to colocate and hire your own admins.  However, I think Netflix shows you can&#x27;t be too big tho for AWS.  Their hybrid approach is probably best.    Run on AWS&#x2F;GCP for things that you just can&#x27;t afford to fail, then move your non critical workload to colocation.')
