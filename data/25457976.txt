We understood the liability issues, that&#x27;s why ultimately we had no leg to stand on, but the crux of how poorly Stripe handled this was:<p>- &quot;0 day&quot; notice. Boom, account shut down. Don&#x27;t like it? Well pay clear every single account.<p>- You let accounts process refunds even with active chargebacks. This isn&#x27;t a default &quot;sane&quot; position. We had no way of reacting to this.<p>- The period this went on. From the first negative balance to &quot;Day 0&quot; was well over a year. Not once did you send a notice or friendly email this was happen. It literally went from happy days to business destroying lock outs overnight. We had customers leave us with serious negative balances which we could have possibly collected if they were still customers. Overall we only managed to get about 1k back from our customers.')
