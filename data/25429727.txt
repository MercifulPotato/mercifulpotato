Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25433271], score=None, time=1608036050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429093, text='&gt; This document [0] has airport-to-city-center-by-taxi timings for top European airports. 1 hour seems to be the absolute worst, 27 min average, 22 min median. And it only gets better with smaller cities [1].<p>Sure; rail times were what I was assuming; your document puts them in the region of 40 minutes from a &quot;hub&quot; (though there&#x27;s a lot of variation), so I stand by about an hour from a typical origin&#x2F;destination. If you routinely take taxis then fair enough, but that comes with its own set of downsides.<p>&gt; Boarding for short flights shouldn&#x27;t close earlier than 20 minutes before departure. For large airports 40 mins should be enough. For tiny regional airports 30. Even check-in counters will sometimes close as late as 30 mins before departure.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen an airport that didn&#x27;t officially advise 45 minutes, and every major airport I&#x27;ve been to had check-in counters closing an hour before departure. (Whereas, Eurostar excepted, the official number I&#x27;ve heard from train operators is 5 minutes). You can probably get away with less most of the time, sure, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to take the risk.')
