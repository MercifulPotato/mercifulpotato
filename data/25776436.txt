There&#x27;s still areas of openness, but they get smaller every year. And every time there&#x27;s a new layer of restriction added there&#x27;s always someone to point out that you still can do x y and z, it&#x27;s just 10-20% harder than it used to be.<p>I agree with the tone of your post, but it&#x27;s not the <i>web</i> that&#x27;s open (every website is created&#x2F;owned&#x2F;controlled by <i>someone</i>), it&#x27;s the Internet as a whole that needs to be open.<p>&gt;When apps for phones came out it was &quot;Well, you can always just make a web app. They have no control over that.&quot; but consumers are less likely to use a web app and you don&#x27;t have the same access to the device.<p>I understand your frustration, but while we have freedom of speech and freedom of association, etc.<p>And while you certainly have a right to start your own business, you don&#x27;t have the right to force others to make it easy for you.<p>Again, I understand your frustration, but what you&#x27;re arguing for just doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Why should other companies be forced to change their business practices to make your life&#x2F;business easier?<p>That&#x27;s a rhetorical question of course, but you don&#x27;t have to treat it as one if you don&#x27;t want to.')
