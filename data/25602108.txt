How would you design a Mario or a Zelda game? Or do you have any examples of comparable games without cartoon violence?<p>Many popular games have an element of rivalry; you have to take away the ball, defend or capture a base, get the most points, etc. In a game of tag people chase and touch each other. One could argue that being “caught” or being “jumped on” are violent concepts, but in the context of a game I’d view them as harmless.')
