Were you&#x2F;they able to start the car??</i><p>When I was an auto mechanic back in the 90s, more than once I&#x27;ve pulled a car into a bay that wasn&#x27;t the car I was supposed to work on. The keys matched, make and model matched, must be the one that needs an oil change. And, yes, I&#x27;ve changed the oil on a car that wasn&#x27;t there for an oil change.<p>It didn&#x27;t happen but a handful of times over a few years, but it did occasionally happen. Does it happen with modern keyless entry? Dunno, I&#x27;ve been a software dev for the last 25 years.')
