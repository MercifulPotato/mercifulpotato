Anyway, this is like buying hamburger meat and discovering it&#x27;s made out of ostrich.<p>I think there&#x27;s a big difference between making it illegal to name something because it wasn&#x27;t manufactured in a certain spot, versus making it illegal because it&#x27;s a completely different product.  I couldn&#x27;t care less if Feta was made in Greece or not.  But Feta from cow&#x27;s milk isn&#x27;t Feta, any more than a peanut butter sandwich made with hummus isn&#x27;t a peanut butter sandwich.')
