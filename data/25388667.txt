Item(by='Tomte', descendants=None, kids=[25388981], score=None, time=1607709922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372401, text='über allen wipfeln --&gt; works<p>&quot;über allen wipfeln&quot; --&gt; 403 Forbidden<p>&quot;über&quot; --&gt; works<p>I&#x27;ve tried a few other cases like those. It seems to me that Umlaute are fine when only a single word is used, even quoted, but a quoted string of several words where one has an Umlaut leads to the error.')
