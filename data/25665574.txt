Did you look at the life-expectancy impact of severe economic downturns and compare them to likely excess fatality figures due to your proposed policy? I suspect not, because last I looked it didn&#x27;t seem to find much evidence for silently killing economic stress.<p>Not the point I was making. I do not know which option will lead to less death, neither do you, neither do really the scientists (although they have a better idea). However, a full lockdown will lead to more economic loss at least in the short term than a voluntary lockdown. Long-term, as I said, I don&#x27;t think any of us can say.<p>&gt; you might still find that just the &quot;legitimate&quot; cases are enough to really mess up urgent health care for a lot of other people.<p>Like is currently happening? Yes, my solution wouldn&#x27;t stop all bad effects. There will be much death regardless, the hope is that the people who are left to die as they chose no protection will &quot;help out&quot; with the number of ICU beds needed in general.<p>&gt; how would you even check ?<p>You are in lockdown until you fill in some sort of form with the government, waiving your rights to hospital care in the case of catching Corona. This list is used to make decisions. This part at least is implementable.')
