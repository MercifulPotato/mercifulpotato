Such as yourself.<p>Seems like you are still upset which is shocking since I agree with you.<p>&gt; India has been a democracy in spite of the monarchies the UK used to support in Indian territory, in spite of the regional and sectarian conflicts the British tried to impose on (and succeeded) India.<p>You are repeating yourself. I agreed.<p>&gt; Have you ever considered the reason why India has been forced to languish in the background in world affairs, in spite of being on track to be the most populous country, to be because of American and British (and for a while European) interference?<p>Less american. More british, but yes. I agree with you. And the reason why britain succeeded is because the indian elites are sell-outs. That&#x27;s my point. It&#x27;s why india willingly rejoined the british empire.<p>&gt; To correct your preconceived BS, the CoN is a meaningless patchwork of nations of the British empire for Britain.<p>It&#x27;s not meaningless. It&#x27;s symbolic. It reveals the mentality of the leaders of the colonies. If it is meaningless, why is india even in it? Isn&#x27;t it humiliating?<p>&gt; India is not a pathetic colony of Britain<p>Sure it is. Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be in the british empire. It willingly joined. Do you think think would allow hong kong to join the commonwealth? Do you think the US would join the &quot;commonwealth&quot;?<p>&gt; India has already overtaken Britain by the GDP numbers.<p>Considering india had 1.4 billion more people... And yet still britain is a permanent security council member and india is not.<p>&gt; Yet you also willfully ignore places such as Puerto Rico or American Samoa or France&#x27;s former African colonies, all of which have become worse shitholes than India.<p>Puerto rico and american samao are doing much better than india. Go look it up. And as for france&#x27;s african colonies, I believe they should liberate themselves as well. What&#x27;s your point? Puerto rico isn&#x27;t a country of 1.4 billion people.<p>I&#x27;m not the one being closeminded. You are. It seems like something triggered you and you act like I&#x27;m insulting india. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m saying india should become an independent power jusst like china. Not a british slave colony. If china was still in the british empire, I&#x27;d say the same thing.<p>Imagine after ww2, china decided to rejoin the japanese empire. That would have been insane right? That&#x27;s what india did. The only reason that happened was because the indian leadership&#x2F;elite are sellouts. No other explanation for that. And it&#x27;s also why india is so poorly developed. After ww2, india shouldn&#x27;t have begged their way back to the british empire, they should have demanded a seat at the UN security council.<p>As it stands, india today can&#x27;t demand a permanent seat at the UN security council since they are a colony of britain. Can&#x27;t have britain and their colony both in the permanent security council...')
