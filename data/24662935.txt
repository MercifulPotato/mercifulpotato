I&#x27;m concerned about the cohort of people who are barely scraping by, you seem to paint a picture that these peoples lives have improved because their &quot;real income&quot; has grown substantially.  Ok so they were barely making rent at 15k&#x2F;year, and their real wages increase by 5k&#x2F;year since 2010.  Has their rent remained stable over the last then years?  Perhaps these quotable numbers aren&#x27;t all that useful except to further marginalize?')
