From scheduling to medical records to payroll to remote monitoring to mobile apps, we aim to be the operating system for delivering care in the places people call home.<p>Our software powers over a million care visits a month, and with an aging population, limited hospital space, and COVID, that number is on its way up.<p>We&#x27;re a high-growth company with the awards and revenue growth to show for it, but at the same time, we remain individually focused on the reasons that brought us to this niche industry.<p>Our back-end is a combination of Python and PHP, and our front-end is mostly Vue. We write tooling in whatever we know that works, and we run on AWS.<p>Roles:<p><pre><code>  - Operations Engineer\n  - QA Developer\n  - ETL&#x2F;Data Pipeline Developer\n  - Internal Tooling Developer\n</code></pre>\nOur engineering hubs are in Montreal and Victoria, with additional offices in Toronto and Peterborough. We&#x27;re remote-first, but not yet remote-only.<p>Happy to answer questions at daniel.langer [at] alayacare.com')
