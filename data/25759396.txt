A common scenario at present: instead of trawling all backups &amp; distributed stores to laboriously expunge every bit of deleted data, you could delete the relevant <i>encryption keys</i> - a small piece of data, a known quantity - rendering the encrypted data <i>inert</i>. This is particularly suited for systems that use WORM approach to backing up &amp; distributing data.')
