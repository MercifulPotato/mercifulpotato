On one hand developers, who as you say do not actually use all the deductions of configure scripts,.\nBut also users (the ones who blindly type .&#x2F;configure) are to blame a little. If you complain that you wait while configure checks to find whether your machine is 32 or 64 bits, etc., please read on how to specify &quot;site defaults&quot; once and then all your configure runs take a fraction of the time.')
