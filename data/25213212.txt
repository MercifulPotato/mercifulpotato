It&#x27;s very viable to meet your protein needs on a vegan diet. That stuff about vegans not being able to get complete proteins is meat industry propaganda. Furthermore, the World Health Organization said that only 10 to 15% of daily calories need to come from protein. I believe I&#x27;ve also read that there&#x27;s no proven benefit to all of the extra protein that Americans eat daily (I haven&#x27;t looked into that claim in-depth, though).')
