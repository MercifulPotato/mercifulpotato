It&#x27;s part of the human genome and like all genetic mutation it&#x27;s value is relative to selective pressure. But why should we not value individuals who have nocturnal tendencies as strategic advantage in the spectrum of human ability?<p>Personality I must have inherited an extreme form of this mutation from my grandmother, who always seemed very proud of her nightowlishness. We often encountered eachother happily up to something or other past 2am.<p>On the other hand the outside world has been a challenge. I&#x27;m not really awake until 11am. Highschool was pure hell. I was always late to class and always in trouble for it. In college I worked night jobs and took late classes. A few times I made up my mind to let go of making myself wake up or go to bed at certain times and let my natural cycle happen. Within two weeks I was very happily awake until almost dawn every night and up at 2ish.')
