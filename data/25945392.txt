Item(by='the_other', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611855401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25944935, text='Playing devil&#x27;s advocate here (because I have weakly held opinions and no good answers of my own):<p>&gt; There are a lot of projects (sudo being the most recent example) supported by a team of developers in the single digits (or just one) that are relied upon by projects raking in millions if not billions in annual revenue.<p>But they gave it away for free. That would be the same whether there were big, small or zero companies using the software.<p>I think probably the problem is framed wrong:<p>- maybe giving software away free was a bad idea (I don&#x27;t believe this; just putting it on the table for conversation)<p>- maybe those giving away their software free should make better calls _for themselves_ about how they spend their time<p>- maybe use different licensing<p>- stop calling it free; instead call it &quot;free a the point of consumption&quot; and consciously build a model to support that at the outset (this is my current personal opinion, but I grew up in the Uk when it had a functional NHS so I&#x27;m biassed)<p>- dig deep on what both &quot;free as in beer&quot; and &quot;free as in speech&quot; mean to you and how they relate and what you want to do about that<p>Open source came out of a joyous utopianism that hasn&#x27;t been backed up the wider societal changes needed to sustain it. This is understandable because that work is ridiculously hard (and I&#x27;m aware some people _are_ trying to make those changes. I just day-dream about it).<p>Currently, most of the world works on capitalism, for better or worse. I&#x27;m not trying to defend or attack capitalism here, but when you work in a capitalist system and _all_ your other interests and life support systems use capitalism, you have to factor that into your thinking. Open source makes more sense in a post-scaricity society and we&#x27;re not there yet. FOSS might even help us get there, and the problems we&#x27;re seeing in the past 3-4 years might be the signs of things changing.<p>I know this message sounds like victim blaming, and that&#x27;s a real problem in some situations, but I don&#x27;t think this is the situation here. Everyone working in tech is at a higher than average level of privilege than their immediate peers; working in FOSS is a choice you make from that position of privilege.')
