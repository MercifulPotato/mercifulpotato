Two of the main complaints about &quot;Lisp&quot; are that it&#x27;s not really a functional language and that there aren&#x27;t enough libraries&#x2F;the standard library isn&#x27;t what it should be. These are specific to Common Lisp. Clojure gives you a functional-first Lisp, access to all Java libraries, and a decent standard library. The Common Lisp standard is very old, even if you look at the date it was finalized (1994), but most components are from a much earlier period than 1994.')
