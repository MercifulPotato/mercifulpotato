This keeps my followers happy.<p>Now you can by all means click follow all day and night and it will work but what I did was make a [auto follow bot](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;calemedia.com&#x2F;parler-com-auto-follow-bot-gain-followers-automatically-get-free-traffic&#x2F;) if you know how to bot websites it will make everything a million times easier and you can get back to using other methods of getting free traffic.<p>My Parler account has got my website 1000s views and 100s of new members. This is something you should be doing no matter if you have a blog or a product or just a different social profile you want to advertise the possibility are endless.')
