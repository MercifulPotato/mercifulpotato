So I’m fairly familiar how MVCC relates to CoW, and the way that I read this is that it’s kind of the inverse of CoW: it’s an in-place update and a copy of the old data.<p>I can completely imagine the corner cases this ends up touching, as there must be an insane amount of logic in Postgres that assumes immutability of data on disk: if I read data block X for transaction version 1234, it will always remain the same.<p>It’s a very interesting approach though. Once all the corner cases are solved and delt with, I wonder: are there any reasons <i>not</i> to choose zheap over the standard storage engine?')
