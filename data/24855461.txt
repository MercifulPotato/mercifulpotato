Push out computational ability to everyone.<p>Same with Raspberry Pis - send one to every student in the country, the economic benefit from the 8-10 genius level kids getting that R-Pi and being inspired into programming will pay for the few million other devices.<p>I also really like the arm of the German government that port-scans companies and contacts them if they have vulnerable services running, it is the duty of the government to protect its industry and citizens and this kind of preemptive public good is innovative and shows long term thinking without a desire for immediate, transactional payoffs.<p>These things raise the bar and make miracles more likely to occur by “gardening” them into existence')
