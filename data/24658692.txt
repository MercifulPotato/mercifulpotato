I was following it closely since the announcement a few months back.<p>My question is: I am sure you guys are familiar with crypto-based prediction markets like augur.net and prediqt.everipedia.org that use smart contracts and real money for predictions. Given that facebook is also building Libra and getting into blockchain, do you guys see that down the line Forecast could be something that moves to facebook&#x27;s blockchain and&#x2F;or you guys collaborate with crypto-based products like the above mentioned? That would be truly exciting since it would bring pure market dynamics to the predictions. I&#x27;m aware of the regulatory hurdles there, but thought I&#x27;d ask anyway. Great job! This is so fun to use.')
