Item(by='csense', descendants=None, kids=[24926142], score=None, time=1603922937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921462, text='Previous article from the FBI director on this subject[1].<p>Basically &quot;Operation Fox Hunt&quot; is China saying to people overseas who say things China doesn&#x27;t like, &quot;Come to China to be jailed, or commit suicide.  If you don&#x27;t, your family will suffer in your place.&quot;<p>Threatening family members is very not-good.  China just doesn&#x27;t have the same kind of ethical system as Western nations, they hold the collective above the individual, and they expect everyone to know their place.  So it makes perfect sense from a Chinese perspective for criticizing the government to be regarded as especially despicable (you don&#x27;t know your place), and to hold one member of a family responsible for another&#x27;s conduct (the collective is above the individual).  But from a Western perspective, it&#x27;s a special kind of evil for a government to threaten its critics&#x27; innocent family members.<p>I hope these Chinese agents are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.<p>I hope Washington sends China a bill for the costs of investigating, prosecuting, and jailing their agents.  And if China refuses to pay, China has lots of US Treasury securities; interest and principal payments to those Treasuries could presumably be seized before leaving the US banking system.<p>I hope Justice Department lawyers are assigned to help victims file multi-million dollar civil cases against China for infliction of emotional distress.  Medical bills and disability compensation if injured; wrongful death if their relative was killed.<p>And while we&#x27;re billing China for the costs imposed by its actions, let&#x27;s throw in a lifetime security detail to protect the victims from future harrassment by China&#x27;s next batch of agents.<p>The only thing that surprises me is that they restrained themselves to mere stalking and verbal threats.<p>If the ethics of China&#x27;s decision makers are so twisted that threatening family members is okay, it seems like they&#x27;re pretty twisted, and only a little more twisting will get them to the point where they declare uncooperative targets ought to be receiving mailed packages of their loved ones&#x27; fingers and toes, escalating to eyeballs and other body parts that are increasingly unpleasant to lose.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-china-wray&#x2F;fbi-chief-says-china-threatens-families-to-coerce-overseas-critics-to-return-to-china-idUSKBN24825V" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-china-wray&#x2F;fbi-chief-...</a>')
