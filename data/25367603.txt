YouTube &quot;prominently surfaces authoritative information&quot; (i.e. promotes their corporate partners&#x27; content).<p>2. YouTube &quot;limits the reach of borderline content&quot; (i.e. suppresses content which does not violate its rules).<p>3. YouTube is trying to prevent third party content aggregators from linking to &quot;borderline&quot; content.<p>YouTube clearly has a preferred content source.  I still remember the days when videos from Fox News or CNN would have 500 views.  Those days are long gone now.  Can&#x27;t help but see them recommended on any political video.<p>All in all, a good day for some keen entrepreneurs.  People joined &quot;You&quot;Tube not &quot;Video&quot;Tube.  I hope this encourages disruption in the space.')
