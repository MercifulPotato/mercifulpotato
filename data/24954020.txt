If you need something to work at 100 degrees C but it will never get to 110C, you don&#x27;t buy a material that works at 110C, you find the cheapest material that works at 101C. (Factor of safety aside)<p>You can prove in math your design will work<p>In Programming, unless you are working at switch levels, how could you prove your code is most optimized?<p>It&#x27;s not going to be. Abstraction has removed the possibility of doing that.<p>The closest thing I&#x27;ve seen to Engineering in the Programming world is Industrial Engineering. This is the way Engineers optimize production environments. You can see this in Programming in various time&#x2F;load aspects. But industrial engineering is an &quot;After the fact&quot;, and as much as I like optimization, it has a reputation of not being Engineering.<p>Hope that makes sense. Science and math vs optimization.')
