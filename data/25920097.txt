So in terms of unique behavior, all that site isolation means is that you&#x27;re going to hit caches more often and be missing cookies.<p>I mean, sure, a website can recognize that you don&#x27;t have any unique cross-site cookies to send them and make some inferences based on that, but the alternative is... having a unique cross-site cookie. So it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re doing any better in that scenario.<p>I can see an argument against a few of these like DecentralEyes, since they change which resources you fetch at a more micro-level. But uBlock Origin and Multi Account Containers seem like strict privacy&#x2F;security improvements to me.<p>UBlock Origin especially -- if you care about privacy, you should have that installed, because outside of very specific scenarios your biggest threat model should be 3rd-party ad-networks, not serverside 1st-party timing attacks&#x2F;fingerprinting. No one should be running Chrome or Firefox without Ublock Origin installed.')
