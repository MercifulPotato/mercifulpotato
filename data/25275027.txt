This is likely another of those passion project that, might draw in some overzealous on-watchers, not really become anything usable in the end, but still be incredibly valuable for the greater ecosystem.<p>It points out how some things has gone unconsidered in the &quot;status quo&quot;, but rather then just rant about it, shows how it can be different.<p>It might put some lesser known code bases into the public eye.<p>It might iron out compatibility issues with e.g. the linux kernel and &quot;the good parts&quot; of POSIX&#x2F;unix-philosophy. Which is why I like Alpine and Voidlinux for being such complete systems, without hard dependencies on GNU-components (I think the GNU project, especially many of the individual code bases, are awesome as well).<p>And while there are benefits of both statically linked applications, an dynamic linking, I do find it for the best if that can be a realistic choice of the user, whatever program of library you want to use. And most big applications simplu can&#x27;t be totally statically linked as of now.<p>It&#x27;s a form of &quot;greenfield project&quot;, but still leveraging existing components.')
