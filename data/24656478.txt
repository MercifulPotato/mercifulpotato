The only issue I have is that 1) the power bricks aren&#x27;t cheap, small, and powerful enough and 2) charging things through my MBP doesn&#x27;t work well because the wattage (60) isn&#x27;t high enough. The external hard drive won&#x27;t work if my phone is plugged in as well.<p>GaN chargers are pretty cool. I found the Hyper Juice to be a shit product though. Still waiting for Anker to release some high watt chargers.')
