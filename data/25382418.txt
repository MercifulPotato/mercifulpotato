That&#x27;s a lot, but it&#x27;s in the range of the sort of power that a high-end electric car motor might draw now, and they somehow manage it with not-too-unreasonably-thick electric cabling.  Granted, there probably aren&#x27;t many electric cars designed to output 600 horsepower for ten minutes: eventually, the cables and the batteries will just get too hot.<p>I&#x27;m not an electrical engineer; I don&#x27;t know what the proper cable size is for this application with all the correct safety margins, but it doesn&#x27;t seem too terribly unreasonable as long as the voltages are pretty high and the battery can tolerate it.  If heat is a problem, then water cooled cables can help.')
