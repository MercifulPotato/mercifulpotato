This is not explicitly stated and it seems much of the discussion is based on different assumptions. Too soon to make good shows? Too soon for you? Too soon for Netflix? All of those likely lead to different answers.\nIt seems quite possible that optimizing for Netflix&#x27;s interests might leave some dissatisfied. But it is hard to call that cancelling too soon if it lets them get to their overall objectives.\nAn interesting question is if Netflix themselves in optimizing for the short term reward are penalizing themselves in the long term? That is much harder to know.')
