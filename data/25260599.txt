Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606780450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254493, text='Damn, Dave, did you spend all that sweet Netflix money already...? &#x2F;s<p>More seriously: artist screwed out of the money his art attracts - it must be a Monday!<p>A few years before Chappelle signed The Contract, Courtney Hole had already “done the math” in a famous piece [0]. She wasn’t even the first - Steve Albini had gone on record (eh) in 1993 [1]. There are many more examples from previous decades, both in music, cinema, TV, novels, comic books... these are just the first ones that spring to mind. The commonality being: established producers and distributors exist precisely to squeeze every once of value out of one’s art, and pay it the bare minimum they can get away with it. My bet is that Netflix will soon be like that too, there is no intrinsic reason they won’t (once they become as utterly dominant as tv networks were).<p>But I think (I hope) the real beef here is not about the money, but rather the name and characters. He cannot call anything “The Dave Chapelle’s Show” and he cannot touch those characters. He’s done plenty of work with his name on since then (“DC’s Bloc Party”, his comedy specials...), so maybe it’s just the characters he’s after? And what about “I’ll just take it”, is it a threat to reprise those characters and dare the network to sue him...?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;love_7&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;love_7&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebaffler.com&#x2F;salvos&#x2F;the-problem-with-music" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebaffler.com&#x2F;salvos&#x2F;the-problem-with-music</a>')
