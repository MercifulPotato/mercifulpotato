Because someone like me holds the opinion of non-experts as having zero value. I will not respect and do not want any policy being set by people with your attitude. I will continue to follow the science, and if I feel that people like you who ignore it are threatening my life, then I will do everything I can to stay far away from you and keep you far away from me.<p>I&#x27;d be totally for splitting society into those who respect science and experts, and those who don&#x27;t. I have no desire to live in your world.')
