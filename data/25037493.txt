If <i>you</i> are doing the mowing, cutting then i&#x27;d agree -- because it isnt a &quot;product&#x2F;platform&#x2F;marketplace business&quot; as much as a service, so you should earn the market rate of the service, less your independence discount.<p>If you are not doing the mowing, cutting but instead have a scalable business that could grow beyond the 24hrs you can work yourself, then you may not have made $1k in 6mo because you&#x27;re investing for growth.<p>Since the article is about MRR, i&#x27;m assuming they are talking about the second category, which is true MRR.')
