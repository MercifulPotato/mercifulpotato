We may prove some programs, but we can&#x27;t have a generic algorithm that does so.<p>And thus, if we have a program that represents an AI, we can&#x27;t prove that it is ok to use it or not.<p>However, the problem is not the AI itself, it&#x27;s the humans that feed problems to it to solve.<p>As the paper says, one example is &#x27;make the world a happy place&#x27;. This can lead an AI to destroy all humans. But the problem is actually the specification of the problem, which is insufficient.<p>Again, the problem is us humans, and not the AI.<p>The only problem with AI is when AI gets a physical body and needs to survive competing with the rest of us: if it is a super intelligence, it will thrive despite all the humans&#x27; effort to contain it.')
