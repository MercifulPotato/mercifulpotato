The spot I have in mind is above some knee-high shelves, so I’d probably only need to run the cable for half a meter before it vanishes behind them.  Hopefully it shouldn’t be too jarringly visible!  As I’m renting the apartment, I can’t really poke holes in the walls to hide cables (sadly).<p>Alternately, there are some other shelves of a more normal height that I could just set it on top of; the power cable would be much less visible that way.<p>But I do like the idea of having it on a wall.  As you say, the trick is going to be working out how to camouflage the cable.')
