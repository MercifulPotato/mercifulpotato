Not sure how accurate or up to date those notes are.<p>I would presume that corporate or bank bailouts would be separate bills that don&#x27;t exist right now.<p>I could be wrong about any of this but my point is, what you think is obvious, isn&#x27;t, so maybe we should be nice to one another.<p>&gt; You could even lobby your Congressperson to improve that aspects and remove flexibility from the executive.<p>Why say something like that? I mean, you know it isn&#x27;t true, and so does everybody else. Unless you think I, personally, am a huge bank? I&#x27;m genuinely curious why you think saying something like this helps. I mean, do you actually think a Congressman gives a shit about what a normal person says? They don&#x27;t. For every 1 of me, there would be 1,000 demented idiots writing to them (who they also don&#x27;t care about).')
