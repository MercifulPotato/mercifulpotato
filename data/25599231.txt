Things don’t happen that way. The Vietnam War heated up in 1965 and ended in 1975. Well, what’s that got to do with decades? No, that packaging of time is a journalistic convenience that they use to trivialize and to dismiss important events and important ideas. I defy that.<p>(And I say this having myself just told a family member that I&#x27;m sure people everywhere are happy for 2020 to be over.)')
