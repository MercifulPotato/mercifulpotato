The forgettable state school I went to now estimates a total cost of $20-30k&#x2F;year (inclusive of food, housing, transportation, etc - depending if the kids live with you or independently). 4 years, 6 kids on the low end would then be around $500k. Now, parents obviously arent obligated to pay for their children&#x27;s higher education, but if you were thinking about it, that&#x27;s half your money right there - at today&#x27;s prices.')
