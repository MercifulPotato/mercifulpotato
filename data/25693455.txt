No more of this on HN, please.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>Edit: your comment history is unfortunately replete with this kind of abuse. We already asked you to stop [1], and you&#x27;ve clearly been using HN primarily for political and ideological battle, which is another thing we ban accounts for [2], regardless of which ideology they&#x27;re battling for. So I&#x27;ve banned this account. If you don&#x27;t want to be banned, you&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com and give us reason to believe that you&#x27;ll follow the rules in the future.<p>Destroying the commons like this is profoundly not ok. It does no good and helps no one. Having this place descend into the hell realms is not in your interest either.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24538396" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24538396</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=primarily%20test%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=false&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=primarily%20test%20by:dang&amp;sor...</a>')
