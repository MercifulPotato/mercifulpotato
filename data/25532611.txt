Thanks so much for the pointer...the ability to traverse tons of data formats quickly to &quot;get a feel&quot; for them (much like simonw&#x27;s use case for some of the sqlite-utils) is exactly the tooling I need in cases like this, and the TUI interface is an awesome bonus. Will definitely be playing around with this over the next few days...thanks!')
