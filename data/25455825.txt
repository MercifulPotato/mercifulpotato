Like much of a UK media that shares its outlook, there&#x27;s been nigh on 6 months of articles looking for any sign that Sweden&#x27;s largely voluntary strategy will or has failed, as Spiked noted[0]â€¦ oh, 6 months ago in May, so it seems it&#x27;s been longer than 6 months.<p>For a far more balanced view of Sweden&#x27;s response, I recommend this article[1] in the Spectator. I suspect I&#x27;ll have to wait another 6 months until the sun is back out for another of its ilk.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiked-online.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;why-they-hate-sweden&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiked-online.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;why-they-hate-swede...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectator.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-myth-of-sweden" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectator.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-myth-of-sweden</a>')
