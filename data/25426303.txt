Should the people who &#x27;employed&#x27; the slaves be responsible, or should the people who enslaved and sold them also be considered at fault?<p>All those people are dead. The only entities left to sue are legal entities that aren&#x27;t natural persons.<p>&gt; If the second, then note a lot of slaves were initially captured and sold to white slavers by their own kind.<p>Then governments, corporations, etc. in Africa and Europe can be held to the same standard.')
