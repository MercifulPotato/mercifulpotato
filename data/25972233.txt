Anyhow, I tried running the linked installer for the native messenger and noticed that GVim now opens with “fileencoding” set to “latin1”. This resulted in conversion errors (I have “encoding” set to “utf8” in my “vimrc”) but I was able to get around that by running “:x ++enc=utf-8”.<p>I’m now able to quickly and easily open, close and re-edit text-boxes containing UTF-8 character. Thanks.')
