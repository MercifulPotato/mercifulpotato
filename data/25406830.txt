Lack of side effects, composition, currying etc and other functional benefits much more neatly line up with how functions are treated in maths.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s still a programming language, and is used much more for traditional engineering or compsci applications than something like Maple or Mathematica would be in Mathematics research, but nonetheless the main draw of Haskell is that it will feel like a home away from home for mathematicians and not because of 5 features noted in this article.')
