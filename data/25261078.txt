You contract with an organization to trade your time for money, which you can then trade for other stuff.  Most such employment contracts can be ended easily by either party if they don&#x27;t like it.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of my career working on problems of my own choice, both in someone else&#x27;s employment, with a co-founder, or on my own.  The limiting factor turned out not to be time or money: it was that the set of problems that are worth solving in today&#x27;s economy and can be solved by one person (or even a small team) is vanishingly small, and I just had a bigger impact when working with larger organizations.')
