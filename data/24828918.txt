Even if they serve the same purpose (kallax and eket for example), the price is a pretty good indicator of the durability of the furniture and your ability to disassemble and reassemble it down the line.<p>What I guess I&#x27;m trying to say is that it&#x27;s not IKEA problem, it&#x27;s budget lines of IKEA products problem. At the lower price range it&#x27;s hard to expect great durability.<p>A lot of wooden IKEA furniture sold in Europe is produced in Poland and there are many local knock-offs of IKEA products from other manufacturers. These are either cheaper and even less durable or more expensive but barely match IKEA&#x27;s ease of assembly and quality of the components. I really don&#x27;t think that durability is IKEA&#x27;s greatest problem. ;)')
