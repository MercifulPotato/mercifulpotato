It&#x27;s not about improving the country, it&#x27;s about making your mark during your 2-4 year tenure (in whatever position the politicians may find themselves). And because of the US&#x27; broken democratic system that moves towards and maintains a two-party system, it&#x27;s becoming an us-vs-them fight, with the sides entrenching themselves more and more.<p>A Dem win or a Republican win (wherever) will not improve things much, it&#x27;ll just flip flop things around for a little bit and the other side will be pissed off until they win again. It&#x27;s a downward spiral and I&#x27;m not seeing anything being done to break the cycle, it&#x27;s just damage control and short-term improvements.<p>Reboot the system, change the democratic system, allow for more varied representation, reduce the power of the president (and for fuck&#x27;s sake moderate their statements, Trump&#x27;s twitter diarrhea was an embarrassment to everyone), etc.')
