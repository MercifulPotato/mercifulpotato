And the story also have overall very odds treatment of justice and fairness. And characters are cartoons. And the only property of wife that matters is her look.<p>Which is why I did not cared about how it ends. The people in story are not real enough to reason about them. They don&#x27;t have psychology beyond crude stereotypes.<p>Like, ok, she grew with psychopathic dad, which the story author basically praises. She had likely accumulated trauma and resentment towards dad and own never met emotional needs. Is she even capable of strong emotiomal commitment? People with dads like that struggle in that area.<p>Maybe whole relationship was just her way to get revenge on dad by being involved in humiliating relationship for him. We really don&#x27;t know whether she will be jealous or not, given that she knew she wont marry this dude from day 1. Or she hinted nothing, or she had no idea and hinted only to unparalyze him.<p>But the story author does not consider such option, because she is not real character. She is just literary device. She is supposed to be motivated solely by dudes body beauty, but that is not real people think.')
