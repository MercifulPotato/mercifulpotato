I think I switched to something dynamic (textpattern) partly because back then I thought it mandatory that every month and day needed its own index if you just put in the month&#x2F;day in the URL and stuff like that. Seemed more elegant to do that dynamically than store redundant information.<p>(Textpattern was pretty great. Taught me about the weird google searches that lead people to your site.)')
