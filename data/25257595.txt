The protein datasets they used also mostly came out of various NIH-funded projects.<p>What I meant to focus on was that I think DeepMind has less of a pure money&#x2F;scale advantage in this area than in some others. In something like Go or Atari game-playing, there are many academic groups researching similar things, but their resources are laughably small compared to what DeepMind threw at it. So you might argue that they got good results there in part because they directed 1000x the personnel and compute at the problem compared to what any academic group could afford. In biomed though, their peers in academia and industry are also pretty well-funded.')
