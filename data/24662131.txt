I just want to write &amp; publish my posts somehow; used to use medium but then they added all these popups and annoying things, so I switched to Hugo. Now, it might be a good stepping stone to eventually just setting this all up myself, since I&#x27;ve been frustrated with the limitations of markdown &amp; hugo shortcodes and occasionally just want to write things in HTML (yes I know you can write HTML in hugo markdown pages). But I never would get to that stage straight from hosted blogs like medium, so it is good that static site generators exist I think.')
