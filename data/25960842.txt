Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611946311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960695, text='I very rarely see this style -- which comes from &quot;Setext&quot;, IIRC, which <i>might</i> be patient zero of the &quot;human readable plain text markup styles&quot; -- in the wild anymore, and I suspect it&#x27;s probably for the reasons you&#x27;re describing here. I almost never use it myself, except in contexts where the &quot;source file&quot; is just as likely to be read as a rendered HTML version. README files are a good example.<p>&gt; In some editors&#x2F;IDE, the underline even gets highlighted &#x2F; boldfaced, thereby exacerbating this effect.<p>I think a lot of editors just don&#x27;t <i>know</i> about this style of heading, but they do know that a line of three or more dashes is used to create a horizontal rule, so they&#x27;re trying to highlight that.')
