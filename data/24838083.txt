And I think there’s empirical data to back me up.<p>We can pick one politician, and look them up on Politifact.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;personalities&#x2F;joe-biden&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;personalities&#x2F;joe-biden&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;personalities&#x2F;donald-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;personalities&#x2F;donald-trump&#x2F;</a><p>Do you really believe Fox News does a better job of fact-checking? Or your media organization of choice.<p>Politifact is solid. Pro Publica is solid.<p>Attempting to reduce it to “all are equally bad, or so bad it doesn’t matter” is disingenuous and actually furthers attempts to deceive the public by undermining sources which are actually trustworthy.<p>Distrust everyone, and you’ll believe anyone.<p>Of course this doesn’t mean you get to turn off your thinking cap - we always have to exercise our own judgement, even when reading information from sources we believe to be trustworthy.<p>If you genuinely believe what you are saying then I encourage you to broaden your sources. For example, ‘Ghost Wars’, which won a Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and has been broadly acclaimed, covers the CIA and all the stuff it did &#x2F; has been doing in Afghanistan since 9&#x2F;11.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghost_Wars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghost_Wars</a><p>There are plenty of good books on domestic politics too. Books will help broaden your perspective and better evaluate these journalism or media organizations we are talking about.<p>If you’re not engaging in this discussion with good intention, and your goal is to deceive and generally undermine people’s confidence in reputable sources of information because you believe it furthers your own political beliefs, well, then you should feel ashamed of yourself.<p>I’m being honest - I don’t know which one is the case.<p>What you say, however, is demonstrably untrue and a falsehood.')
