I suspect a primary need for a cloud service is to just handle authentication with music services.<p>In theory you could do it entirely locally, but then you would run into super weird and dangerous (from a security perspective) situation where the redirect leg of the oAuth would need to point to a local IP address or similar.<p>I imagine it is possible to work around these issues, but it would be a huge faff, and would be very hard to make it as slick as a cloud based system.<p>Ultimately most consumers just donâ€™t mind signing up for things. So why make your engineering 50% more complicated for a tiny minority of your target market.')
