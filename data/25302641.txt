The best way I&#x27;ve heard it phrased is that we are not working from home.  Rather, we are at home during a crisis, trying to work.  Yes, it is month 9 of a crisis, but still a crisis, and it is reasonable for performance expectations to be lower as a result.<p>For me, my apartment wasn&#x27;t chosen with the expectation of being a space to work from home.  My computer desk is in the corner of the living room, because I like being able to talk with my wife while playing video games.  When covid hit, that also became my work desk, as there isn&#x27;t a good place elsewhere to move it.  The space simply wasn&#x27;t intended to be a dedicated work area, and I know that I get distracted whenever my cats wail at me for attention.  (I imagine that kids are even more needing of attention, though I don&#x27;t have personal experimental evidence to back that up.)<p>And that&#x27;s okay.  That&#x27;s human.  It&#x27;s okay to re-evaluate expectations in light of a crisis, and know that there will be distractions throughout the day as a result.')
