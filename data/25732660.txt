Do not trust Google to vet the apps in the play store. They won&#x27;t; they don&#x27;t even try.<p>2. Those shiny Play Protect and whatnot postured around by Google are practically utter useless bs&#x2F;bloat<p>3. Stick to famous, really famous apps from the Play Store - as in well known - e.g. Facebook, Netflix, Evernote etc (you will be tracked of course, you won&#x27;t be hacked - you pay this price by using Googled Android anyway)<p>4. If you couldn&#x27;t find a well known app on Play Store - head to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.f-droid.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.f-droid.org</a><p>5. Do not, just do  not download any other app on your phone (treat it as a no exception rule) unless you know what you are doing and possibly can look at the code - find something decent as an APK from GitHub et al.<p>6. Be very miserly when it comes to doling out permissions to apps. Your default should be &quot;no&quot;.<p>7. Privacy (not really) and safety are just superficial polish by Google on Android OS - their core and only focus developing the OS is: making it as much of an ad platform as they can and on top of that how to get a bigger and bigger cut of the overall ad revenue with every release.')
