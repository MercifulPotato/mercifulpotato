I hear the “but Google is just better” argument a lot and sure they are. Google search is better because they pay other companies to hamstring Google’s competitors. That’s the whole point of this anti-trust investigation. Google has made themselves the best not necessarily by actually being the best, but by paying other companies to hold Google’s competitors down. They pay to make sure their competitors are worse, not that they are better.<p>You and me, as consumers, shouldn’t be forced to use a worse product just to try to balance the market, because we can’t compete with Google either. That’s the point of anti-trust regulations.')
