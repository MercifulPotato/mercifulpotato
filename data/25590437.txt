I&#x27;ve heard about the benifits to consumer prices sure, and that a certain amount of manufacturing has returned due to robotization, but even if that is factored in I&#x27;m a bit confused as to how this claim is even close to reality.<p>1. CA assumes particpating consumers and businesses have knowledge of location of lowest cost, which isn&#x27;t always true.<p>2. CA ignores transport costs which can easily offset the raw CA numbers.<p>3. CA fails to factor in lack of or monopoly on economies of scale.<p>4. CA also fails to factor in rates of inflation, subsidies, lack of or high import controls etc.<p>5. It fails to take into account non-price factors such as brand loyalty, item quality, etc.<p>6. Exchange rates can undermine raw CA numbers.<p>7. CA ignores IP legal issues mostly surrounding R&amp;D investment.<p>8. CA still fails to take into account second and third teir effects needed to institute CA. So as I referenced before, Guatemala as an example, had to have a coup performed against it first, with massive amounts of suffering and theft from people to pave a way for the &quot;free-trade&quot; state needed for CA to come into effect. That loss of life and wealth as a prereq isn&#x27;t factored in.')
