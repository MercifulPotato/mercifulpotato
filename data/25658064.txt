This core is similar in performance to the dual-issue in-order Cortex-M7- also 2 DMIPS &#x2F; MHz.  I guess I view this core as a technology demonstration that you can have a practical (not too large, not too low MHz) out of order processor in an FPGA.<p>On the other hand, I think there is still space for a small in-order dual-issue FPGA RISC-V with 2 DMIPS &#x2F; MHz performance.<p>Actually there is one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencores.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;biriscv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencores.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;biriscv</a><p>1.9 DMIPS &#x2F; MHz..')
