Perhaps you can solve a mystery phone hiccup that happened to me a few years ago? I called a friend (mobile to mobile if it matters) and, from memory, about 20 minutes into this call I get disconnected, _but_ I instantly end up on a call with an elderly stranger instead, who seemed pretty irritated she was now on the phone with me. I was surprised enough that she hung up before I could form a coherent sentence to explain what had happened so I&#x27;ve no idea if she was trying to ring someone or if the same thing happened to her or if she&#x27;d dialed my number by accident. From what I remember it seemed like she was also already mid-conversation as well though.')
