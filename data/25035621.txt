The rep was pushing iCloud under threat of losing their data. It seemed like such a scam. I can only imagine what it feels like to be tech-illiterate and told you must buy a subscription or we&#x27;ll wipe your family photos.<p>A &#x27;premium&#x27; phone like an iPhone should really have a free backup for at least the data size of the phone.
