It&#x27;s not correct to suggest that incentives, prices &amp; economic principles capture sufficient information to give us rational cause to bestow absolute faith in them.<p>&gt;&gt; the general principal holds that make something more expensive people consume less of it<p>Again it&#x27;s not an absolute, there comes a point where it no longer holds. E.g. if you price water, consumption surely drops until the point where there&#x27;s only essential usage. Increase price all you want then because instead society will break, as in people will circumvent laws or agreed methods of exchange.<p>&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the alternative?<p>That we&#x27;re more cautious about calling out the parts we&#x27;re uncertain about.')
