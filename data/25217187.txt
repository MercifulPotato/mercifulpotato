And if they did respond too specifically presumably the times would shift their allegations to different specifics in any case, making a general response the only durable one.<p>Interestingly, other commenters here characterized Coinbases&#x27; message with language such as &quot;incredibly thorough prebuttal&quot; and suggested that this indicated that the story was devastating.  You seem to be arguing the opposite, that it is perfectly generic and is thus indicative of a traditional cover-up approach.  From this it seems to me that regardless of what approach they took it would be characterized as evidence against them.')
