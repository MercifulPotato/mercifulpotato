In the US, it&#x27;s generally <i>not</i> just a matter of where you sleep at night or where you keep stuff; the legal definition of &quot;residence&quot; is a matter of intent, where you <i>intend</i> your permanent place of residence to be. Of course there needs to be objective evidence of your intent: you can&#x27;t just say &quot;I live in Texas&quot; if you own a home in California which you aren&#x27;t renting to anyone else, but don&#x27;t own any real estate in Texas. But it looks like Musk is selling all his California property. Even if he doesn&#x27;t buy a home in Texas, if he has a permanent rental of one there, but only rents places in California temporarily when he travels there for business, legally his residence would indeed be in Texas.')
