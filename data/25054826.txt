There are optimal levels.<p>And there are levels that cause toxicity.<p>&gt; Supplements can help with that.<p>[citation needed] which is kind of the point of this article.<p>&gt; ...and easier and cheaper than a diet which includes all necessities. Low levels are suboptimal for you. Makes sense?<p>Unless your diet already has you covered, in which case it&#x27;s strictly harder and more expensive.<p>Again, you should look for evidence of improvement, that&#x27;s what the scientific process is all about. I encourage you to embrace the scientific process and take a data driven approach to whether ingesting something is going to help, harm, or have no impact on you at all, instead of just listening to your mom. My mom is a saint, but she&#x27;s not right about everything.<p>Worse yet, because multivitamins like all nutritional supplements are not regulated by the FDA, they can range from totally ineffective to half decent, but you have no way of really knowing. The most common magnesium supplement I&#x27;ve found on Amazon is only 19% bioavailable [1] as compared to a best-in-class 90%. Where does your multivitamin rank? That&#x27;s just one specific example.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6683096&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6683096&#x2F;</a>')
