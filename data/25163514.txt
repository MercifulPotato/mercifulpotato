You don&#x27;t hear from the many that don&#x27;t proselytise.<p>&gt; even something like atheism is a religion<p>That&#x27;s nonsense, a rhetorical subterfuge to defend religion (&quot;oh, but you too have a religion.&quot;) maybe. Atheism has none of the things you claim (origin story and eschatology, prescriptions on how to live). Some (atheistic) sciences indeed give us the former two, and some (atheistic) Weltanschauungen (such as humanism) the latter, but that doesn&#x27;t bestow religious status on atheism itself.')
