Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[24946007], score=None, time=1604072742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24941921, text='&gt; &gt; Yes, you are speculating that pindab0ter would think the enforcement action was related to the CoC<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not what I said.<p>Yes it is, you literally just said &quot;I think pindab0ter would agree that it was improper enforcement of the CoC&quot;. See, you said &quot;enforcement of the CoC&quot;. As in, CoC was the thing that was being enforced. Now you&#x27;re trying to claim that &quot;enforcement&quot; was not related to &quot;the CoC&quot; in that sentence? Wow.<p>If you took a random person off the street, showed them that sentence, and then asked &quot;what was being enforced&quot;, any English speaking person would be able to identify &quot;CoC&quot; as the thing that was being enforced (albeit it was enforced improperly). So clearly, in that sentence, the enforcement action was in some way related to the CoC. I don&#x27;t know what kind of mental gymnastics you&#x27;re trying to pull by claiming that the sentence means something else.<p>&gt; You seem to be focused on detailed differences in meaning but missing the thrust of these arguments. You claimed Scotsman fallacy to a perceived specific meaning of the sentence, but it didn&#x27;t fit in context. In general you seem to be not aware of the contextual meaning of what anybody has said here.<p>Look, I was trying to be nice earlier when I said that you and I interpret pindab0ter&#x27;s words in a different way, and that we should leave it at that. I don&#x27;t actually think your interpretation is plausible. I think it&#x27;s obvious to anyone who read the original comments in context, that pindab0ter didn&#x27;t consider OP to be an example of &quot;weaponizing a CoC&quot;. You can play word games all day long and talk down in a condescending tone, but I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re hoping to achieve with that.')
