Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25073908], score=None, time=1605209004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25072902, text='&gt; I just posted a link to latest Trump tweet, and got flagged.<p>The tweet you was about an item of political controversy excessively well-covered in the mainstream media (making it generally off-topic <i>even as an independent story</i> for HN), and was not at all germane to the post about Benford&#x27;s law that it was offered as a comment on (making it off-topic as a comment on that post.)<p>There are venues in which linking that tweet might be appropriate, one can even imagine a hypothetical HN comment thread on which it might be on-topic. However, it wasn&#x27;t on-topic where it was offered.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t understand why simply reporting something as relevant as what Trump tweeted is reason enough to get flagged. when its directly relevant to this article<p>Trump&#x27;s tweets -- well, this Trump tweet, I suppose its theoretically possibly he might sometime tweet something where this would not be true -- are completely irrelevant to the utility of Benford&#x27;s law in detecting voting fraud.<p>&gt; and what your president tweeted is news worthy<p>Conventional newsworthiness (because we have a conventional newsmedia) is generally tangential and often a negative to HN-relevance.<p>&gt; When your president retweets that 2.7 million votes where deleted during this election by dominion software.<p>Were this a thread about Dominion software, or about the general incidence of electoral fraud, or about <i>this particular election at all</i>, there might be an argument that that was relevant. Its not, and its not.<p>&gt; I made no claims of its validity<p>Even if the tweet were otherwise <i>relevant</i>, its validity, <i>whether or not you make an explicit representation about it</i>, is not irrelevant to the question of whether it should be upvoted, downvoted, flagged, or simply left unmoderated when presented here.')
