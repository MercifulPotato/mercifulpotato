I suspect a need for that will drop in the community once GATs land so it’ll be interesting to see how the nightly usage changes.<p>I’m also curious if the % using nightly number is getting skewed by the population growth of Rust itself rather than language feature changes itself (assuming the study is actually sensitive enough to confidently state a 2% change is outside of the error margin).')
