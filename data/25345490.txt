He&#x27;s the Donald Trump of the classical music world - trying desperately to be considered one of the &quot;big ones,&quot; while piling on incessantly with new &quot;works&quot; that rehash the same tired minimalist tropes, which have all been explored by far more competent composers such as Berio, Feldman, Riley, and Reich.<p>I am not surprised to read these glowing reviews of the man on HN, though, as Glass always does get the royal treatment outside of the music world. He makes the kind of soulless dreck that would be suitable for writing code without getting distracted by any chance of meaning or beauty.')
