It isn&#x27;t negative, exactly, at least not yet, but a lot of informal discussions between teams that used to occur in the hallway, break room, or wherever, just doesn&#x27;t happen spontaneously when we are all remote.  So it goes through more traditional channels, which makes it more formal and more political in many cases.')
