This is bad for obvious reasons. It would be neat if there was another browser not effectively run by Google. Being open-source is nice, but who writes the commits? Who controls the direction? Mostly Googlers. Sure, others contribute, but the project is obviously steered by Google. Having most of the user experience&#x2F;stack of the Web controlled by one company is called a monoculture and it isn&#x27;t good.')
