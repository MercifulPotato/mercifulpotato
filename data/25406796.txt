Item(by='pavlov', descendants=None, kids=[25406844], score=None, time=1607870047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406633, text='<i>&gt; “... one common word which does seem to have been invented by the software industry: &quot;access&quot; as a verb”</i><p>Really? That’s surprising because the French and Spanish equivalent verb (accéder &#x2F; acceder) is common and has multiple meanings such as “reaching a peak”. I would have imagined this word transferred over in the Norman days.')
