We may be tired of COVID, but COVID is not tired of us.<p>Even when the death rates are super scary, people still don&#x27;t follow common sense measures. Remember the so-called lockdowns in the USA? Everyone was still out horsing around, getting together, buying their khakis, eating at whatever restaurants they could find that were open. There was no enforcement, so nobody followed the rules. What a surprise!<p>Even now, where the disease is arguably worse than it&#x27;s ever been, local governments are talking about opening up schools and other indoor super-spreader businesses like bars and night clubs. In most places, churches, with their saliva-fest indoor singing and chanting, are fully open. Nobody is taking sane measures at the arguable height of the pandemic!<p>If we learned anything from this pandemic, we learned that we can&#x27;t rely on people voluntarily acting collectively to make things better for everyone.')
