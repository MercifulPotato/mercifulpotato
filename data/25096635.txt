Koreans basically eat something spicy every meal in the form of kimchi, and sometimes eat extremely spicy meals. I&#x27;ve heard that basically all Koreans have at least mild stomach inflammation because of this. Koreans also eat quite a lot of meat, using the spiciness of kimchi to clean their palate. I wonder if the health effects can be seen in the Korean population, or if the probiotics in the kimchi will confound the results.')
