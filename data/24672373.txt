Most people treat them as binary: either something is nice, and gets 5, or is crap, and gets 1. The neutral score for things that are OK tends to be 5, sometimes 4.<p>This is particularly pronounced whenever there are any consequences attached to the ratings. If you give anything but 5 to your Uber driver, you&#x27;re risking them losing their job. If you give anything but 5 on an e-commerce platform, the seller may lose a lot of money. 5 being the &quot;neutral&quot; score became normalized.')
