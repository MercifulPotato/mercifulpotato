And in many cases an urgent care clinic can tell you what simple procedures will cost. There are imaging services companies that can tell you upfront how much diagnostic tests are going to cost as well.<p>A broken tooth is a much less complex injury than a broken arm. In many cases you don&#x27;t even need to be a dentist to diagnose it. Try walking into a dentist office with a more complex injury that could involve multiple different dental specialties and severe underlying complications. You aren&#x27;t going to get an immediate upfront price.')
