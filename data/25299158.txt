They are comparable.<p>Importantly, you&#x27;re comparing the M1 in a Mac Mini, to the 4800U in a laptop. Comparing the M1 in the Air, for example, the 4800U is quite a bit faster in multicore and the single core performance advantage shrinks.<p>As for 2 and 3, you&#x27;re comparing to AMD, not to Intel. AMD CPUs have significantly better power efficiency than Intel.<p>If you want to compare battery life without taking into account software, compare power consumption. The Zen chip uses slightly more power than the M1 on a laptop.')
