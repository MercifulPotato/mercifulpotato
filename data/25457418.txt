I hesitate to call it a two stroke because that isn&#x27;t strictly true, apparently.  However, it has a narrow power band, like a conventional two stroke.  This means that it&#x27;s a poor engine outside its power band; excessive emissions, inefficient, etc.  Inside its power band it can be tuned to be clean and efficient.<p>So using it for constant RPM applications such as a generator can make sense.  Using it as the prime mover where a wide power band is needed is a bad choice.')
