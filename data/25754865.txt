The voters were told that the winning party&#x27;s candidate would be the commission president.<p>Now von der Leyen is. She did not run in the election.<p>This is a lot more similar to the electoral college making the losing candidate president than people want to admit.<p>We elected the parliament under the impression that the MEPs would then elect the candidate of the party that got the most votes. Then, they didn&#x27;t.<p>The EU is not very democratic and if we don&#x27;t fix that, we will lose it. And that is the last thing I want. I want the EU to succeed.')
