Most observations are easily explained by existing theory. If you are proposing something new, you need evidence and time to upend the consensus.<p>Flat Earth, rain spirits etc all were disproven because, eventually, the most plausible explanation of phenomena matched evidence to the contrary rather than what existed.<p>Scientists don&#x27;t ignore flat earth, they weight it&#x27;s evidence just the same as a globe earth. The reason that the globe earth is accepted as the consensus truth, is that it has the overwhelming evidence of its veracity, an argument for the globe collected over a long period of time.')
