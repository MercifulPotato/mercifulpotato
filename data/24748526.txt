High capital costs are no barrier to private financing as long as the eventual profits will accrue to the investors.<p>What about the risk premiums for disasters. Isn&#x27;t it only economical if states accept the cost? If we wouldn&#x27;t accept an owner of a nuclear power plant to go bankrupt before cleaning up ,after a Fukushima scale accident they&#x27;d be forced to either have an insurance that made it uneconomical, or deposit many times more than the reactor costs up front, for cleanup. Neither is viable. It&#x27;s always subsidized.')
