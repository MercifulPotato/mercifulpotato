They require too much attention and persistence to deliver on privacy, and even then they are limited in their effectiveness.<p>Decent article, but a bit light on easy-to-use, practical details. They seem to make the case that ad-blockers are ineffective and too much of a hassle, but that&#x27;s not my experience at all. I agree that tracking and privacy is a cat-and-mouse game, but I think ad-blocking currently is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block trackers. I installed uBlock Origin on my family&#x27;s computers a couple of years back, and it has Just Workedâ„¢.<p>The next logical step would probably be PiHole or NextDNS for deeper blocking than some browser ad-blockers, as well as for blocking outside of a browser. I have DoT set up on my router and most off my portable devices, and there haven&#x27;t been any hiccups yet.<p>All bets are off once tracking is implemented server-side though. The way GDPR currently has been enforced has led to a lot of bad practices by the tech industry, so we&#x27;ll probably need new laws that regulate data gathering.')
