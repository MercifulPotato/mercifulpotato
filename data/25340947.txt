Item(by='anoncoward14916', descendants=None, kids=[25342544], score=None, time=1607394674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338325, text='Not many folk have enough data to make a fair judgement on what took place here, although plenty have already felt comfortable to do so.<p>It seems not to be in dispute that Timnit offered an ultimatum with a series of demands that needed to be met for her not to resign. It seems not to be in dispute that Google decided that it wasn&#x27;t in the business&#x27; interest for this paper to be published (for whatever reason). The rest is either cloudy (why did Google choose to part ways with her) or moot (was her ultimatum technically a resignation or not).<p>Some folk clearly fall into the category of #BelieveBlackWomen, which seems to be a surprisingly non-curious attitude to take. (Does being black or female automatically make an account more credible? Don&#x27;t both sides have plenty to gain by putting a positive spin on their version of events?)<p>A plausible alternate explanation of events is that Timnit had become a liability to Google. We have to speculate a little here, but we do know that she got into a very public spat with Facebook&#x27;s Chief AI Scientist, leading to him quitting Twitter; that she sent a broad mail to ERG groups that undermined the leadership&#x27;s messaging and goals around diversity; and that she admits she &quot;hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google&quot;. It&#x27;s quite possible that her ultimatum was the final straw for Google leadership, both because capitulating would set a precedent for others to hold the company ransom, and because her employment had become a net negative.<p>But we don&#x27;t know. Google is unlikely to share its side of events for  reasons of liability. In general, company executives have more at stake from a bald-faced lie, but it&#x27;s not possible to be sure. So it we&#x27;re left with the choice of &quot;believe her unequivocally&quot; or &quot;reserve judgement&quot;.<p>Those who fall into the latter category are far less likely to speak out. I&#x27;m a Googler, but it&#x27;s ironic that it feels career-limiting to not vocally dissent from the petition, such that I&#x27;m using an anonymized account for the first time. But I suspect there is a silent but significant constituency at Google who are skeptical of her claims, as well as many others who would love nothing more than for less political activism in the workplace.')
