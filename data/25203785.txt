Item(by='alexyakunin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606257176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203784, text='For anyone interested in real-time Blazor apps - I&#x27;ve just published the most &quot;advanced&quot; Fusion sample live: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusion-samples.servicetitan.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusion-samples.servicetitan.com&#x2F;</a><p>What&#x27;s interesting there:<p>- It&#x27;s a Blazor app that supports _both_ WASM and Blazor Server modes\n- Authentication sample shows GitHub auth with real-time session tracking. Try signing in there from multiple browser windows and from different browsers - you&#x27;ll be surprised.\n- Server Screen page delivers an image stream of ~ 10-20fps &#x2F; 10 Mbps even on mobile. It&#x27;s not a real server-screen, of course - the sample is hosted on k8s cluster. Though the pics it sends are generated in real time. It delivers a screencast if you run it on Windows machine.\n- Chat is just nice to play with, esp. with multiple windows open. It persists everything to a local Sqlite DB, so its state doesn&#x27;t survive deployments.\n- And Composition is probably the most interesting part there: it shows how Fusion automatically tracks changes made in completely different parts of this app (Chat, Authentication, Consistency, etc.) and combines them into a single state that&#x27;s also updated in real time.<p>P.S. The cluster is tiny (1 core), so please don&#x27;t turn it into a challenge to crush it - especially via &quot;Server Screen&quot; page, which was made mostly to show what&#x27;s possible, though was never designed to serve even a hundred of concurrent users on a small machine.')
