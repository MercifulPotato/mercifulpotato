Hope some company is generous in hiring said OSS developer and paying them a salary to continue working on that OSS work (ideally without too much pressure to modify it for that one company&#x27;s use case).<p>2. Make that developer spend a lot of time doing marketing to generate donations&#x2F;sponsorships to a level where the developer can pay for things like food, shelter, and insurance.')
