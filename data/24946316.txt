And those visuals are still quite simplistic as I haven&#x27;t implemented yet all the ideas to visualize tiny wavelets present in any realistic sound.<p>A few possible next steps I had in mind:<p>(1) Turning those ACFs into actual shapes, not just colored rings assembled together, so say an accord on piano would create a sophisticated 2d or 3d shape with elaborate structure. Perhaps, just mixing the flat ACFs with an exp decay would achieve the result.<p>(2) Visualizing the ACF heights map as a water surface with a raytracer. This sounds nonsense until you see a few real (physical) examples: &quot;cymaglyphs&quot;. Those are reflections and refractions on the rippled water surface that&#x27;s assuming shapes of the so-called Faraday waves (a parametrically driven wave equation, see &quot;Numerical simulation of Faraday waves&quot; by L. Tuckerman on arxiv). However this requires solving a complex diff equation + an extremely high quality raytracer, as otherwise you&#x27;d get blurry pixelated images. None of the existing raytracers would work here.<p>As for compatibility with other browsers, it works on desktop Chrome and Firefox, but not on their mobile versions. I haven&#x27;t figured out yet why. Must be something to do with GPU differences. Safari is a whole another story. The visualizer uses WebAudio + WebGLv2, and Safari isn&#x27;t known for supporting the bleeding edge standards. While you could do everything without GPU, it would crawl at 0.03 fps and you wouldn&#x27;t be hear and see sound in real time.')
