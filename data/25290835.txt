Couple of questions:<p>- Does re-balancing create a taxable event? If so, given a bunch of these cryptos trade in BTC pairs, do you generate all the documents necessary to file taxes?<p>- What do you feel about the top 10 currencies changing so rapidly over time? I think every month (or maybe two) the top 10 list significantly changes. Doesn&#x27;t that accumulate a lot of trading activity and fees? Given the volatility, is there any point to holding the top 10 instead of just holding solid &#x2F; consistent cryptos like BTC and ETH?')
