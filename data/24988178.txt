Item(by='mrtksn', descendants=None, kids=[24994951, 24988258], score=None, time=1604490199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987197, text='It&#x27;s all good but:<p>1) The pricing is listed as per invocation however it is also billed for the CPU seconds and It happens that on a low volume function usage I exceed the free quota exactly on that as the invocation numbers remain very low.<p>2) The functions take about 10s-15s to execute on cold start. Every execution that happens between something like a minute is a cold execution. It is also billed as 15s execution even if the actual script runs for 200ms.<p>3) The CPU second are calculated according to time and VM memory, so if your function happens to make a call to another API and sits idle for 5s for response to arrive, you are still billed as 5s full memory usage.<p>Which makes me wonder why I would&#x27;t spin a DO droplet instead. Maybe it&#x27;s good on very high volume but from experience I know that a 5$ NodeJS droplet can handle hundreds of concurrent request.  That would probably cost a lot on Google Cloud Functions. On low volume DO droplet performs much better anyway.')
