If your web&#x2F;app&#x2F;whatever has legitimate reason why it needs the data, GDPR is fine with that. For example it&#x27;s perfectly OK for a dating app to collect information about person&#x27;s eye color and height or for medical app to have access to your heath-related information, even though it could be used (with other data) to identify specific individual.')
