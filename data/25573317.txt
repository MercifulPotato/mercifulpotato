The subsidies <i></i><i>increase</i><i></i> the cost of sugar (HFCS, cane, beet, etc.).  We are subsidizing farmers by increasing the cost to consumers.<p>If we let the market decide the price, it would only <i></i><i>lower</i><i></i> the cost of sugar.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any evidence that HFCS is appreciably worse than sucrose.  The problem is added sugar of any type.')
