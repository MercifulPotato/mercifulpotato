However, this results in the inability to reset your password- if you go to MEGA and try resetting your password (and have no other authenticated instances) you&#x27;ll lose all your data.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t using a PAKE remove the ability to encrypt data with a password, because it is never being sent over cleartext? Also, wouldn&#x27;t that mean you could no longer be sure that your data wasn&#x27;t being viewed by the service?')
