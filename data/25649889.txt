Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609875127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649486, text='&gt; It&#x27;s clearly _not_ hypocrisy by any normal definition of the word.<p>Okay sure if you define their goals for EVs simply as decreasing _local_ pollution, then you&#x27;re right it&#x27;s not hypocritical. Though in that case I would instead refer to it as extremely selfish, since they are using the proceeds from their exportation of pollution to decrease their own local pollution. Honestly I&#x27;m not really sure which perspective I find worse.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a continuous debate...<p>Given you clearly don&#x27;t strongly agree with what you wrote, I won&#x27;t attack you on it. I&#x27;ll simply point out that those arguments are really no different than all the other self-serving arguments people use to post facto rationalize their actions. If them ridiculous. They remind me of the arguments I sometimes hear from fellow Swedes saying that Sweden&#x27;s large profits from arms exports aren&#x27;t bad since they&#x27;d be sold by someone else anyway. Convenient how easily such reasoning can be used to ignore one&#x27;s culpability.<p>&gt; I mean if you think it&#x27;s hypocrisy you&#x27;re free to do so, but it&#x27;s not very productive. What action should Norway take to reduce the worlds CO2 emissions more than they are? The Norwegian green party wants to cut all oil&#x2F;gas production by 2035. Is that enough, or should they have cut everything already?<p>If this is a serious question, then I&#x27;ll answer it. They should stop being hypocrites. That is they should either stop their exports immediately or they should come to terms with the fact that they are making the world a worse place. You might want to get rid of Solberg as a first step:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sverigesradio.se&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;7335804" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sverigesradio.se&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;7335804</a><p>&quot;Norge är ett av världens rikaste länder, mycket tack vare sin olja. Men man tar inget klimatansvar för den olja som exporteras.<p>Det säger Norges statsminister Erna Solberg i Ekots lördagsintervju idag. Enligt henne är det den som köper oljan som har ansvaret för utsläppen. Och då menar hon bland annat Sverige.&quot;<p>Total bullshit. I mean I agree that Swedes need to take responsibility for their actions (Sweden is probably just as full of hypocrites as Norway), but Norway is selling their oil knowing very well the result. Of course they are responsible. They are selling it because they want money. There&#x27;s nothing noble about it.')
