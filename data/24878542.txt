In order to supplant C&#x2F;C++, Rust (and Rust programmers) will need to operate in harmony with the existing ecosystem for decades.<p>This interoperability means that Rust programmers will need to also be good C&#x2F;C++ programmers. Its not a binary OR, its more like diffusion.<p>Just as an example, the primary (or earliest) use of Rust is in Firefox. But Firefox is still a C++ project.')
