What ads you see will be aligned with their interests, not yours; e.g. if you&#x27;re a &quot;high earner&quot;, you might see ads for more expensive products and no cheap alternatives. If you&#x27;re &quot;expecting a child&quot;, the ads might scare you into buying more child safety products than you need; etc.')
