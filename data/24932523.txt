History has proven (With a few caveats i&#x27;m sure) that real change happens with force. Has America lost it&#x27;s ability to rebel against tyranny?<p>America was built where small pox had a much higher death % - Were they forced to wear masks and stay inside? People die, it&#x27;s a fact of life. Now we the people are forced to deal with the economic backlash that any idiot could have told you was going to happen. The media blocked any &#x27;misinformation that relates to corona virus&#x27; and labeled them &#x27;Anti-maskers&#x27;.<p>Alot more people are going to die than the corona virus could have ever killed. The amount of mental health problems exacerbated, jobs lost, lives ruined is immesurable, but the one KPI we can all rely on is total number of coronavirus infected. It&#x27;s a joke and we haven&#x27;t even gotten to the fun part yet where we have a 34% debt surety rate based on the two massive stimulus&#x27; that are going to be passed.<p>America was built on free-press and if say some entity tried to bury a story, it&#x27;d result in people dying, publisher being burned, or boycotted.')
