If you put the sand in first (aka the little things) there is no room for the rocks (aka big things).<p>My take away from the above is that neither way is right, wrong or &quot;The Way&quot; but that there are different methods for each person, team, profession, company etc. Simple example: infosec and IP rules may not even let you have one digital application that you can access at all times for both corporate and personal tasks. YOU might not even want your personal tasks co-mingled with work tasks for privacy reasons.')
