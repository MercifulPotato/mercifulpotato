But it was more accessible to people unfortunately. I spent some time trying to become a Gentoo developer for a while and then just gave up because there was no response.<p>I used to updated the clang patches to make newer clang versions compile things on osx before most of those things made it upstream.<p>I think it&#x27;s vastly superior to macports and while I find nix interesting I don&#x27;t really find it that practical. I think what makes homebrew more popular than the rest is how many precompiled packages exist. If gentoo-prefix had the same amount of precompiled packages, then I&#x27;d think it would definitely be much better for most users.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gentoo.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project:Prefix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gentoo.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project:Prefix</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fishman&#x2F;timebomb-gentoo-osx-overlay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fishman&#x2F;timebomb-gentoo-osx-overlay</a>')
