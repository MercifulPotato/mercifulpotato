So about 3.5 moon diameters apart right now.<p>Estimating angles in the sky is very difficult.  It&#x27;s also subject to perception illusions, like the &quot;Horizon Effect&quot; in which the Sun and Moon appear larger that their 0.5° diameter when, in fact, there&#x27;s no difference.<p>Some say this effect explains why your penis looks small when you gaze down at it.  It&#x27;s hard to judge, sometimes.')
