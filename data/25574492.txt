If you are film shooter and want small camera Rollei 35 is the tool.  Of all the cameras that I own, I use Leica M3 and Leica M240 exclusively. Its ultimate photography experience and yes, the lenses are sublime and filled with artistic rendering. Mobile phones are devices with goal to replace all the devices, in reality they are good companion, device for quick capture of ideas.')
