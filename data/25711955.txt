I mean, not everyone has to enjoy a language. On the other hand, there&#x27;s a difference between voicing an opinion, which is personal, and making claims like:<p>&gt; Haskell is a pain in the ass to program in. It&#x27;s a language developed for mathematicians, not the real world.<p>Because then, you are discarding other people&#x27;s experience about the language, while you claim your own experience is relevant.')
