Currently I use Gumroad, so they handle the payment and invoices and only send me the money with a weekly invoice, regardless of the number of sales. BUT, I always wanted to use Stripe instead of Gumroad for various reasons (lower fees, multiple currencies, per-country pricing, better withdrawl methods), only that by doing so I would have to deal with a lot more invoices. Having only the annual (and lifetime) options would really make me reconsider Stripe.')
