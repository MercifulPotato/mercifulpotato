You just provided me with another indication that the alleged wide reach of QAnon is the actual conspiracy theory.<p>Even assuming that is true (I haven&#x27;t noticed, but I didn&#x27;t specifically look for it), it doesn&#x27;t prove they are &quot;widespread&quot;, as only few people go to Corona protests. They are a special part of the population. I don&#x27;t think people happen upon QAnon stuff and become radicalized that way, as the  social media alarmists claim.')
