Much of the material put forth by the organization involves misinformation on vaccines and anti-vaccine propaganda. It was founded and is chaired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Established under the name World Mercury Project in 2016, it has been campaigning against various public health programs, such as vaccination and fluoridation of drinking water. The group has been contributing to vaccine hesitancy in the United States, encouraging citizens and legislators to support anti-vaccine regulations and legislation.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinktwice.com&#x2F;faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinktwice.com&#x2F;faq.htm</a><p>&quot;Some doctors will say anything to compel parents to vaccinate, even if it doesn&#x27;t make sense or is an outright lie. They spread this misinformation to make parents like you feel guilty, and to create tension between parents of vaccinated and non-vaccinated children. It is a ploy to coerce you into vaccinating your child. How could your non-vaccinated child be a danger to the vaccinated child? If vaccines are effective, then the baby should be protected.&quot;')
