OTC desks require larger amounts before talking to you.<p>Coinbase for example doesn&#x27;t always have wire transfers available for withdrawals.<p>So just being able to spend from a debit card - which also gives rewards - is good.<p>The conversion possibilities between crypto and fiat change practically every month though. With the paypal and instant debit integration coming out over just the last few weeks after a decade of not existing and being specifically one of the financial institutions I wouldn&#x27;t want to see my crypto use because their compliance officer would freak out on autopilot.<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t know or care how many people do it, I don&#x27;t write blog posts or contribute to international headlines just because it was a solution for me. I have a transferwise card too, shrug.')
