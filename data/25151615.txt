That was almost twenty years ago now, and I still have the feeling that I&#x27;m only scratching the surface.<p>Wait... I know there are cross-disciplines that let you get into certain programs, but you skipped and entire undergrad&#x27;s worth of core classes in Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry and Physics (and possibly Masters level research) and got into a Molecular Biology PhD program with 10 years as a CS?<p>That really is amazing, and kind of disheartening as a person with a BSc in Cellular&#x2F;Molecular biology. Goes to show just how irrelevant it really way in the grand-scheme of things--though, to be honest I had already had that thought as I was doing it.<p>I actually double majored as a Bio-Chem major but never went past my junior year requirements for it, and was never even given the option to have my completed lower division course work be deemed as a minor when I graduated.<p>And, yes you are right; once you understand how immense the field is and how wide reaching it is, you cannot fathom being able to ever really grasp it in one Lifetime. It&#x27;s an amazing field of study, but despite my credentials saying a concentration in Molecular Biology I honestly had a much greater fascination in Microbiology and the role it has on Human and Plant Health and disease and the correlation between the two via diet.')
