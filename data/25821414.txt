In Denmark it&#x27;s called Pressen√¶vnet, and it&#x27;s members are appointed by our Supreme Court, a &quot;guild&quot; of the editors of the primary medias in our country, a political body for PBS services and journalist unions.<p>Works perfectly fine, and as far as the EU goes, I think that&#x27;s the direction we need to take.<p>I have no idea how you would do it in the US, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really for us to worry about either.')
