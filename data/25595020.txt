It is incredibly wasteful, structurally leading to the $5K hammers and an entire year to design an official face mask.<p>It also utilizes and requires a &quot;punishment is one misstep away&quot; dynamic - without which there would be no functional lower levels of the pyramid, and higher levels would look very different.<p>You treat an engineer badly, they leave their job and possibly go to your competitor. You treat a soldier&#x2F;pilot badly, and ... you can keep doing that for quite a while.<p>Steve Jobs&#x27; management style was, perhaps, the closest SV can get to military style. It works, but I wouldn&#x27;t work there. And Jobs paid people handsomely to endure that.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s Linus Torvalds. He has incredibly effective leadership, over almost 30 years now, without hiring people, without even paying them, yet still getting a lot done. Not entirely flat hierarchy, but anyone is one email away from Linus (though not one commit away); No planned career advancement or horizon, and no strategic training.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many projects on the spectrum between Jobs and Torvalds, and in my experience the Jobs side of the scale is not generally more successful.')
