You want <i>all</i> the criticism and feedback you can get from your skilled and knowledgeable work force. If you don&#x27;t get that, you&#x27;re wasting the majority of that money in their pay check.<p>The irony here is that if you have a manager firing someone who presents an ultimatum, then tat in itself is effectively an ultimatum that you are supporting. ;-)<p>That of course <i>also</i> doesn&#x27;t mean you accede to every ultimatum. I mean, if your business plan is to do X, you want employees that will help you to do X. If they are getting in the way of X, then you need different employees anyway. Usually though, you and they have already worked out that they want to work with you to help you do X before you hire them.<p>So the main reason you get ultimatums is because they didn&#x27;t anticipate and do not like the approach you are taking to get to X. Assuming they are smart and have good judgement (and again, if not, why did you hire them? why are you paying them?), there&#x27;s a very good chance that there are some problems with your approach and you&#x27;d be wise to at least <i>consider</i> that possibility and their perspective. They may be trying to save you from making a terrible mistake, and feel like it is incumbent on them to stop working for you because allowing you to proceed would be working against that goal you hired them for.<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for two people to have very different perspectives on what helps to achieve a company&#x27;s objective. It&#x27;s also not uncommon for one of those people to be horribly, horribly wrong. Sure, if you&#x27;ve got an employee who has presented an ultimatum based on horribly wrong judgement, it may make no sense be their employer.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you though... just because their a subordinate doesn&#x27;t automatically mean they are the ones exercising horrible judgement... and the farther you go up the food chain, the more severe the consequences from supporting someone&#x27;s horrible misjudgement. So having a policy of summarily firing subordinates who present ultimatums both creates the wrong environment to get the best out of your team <i>and</i> terribly harmful for the leadership of your organization.')
