I&#x27;m sure an opponent or two has cheated, but to me it doesn&#x27;t matter. Either way I just play the board. If it happens I&#x27;m just playing a harder game and maybe learning something new. My rating isn&#x27;t important enough to me that a game or two lost to cheating is not a big deal. I&#x27;ve also had Chess.com reverse games a month later that they have detected the player as cheating.')
