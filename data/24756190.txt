You will not face legal sanction, only have your content be removed from the proprietary platform by the platform&#x27;s owner.<p>I&#x27;m seeing people complaining that they should be able to run their platform however they want and promote&#x2F;ban whatever they want because of their freedom of speech. And then later I see people arguing that you shouldn&#x27;t ban anything from your platform because freedom of speech. Hopefully those are distinct groups, but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; is mostly use dishonestly to try to justify one&#x27;s actions no matter which direction they go.')
