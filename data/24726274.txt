So the maximum loss is much higher in absolute terms for a large company and so they&#x27;re able to invest more absolute money into security. Plus, philosophically, startups already have such massive risk that another X% due to a potential security breach isn&#x27;t even worth bothering with versus spending the money on lowering risk in other areas.')
