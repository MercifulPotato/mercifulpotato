After the introduction of the ATM, the number of bank tellers in the US actually increased. Why? Because ATMs didn&#x27;t completely eliminate the need for bank tellers, they just automated a lot of their most mundane tasks. However, ATMs <i>did</i> reduce the amount of tellers needed to operate a branch, which made it cheaper to open new branches. So in the end, the elimination of positions at existing branches was dwarfed by all the positions created at new bank branches that now could be operated profitably.')
