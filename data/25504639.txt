Can we discuss if a trans male who identifies herself to be a woman should be allowed to take part in female sport competition (box, running)? I am afraid we no longer can discuss such &quot;uncomfortable&quot; topics<p>You can debate those things on reddit without being censored on a lots of subreddits. However, the reason these are such contentious topics is that 99% of the time they are aired it&#x27;s either people using them to complain about SJW culture, or people trying to stir up shit.<p>The last 1% is people who legitimately care about these people and want to discuss their wellbeing and rights. But I&#x27;m putting that in to be generous, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever seen these topics discussed in good faith.<p>You did not bring them up in good faith, for example, you just used obese and trans people to make a point. I have no reason to think you actually care about them or would ever engage in a conversation about their rights within our society.')
