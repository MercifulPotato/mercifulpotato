Special relativity still has a concept of spacetime, it&#x27;s just that the spacetime is flat, not curved like in general relativity.<p>(In fact, you can even do quantum mechanics in curved spacetime, as long as the spacetime has a predefined fixed curvature. But in GR, the curvature depends on how the matter and energy inhabiting the spacetime are distributed. That is what gives quantum gravity theorists trouble.)')
