Item(by='curiousgeorgio', descendants=None, kids=[25376940, 25379466], score=None, time=1607617841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372258, text='The objections you&#x27;re raising (and repeated on sites like the one you posted) are a matter of interpretation of the law, and people on both sides of the political spectrum are now realizing that the law needs clarification. It is not a settled matter by any means, and our lawmakers are still debating the issue.<p>When a company like Twitter censors the president of the United States, while <i>also</i> embedding their own editorial comments over the content he posted, those actions could easily be seen as falling outside 230 (even if courts haven&#x27;t decided that in the past). No one denies the fact that the internet today is very different from when 230 was drafted, and from a moral standpoint, we absolutely need more clarification codified into the law.<p>If your town&#x27;s public square were seized by one of the richest companies in the world, and they began exerting political control over who was allowed to speak in the town square, it would certainly raise some red flags and likely encourage legal changes (even if, for a time, it was perfectly legal).<p>The 230 debate isn&#x27;t even the core of my argument (if you read my previous comments). The point is, whether through legal means or simply by way of market pressure, we should not be allowing these companies to control the political discussion in such heavy-handed ways. Diversity of opinion <i>is diversity</i>, and we need more of it - not less (it&#x27;s ironic how some push so hard for diversity, yet seem to think we can&#x27;t handle it when it comes to speech).<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hard to imagine, but if they started silencing liberal views, there&#x27;s no doubt there would be an uproar among democrats. Apart from any legal changes that may come, we vote with our clicks and platform usage, and there&#x27;s a growing number of people who are tired of these political censorship games, so they&#x27;re leaving for other platforms with less political bias. As censorship increases, that will likely accelerate.<p>This is the last of my comments in this thread.')
