Our assignments were difficult and heavy. There was no expectation that you should complete them without Google or reference material.<p>In contrast, the &quot;final exams&quot; were either non-existent or extremely easy and account for only 10-20% of the grade, where they existed.<p>I really liked this approach. Make your assignments very difficult. Alternatively, give difficult 10-15 minute quizzes every other week. IMO, it&#x27;s a much better way of evaluating students.')
