That said, I&#x27;m buying a house. I moved from Seattle and it is utterly bizarre to me that housing in Vancouver is more expensive than Seattle, while also offering significantly lower pay.<p>My hot take is that most of the rulemakers (politicians), are property owners, and are unwilling to take the drastic steps needed to put the brakes on.<p>My solution is to take drastic steps to increase supply. The empty homes tax in Vancouver was a good step for rentals, but I think it should be punishingly high since I suspect that cheating is rampant. I also think that the permitting and building process should be inverted; any project that follows  zoning rules should allowed by default, and it shouldn&#x27;t take months or years to get permitting approved.<p>If I&#x27;m allowed to go hog-wild I also think that anyone that supports historic &#x27;character&#x27; neighborhoods should have to live the full historic lifestyle. If you fight density on &#x27;historic&#x27; grounds you should also be forced to sell your price for the &#x27;historic&#x27; price, use &#x27;historic&#x27; appliances, and earn &#x27;historic&#x27; pay.')
