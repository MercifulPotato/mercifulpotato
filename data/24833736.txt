Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=[24834204, 24833853], score=None, time=1603165307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833594, text='&gt; I think the main problem with the decision was the assertion that entities like corporations, rather than simply individuals, have free speech.<p>The decision did not assert or assume this. It rested on the idea that individual have rights, and they do not lose those rights by acting collectively.<p>If I&#x27;m allowed to speak, then I&#x27;m allowed to buy and use a printing press so that my speech can be more easily distributed. If I can&#x27;t afford a printing press, I can go in halves with you, so that we can both print off our pamphlets. If neither one of us can afford a printing press, we can take up a subscription among our friends to buy one.<p>Or to put it another way: The New York Times does not have a free speech right, but the humans who work at and own the New York Times <i>do</i>, and gagging the New York Times would infringe on the rights of those humans. Any law that implies the New York Times <i>can</i> be gagged (eg, because it&#x27;s a corporation, and thus has no rights) is clearly wrong.')
