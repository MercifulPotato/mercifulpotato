As others here have noted, it is all too tempting to use a language whose string type actually does something very fancy, and be unaware of it. Most of the time it &quot;only&quot; causes inefficiency.<p>I don&#x27;t remember if the HTTP spec has it, but I clearly remember the HTML spec has some parts that explicitly say &quot;case-insensitive <i>in the ASCII range only</i>&quot; (i.e. 61-7a = 41-5a), presumably to prevent things like this from happening.')
