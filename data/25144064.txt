A total number of 2505 people, 358 a day, passed away. Not since the first week of year 2000 that many people have died in Sweden. The 14th and 16th week of 2020 is third and fourth respectively on that same list. The month of April is the deadliest in Sweden since the 1990s with 10 458 deaths. You have to go back to December 1993, when 11,057 people died, to find a higher figure. At that time, the flu was unusually malignant. If you go past that month, you have to look back to 1918 and the Spanish flu to find a more deadly month.[0]<p>Your interpretation of the data is not correct.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emanuelkarlsten.se&#x2F;number-of-deaths-in-sweden-during-the-pandemic-compared-to-previous-years-mortality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emanuelkarlsten.se&#x2F;number-of-deaths-in-sweden-during...</a>')
