But I hope that DO will refine the approach a bit, as opt-in-only will probably kill Hacktoberfest for me.<p>The intersection of projects that I use or care about, the projects that are in a language that I&#x27;m interested in using (or even learning), the projects that are on github, and the projects that will actually opt in even after the events of the last few days, well... I&#x27;m guessing that set is going to be pretty small.  Quite frankly I don&#x27;t want to spend more time searching&#x2F;scrolling through github trying to find contributions to make than I do actually contributing.<p>Of course, none of that probably matters, as I realize I&#x27;m not the target audience for Hacktoberfest: I regularly contribute to open source projects.  Whether or not I get a t-shirt won&#x27;t change that, but I&#x27;m not going to lie - I&#x27;ve enjoyed getting the shirts (and stickers!), and wear them often.  They can be good conversation starters, and it&#x27;s also nice to have a tangible reminder of my contributions, since so much of what we do in this field is completely intangible.  Though, to your point, the potential implications of the t-shirts going forward may change my feelings on wearing them.<p>And I completely agree w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t to communication.  Earlier today I made a PR and refreshed my Hacktoberfest profile to make sure it picked it up, only to see it marked as not valid due to not being in an approved repository.  So I went looking for an explanation and eventually wound up in this thread.  As you noted, there was no mention of it on the site, no email, etc.  There also doesn&#x27;t appear to be a contact email listed anywhere on the Hacktoberfest site.')
