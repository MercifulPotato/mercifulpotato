Like a fucking idiot. That&#x27;s who&#x27;s listening to this shit. Getting a billion streams in a month. It&#x27;s fucking nine-year-olds. Our fans have, like, a hundred and fifty albums that they listen to, on a sort of rotation, at least one of them once a month.<p>- Patrick Carney (of The Black Keys)<p>I have no qualms with Spotify&#x27;s business model: a 30&#x2F;70 split seems fair. But their incentives are absolutely aligned with the record labels and the huge artists, not the smaller artists.<p>The promise of the golden era of music piracy was that it&#x27;d be a force to level the playing field for all artists and give the little guys a fair chance to compete with the bigger guys.<p>Spotify should give a subscriber&#x27;s money to the artists one listens to. It&#x27;s not just what&#x27;s fair; it&#x27;s common sense, and it would absolutely breathe a new life into the music industry.')
