For him, SaaS on a credit card was a no-go, it needed to be a monthly invoice.<p>I think it&#x27;s an opportunity for a new kind of financial business, where SaaS subscriptions can be ordered (with some kind of approval workflow) by a selection of LargeCorp employees, and there is only 1 monthly grouped invoice to LargeCorp, with a known and pre-approved PO number.<p>Money could even be made by getting the money in from the LargeCorps earlier than it&#x27;s being paid out to the SaaS services. Or a simple markup.')
