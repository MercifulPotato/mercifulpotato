I had probably 800 albums or so in 1986 when I started re-buying most of them as CDs.  In the late 90s I spent weeks ripping them to 192kbps MP3s via lame. Since then I&#x27;ve bought many hundreds more CDs, though recently it is usually just buying mp3s directly from bandcamp or from amazon. On occasion I will buy the physical CD because it is cheaper than a digital-only mp3 option. I just checked and I have a bit over 20,000 songs.<p>My family has a spotify account. In the past we used pandora. I have tried them both but I always immediately come back to playing albums from my own collection.<p>I&#x27;m in my mid 50s, and I grew up listening to album-oriented rock (AOR), and not just a stream of pop hits. I still prefer to listen to albums start to end. When an album ends, I judge my mood and think what album fits it and put that one on. That is something spotify doesn&#x27;t do for me.')
