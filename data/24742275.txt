Why does Apple get to moderate Telegram&#x27;s users?<p>If you let a communication app onto your platform, you are letting people use that to communicate. It is not up to apple to moderate telegram. It is up to telegram.<p>If apple wanted to, they could argue &quot;Telegram is so badly moderated we want them off our platform&quot;. But that is very different from saying &quot;If you do not take these specific moderation actions, we will kick you off our platform&quot;. Unless telegram was already on very thin ice with Apple, this is a massive over-reach by Apple.')
