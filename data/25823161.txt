Item(by='dominik-2020', descendants=1, kids=[25823887], score=5, time=1610986380, title='Show HN: Delete your personal data from data resellers to stop you getting spam', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi Hackernews,<p>I&#x27;ve started a service which deletes your personal data from data resellers&#x2F;traders which as a result stops you receiving sales or recruiter calls&#x2F;emails.The service forces companies which sell your data to Sales teams and recruiters to delete it. This works via GDPR and CCPA.<p>You probably have never heard of companies, like Cognism, VoilaNorbert, etc., which have received millions of dollars of investment selling your personal data without people knowing.<p>Example data stored by these companies:\nData about you:\nFull name, First name, Last Name, Email (verified), Education (university), Location (city, state, state code, country, country code, latitude, longitude, timezone), Short biography, Homepage, Avatar, Job title, Job role, Sub role, Seniority, Facebook handle, GitHub (handle, avatar, company, blog, followers, following), Twitter (handle, bio, followers, following, status, favorites, location, site, avatar), LinkedIn, GooglePlus, Private phone #1, Private phone #2<p>Data about your employer:\nCompany name, Company name alias, Website, Country, City, State, Zip code, Company phone, Industry, Company address, Company LinkedIn URL, Company Crunchbase URL, Company Type, Technologies used by company, Financials, Year founded, Reply sentiment\nDifferent data resellers have different data fields.<p>Link to the new service is here:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;gosauber.com<p>The goal of the service is to make people aware what information is stored on them and give a chance to decide what and how your data is shared.<p>In the future I was thinking of adding functionality of also erasing web tracking data and different types of companies.\nLooking forward to some feedback, as this is my Indie-hacker project.<p>Dominik')
