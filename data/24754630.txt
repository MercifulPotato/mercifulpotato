Ask for a path &amp; save permissions once, and then you&#x27;re allowed to continue saving to that file however you like, until the tab&#x2F;browser is closed (and then next time you need to ask for permission again).<p>Significantly more complex though as you need a bunch of JS, and it&#x27;s Chromium-only right now.')
