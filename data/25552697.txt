You can still identify causes and try to remediate them, but most of the time the remediation shouldn’t be something like “let’s fire Bob for making a mistake&#x2F;error”, but rather, “Let’s look at all of the events that led up to Bob making that mistake and figure out how we can help him avoid it in the future through a system, process, or people change, or a combination therein”.<p>That being said, if someone is negligent and consistently does negligent things they should probably be put into a position where their negligence won’t cause catastrophic system failures or loss of life. Sometimes that does mean firing someone.')
