They could be used for shopping, inspiration, bookmarks, or many other purposes.<p>I developed a similar site before Pinterest launched. Etsy used to have a feature called the Treasury, where members made collections of items, typically based on a theme like color, purpose, theme or aesthetic. Around the same time (2008-2009) there were sites like Wists, Wishlist or the Amazon wishlist bookmarklet. I had an etsy-related startup at the time.<p>We decided we wanted to make a collection site that was like the Treasury but drew from anywhere on the internet. I created a bookmarklet similar to Amazon&#x27;s that would pop up, let you select a photo and a title and add any URL to one of your lists on our site. We had it 80% functional and styled, but became distracted by our primary project and unfortunately never launched it.')
