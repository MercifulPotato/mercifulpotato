Which is kinda amusing, given all the fights over it on campuses etc back in the day, that were in many cases about the rights to publicly express those political opinions that are now mainstream on the left.<p>But what&#x27;s especially worrying is that some people do remember, and dismiss it anyway, because it &quot;had served its purpose&quot;. That is - they explicitly say that it was never an actual principle, but merely the means to enable their propaganda when they were not in a position of power to ensure that they&#x27;d be heard. Now that they are, they don&#x27;t want that tool to fall into the hands of those who &quot;oppose progress&quot;. Same thing goes for due process rights, and some other long-held left liberal principles. Indeed, the very word &quot;liberal&quot; is becoming a slur further on the left, and specifically so because they see it as an ideology that protects their enemies. Much of that rhetoric is hard to distinguish from Soviet propaganda of old (take a look at question 42 here to see what I mean: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;USSR100QuestionsAnswers1986&#x2F;page&#x2F;n59&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;USSR100QuestionsAnswers1986&#x2F;page...</a>).<p>And while it&#x27;s tempting to dismiss all this as some random internet rants that don&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s hard to continue doing that when even ACLU is forced into changing their long-held stance to appease the social pressure and demands of newer members, and when their events are shut down by protesters chanting &quot;liberalism is white supremacy&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, here&#x27;s what non-authoritarian socialists thought about something similar going on 70 years ago:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwellfoundation.com&#x2F;the-orwell-foundation&#x2F;orwell&#x2F;essays-and-other-works&#x2F;the-freedom-of-the-press&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwellfoundation.com&#x2F;the-orwell-foundation&#x2F;orwel...</a>')
