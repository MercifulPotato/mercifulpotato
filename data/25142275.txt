This backs up that what she did was unprofessional and interfered with her job, but I&#x27;m torn over this because it also means she got silenced. Then again, are &quot;dongle&quot; jokes the hill you want to die on? Or TWSS? This was in 2013 before the term &quot;woke&quot; was even popularized.<p>Not sure what her race has to do with this, though.')
