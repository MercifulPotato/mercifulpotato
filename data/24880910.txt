Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[24881508, 24896561, 24882897, 24882472, 24884501], score=None, time=1603563228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880357, text='&gt; Really seems like a &quot;hey nurse did this patient have their fentanyl yet?&quot; would have resolved this issue.<p>You&#x27;d be surprised at how questionable hospital care is run in NY, even with $450 &#x2F; month insurance with a high deductible.<p>To protect the privacy of the person I know, here&#x27;s a story from 2-5 months ago:<p>- Person A goes into doctor&#x27;s office for something pretty common<p>- Doctor requests cat scan or MRI (I forgot which one is which) based on symptoms<p>- Person A gets the scan<p>- Doctor evaluates results and says to book surgery in a hospital ASAP as it&#x27;s probably cancerous<p>- Person A books surgery<p>- Hospital gives prep instructions to be performed by Person A 48 hours before surgery<p>- Person A does everything and goes in for surgery<p>- Person A is prepped for surgery and is put under anesthesia<p>- Surgeon comes in and looks at the scan in the operating room<p>- Surgeon says this scan is nothing to worry about and surely doesn&#x27;t warrant surgery and it&#x27;s not a tumor or cancer<p>- Person A is wondering how the surgery went after coming to from being put out<p>- Nurse says no surgery was done and even she was able to look at the scan and see nothing was wrong<p>- Person A is told to go home and wait 4-6 weeks to self heal<p>So let&#x27;s ignore thousands of dollars in bills (deductibles). All of this could have been avoided if someone actually looked at the results of the scan before going through the motions of putting someone under anesthesia and a massive amount of stress.<p>That&#x27;s only 1 of many stories. In another case someone I knew had their blood drawn twice in the hospital because the 2nd nurse didn&#x27;t believe them when they said they just got their blood drawn by another nurse 10 minutes ago. The vials were literally next to them, about 3 arm&#x27;s lengths away.')
