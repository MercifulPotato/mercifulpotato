This is some guys&#x27;s weekend beer fantasy. This would be a good Netflix comedy.<p>I think some commenters here are overstating the situation. This is not &#x27;National Defense HQ&#x27; thinking &#x27;hey let&#x27;s try this out on the dumb plebes&#x27; - this is &#x27;Bob&#x27; the &#x27;Captain&#x27; in the Halifax Rifles but really a Restaurant Manager by day, who watches <i>way</i> too many History Channel war documentaries who decided to do his own training - or something along those lines. I don&#x27;t know the truth but I would be shocked if this were approved from those above the reserve unit.')
