I would like to know more about why they wanted to switch.<p>I use Jekyll for a few sites that benefit from gitflow around markdown collaboration and it’s pretty solid. I read about other generators and if something is easier or better I’m interested.<p>But for me, it seems Jekyll solved this problem years ago. And it has good docs, active development, etc.<p>The few people I know who switched off of it did so for what seems like arbitrary reasons to me. A group I collaborate with switched to gatsby because they said some of their developers couldn’t run Ruby on their workstations. And I guess switching their generator to gatsby was easier than figuring out that problem :)')
