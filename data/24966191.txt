It makes sense as it eliminates all the smearing problems. Your left hand moves away from the written letters and lines exactly as you write them. Like it happens naturally for a right handed person writing &quot;normally&quot;.<p>However, I guess the problem is that it basically means you have to learn writing the letters in a completely different way and most 6 year olds will not be able to come up with that themselves.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; <i>Left-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper &quot;forward slant&quot; with the left hand if the paper is turned  1⁄4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bias_against_left-handed_people" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bias_against_left-handed_peo...</a>')
