It’s the product of powerful propaganda.<p>Why is it surprising? It&#x27;s not complicated. Gulf states - not Israel - pay the bills in Bangladesh.  It also throws in  religious fundamentalist indoctrination schools for free, schools that preach hatred of Israel.<p>&gt; It’s kind of horrifying to see the effect of that same propaganda here in the US recently.<p>The majority of the US supports both Israel&#x27;s and the Palestinians&#x27; right to exist without oppression and fear of attack.  People are largely opposed to either party violating that principle.<p>Perhaps you missed the outrage in the US at the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, or the bipartisan condemnation of the Saudis&#x27; war against Yemen while the previous president and his family courted them, or the US renewable energy industry that is trying to decouple us from Gulf petroleum dependency.<p>The US public has deeply soured on the Gulf States across the political spectrum.  The only people who are still warm to them, as ever, are those who seek access to their immense capital or are enamored with their theocratic and authoritarian system of government.')
