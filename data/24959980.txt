I&#x27;m currently in a discrete class as a part of my computer science minor, and am struggling with proofs (mainly induction) primarily, in my guess, because I never got comfortable with fundamental algebra.<p>I tended to avoid any math wherever possible because I did not grok it naturally, but when I took calculus last fall, I actually fell in love. However, as stated above, I struggle with basic elements due to my prior avoidance and because this is coming to a head with my struggles with proofs, I would love any resources you all can give me that would help me recalibrate my missing knowledge &#x2F; practice.<p>I hope this made sense and thank ya&#x27;ll in advance.')
