Presumably CDPR employees are not afraid to convey such bad news to the management. So why did the management still decide to go ahead with the release this year?<p>After reading this transcript, I didn&#x27;t find the answer to these questions.<p>&quot;Underestimated the scale and complexity of the issues&quot;: it&#x27;s not like they needed to <i>estimate</i> anything. This is not an MMO that behaves differently after the million users log in. This is not a PC that behaves differently on unpredictable end-user&#x27;s systems.

It seems, however, that the management would have a pretty unambiguous information at their disposal.')
