What time did you play? Around 2002?<p>Since I was a 2k player at the time, let me assure you, that the top dudes at the time (Koven, Sheriff for example) were already so called pro gamers who got payed&#x2F;sponsored and they were exceptionally good.<p>The true story is, that many folks above 2k+ did what was called &quot;points trading&quot; back then. Koven once stated, that they got payed according to their rank in the official ladder.<p>So he also had to defend against cheaters, un-sync games etc. He was always top notch, but he had to adjust his rating accordingly, due to cheaters.<p>Almost all at the top did points trading. Smurf accounts, the system, some refusing to play against weaker players, or some playing DM to get points faster. Also some game &quot;hacks&quot;, like the farming bug etc. that gave you the edge in early FLUSHing games.<p>So take this: 1850 is extremely good in RM 1vs1. 2k+ players are exceptionally good at micro-management. A skill to be learned.<p>I was part of CN, you might remember this clan from our most famous player, Lightning_CN. Greets to Force, Gwenny etc. where ever you are! :)<p>PS: There is a book from L_Clan_Chris at Amazon. Some knowledge bites to digest.')
