They went through &gt;12 IT people before crawling back. My coworker got the client and was fired within 3 days. His replacement another coworker lasted about 2 weeks. I then was given the client. I went onsite, was stoic as usual and they loved that. They could be abusive as much as they pleased to me and I never responded to any of it. It worked for many months but I got busy. I was booked weeks in advanced. So they sent a coworker onsite and they flipped their lid. It was about a 45 minute drive there, this coworker billed them for 4 hours of driving. Like as if they wouldn&#x27;t realize?<p>They complained so badly but never named my coworker because they never got his name. My boss assumed they were talking about me and he flipped out on my about fraudulent fluffing my numbers and all that. I had no idea what he was talking about and couldn&#x27;t defend myself. He just tore me a new one for awhile and said they had to 0$ out all their recent bills.<p>Afterwards I looked it up and after finding out it wasn&#x27;t me. I was not too pleased.')
