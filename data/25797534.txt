From the perspective of the company, dealing with unions is expensive and time consuming. It&#x27;d be better just to give employees fair benefits and pay without dealing with a union. But if there&#x27;s no union, only the threat of unionization incentivizes actually following through.<p>Similarly for workers, no one wants to have to work harder to be treated fairly along with paying the overhead of unionization. What you end up with is an unstable equilibrium for the creation and destruction of unions.')
