Therefore I often find myself asking myself, &quot;what do you care what other people think?&quot; Sometimes the answer is &quot;nothing really&quot; and sometimes it&#x27;s more like &quot;well this group of other people have a higher level of expertise or experience than me so if they disagree I want to know why.&quot; Mostly though I am quite comfortable being outcome independent with respect to other people&#x27;s opinions. It&#x27;s nice if they like me or what I have to say, but mostly it really doesn&#x27;t matter if they don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s also an observably necessary trait for paradigm shifting scientific progress, since advancing a new paradigm requires defending the claim that every other subject matter expert is actually wrong, and human nature being what it is they will never react kindly to that assertion.')
