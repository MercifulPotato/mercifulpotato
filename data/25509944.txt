Item(by='spapas82', descendants=1, kids=[25510019], score=2, time=1608664346, title='Ask HN: How Electronic Signatures Work', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hello, I&#x27;ve come across various applications where I am needed to sign electronically: I am given a tablet or mobile phone and put in my signature (or something that resembles it at least) in a specific placeholder using either a stylus or even my finger! This is common in not-so-important things like couriers but recently I&#x27;ve also be instructed to sign like this in banks (!)<p>There seems to be some secret occult on how such solutions work. I understand they get a bpm&#x2F;jpg (or whatever) with my scribble; then what? Also, I am really not sure if such solutions are legally binding! What would happen if tomorrow I say to my courier that I didn&#x27;t receive the package and that ain&#x27;t my signature there?<p>Thanks for any help!')
