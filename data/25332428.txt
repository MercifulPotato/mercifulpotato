You assume a &quot;nanny web&quot; is about taking away these freedoms, when in fact it&#x27;s about incentivizing people to actually utilize them.<p>I agree with you insofar as Mill&#x27;s free market of ideas is the best remedy against bigotry and extremism, but you have the wrong idea about how to achieve that -- unregulated laissez-faire &quot;freedom&quot; on the web does not result in actual free discourse. On the contrary, that&#x27;s just a recipe for a web overrun by all manner of adware, malware, spyware, propagation of unconscious self-censorship by means of universal targeted and mass surveillance, and straight-up disinformation ops and public opinion manipulation from hostile actors. How are you going to have sincere exchanges of ideas at scale over all that noise?')
