Item(by='abhisuri97', descendants=3, kids=[24770347], score=2, time=1602622967, title='Ask HN: Is there a CSV (or any document) of voting locations in the US?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I was just trying to figure out which early voting location would be best for me (and others) to vote based on what&#x27;s closest to the voter and would likely have a small wait time (based on local population density in the zip code). However, the only thing I can really see that lists out the locations is my county&#x27;s election office website. I feel that someone&#x2F;some company should already have these locations listed somewhere (my best guesses and Google and Vote.org didn&#x27;t actually have early voting locations and just pointed me to the TX state website).')
