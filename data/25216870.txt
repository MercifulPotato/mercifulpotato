I&#x27;d instinctively prefer do do such diagrams in a declarative way and let a layout engine worry about making it look nice. However, I never had to dabble into area that makes heavy use of such diagrams â€“ maybe it&#x27;s just too hard to make look good for typesetting.<p>I also have a theory that it would be good to have a re-implementation of the graphviz core to it more modular and make extensions such as Quiver more feasible, as from an outside, layman&#x27;s view graphviz is pretty old and does not necessarily work well in today&#x27;s frameworks other than encapsulating it with lotsa layers above it.')
