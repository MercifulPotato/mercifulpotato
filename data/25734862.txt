Item(by='davb', descendants=None, kids=[25735015, 25734903, 25734895], score=None, time=1610393241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732956, text='I&#x27;d probably switch to (and get friends to switch to) Signal if it supported Android Tablets and had a web app (like web.whatsapp.com). Those items might seem minor but having to always have my phone next to me, even when I&#x27;m browsing on my tablet, is inconvenient. Same goes for not being able to login easily to a semi-trusted device via the web (e.g. my work laptop - I don&#x27;t want to install the desktop client, but I trust it enough to login to a web app, possibly in an incognito window).')
