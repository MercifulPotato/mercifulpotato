Starting with large growth in non-PC markets, actually, mostly the consoles.<p>Jim Keller was certainly key in getting Zen up &amp; going, but he left in 2015 so his impact on Zen 3 would be rather minimal to say the least.<p>Combine that with the timing of Intel struggling hard with new process nodes and there you go. A bit of AMD got better, a bit of Intel got worse, and now you&#x27;ve got this landslide result.')
