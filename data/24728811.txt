It comes off sounding like a person who loves running their own steam train because it works for them and can&#x27;t believe that anyone would ever want to use a car or bicycle.<p>More power to anyone who&#x27;s needs are met by OpenBSD on a laptop, but they are as far from a typical user as can exist. And I don&#x27;t mean just a stereotypical &#x27;business user&#x27; who only uses their computer to access email and spreadsheets, I mean any power user who actually creates stuff with their computer, whether it&#x27;s programs, websites, music, video editing, documents, whatever.<p>This person hates Finder. A normal person hates a laptop that might not go into suspend mode when they close the lid to go to a meeting or it might just lock up and lose all their work because some webcam driver that got loaded doesn&#x27;t fully support suspend. And god forbid if they try to plug the laptop into a random projector to do a presentation.<p>This person hates the startup sound. A normal person hates a laptop where the fonts look like crap or all the GUI elements render at way too small a size unless you edit config files and play with DPI settings.<p>This person hates the dock. A normal person hates a laptop that requires you to install command line utilities and edit config files to enable reliable power management and get decent battery life.<p>This person hates laptops that don&#x27;t have lots of different kinds of ports to plug in stuff. A normal person loves that they can just buy any external solid state hard drive on Amazon and plug it into the USB-C port with zero configuration and it transfers files super fast. Or they can buy any brand new USB-C webcam or headset and everything just works and they get it with next day delivery and can get on with their actual job and never thing about it again.<p>This person hates .DS_Store files. A normal hates a laptop where trying to have a simple video call is probably going to require 6 hours of figuring out which kernel modules are required to support your webcam and audio chipset. And if you use multiple webcams or regularly switch between headsets or whatever, you might as well just give up.<p>This person hates the App Store. A normal person hates a laptop that doesn&#x27;t let them run essential software like Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, Illustrator or whatever modern creation software makes them 50x more efficient at their job.<p>But if OpenBSD solves your specific laptop needs, that&#x27;s awesome and keep on keeping on. The best thing to happen to computing since the mid-90s is that now pretty much any computer can talk to any other computer and most file types can be read across and range of operating systems and software. It <i>really </i>didn&#x27;t used to be like that. So at least we live in a world where the steam train people can keep on running their steam trains.')
