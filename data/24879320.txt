But I&#x27;m using the &quot;old&quot; PhotoStation instead of Moments. It feels too much like Google Photos where all pictures are bundled, and I like to have &quot;Albums&quot; or folders that are separate. But i use it also for just regular camera photography, not just phone where it makes more sense to have a timeline. Hard to have a useful timeline when I take 1000 pictures in a weekend with my Fuji')
