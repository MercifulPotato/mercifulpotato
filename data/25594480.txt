They didn&#x27;t acknowledge <i>that</i>.<p>Was it improperly stored in a refrigeration unit that is restricted for only storing other things and the person put it out and posted about it, but nobody claimed it? Maybe it was in a beer fridge or the break room fridge on cleanout day.<p>Lots of options. In the example the poster said, it was a deliberate act, but in the poster&#x27;s case, the intent wasn&#x27;t to ruin things, even if that would have resulted from the deliberare act.')
