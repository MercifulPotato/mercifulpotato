I had been doing the others before, but adding the ketamine was life changing for me.<p>Itâ€™s a shame too. I had the best health care option from one of the largest public tech companies and I had to pay $450 out of pocket, twice a week for four weeks, and then moving down to every other week. This is on top of $6k they took out of my salary over the year.<p>It is extremely frustrating the amount of basic mental health care needs, which I believe depression is, that are simply out of reach for most of Americans.')
