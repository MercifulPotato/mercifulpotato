Go into Facebook and download your data and look in the ads folder. There&#x27;s a very helpful &quot;advertisers_who_uploaded_a_contact_list_with_your_information.html&quot; page that lists every advertiser who somehow obtained your contact data and ran targeted ads to you. There&#x27;s a lot of sketchy companies out there who I never had any kind of relationship with who somehow managed to obtain email or other contact data. Bit of an enlightening experience as to just how widespread your personal data is being shared, even if you&#x27;re somewhat careful of who you give your personal data to.')
