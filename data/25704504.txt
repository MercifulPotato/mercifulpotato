Removing a mapping is expensive (need to flush). Also, processes have their own (mostly) independent page tables.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be reasonable accounting, when paging-in is cheap, but only if there is no need to page out (available free memory). Especially when trying to argue that paging out is zero-cost.')
