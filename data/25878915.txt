Many languages still have the same grammar and vocabulary. Despite having computers in our hands, we still rely on the same inefficient alphabet, grammar, and vocabulary. My question is: why haven’t we invented more efficient ways of communication? for example, why haven’t we added more letters to the alphabet? Why haven’t we incorporated commonly used icons as part of our writing (E.g. using the download icon to write “download” instead of using the alphabet to convey the same meaning)?<p>I feel like ever since the printing technology became more available, the pace of evolution of languages has slowed down. I thought computers would help with that, because they provide a dynamic way to exchange and communicate ideas. But here we are, decades after the invention of the first computer, and for programming we still rely on the QWERTY keyboard that wasn’t even invented for ease of use.<p>P.S: typos and errors are due to voice dictation.')
