While he was professionally successful, his children, who were both born in Germany, struggled. They still feel they are outsiders, not quite German but definitely not Pakistani — a feeling that is repeated as they have children of their own. This experience juxtaposed with that of my father shows a clear difference. Even though I was raised in a predominantly white New York City suburb, I was never considered anything other than American. It is treatment that is extended to my children who, like the subsequent descendants of immigrants, are only aware of the ethnic roots as a distant fact. This is the fundamental difference between European and American Muslims: the ability for American Muslims to assimilate.<p>Note that while the US doesn’t take as many Muslim refugees as Europe, unlike Canada or Australia it has an immigration system based on family reunification, not points. So while the first person in a family may immigrate based on say an H1-B, siblings and other family might immigrate significantly lower on the economic ladder. (This was true of for example my uncle, aunt, and cousins, who came over on a family reunification visa sponsored by my dad, who himself came over with a white collar job under an H1-B.)')
