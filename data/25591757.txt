Improving technology improves the efficiency with which this can be done. Stopping growth in the technological improvements doesn&#x27;t mean we go back to zero, we simply get stuck at the current level of efficiency.<p>Also the premise is unrealistic anyway. Technological improvements will still happen incrementally even with zero funding for research. Especially as big changes occur and needs arrive.')
