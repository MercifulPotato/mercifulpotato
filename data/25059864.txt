HTML support is built-in for sure in all the web-focused IDEs (pycharm, rubymine, phpstorm, webstorm). I generally edit almost all my files in a JetBains IDE, heavily using the &quot;scratch&quot; feature.<p>The Rust plugin is not ideal yet, although it is officially supported so in time it will probably have the same support and quality other products have.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m convinced this comes from the fact that IDEs have to be both highly opinionated and very flexible: supporting all of flask, django, pandas+Jupyter and ansible, properly, is tough: all are Python, all are really different. Either you turn Pycharm into something that does not work good for anyone (lowest common denominator) or you have to leave out communities.<p>Yes, some frameworks are not fully supported, which is inevitable. The most popular frameworks will usually have an official plugin. I wish more framework&#x2F;language communities would take developing a JetBrains plugin more seriously.<p>The language plugins do usually leverage community tools when possible, but sometimes it is prohibitively expensive performance-wise.<p>In conclusion: Vim and Emacs do win in ubiquity for sure. It is unfortunate though that many communities only focus on getting those type of setups working well. The JetBrains IDEs are MILES ahead of what Vim, Emacs or Visual Studio Code can do with their hodge-podge of plugins that I would never trust with a context-aware automatic refactor in my life. Those editors are in fact a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;, and people lose so much productivity because of them.<p>In fact, I <i>will</i> consider a language &quot;niche&quot; until it gets proper JetBrains support for the above reasons.')
