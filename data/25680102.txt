Fetchmail kept randomly crashing on select spam messages and my bug reports went unheeded (and I wasn&#x27;t what anyone would call a programmer) so I needed a new way to download my mail. So I wrote a crappy Perl script. All it does is use standard Perl modules to download the mail, and pipes it off to an MDA (postfix, maildrop, etc) to deal with them.<p>After nearly two decades, no matter what system I plunk it on or mail provider I use, the same stupid script just keeps working.')
