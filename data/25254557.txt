Restaurants and pubs were closed for dine in service, but they are allowed to do takeaway. &quot;Non-essential&quot; shops were closed, but anecdotally, lot&#x27;s of non-essential shopping continued at places like supermarkets and hardware stores. Prior to the lockdown, there were already tiered regional restrictions in place, so rather than going from wide open to locked down like in March, we went from somewhat restricted to somewhat more restricted and now we are going back to somewhat restricted.')
