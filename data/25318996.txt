Item(by='ddalex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607207075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305489, text='not OP, but currently a manager at Google (full disclosure, opinions are my own, company is not involved, etc)<p>I fully expect that everybody at Google will create the designs for the problems they own, get the designs through peer review, work on implementing these designs, and verify that the solution is solved in process.<p>What changes with the seniority level is the scope of the designs - a junior may be expected to design their piece of code, only their module, a mid level is expected to design an entire subsystem while delegating individual modules, a senior is expected to design an entire system delegating the subsystems, etc. Of course, it&#x27;s not so clear cut all the time, but the critical piece we have here is that - Everybody, at all levels, are expected to share expertise, knowledge and acumen in order to help others grow. When you put everything together it creates a nice cycle of constant growth pressure.<p>Absolutly I will not qualify anybody&#x27;s work here as &quot;droning&quot;, and if someone in my team would feel like that I would invite them to speak up and work together into making it better.<p>About the quality of people here, what has impressed me most is the uniform high level of competence and niceness. In other companies where I&#x27;ve worked the skills would more-or-less all over the place, but here it&#x27;s uniform good. I&#x27;d rate Googlers consistently in top 20% of the teams where I&#x27;ve worked with before. Also everybody is so very nice, a real pleasure to be around and work together. I still haven&#x27;t discovered how recruiting selects for this, but everybody constantly passes the airport test my in book.')
