They&#x27;d sell systems to the TSMC&#x2F;EU partnership. The key is that the process engineers in the fab would learn how to develop processes for the leading edge geometries. To some extent, ASML engineers would know this, too. However, the secret recipes (literally) of chip production are so closely guarded that even the equipment companies for the tools they run on are not permitted to see them.<p>I completely agree that consortium-based organizations are less able to respond and react to changes or issues. That&#x27;s why it needs to be treated as a strategic (defense) matter rather than a government&#x2F;industry partnership, a-la Sematech in the US.')
