We end up having to define schemas only twice, one for sqlalchemy models and another for the version of that model you want to deliver via the api. The experience has been that the code is almost completely just schema definitions with very little boiler plate, and even the slight duplication between sqlalchemy and pydantic actually end up being more useful than not in every case.')
