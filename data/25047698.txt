While I&#x27;m impressed by the unicorn startup stories, I want to also hear from those that did&#x2F;could not take that path, which is a majority of the startups. One of the most impressive things is that Josh did all of this with a level of transparency few founders would be willing to.<p>Of course, some posters here are talking about employees getting a raw deal, but it was there for all to see that the company had decided long back to prioritize profit more than growth. Any employee that would have expected a unicorn like exit would have known it wouldn&#x27;t be the case and would have left long ago. Blaming Josh for that doesn&#x27;t feel right to me.')
