I rarely comment and do not see how this as a strawman. If this is not a strawman, then explain how a 15yo with notepad can do the same as these solutions with a defensible stance. Is it because the person replying to you wasn&#x27;t nice and give you fluffy kind words? I&#x27;m not understanding why the thin skin here. If you make a bold statement, it should be able to be backed up. Problem is here that you can&#x27;t, so just ad hominem instead.')
