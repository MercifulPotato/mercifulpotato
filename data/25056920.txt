This was exhausting, demotivating and non-productive. Meetings stretched forever, and tbh most of them weren&#x27;t needed.<p>70% of communication is body language, that we miss over a zoom call, so we&#x27;re constantly &quot;over-delivering&quot; behind the camera. (not like that, you dirty mind ) and 4 hours of video calls can drain you out.<p>As of now, HBR states 71% managers find meetings unproductive, CNBC told us 67% of team members spend way too much time in meetings.<p>With tools like Slack, Teams and &quot;always-on&quot; culture, staff are constantly bombarded with pings and FOMO prevents us from stepping away from our computer, leading to really long and stretched out work hours.<p>This lead to zoom fatigue, team disconnects, and people generally just wanting to get back into the office.<p>Lastly, with hybrid models, you end up having half the team in the office doing standups, and everyone else is left out. This leads to disconnection and makes you feel like its highschool all over again<p>With all this happening, we wanted to productise our process that cut down 4 hours of daily meetings to 10 mins max of calls. We&#x27;ve adopted a pure async approach and we&#x27;ve never been happier<p>With RemoteWorkly Send a video message instead of holding an unwanted meeting<p>- Async video meetings with transcriptions for teams to communicate across timezones and offices. Aka video walkie talkie<p>- Use video threads for meetings, onboarding staff, client feedback for agencies, building internal wikis.<p>- Share your stand up. Stay connected. Discuss work and see who&#x27;s working on what...all without another &quot;catch up meeting&quot;<p>- Work with all your tools in one place.
