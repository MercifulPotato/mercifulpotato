It&#x27;s true that in <i>some circumstances</i> the GIL prevents threads from running in multiple cores, but not all. The GIL would definitely have been released during the file I&#x2F;O calls in your program. Depending on what hashing library you were using, it could well have released the GIL too and enabled true thread-based parallelism. For example, the built in Python hashlib says [1]:<p>&gt; Note: For better multithreading performance, the Python GIL is released for data larger than 2047 bytes at object creation or on update.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m absolutely not saying that nobody should use multiple processes. For some applications, it&#x27;s no more complex to use the multiprocessing module than to use threads and not much overhead to pass the data between processes. In that case, it&#x27;s nice because you just don&#x27;t even need to worry about whether the GIL is going to play a role, which can be a pain since sometimes there&#x27;s no documentation saying whether specific functions release the GIL or not. All I&#x27;m saying is we should always make clear that to clear to everyone that threads are an option that the GIL doesn&#x27;t (always) prevent.<p>&gt; Also, the featured video is from 2015. Maybe it&#x27;s just outdated information?<p>Another note on the hashlib page said that the above feature was added in Python 3.1 (released in 2009). That&#x27;s just about that particular module. I found documentation from Python 1.5 (released in 1998) that describes how C extensions can release the GIL [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;hashlib.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;hashlib.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;release&#x2F;1.5&#x2F;api&#x2F;node43.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;release&#x2F;1.5&#x2F;api&#x2F;node43.html</a>')
