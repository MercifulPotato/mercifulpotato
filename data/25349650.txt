I&#x27;ve talked 1:1 with about 3, and in all three cases the people refused ample help due to 1) not wanting to go to rehab or 2) paranoid schizophrenia, which the city won&#x27;t deal with to avoid civil rights problems.<p>Boiling everything down to &#x27;homelessness means society is selfish&#x27; is over simplifying an incredibly complicated problem. There are things that can be done, but it requires a lot more thought than holding hands and handing out free stuff. SF is probably the least selfish city on the planet, which is arguably part of the problem.')
