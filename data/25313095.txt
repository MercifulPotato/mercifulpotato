Communist China? Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia? No, it is the United States prior to ubiquitous internet news.<p>Respectively I refer to Walter Cronkite&#x27;s turn against the Vietnam war at the Tet Offensive, the misinformation campaign levied at the Nicoroguan Sandinistas and the New York Times decision to hold the warrantless wiretapping story until after the 2004 election.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that is a better world. I&#x27;m not sure if we aren&#x27;t just looking at trade-offs, moderated media having its flaws and virtues, unmoderated having its own.<p>It is no wonder we shrink at the trials and tribulations of unmoderated information. They are new. But I think there is a tendency recently to overlook the costs our gatekeepers previously imparted to our society.')
