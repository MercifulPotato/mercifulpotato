They make the majority of product revenue with the ink.<p>Pretty much everything that people hate about them comes from this business model.<p>I personally print very rarely, but I found laser printers are much better for rare printing. When I had an Inkjet the Ink was always dried up when I tried to use it occasionally, so when I actually needed it it didn&#x27;t work. So now I buy the cheapest laser printer that can do duplex, and that works when I need it.<p>Probably the only reason to have an Inkjet is if you need color printing')
