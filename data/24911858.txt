All of those old USB-A chargers and USB-A&#x2F;Lightning cables will still charge the new iPhones perfectly well.<p>So will every iPad charger ever made, btw.<p>And every USB-C Mac charger ever made.<p>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you or any particular observer wants to give credit for this reducing e-waste or being &quot;eco-friendly&quot;.
