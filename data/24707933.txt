The risk of drug overdose is concentrated. You don&#x27;t accidentally trip on heroine, it takes a set of (largely predictable) circumstances to get there.<p>Society correctly assesses this risk, which is why solving the opioid epidemic polls a lot less favorably than policing and defense. The idea that society (writ large) cares more about preventing genocide and war than preventing isolated drug deaths isn&#x27;t really that controversial.')
