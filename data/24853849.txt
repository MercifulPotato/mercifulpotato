Linux is certainly huge, and yes it&#x27;s size means it&#x27;s beyond any newbie&#x27;s capacity to understand it all.<p>But nonetheless lots of newbies contribute to it regularly.  Most of them build up the understanding they need by reading the kernel code.  Obviously, that means you don&#x27;t have to understand all of it to get a lot of benefit from just reading a small subsection.<p>So it is indeed possible to go read the Linux kernel just as a learning exercise.   The key point is you don&#x27;t have to read all of it to get a benefit out of it.  Reading just a small subset works just as well as reading the entire source of a small project.')
