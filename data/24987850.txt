Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604485675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987133, text='&gt; In my experience it&#x27;s also much more compatible with Java&#x2F;JVM libraries. In Scala that&#x27;s perfectly possible but leads to very un-idiomatic code, in Kotlin you barely notice.<p>I think that&#x27;s actually reversing as Kotlin and Java diverge. E.g. interop with Java Optionals is very easy in Scala (and they obviously correspond directly to Scala Options) whereas it&#x27;s harder to make them fit with Kotlin nullable types. And Kotlin&#x27;s &quot;suspend functions&quot; are unlike anything else and mean you have to understand a concept of &quot;inline&quot; that changes the semantics of the function it applies to; e.g. calling a Java function that takes a callback from an async function is straightforward in Scala, but not so much in Kotlin.')
