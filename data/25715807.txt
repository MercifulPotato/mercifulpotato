Our species relied heavily on small communities working together and excluding other communities throughout our entire human history. Tribalism is engrained in our nature as a direct effect of our evolution. It would take another thousand years to unlearn that. Social media is a global tool, and therefore social media has just brought out the worst in humans on a global level, but it hasn&#x27;t created that intrinsic tribal instinct in us to begin with. Humans are just not meant to cooperate on such a large scale. We&#x27;d all be much better off (aka leaving more harmonious) if we&#x27;d live in smaller communities and would revert a lot of what globalisation has given us.')
