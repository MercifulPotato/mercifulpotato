I&#x27;d rather not spend extra money on more real estate or a WeWork-type membership.<p>I just don&#x27;t find it very surprising that ~60-70% of people don&#x27;t particularly like permanent remote, since it&#x27;s 1. a departure from the norm and 2. people usually build their home-work separation with the commute, and I would say people expressing missing the commute separation at least some of the time represent a majority, if not a plurality, of my direct coworkers. But we are also at a company that let people do partial WFH pre-COVID.')
