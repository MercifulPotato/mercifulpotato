They are just workers like everyone else, and frankly, as preformative. Most of them are regular people and not sociopaths.<p>The difference with some &#x27;banking&#x27; roles - is that they are playing in games of &#x27;dealing and leverage&#x27; - not so much value creation.<p>So they&#x27;re naturally going to acclimate to a different way of viewing thew world. They play zero-sum games whereas everyone else is doing work, or trying&#x2F;pretending to.<p>They have access to the &#x27;old money&#x27; class and they see the potentiality.<p>But really - the lower rungs of banking are just upper-class elite.<p>The &#x27;old money&#x27; are not necessarily sociopaths - they are often quite nice people, they vary from down-to-earth to detached to egoist. Maybe not nice enough to give up their money but not necessarily bad people. And living off of a stipend of limited wealth can give a sense of the limitations of money and these people are not wagging their money in your face.<p>There is a hugely fundamental difference between &#x27;barbarian&#x27; like Donald Trump, or Putin, and kids from the Bertelsmann family because those who are &#x27;out of the game&#x27; and living off old money are super effete, it&#x27;s not like they are going to be that important or influential. They are useless and they know it.<p>I also dispute the morale differentials etc. I think there&#x27;s some truthiness there, but it&#x27;s a function of aspiration: the &#x27;working class&#x27; have more likely than not accepted their lot while the &#x27;middle class&#x27; are competing for surpluses.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not so cynical. Those &#x27;middle class&#x27; people do important things. It&#x27;s not easy to be a dentist, doctor, write software, manage people etc..')
