Or debugging services in production, which tracing is a key part of - but again just a small part of observability, and one that the rest of your dev process should be actively trying to minimize. If you have any degree of DevOps going on, many key SLIs will much higher-level (p99 of HTTP requests, MB of storage per customer), and I don&#x27;t see how eBPF addresses that better than existing instrumentation, or in some cases at all.')
