Duty is beyond the things you have to do without being thrown in jail.<p>Many military people do feel a sense of duty, and that&#x27;s why they serve or served.  In a civilian sense, duty would be things like acknowledging that a park is a shared space.  If you walk past a piece of garbage and don&#x27;t pick it up, you have failed in your duty to maintain the shared space even if you aren&#x27;t the one that dropped it.  A contemporary one would be cutting down on CO2 emissions.  It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s duty to cut back on that; someone who bought a Hummer would be shamed, as would people who keep their thermostats super high or low.  Gossip spreads that you&#x27;re a clod who&#x27;s damaging the environment we all share, and you get shamed.<p>People used to patch potholes in public roads near their house because they felt a duty to keep the neighborhood nice.<p>These things don&#x27;t happen anymore.  I&#x27;m not sure whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing, since there were certainly downsides to duty.  I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s legal to patch potholes in public roads anymore.')
