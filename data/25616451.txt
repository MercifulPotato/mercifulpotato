It started as a for-fun project 8 years ago when I decided to do the digital info system for a local hacker conference and didn&#x27;t find anything that allows quick prototyping and rapid iteration&#x2F;live coding of content. I then switch from &quot;desktop Linux&quot; to Raspberries and added a web based service around the fairly low-level command line tool. It&#x27;s my main source of income for 4 years now.')
