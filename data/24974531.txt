Item(by='vinay427', descendants=None, kids=[24974691, 24976671, 24974562], score=None, time=1604358362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973102, text='&gt; There are S-Bahn stations in Switzerland with 10 times the daily riders of BART that are nothing more than a signpost and a place to stand.<p>Do you mean a specific BART station? The average total BART daily ridership (400k weekday, 100k weekend) is roughly comparable to the total daily Zürich S-Bahn network ridership (400k-450k in one figure I found).<p>I&#x27;m not sure that Zürich has the most popular network in the country but I would assume it&#x27;s up there. Bigger stations here are definitely smaller than that SJ monstrosity, and I really like how efficiently they&#x27;re laid out, but which popular stations are you thinking of that are just a signpost and a place to stand? Even the most popular space-constrained ones in the city (Hardbrücke, Stadelhofen) are <i>way</i> more than that, and the only I can think of in the city that are basically just a signpost are those with relatively infrequent service (Seebach, Friesenberg, etc.).<p>In any case, I think Caltrain feels a lot more like the S-Bahn equivalent, and most of the stations aren&#x27;t much bigger either. This seems to hold for several other commuter train services in the US, such as NJ Transit.')
