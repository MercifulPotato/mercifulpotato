What breaks into my brain is surprise and irregularity, and a color just doesn&#x27;t trigger that. I don&#x27;t even notice the fonts if I&#x27;m not looking at it. I almost feel like the 10 minute window would have been better, because then at least I wouldn&#x27;t be getting used to it constantly changing color.<p>Not to mention that for this to be used as a sticky note, I&#x27;d need to have it as a window on top of my screen. Typically when I create a sticky note, it&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t do the task right now. So to have the task just on top of everything else, animating... even if it is annoying enough to get my attention, then that kind of guarantees I&#x27;m not going to get much else done in the meantime because it&#x27;ll be distracting me.<p>The idea behind a sticky note for me is that it&#x27;s a reminder. It&#x27;s not meant to be omnipresent, it should just show up every once and while like a recurring alarm -- in a perfect world, it would only show up when it&#x27;s actually time for me to do the task, so it doesn&#x27;t risk breaking my concentration if I&#x27;m doing something else that&#x27;s productive.<p>Good idea, and maybe it&#x27;s something that&#x27;ll work better for other people. But I can&#x27;t see myself getting use out of it in its current form.')
