You can&#x27;t call someone a &quot;protester&quot; if they have gone past a police blockade and are attempting to enter the chamber against the direct orders of Capitol Police. They were rioters.<p>I have a problem with BLM _riots_ but not anything about the protests themselves. I have a small problem with the MAGA protests, in that they&#x27;re being led astray, but they absolutely have the right to protest and air their grievances if they&#x27;re peaceful.<p>You are the one being gaslighted or trying to fool others. Every challenge to the vote was thrown out because there was no evidence presented. If there are the thousands of millions of zillions of cases of fraud and evidence of any of it why hasn&#x27;t that been presented? It&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t exist. You can spout whatever lies you like in the media - social, mainstream or lamestream. But you can&#x27;t lie to a judge without consequences, so no lawyer will help you lie.<p>As for Georgia, more than zero evidence: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;fact-check-did-fabricated-water-main-break-affect-vote-counting-georgia-trump-says-1558876" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;fact-check-did-fabricated-water-mai...</a> so stop repeating that ridiculous talking point like it&#x27;s a fact. If someone else sees your posts they might believe the same false things you do because you&#x27;re authoritative.<p>There isn&#x27;t a conspiracy to elect Biden. He&#x27;s not that interesting.')
