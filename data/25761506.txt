I agree with this:<p>&gt; Pretty much everyone is eager to get back to normal, and I&#x27;m fairly confident that this is exactly what is going to happen.<p>There&#x27;s no substitute for in-person education. For years, I heard from the online education cheerleaders that online can be better. Online can be a quality experience, but you can&#x27;t build the same relationships, develop the same comfort with asking questions, or deliver the same set of intangibles in an online setting.<p>That said, I think hybrid classes are probably better. Some material is better taught in an async fashion. The big limitation of in-person education is that you have no choice but to schedule a fixed block of time for meetings. The flexibility of async means students can go through certain types of material at the right pace for themselves.<p>&gt; it seems that startups like edX, Coursera, etc. have not really been successes<p>These options aren&#x27;t university classes. They&#x27;re the next generation of textbooks.')
