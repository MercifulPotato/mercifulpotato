I have tried keeping note files on my computer, and I&#x27;ve tried using tablets to jot things down (I have spent so much money trying to get this option to work).  Paper just works better.  I found that I like to scribble and underline, and draw.  I&#x27;m just not an organized thinker.  Forcing things to be in a list don&#x27;t work for my thoughts and even drawing on an iPad etc. seems too constricting.  The precision of paper just isn&#x27;t there.')
