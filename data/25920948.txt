It was not uncommon for them to be applied manually (and sometimes faultily). Sometimes you would mail patches to maintainers directly, other times you would share them on mailing lists, where they would undergo a bit of &quot;social review&quot; (works for me!) and would or would not be applied.<p>Some people just mailed entire modified files and expected maintainers to figure out the changes on their own.<p>As for &quot;committed&quot;, many maintainers may not even have used source code control (notably Linus didn&#x27;t use any), and I can&#x27;t recall a single project with publicly accessible repositories in the 1990s as opposed to tarball releases.<p>&gt; All you needed was a text editor and an email account. Now you need accounts on whatever code forge is involved [...]<p>Getting an account on any of these code forges in 2020 is almost certainly much easier than getting an e-mail account at all in the early 1990s for many people.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the author that contributing was easier in the 1990s. Generally, it involved a bit of a social process, trivial drive by fixes were not any more popular than today, there were coding standards to be observed (and not always written ones), in larger projects, you could expect to navigate some flame wars, and sometimes your contributions were rejected anyway because RMS decided to cancel your OS.')
