Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[25821812], score=None, time=1610977862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821677, text='&gt; Depends on interpretation of\n&gt;&gt; an unauthorised, non-employee individual was allegedly living within a secure part of the O&#x27;Hare airport terminal<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t depend on intepretation. There is absolutely no way you could interpret that sentence as meaning &quot;he used a stolen badge to get into areas not open to the public&quot;. He may or may not have accessed additional areas, but the article certainly does not claim he did. We know he accessed the &quot;secure&quot; arrivals area, and the article strongly hints that that&#x27;s where he lived. Whether he also accessed other areas is possible, but it&#x27;s not claimed in the article.')
