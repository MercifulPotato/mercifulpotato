The things you&#x27;ve listed seem pretty trivial to be honest, and I imagine any man shorter than 5&#x27;9&quot; would trade positions with you in an instant. It&#x27;s like listing the bad parts of having more money, sure nothing is ever 100% positive but when it&#x27;s 99% positive, it&#x27;s not always worth mentioning the negative 1%.')
