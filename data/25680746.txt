Item(by='SAI_Peregrinus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610072989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680621, text='Puzzle and &quot;classical&quot; cryptography, as opposed to modern (post Claude Shannon&#x27;s &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;[1] paper from 1949) cryptography. From the table of contents no modern cryptosystems are even mentioned. That said, I&#x27;d expect it&#x27;s a good book for people with an interest in historical cryptography and cryptogram puzzles. Most modern cryptography texts will mention the sorts of things in this book&#x27;s contents in passing, but not really describe the techniques or provide exercises.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;netlab.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;files&#x2F;shannon1949.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;netlab.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;files&#x2F;shannon1949.pdf</a>')
