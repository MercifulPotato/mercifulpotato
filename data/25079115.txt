It&#x27;s up to you where you are in your life.<p>Clearly people say things like a &quot;head on a pike&quot; or &quot;rape and pillage&quot; in regular speech. &quot;Head on a pike&quot; is a well know idiom.<p>They are clearly different to saying &quot;I want to behead someone&quot;, &quot;I want to rape someone&quot;<p>They changed the quote from a well know idiom.
