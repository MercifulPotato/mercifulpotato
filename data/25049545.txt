All titles on Steam when played with Proton are registered as being played on Linux, not just the ones available officially, and if you do this with something you just purchased it will show up in Steam&#x27;s statistics as a Linux sale.<p>This lets the publishers and developers know that there&#x27;s a market of Linux gamers because they can see that <i>X</i> thousand players play their game on Linux. So when they make their next game, hopefully they&#x27;ll pick technologies that lets them release with proper Linux support and not &quot;hope it runs under Proton&quot;-support.')
