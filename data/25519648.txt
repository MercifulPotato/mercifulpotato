The revenue doesn&#x27;t come from hidden fees to the users. It comes from third-party liquidity providers. They do so because liquidity providers overwhelmingly prefer to interact with retail order flow over the undifferentiated toxic flow in public exchanges.<p>The best analogy is how Miami club promoters will get pretty girls free entry and drinks. The pretty girls aren&#x27;t paying any sort of hidden fees, and in fact are getting a better deal than they would with general admission. Rather it&#x27;s the venues that paying the fees, because they overwhelmingly prefer patrons who are pretty girls compared to the average person who shows up at the door.')
