Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=[25638457], score=None, time=1609792611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637328, text='That should be pretty obvious to you.<p>Someone you hire to redo your kitchen isn&#x27;t employed by you, they&#x27;re employed by their employer, where everything we talked about makes sense. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a distinction between an employer-employee relationship and a contracting relationship.<p>They of course get a say in how your kitchen is done: if it&#x27;s not up to code, or dangerous, they absolutely have a say. And frequently. When I redid my kitchen my GC pointed out all these things to me and modified I my plans.<p>&gt; If you work for a company and you feel they are making bad decisions and perhaps your job is in peril (because the company may go down), it is high time to look for a new job.<p>You&#x27;re re-stating how it is today, but there&#x27;s no reason it need to be this way, and it fails to meet the fiduciary duty to the company and its shareholders.<p>&gt; And again, who then decides what is or is not a bad decision? Courts will get to decide on economic decisions. But lawyers have studied law, not economics. How does that make sense?<p>You don&#x27;t need a law degree to know harassment is wrong. In fact mandatory training is part of your, wait for it, fiduciary duty. You don&#x27;t need a degree to recognize bad management.')
