I desperately need some bumps on the current keyboard and thought of messing with glue and plastic, but it hasn&#x27;t occurred to me that someone already made a finished solution for that. From searching, I now see a bunch of related stuff, like braille and such, so it would help to narrow it down to more suitable products.')
