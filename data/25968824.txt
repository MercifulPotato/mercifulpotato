Rent is 200-250 EUR&#x2F; pm &amp; young people generally speak English. Additionally, it is quite a calm place with little to no crime. There are no cons to me at least because during this pandemic I cannot meet other people anyway even if I was in The Netherlands where I lived. Burgas is a cheap destination with a lot of great natural and community sights and experiences to be seen. Highly recommend it.')
