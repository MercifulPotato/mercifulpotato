I went once and we were literally served it for every meal except breakfast. We visited a lot of different places and our hosts were always very proud of their particular method for making it and keen to show off their skills, but they didn&#x27;t realise the last people we had been to see had the same idea. Its delicious, but it became a bit of a running joke the fourth or fifth time we had it! I really liked the Basque country, great cities and beautiful landscape.')
