Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609011889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544796, text='1) I feel like this should be obvious, but somehow you didn&#x27;t do it: you have to compare Domino&#x27;s with other pizza places--almost all of which have always had internal delivery service--not an external hack like DoorDash.<p>2) Domino&#x27;s was always great at delivery, and was always better than all other options (even for pizza). That they bothered to make a slightly better iPhone app than everyone else doesn&#x27;t somehow affect this: you have to look only at strategy <i>changes</i>. Even the article gets this correct, by stating multiple times that Domino&#x27;s has always been optimized as a pizza delivery company.<p>&gt; The most impressive part about Dominoâ€™s growth from 1960 to the early 2000s is that they became one of the biggest pizza delivery chains in the world with some of the worst pizza in the world.')
