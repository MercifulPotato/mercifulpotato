You made a device, then you sold it. You shouldn&#x27;t get to control it after sale because you no longer own it. Plain and simple.<p>Apple didn&#x27;t just &quot;make a device&quot; though. They don&#x27;t make just hardware - they make software w&#x2F; hardware. The product is the whole experience. Expecting them to change how they design their product for the masses (that LOVE THEM), because you can&#x27;t do exactly what you want, is wrong.<p>&gt; I bought it, it&#x27;s mine now, I&#x27;m on my own, and please don&#x27;t get in my way of modifying the thing I bought because I have the right to do so.<p>YOU CAN do what you want with it. If you were perhaps smarter, you could hack into it and make it do whatever you want. You can throw it right off a bridge if you want! Congratulations. But Apple IN NO WAY is required to make it EASIER for you to throw it off a bridge. Sorry.')
