Just the fact that not only it&#x27;s independently readable, but also you can find out about corruption of it matters to you for forensic purposes raised.<p>Journalctl does provide at least one significant feature though - on a properly configured system &quot;journalctl -u foobar&quot; gives you the logs of foobar.
