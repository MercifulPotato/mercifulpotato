If I&#x27;m expecting a location I could take a string (&quot;Baghdad&quot;), lat long pairs, an enum, etc. With a union type I can specify that it could be any of these but they fill the same purpose. In Java I&#x27;d either do method overloading or expect to receive an object that implements a method that would give the location in a common format. The wrong way to do it would be to have a function that has both a lat&#x2F;long input and a string input and just say that they&#x27;re nullable and we only expect to get one of them.')
