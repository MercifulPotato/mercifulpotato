But, if you don&#x27;t mod or submit content then you might not notice those improvements.<p>That said, like digg, the redesign is also missing a lot of features that old.reddit has. So, if they don&#x27;t want to digg v4 themselves (which is what made Reddit popular to begin with) then they have to at least keep old.reddit around until there is feature parity.<p>They will definitely shed a lot of users when they drop old.reddit but anyone who uses particular subreddits for their hobbies and interests may bite the bullet and get used to the redesign if they like the community enough. Hopefully Reddit Enhancement Suite makes a lot of improvements when that happens because RES makes reddit so much better.')
