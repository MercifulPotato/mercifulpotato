Continue verification until confidence in the system reaches acceptable levels.<p>The voting machines that I&#x27;ve used recently are systems that automatically count paper ballots as they are submitted.  There&#x27;s a clear chain of custody with these, and these results have a 100% audit trail.  Not only that, but these systems work in tandem to identify errors in either system.<p>The likelihood of discovering some injected irregularity is pretty high.  Especially since we have systems in place for automatic hand-recounts in tight races.  So if the system were going to nefariously alter the election outcome, it would have to be done at such a magnitude as to exceed the threshold for automatic hand-recounts, but be small enough to not be discovered.  Plus, candidates can request a manual recount, further increasing the reliability of the system.<p>As with all systems where reliability is paramount: it&#x27;s important to lean on redundancy in the system, rather than try to make a single component as reliable as possible.')
