Item(by='phil21', descendants=None, kids=[25599133], score=None, time=1609444975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593698, text='&gt; Somehow between WW2 and here, we completely lost the idea of Duty as a personal responsibility.<p>We stopped demanding and respecting it as a society.  Started to look at those adhering to such things as stupid and old fashioned, while seeing those who gamed the system as smart and clever.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to describe this for quite some time now.  I watched the below scenario with my own two eyes happen to two &quot;friends&quot; in about 2001.<p>Just look at two defendants arrested and in court for a misdemeanor bar fight.  One defendant lowers his head, apologizes, pleads guilty, gets time served, anger management, and a permanent violent assault record.  The other defendant lawyers up, refuses to take any responsibility, and gets away with community service with no admission of guilt.<p>The first guy just had his (professional) life ended before it even really began.  The second guy got a slap on the wrist.  The second guy will be seen as smart and savvy, and the first guy will get made fun of for being a stupid idealist.<p>Society has taught me that owning up to one&#x27;s mistakes - and by extension sacrificing to do one&#x27;s duty - isn&#x27;t even respected these days, it&#x27;s actively derided.')
