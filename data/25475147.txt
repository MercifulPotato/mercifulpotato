But I’m more inclined to try out a factory style interface (outer function initializes hooks and returns a function component that accepts the props for the base component plus state from the hooks).<p>I think it would fit more my preferred style as well as the kind of interface that people find attractive in hooks. It would work well with generics in TypeScript. And it wouldn’t be as fussy about the weird implicit behavior of component naming that came with wrapped&#x2F;generated classes and decorators in past experiments with composition in past React fads.')
