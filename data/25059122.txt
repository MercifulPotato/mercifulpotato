What you see and hear directly from other people is already a filtered view. The ads that lead to bad products never influence you nor do they take your attention. Some stuff passes through but with some common sense it could all be avoided.<p>I share the sentiment of the OP; i am shielded from ads and even if they come through some way or another itâ€™d influence me personally very little: i rarely buy stuff and when I do I research extensively. Some brands that are overly advertised are also a red flag to me.<p>But, I am aware I am in minority here. And those like us have a negligent impact at best. I think advertising does heavily influence the masses.')
