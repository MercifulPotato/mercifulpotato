And you certainly didn&#x27;t do that. You took a circuitous rhetorical tack that only hinted at arguments without making them. Other commenters did a fine job covering that. But you certainly felt comfortable declaring things to be &quot;bad arguments&quot; without having made any yourself yet.<p>So let me make some arguments for you to consider.<p>-To declare that certain people (on the basis of their minority status) have inherently privileged knowledge of boundary-less, undefined, fuzzy social dynamics is a divisive assertion. It seeks to divide authority along identity lines.<p>-To advocate that certain people (on the basis of their minority status) should actively be given privileged decision-making status over collective processes or structures is a divisive and dogmatic advocacy. It seeks to divide power along identity lines.<p>-To denounce as ethically compromised the people who disagree with you on complex open topics, such as the above two notions, is outright dogmatic. To assume one&#x27;s perspective is so undeniably true that discussion can only be aggression is a dogmatic position.<p>I contend that all three of these dynamics are rampant in the preferred methods and among the prominent leadership of the currently en vogue Racial Justice and DEI movements (lots of crossover).<p>To tie it back to the start: I&#x27;ve observed Timnit engaging in these things, fanning these flames and boosting others who do so too.<p>But note that my comment implies there are <i>other</i> ways to advocate for diversity and justice. The broad BLM&#x2F;Kendi&#x2F;DiAngelo&#x2F;Gebru style is not the only form and theory of diversity advocacy.<p>A simple alternative, for example, would be to call attention to the same problems without 1) preemptively attacking other people based on their own immutable identity characteristics, and 2) trying to draw new lines and hierarchies of privileged voice and power.<p>Lots of people (I suspect the majority of the sympathetic) practice this alternative. However, the louder, Timnit-aligned strain seems to enjoying social privilege in this area at this moment. How ironic.')
