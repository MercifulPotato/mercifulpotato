Former and latter and their overuse is one of my pet peeves. Especially when used for merely sounding precocious in long winded statements. :p<p>As far as &quot;Scientism&quot; being a thing, I appreciate where the author is comming from, but for every bit of science telling us something there is another piece saying the opposite.<p>I suppose You could say the propagandization of science = &quot;Scientism&quot;, I think of how effectively big tobacco made use of this technique.<p>It does concern me however just how many people will blindly follow and agree with someone in a lab coat that is holding a clipboard with authority. It is almost as concerning as how many people believe the prophecies being spouted by YouTube preppers lately. I mean just because they didn&#x27;t ru n out of toilet paper a few months back, now were supposed to listen to them about effective disease treatments rather than the people who actually hold degrees and doctorates on the subject?<p>IMHO (or not so humble) Far too many people conflate their google searches with a four year or more post secondary education where people actually learn how to use the scientific method.')
