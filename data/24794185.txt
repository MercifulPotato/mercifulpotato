People who preferred remote work had very little choice in the matter. Our society assumes that commuting to work and sitting in a cubicle (or worse) is fitting for 99% of the work force.<p>So what I mainly see here aren&#x27;t the comments you cite, but a &quot;ugh but I <i>like</i> the office&quot;, which gets very little sympathy from me in a society where, virus aside, the majority of jobs are office-only. Like, the world is already tipped in your favor.<p>To put it into perspective, I was so desperate for a fully remote job that I took a $50,000 salary for it when I was making $130,000 in Austin, Texas. Now I live in South America on a beach doing exactly what I want to be doing.<p>I don&#x27;t like the optics of calling Covid a &quot;good thing&quot;, but it must be pointed out that it got offices (like my former job) that were adamantly ass-in-seat only to go remote-only. It spurred fundamental (hopefully lasting) shifts in our work culture. And a lot of them were a long time in the making and waiting. How many of these companies that were firmly ass-in-seat are now fully or mostly remote realizing that the sky isn&#x27;t falling? I hope we reach a better equilibrium.<p>Ideally our employment options would have something for everyone without you needing to go for a $50k job to get what you want. Another culture change I&#x27;d like is for WFH options to come with a signing bonus to get your home office sorted out, something that&#x27;s sorely lacking.')
