It&#x27;s cheaper to build in a 32.768kHz crystal for timekeeping than try to access the grid frequency from the isolated low-voltage circuit.<p>IIRC, the grid frequency is usually more accurate.  Probably because it&#x27;s carefully monitored and managed by the power authorities like the OP describes.  If you build a clock with its own frequency reference, than any error will accumulate and have to be monitored and managed by the user.')
