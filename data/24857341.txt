Item(by='magicalhippo', descendants=None, kids=[24858024], score=None, time=1603370299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855350, text='&gt; the Epstein drive might as well be magic<p>For me, good sci-fi does just that, ie limit the magic to one thing or technology, and use that to explore something interesting.<p>Same with Altered Carbon. What would happen to society if we could swap bodies but keep our minds? That one piece of technology (&quot;the stack&quot;) is magic, but from it follows lots of interesting exploration of the possible impacts on society etc.<p>What I hate is when they try to explain the magic. Don&#x27;t do that. It never works. Just assume it&#x27;s there, someone discovered it, invented it whatever.')
