I would direct this scrutiny towards the health authority and the political administration.<p>Anyway:<p>&gt; I guess it all depends on your definition of &quot;collapse&quot;. I would describe a situation where hospitals are overloaded to the point where they have to choose who gets to live and who has to die a collapse.<p>Triaging patients and prioritizing them is every day in a hospital, corona or not.\nIf you talk with a Swedish doctor (I do, because that&#x27;s the health service I use), they often think in terms of which medicines are cost-effective and for which group of patients they should be used (basically - what is the human basis for using this expensive medication on this particular patient). To make it concrete, maybe they will even tell you that you are a &quot;priority&quot; because you have a long working life ahead of you.<p>Medicine and care can be infinitely expensive and public health care is a finite resource. They always calibrate towards giving patients adequate care, not infinite care.')
