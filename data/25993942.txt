The biggest are tropism and release.<p>Statistically, because of the addictive effects of untreated ADHD, the likelihood of substance addiction with or without amphetamine treatment is almost equal. There is of course a risk of getting addicted to Adderall, but amphetamines with long releases are not very addictive as far as drugs go and the risk of getting addicted to other things is drastically reduced.<p>Methamphetamine as used illegally is a lot more addictive than Adderall because it is generally consumed in ways that lead to much more immediate effects and not orally, and even when orally it is generally formulated to be released more quickly. More rapid effects seriously increase addiction potential.<p>The doses are also much smaller for Adderall than meth in 99% of cases.<p>Because of these factors, methamphetamine is much more addictive than pharmaceutical amphetamine salts.')
