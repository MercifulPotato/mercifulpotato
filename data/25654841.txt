Let me know when there&#x27;s more then extremely minimal evidence of reinfection. We are at the point now where we are coming up on a year of significant spread and it&#x27;s still missing. Additionally, have we ever seen an mRNA vaccine for a coronavirus? Nope. Evidence here is at best uncertain.<p>&gt; We don’t have the capacity to make enough vaccines for global herd immunity in under a year. Which is why reduced long term efficiency is a significant concern over a faster rollout schedule.<p>Would we have enough if we split doses? Why does the US need global herd immunity?')
