I&#x27;ve got bonded VDSL2 at a combined 80 Mbps&#x2F;10 Mbps. That&#x27;s good enough for most things, although it&#x27;s tier limited (my lines could do more, but the sync rate is capped), and I&#x27;d love more upstream, and a bunch of other stuff... But it&#x27;s not bad enough for me to foot the bill to get muni fiber extended to my house (and then tear up my driveway to get it to the house).')
