You have to remember than those &quot;big&quot; decoders can be scaled down to a few thousand transistors as is seen on something like the 486 if you willing to pay the performance penalty.<p>The entire 486 was something like 1M transistors (including cache&#x2F;mmu&#x2F;fpu&#x2F;etc&#x2F;etc). Which makes it smaller than pretty much every modern design that can run a full blown OS like linux.<p>When you look at things like a modern x86 with dual 512bit vector units, what you see are things consuming power that frequently don&#x27;t exist on the smaller designs (like that vector unit, a modern arm might have a dual issue 128 bit NEON unit).<p>Here is a cute graphic\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Moore%27s_Law_Transistor_Count_1971-2018.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Moore%27s_Law_Transistor_...</a>')
