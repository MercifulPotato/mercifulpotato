I think one thing I&#x27;m wondering is who do you see as your target market? I am a python dev with background in web and such, but I&#x27;m not really understanding the problem you&#x27;re solving from your website. Also, the first step of 3 simple steps is something something MX record. Again maybe I&#x27;m not your target market but I don&#x27;t really now what that means. I know it&#x27;s some email DNS thing, but beyond that I find it fairly convoluted and as a result I still don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re selling. Please don&#x27;t take this personally, and thank you for posting, this truly is wonderful to see the things you are working on.')
