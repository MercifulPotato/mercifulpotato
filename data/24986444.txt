That’s when I asked myself the question above.<p>I learned React&#x2F;Electron and built a solution named Label LIVE. Check it out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;label.live" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;label.live</a>.<p>This side-hustle has been a HUGE challenge and helps augment my consulting income.<p>Do you have to print Avery sheets with dynamic data? Don’t want to mail merge? Copy&#x2F;paste got you down? Want to use your Zebra printer on a Mac? These simple things were incredibly difficult a few years ago...<p>My app has tons of fun features powered by the JavaScript ecosystem: USB, Fonts, Barcodes, Excel&#x2F;CSV integration, dithering via WASM, PDF generation,  etc.<p>It may not be the most memory efficient app, but it lets you get your printing done so you can focus on something else.<p>Label printing was a dumpster fire. Users expect a high-stress stinky mess. If I can make it 50% better I’ve succeeded in my goal. There’s still a ton of work to do... I just need to make time for it.<p>p.s.
