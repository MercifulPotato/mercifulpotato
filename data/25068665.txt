If the content creator has limited disk space (and many people do not have the money to keep buying external disks), it&#x27;s not hard to imagine the original copy being removed to free enough space to create more content. Also, even if it was not deleted on purpose, there&#x27;s a higher chance of the original copy of older videos getting lost (for instance, if it was stored in an external disk which was lost in a flood).<p>And there are also the videos where the &quot;original copy&quot; was on YouTube itself: unless you have a setup to also record locally (or mirror to another site like twitch), streaming videos are only recorded on YouTube.')
