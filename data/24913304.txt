But I can tell you that the only point of contention that the people also care about is security. The middle-east is a warzone, and people rightly think they need some defenses. The regime goes about this with their (effective) tactics of starting&#x2F;funding foreign terrorist&#x2F;militia organizations, and their ballistic and nuclear programs. If the Western block could somehow satisfy this need for security, the regime’s bad actions will become a lot more unpopular. (Of course, the Western bloc can’t do that because they can’t promise anything durable. They also abandoned the Shah, which doesn’t set a reassuring precedent.)<p>3) Yes.
