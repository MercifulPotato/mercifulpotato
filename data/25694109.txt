I hate how people on HN is praising this. There are literally few alternatives for the average person apart from Google and eyeProducts. I have a PinePhone, but what percentage of America can truly put in the effort to use one? &lt;1%.<p>If you cannot install an run your own software on a device, you do not own the device.<p>You cannot praise the removal of Gab or Parlor now and complain later when they take everything else from you. They can increase the Apple developer fees whenever they want. What happens when they start charging you $2,000 a year or $4,000 a year for the right to publish apps? What happens when the two big platforms decide no one can push an app unless their platform has full moderation.<p>What happens when Google and Apple, for your safety, say all user contributed content must go through their &quot;spam&quot; filter first for any apps?<p>This is horrific. You may not like Parlor, but it will not stop here. This is a dangerous place we are in and we should all be horrified by it. People are horrified right now, but they&#x27;re focused on the wrong thing.')
