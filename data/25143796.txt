Currently I&#x27;ve transitioned back to Emacs for most of my day-to-day coding, since LSP provides good enough completion, navigation, and static analysis, and DAP provides good enough debugging and test running.  The rest of your list are non-issues for me, e.g. every editor I know of has good source control tools, and most profiling I do is not in an IDE, it&#x27;s using special-purpose profiling tools.<p>LSP and DAP are open protocols supported by most editors and IDEs.  I have a hard time believing that language implementers won&#x27;t prioritize their implementation over IntelliJ.  Which is a good thing, our development stacks should be open and free.')
