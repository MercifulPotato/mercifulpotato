That was paid for on the backs of the people. Funny how short his memory is....he doesn&#x27;t want to pay a large tax bill for the success that he has had (hence selling all property in CA).</i><p>Genuine question, not trying to be snarky.<p>I grew up in Australia, which educated, housed and fed me very well, and turned me into a successful Engineer. I decided I wanted to live in the snowy mountains of Canada, so I moved here.<p>At what point is a person like myself (or Musk) free to move wherever they want? How long to I owe an obligation to Australia for what they helped me with?<p>Clearly what myself and Elon are doing is perfectly legal, so it sounds like you have a moral objection to what we&#x27;re doing. Do you think morally everyone should stay in the same district they were born, paying off their &quot;debt&quot; from being raised?<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re trying to say here.')
