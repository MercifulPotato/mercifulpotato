The latter in my opinion is the great poison of modern philosophy. It seems to be that it is often used as a way to excuse lazy reasoning and irrational behaviour. Better to pretend that truth can&#x27;t be known, than earnestly seek it out, etc. The irony of course, is that people who don&#x27;t think truth can be known, often act with a great deal of certainty about things they believe to be right.')
