I&#x27;m a scientist, i spend all day looking at and parsing data in a zillion formats. Not to mention writing papers in latex. My productivity directly depends on my ability to ingest and make sense of text files and code and every day is different. A more efficient shell... or more importantly a shell that frees up brain space for other tasks... makes a huge difference.<p>I often work with colleagues who ask how j get results so fast. They&#x27;re very surprised when I say &quot;remote emacs and a solid foundation with shell workflows&quot;.<p>When everything you work with is a text file, getting efficient with the shell just makes sense.
