Intel single Q4 is double the revenue of AMD FY 2020.<p>2. On Consumer they have their Laptop APU launch along with decent GPU lineup against Nvidia. But this translate to 20% YoY. Compared to Intel 10%+ YoY. Remember AMD&#x27;s baseline is a lot smaller. 10% growth from AMD and 10% from Intel is quite a bit different.<p>3. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom looks good on paper with YoY. But reality is that PS5 and Xbox contributed more. Which means Server Sales still isn&#x27;t anywhere good enough. Intel has been defending their territory exceptionally well, as shown with their latest report with large decrease of ASP.<p>This isn&#x27;t just some supply constrain. It is also AMD needs to do better forecasting. Although arguably AMD is conservative in nature due to not so long ago they were on the verge of bankruptcy.<p>What is <i>exceptionally</i> good though was their profitability. Even excluding the one off Tax benefits. Their Net Income in 2020 increased by <i>5X</i>!<p>Edit: Just checked in 2019 they were paying down their debt, which was partly why their net income were low. So 2020 is a true reflection of their profitability. All of a sudden their stock price doesn&#x27;t look so insanely high.')
