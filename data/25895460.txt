This might not be something you always care about, but I think in general it leads to better products, since all that input can be very valuable. I would say by the time you have 30 employees you have had a lot of opportunities to not hire an echochamber. Of course you’ll get some diversity just by hiring different roles. Even just having senior and junior devs rubbing elbows is a good start for diversity, and even if it doesn’t make your product better, you’ll find the two groups have different tasks that are morale tarpits, and you’ll tend to have a happier team.')
