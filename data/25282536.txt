The compromise they came up with was to lock on it for a few decades absolutely <i>plus</i> give enormous power advantages to the people that economically depended on it to protect it going forward; there might have been some who hoped, or at least expected, it would be phased out over time after the lock in period, but for the most part even they would have been hoping future generations might overcome the barriers they set up that made they difficult, it&#x27;s not like they built any foundation for it.')
