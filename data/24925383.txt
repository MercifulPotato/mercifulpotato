Wayland exists <i>precisely</i> because things should easily mix and match - it should be easy to get your apps displaying&#x2F;moving on any standard compositor. The same would go for other Freedesktop standards to do things like input, clipboard interaction, and screen recording.<p>The only difference is that all these things currently used to exist within the X.org project, and now they&#x27;re in various other places (some parts in fact don&#x27;t exist at all...). There&#x27;s nothing stopping people from abstracting a lot of this functionality out in a library for others to more easily build their own stuff with it [1]!<p>If anything the efforts replacing X11 will make it <i>easier</i> to mix and match components, because it gets rid of the focus on the singular X.org implementation. Not saying multiple implementations of the same thing is necessarily a <i>good thing</i> mind you, but you can&#x27;t accuse these efforts of making it more difficult to mix and match.<p>[1]: e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;wlroots" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;wlroots</a> does some of this to make it more easy to build a window manager that supports Wayland')
