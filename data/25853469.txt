Do you argue that if we had to choose just one of these expressions, 0 &lt;= x &lt; 10 would have more utility? I don&#x27;t know how to evaluate this conjecture, but suppose it&#x27;s right.\nWhy would you need to limit yourself to just one, though?\nWhy not to use one that is most suitable to the problem you are dealing with?')
