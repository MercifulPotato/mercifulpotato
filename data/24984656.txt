Since swap attacks are not possible with it, as customers support agents aren&#x27;t able to do sim swaps.<p>Are you sure that this is the case? According to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;fi&#x2F;thread&#x2F;761170" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;fi&#x2F;thread&#x2F;761170</a> there was at least one case where support agents moved a Fi number from a locked account to a newly reopened account, without the user being able to access the locked account:<p>&gt; I call Google Support and the amazing Google Support rep I spoke to (The only good one Iâ€™ve talked to so far during this whole process) stayed with me for over an hour and worked with tier 2 support in getting my Project Fi number transferred to Account 2.<p>A SIM swap with Fi might be harder to accomplish than with a regular provider, but it looks like there&#x27;s still the risk that someone manages to convince a support agent to move the number to a different account.')
