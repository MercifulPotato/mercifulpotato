This opens a view of only that comment and replies to it. If you have enough reputation&#x2F;points&#x2F;karma, you can now see a flag link on top of the comment. If you click flag it ends up in a moderation queue. If multiple users click flag it might bypass the moderation queue and become flagged immediately without further intervention from mods.')
