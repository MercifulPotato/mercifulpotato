They classify ultra-processed foods as a step beyond what we typically think of as processed foods:<p>&gt; Ultra-processed foods and beverages can be defined as products with additives and industrially processed ingredients that have been technologically broken down and modified. They are not merely processed foods with high levels of sugar, salt, and fat but also contain ingredients and additives not commonly used in home kitchens and artisanal restaurants<p>I wish we put more emphasis on educating young people about basic cooking and nutrition. There&#x27;s a common misconception that people reach for ultra-processed foods because they&#x27;re cheaper, but in my experience most people prefer these foods because they think it&#x27;s more convenient.<p>For many people, the idea of cooking a meal has been elevated to a special occasion event, as a treat or a date night. This is partially due to the fact that boring, everyday meal recipes just aren&#x27;t as flashy as a 15-ingredient, hour long recipe that results in a stunning picture for someone&#x27;s blog or instagram. Everyone should learn how to cook some boring, staple meals using basic ingredients from the store. It&#x27;s amazing how many people don&#x27;t know how easy and cheap it can be to prepare simple crock pot or stir-fry meals that are healthy and delicious.')
