I guess the reason I find it hard to visualize is that we ordinarily think that &#x27;vacuum sucks&quot;.  If there is container which has been pumped empty of air and we make a hole in it it sucks in air. So it looks like empty&#x2F;vacuum space &quot;sucks&quot; anything around in it.<p>But that is obviously a misconception. Vacuum is not attracting anything, it is the fast moving molecules around it that PUSH themselves into the vacuum if we make a whole in the container.<p>What makes it hard to visualize is that we don&#x27;t see the fast-moving molecules ever, which are forcing themselves into the container through the pierced hole by the power of their own (tiny) momentum yet very fast speed.  :-)<p>It is also counter-intuitive that tiny things could have fast speeds, perhaps because we think in terms of a person being able to walk much faster than say an ant.')
