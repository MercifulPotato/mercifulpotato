I had an XT with a monochrome Hercules monitor, while in the factory where my father used to work there was a full blown 486SX. Envious of the plethora of the available fonts, I magnified the letters of the System [0] font with Paint, transferred them to a graph paper and took them home. Then for each character I wrote a separate (Turbo)Basic subroutine which would draw it in graphical mode exactly as it was on the paper. Finally I assembled these routines into an elementary editor. Nostalgia, yeah.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;System_(typeface)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;System_(typeface)</a>')
