I spent several days searching for screen recorder extensions and trying them out one by one. It was helpful to understand all the features Screenity needed, not just based on what was available in the extensions, but also from what people complained about in the reviews. On top of that I also tried some desktop screen recorders to add unique features such as push to talk or individual audio controls while recording (system&#x2F;microphone) which aren&#x27;t a thing in any other Chrome Extension.')
