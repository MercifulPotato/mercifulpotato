They don&#x27;t switch &#x27;players&#x27; if I&#x27;m actively listening to something, but if I&#x27;m not, whatever &#x27;boots&#x27; last is the one who gets to become my Airpod&#x27;s player.<p>The fact that we have different experiences tends me to think it&#x27;s a higher layer that&#x27;s doing the &#x27;auto switching&#x27; and someone made too simplistic of an auto-switcher?')
