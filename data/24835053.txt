The result is the GDPR modals keep popping up because the modals can&#x27;t set cookies to remember whether or not I accepted.<p>So the only thing I can do is inject JS&#x2F;CSS to block them.<p>(Also by de-modalizing it and hiding it, I never actually need to accept anything, and nobody gets my permission to track, hee hee.)')
