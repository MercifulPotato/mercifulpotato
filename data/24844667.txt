Item(by='remarkEon', descendants=None, kids=[24844687], score=None, time=1603253424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24835134, text='&gt;&quot;We make sandwiches, taking a side on segregation is beyond the scope of our mission&quot;.<p>Idk, &quot;we make [my edit: great] sandwiches&quot;, which sounds like a great mission, seems very much entwined with who gets to eat said sandwiches - especially if they&#x27;re delicious. Since if you are denying certain classes the right to enjoy your awesome sandwiches, your sandwiches probably aren&#x27;t that great to begin with.<p>If I steel man your argument about having segregated counter space - that they&#x27;d excuse the segregation because if everyone has separate counter space to eat the sandwich the underlying differences don&#x27;t matter -, what I&#x27;m left thinking about is that, well, the experience of having a great sandwich also has to do with the environment in which you eat it. Who wants to eat a delicious sandwich when you have to sit at a crappy table, with crappy chairs and bad service? No one, that&#x27;s who.<p>And then we&#x27;re back to my original point about artificially constraining the market for awesome sandwiches.')
