Self report? Assigned by the government based on your parents? DNA test?<p>Who will you give this data to?<p>What will you do with the conclusions? Say for Covid-19, will you make rules stricter for some ethnicities? Or prioritize them for vaccines?<p>How do you even know how correct this data is? There&#x27;s a big correlation between ethnicities, wealth and social customs. Or do you want to give the researchers also information about that?<p>For me all the answers on those questions are negative. I see no way to do this in an ethical way.<p>We already know there are issues with equality, employment etc of some ethnicities, I think collecting statistics on it will only make the racists in our society believe stronger in their views. I don&#x27;t believe we can stop racism by introducing more (positive) racism.')
