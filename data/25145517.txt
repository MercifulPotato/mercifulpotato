Item(by='creata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605752690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144910, text='&gt; When people talk about it, it always sounds like a simple generalization of exterior algebra. And so it is.<p>Sure, both are quotients of tensor algebras, but if anything, it&#x27;s the other way around. Geometric algebra is to exterior algebra as inner product spaces are to vector spaces, or as Riemannian manifolds are to smooth manifolds. I&#x27;d say that vector spaces are more general than inner product spaces.<p>&gt; Why start calling things 2-vectors, when you could call them 2-forms and people would know what you were talking about?<p>Because they&#x27;re trying to appeal to the kind of physicist that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> know what a 2-form is.<p>&gt; But how do you take the inner product aÂ·i of a vector and a 2-form?<p>Yeah, this isn&#x27;t great, since there are <i>way</i> too many notions of &quot;inner product&quot; in geometric algebra (see The Inner Products of Geometric Algebra: 10.1007&#x2F;978-1-4612-0089-5_2). But I guess the intent is clear enough.')
