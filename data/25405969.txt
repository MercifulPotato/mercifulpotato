It just works, and i never have to worry about shady apps or wonder too much about the quality of the apps that i download - theres always some lesser than others, but on the whole its all good.<p>Arguing for other app stores &#x2F; unsigned apps on the iOS platform is counter intuitive to what made the ecosystem great in the first place.<p>I had android phones and did all the custom stuff &amp; rooting from the G1 and forwards for many years, in the end i only regret not changing over sooner.<p>There is nothing great about the &quot;freedom of choice&quot; on the android platform, it all makes for a lesser experience unless you&#x27;re really into it for other reasons - political&#x2F;principle.')
