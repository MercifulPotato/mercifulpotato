The word &#x27;exodus&#x27; seems to be doing a lot of heavy lifting.<p>The bigger &#x27;exodus&#x27; might be the glut of folks who temporarily moved away from the Bay Area at the start of the pandemic and have made those moves permanent. I don&#x27;t have hard data to back up whether that would qualify as an exodus (and not sure what number is required for that classification either - just that it&#x27;s greater than three), other than anecdotal evidence and personally knowing a few folks who moved back to their hometowns permanently from that area.')
