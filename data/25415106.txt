Much like the other concepts you are arguing here, starting with misunderstanding the simple concepts laid out in the first line of the study. The more things you expect to have presented for you <i>during</i> the conversation, the more likely it is you shouldn&#x27;t actually be in it.<p>You expect to throw the proverbial stone in the lake and everyone else to jump in and give you decades worth of education all neatly packed in a comment. Well you just got the conclusion from multiple users. Flailing about that we didn&#x27;t support our opinion like it was a PhD thesis while you yourself just throw some inflammatory opinions with no qualified support inside or outside of this forum, and worse you remove text after posting, just confirms that you&#x27;re not only unqualified for the discussion but are very likely carrying it in bad faith.')
