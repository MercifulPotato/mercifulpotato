I wanted to be somewhere else so bad.<p>But instead of option 2 (&quot;Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up&quot;), I chose option 3 (&quot;Stick it out for at least a year&quot;) for these reasons:<p>- With only €800 saved up (had just invested €5,000 in a fishing business that had failed) at the moment I realized it wasn&#x27;t a good fit I couldn&#x27;t afford even a month of bills.<p>- It would look bad on the resume, and might have to justify it to next prospective employers.<p>Also due to unfortunate circumstances, my life was administratively a mess: there was a massive 6-month delay in the delivery of new residence permits. And by the time my papers got processed, social security information was no longer up-to-date (only valid for 3 months), causing an additional nerve-wracking 5-month delay. As a consequence I couldn&#x27;t quit or even get fired as, in addition to the mess above, I would have to update employment information (and get possibly another 5-month delay). After my annual review with my boss and a PIP, my salary got cut 10% (had no choice)<p>The happy ending? When I finally managed to get my residence permit and successfully updated my social security information 18 months after I joined the company. I looked for and found a new job, handed in my resignation and joined the other company.')
