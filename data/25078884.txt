Deployment of charging infrastructure is going to be trivial, especially in parking lots with existing light poles.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there won&#x27;t be growing pains, but we will deploy. Over the course of 2015 I went from always being able to find a charger to not being able to ever find one, and then since 2017 I haven&#x27;t had a single problem because more chargers were added. For a couple years, I lived in an apartment where the landlord was a dock and wouldn&#x27;t let me install a charger at the car port, and I had to charge at public chargers. It worked out, even though it wasn&#x27;t ideal. And when the laws finally reign in the rapacious landlords, we will have plenty of charging at apartments too.')
