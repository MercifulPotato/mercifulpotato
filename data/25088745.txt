Keyboards, display hinges, CPU&#x2F;GPU cooling, weak display bezel&#x2F;frames, weak outer-frames on their phones, laptop case creaking, etc. Heck they have yet to figure out how to design cables that don&#x27;t fray. I&#x27;m sure there are some nice aspects to owning a mac too, otherwise nobody would purchase them. But I have yet to find anything that they&#x27;ve done w.r.t good build quality. I do admit they have a very good handle on making their products look pretty. So there&#x27;s that..')
