Where a big chunk of the economy, culture and society in general are relying on?<p>Unfortunately capitalism on its own is failing in presenting a good solution, unless you think the guy running (idk) some important crypto code having to take care of ads to survive is a sign that everything is working as it should.<p>I would love if we had some sort of &quot;trickle-down tax&quot;, where we use dependency resolution and some algo to rate the importance of that particular dependency and make the software and services that are using them and being payed for it, to let some of the profit to help the open source ones (here i think a blockchain solution might be of some help, as things would be totally automated).')
