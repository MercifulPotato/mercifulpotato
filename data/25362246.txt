(In some workflows, the artist themselves could be working entirely on paper, leaving the plotting to a data-entry intern.)<p>With such a workflow, clumsiness of input method doesn&#x27;t really matter — it&#x27;s not impinging on your creative process, since the creative process is already over by the time you sit down at the computer screen.<p>Why, then, did paintbrush software even exist? Well, it could be helpful for finishing touch-ups to plotted input (especially hand-dithering to suit a given system&#x27;s palette — effectively the &quot;color grading&quot; of the early digital era.) And, of course, paintbrush software was helpful for quickly banging out &quot;programmer art&quot; mock-ups to use in your game&#x2F;app, before an artist comes in to replace it with something better.<p>By the late 80s, &#x27;serious&#x27; digital painting software for professional artists to create <i>in</i> came about. But said software either shipped only for systems that had a mouse (e.g. the Mac); or the software package itself shipped <i>with</i> a mouse (as in the case of PC Paint.) So &quot;doing digital painting with a joystick&quot; was never really a thing.')
