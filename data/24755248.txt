So the evidence suggests that articles like this actually <i>are</i> helpful, since there are only so many times you can read that this is the warmest [month] on record before you start to believe that things probably are getting warmer overall.<p>But as to what you were seeking, here were my first DDG results:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climate.gov&#x2F;news-features&#x2F;understanding-climate&#x2F;climate-change-global-temperature" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climate.gov&#x2F;news-features&#x2F;understanding-climate&#x2F;...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climate.nasa.gov&#x2F;vital-signs&#x2F;global-temperature&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climate.nasa.gov&#x2F;vital-signs&#x2F;global-temperature&#x2F;</a><p>I think newspapers publish things that are news, which means it&#x27;s something that happens at a given point in time. A monthly number is news, while &quot;the past few decades&quot; is not. An organization putting out a press release is news, so if that mentions a long-term trend, that can become news, but if it hasn&#x27;t changed in any detail since the last report, then it&#x27;s not really news either.<p>Newspapers, and news sources in generally, are really bad at communicating long-term trends like global climate change, unfortunately.')
