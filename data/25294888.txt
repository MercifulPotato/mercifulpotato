The &quot;retina&quot; resolution is based on a pixel size of 1 arc-minute, that&#x27;s 20&#x2F;20 vision, at 30 degrees, that&#x27;s 1800 pixels. 4k is 2160 vertical, so that&#x27;s about the limit of human vision. So, basically, 4k is what you want at any size.<p>No, because I don&#x27;t want to move my 32&quot; monitor further away to get that 30 degree viewing angle. The reason I have a 32&quot; monitor for work is to have more screen real estate. A 30 degree viewing angle works for watching movies and stuff, but when I use it for coding, I essentially have multiple 30 degree viewing (on-screen) windows.<p>You might say &quot;ok well just get two or three monitors&quot;, but that isn&#x27;t the same either. Besides the space between the monitors, with one large monitor I can subdivide my screen space in any way depending on what I&#x27;m doing, where each window has a 10-30 degree viewing angle or whatever.<p>&gt;you can notice discontinuities at a much higher resolution (vernier resolution), but it only matters if you don&#x27;t have anti-aliasing.<p>That&#x27;s just not true though. It does matter even with antialiasing, the difference is clear. In particular, the dell xps 15 2019 has a ~290 dpi OLED, which has high contrast.')
