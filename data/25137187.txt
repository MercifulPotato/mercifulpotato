But sure, a memory degrades from the original on recall and replaced with bits of false memories.<p>I have an interesting anecdote on forgetting. My grandmother developed Alzheimer at around 83 and she&#x27;d ask me something then 2 minutes later she&#x27;d forgotten she asked me and ask me again. However, at some point she seemed to be deep thinking and at some point started humming a song and as she hummed more she started singing clearly a song from her kindergarten. It was even emotional to her, she had tears in her eyes but there was joy as well. Sadly she descended into complete memory loss that year and soon wasn&#x27;t able to recognize anyone.<p>So even if we temporarily forget, some things are buried deep in there only to emerge at a later age.')
