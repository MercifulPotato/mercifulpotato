As if we can&#x27;t imagine how can those people fall for someone who says he (almost always a he) is appointed by god and bear so much of his bullshit for that. It is not victim blaming, but just barely so. It&#x27;s a massive surge of disbelief, and an accompanying faith that no, <i>those</i> days are over now. We are better than this now.<p>Only we aren&#x27;t, and we are still soaking up massive shitloads of inqueqlity and blood-boiling rule-bending like the good folks we are. For reasons that are, for all practical purposes, exactly like &quot;god says I can&quot;, only this god is called &quot;the free market&quot;. Slightly less superstitious, but no less unreal or stupid as the old thing. It&#x27;s amazing how much you can get depressed thinking about the sheer &quot;same shit different day&quot;-ness of human civilization.')
