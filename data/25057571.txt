Which in reality is madness.<p>If you have just 50 immutable classes you have to replicate those 50 lines of boilerplate for each class and make sure it&#x27;s bug free. It clutters your classes up and it&#x27;s just plain gross.<p>It&#x27;s going to be way better that the platform supports this kind of data structure natively instead of us building out the monstrosity ourselves.<p>By the way, plenty of the features of C# is basically syntax sugar, gets compiled down to more vebose code anyway. We think we write one or two lines of happy code, but underneath it might get turned into 20 lines. Luckily we mostly don&#x27;t have to see&#x2F;deal with it unless you are trying to squeeze your apps performance to the max (or have a nasty bug that cannot be caught by normal means), but at that point it might make more sense to use a lower level language.')
