Turning metrics like CPU, memory, IO and network loads into subtle sounds. Some more important background jobs execution into more distinct, but still somewhat subtle sound.<p>Basically, like the bridge of Enterprise D[0] (or its main engineering[1]).<p>The reasoning here is to recreate the experience of &quot;feeling&quot; the machine. Like drivers do with their cars. Like we could do in the past with HDD sounds, and now sometimes with fan noise[2].<p>Last time I mentioned it publicly, someone told me they use widgets with resource usage graphs for that purpose. I&#x27;ve started using them too, but I noticed that <i>I generally don&#x27;t look at them</i>. Even semi-transparent, they&#x27;re mostly just a blob of color that occasionally obstructs some UI I need to interact with. But sound is a separate channel, and easier to process subconsciously.<p>Anyone knows of tooling relevant to implement this idea?<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XajaCX88NnU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XajaCX88NnU</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GwLsBldD9kQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GwLsBldD9kQ</a><p>[2] - During a recent debugging session, I accidentally gained some insight about the problem by noticing the fan is making less noise than it should during certain tests.')
