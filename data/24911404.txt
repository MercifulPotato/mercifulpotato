Set me back for about 2 weeks.  I do believe that it reduced my intelligence.  Always hard to say with this stuff, but I was in university and the difficulty level seemed to take a significant step up after I recovered... but math is hard!  Had a significant concussion about a decade later, and experienced a similar drop in apparent intelligence and motivation -- which reinforces my belief that the impact was real (with the concussion, I experienced some tangible recovery as well).<p>But... just because this can happen as a result of an extreme flu, doesn&#x27;t mean that we should take these risks lightly just because they&#x27;re familiar.  I think I&#x27;d be a better person, and a more productive member of society, without those injuries.')
