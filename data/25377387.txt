Item(by='aylmao', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607628228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25375400, text='&gt; Oculus couldn&#x27;t survive by itself.<p>Do we know how expensive it is to maintain and how much it earns? It probably spends more than the PSVR division at Sony or the Vive division at HTC, but the Quest is quite popular and, if reviews are anything to go by, very close to making VR &quot;mainstream&quot;. I&#x27;m not convinced it couldn&#x27;t survive off investor money for a while until it becomes profitable. Silicon Valley is no stranger to unprofitable companies living off investments for years and years after all.')
