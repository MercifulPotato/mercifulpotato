People seem to have this misconception that the light from reflective displays like eInk is somehow different from that of emissive displays like LCD or OLED.  Light is light.  An LCD with _perfect_ calibration to the local lighting conditions would look indistinguishable from an eInk display, and thus we would expect it to have the same eye-strain reducing properties.<p>Put a different way: when light falls on an eInk &quot;pixel&quot; it gets absorbed and then re-emitted, modulo intensity.  That&#x27;s how we see the vast majority of surfaces in the world: they absorb light and then re-emit it, possibly changing its intensity and color (frequency).  Technologies like OLED directly emit light; not reacting significantly to the ambient light that falls on them.  But if one we able to measure the light falling on each individual pixel of an OLED, one could adjust each pixel to mimic the behavior of a physical object.  It could &quot;simulate&quot; eInk, so to speak.  If the mimicry is close enough, then there&#x27;s no fundamental difference between the two.  They&#x27;d both be emitting the same frequency and intensity of light.<p>In fact I recall a post, mostly likely here on HN:  Someone took a high quality Apple display and rigged it with an array of ambient light sensors, put it in a decorative art frame and hung it on the wall.  With some software and calibration they were able to get it to look convincingly like a real piece of art, fooling many of their guests.<p>eInk has been around for decades now and has remained an obscure niche.  It&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ll see a renaissance for it, with the patents hopefully expiring?  But there&#x27;s no reason we shouldn&#x27;t also be pursuing better ambient light calibration for our existing displays.<p>P.S.  It&#x27;s not accurate to say that eInk is a &quot;reflective&quot; display, as it does not primarily reflect light.  Otherwise it would look like a mirror.  But saying &quot;emissive&quot; versus &quot;reflective&quot; is common parlance for differentiating technologies like eInk from technologies like LCDs and OLEDs.  Nitpicking the terminology is not particularly helpful though.')
