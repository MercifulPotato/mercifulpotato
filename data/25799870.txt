Item(by='henrikschroder', descendants=None, kids=[25802408, 25800635], score=None, time=1610769140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799368, text='I&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount subtitling a TV series, and there were subtitles floating around for it before I started, but they contained a ton of bad English; wrong idioms, and wrong word order.<p>But when I did my translation, I tried to stick to the word order and expressions of the original language <i>when possible</i>. You could translate each sentence to the most likely way an English-speaking person would express themselves, but can also stray a bit, pick something that&#x27;s closer to the original, but still works. I wanted to subtly remind people that they&#x27;re not in Kansas anymore. Even though the show is a teen high school drama, it&#x27;s absolutely not an <i>American</i> high school, so you can&#x27;t use words associated with that either.<p>One example from the French remake: In English, a conventional piece of dialogue goes &quot;I love you&quot; - &quot;I love you too&quot;.<p>But in French, that dialogue goes &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot; - &quot;Moi aussi&quot;. So in this case we actually picked &quot;Me too&quot; as the translation for that, which definitely sticks out, but comes across as a little bit of a teaching French moment, because you can clearly hear that the character <i>isn&#x27;t</i> saying &quot;Je t&#x27;aime aussi&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s kinda what you were looking for, right?<p>However, somewhere there is a line, across which lies a sea of Bad English, and even further from that line, you get the incomprehensible gibberish of the work in the article, and you really, really don&#x27;t want to end up there.')
