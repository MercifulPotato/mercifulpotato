On the one hand, as a programmer, you may be fortunate enough to be able to hop jobs until you find one that makes you happy. You spend a lot of your life at work. If something is making you miserable, and you can do better, why not?<p>On the other hand, any change is a crapshoot, so if the price of change is high, you&#x27;ll need to evaluate the cost to benefit. That will depend on your location, your skillset, and your personality. That&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll have to discover for yourself.<p>Like you, I&#x27;ve got little tolerance for hostile people. They cost me a lot, mentally, and I take pains to avoid them. Often, they consider themselves justified, and consider it your responsibility to adapt to their style rather than the other way around.<p>So if you&#x27;re unhappy, and fortunate enough to have the power to leave, you can at least ask your teammates and management to help you find a better solution without leaving. They likely spent a lot to hire you and would rather not train your replacement. If nobody else on the team wants to work with them, then maybe they need a change in the team, and not starting with you.<p>And if that&#x27;s not possible, you take what steps you need to stay sane. Work isn&#x27;t always pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t need to suffer from people making it unnecesarily harder.<p>Good luck.')
