They vote with their social interests (is the narrative that this candidate selling cause my relative social position to rise or decline?)<p>This can explain why affluent urban professionals, whose economic and social position is relatively secure might vote for liberal economic and social policies. They live in a world where their marriage is more likely to be stable, their opinion is more likely to be taken seriously, and their values are more likely to be validated by movies&#x2F;TV&#x2F;media. More immigration is not going to diminish his&#x2F;her relative position in society. It might even make it higher as a lot of these immigrants aspire to be in that professionals&#x27; position.<p>On the other hand, it can also explain why some working class white and Hispanic voters might vote for candidates&#x2F;policies that sell a narrative of traditional values (anti abortion, church + family in place of a gov&#x27;t social safety net, etc). They live in a world where their families are less likely to be stable, and where their values are increasingly looked down upon in movies&#x2F;tv&#x2F;media. Greater immigration might diminish their relative position in society (even if it makes them slightly richer .... ). There might even be greater competition for admission for their children into T25 schools (which are lately seen as gatekeepers into the &quot;affluent urban professional&quot; class).')
