Systems like ABS, stability control and traction control have done wonders to keep people out of ditches already.<p>The long term, macroscopic decision making involved in driving computers are nowhere near ready to drive better than I can in winter (or even in perfect conditions).  I love my model 3, but the autopilot is  simply not a good driver.  It would fail any minimally rigorous driving test because it makes rookie mistakes and only drives in the exact moment.  It cannot plan ahead more than even a handful of seconds.  It stays in other driver&#x27;s blindspots when there is plenty of room to adjust the relative positions of the cars.  It accelerates into gaps that are about to not exist because other drivers&#x27; small hints scream they are about to change lanes, even if they haven&#x27;t signalled yet.  It gets confused about speed signs, often reading the off-ramp maximum as the speed and slams on the brakes.  It plants itself in the dead centre of the lane even when other drivers encroach and then when it decides the situation has become dangerous it swerves violently and applies applies significant braking.  Experienced, safe drivers give ground within the lane, preventing the dangerous situation from ever developing, and if the other driver does fully enter their lane are ready to calmly move over without creating an entirely different collision.')
