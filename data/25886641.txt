Will you make those features private again?<p>Nope, any feature that is released will remain public.<p>&gt; I guess it&#x27;s a bit counter-intuitive for me that a one-time release of a feature is tied to a recurring sponsorship level.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m selling early access to new features, that&#x27;s it. If you need something now, and it&#x27;s available for sponsors only, you need to subscribe to get access to it. You can always implement it yourself, the project is very hackable and puts a great emphasis on extensibility. The documentation is very thorough, also in respect to customization. However, sometimes, maybe especially for something like technical documentation, you don&#x27;t want to be fighting browser bugs and edge cases.')
