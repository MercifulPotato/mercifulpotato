And there were even new things released in April. I admit it was far lower than what would likely have been released without covid, but there was content being put out still. I admit that I was annoyed with the lack of content, and still am. But to suggest that I filled that time with stock trading seems like a stretch.<p>Also, none of this addresses my other point. Individual investors do not make up a majority of stock purchases. So to assume that the average Joe being bored at home lead to rallies in retail stocks just doesn&#x27;t jive. What does jive is the decline in other investment opportunities and having large firms shift their investments into the only options they really had; Stocks and real estate.<p>However, real estate even became too prohibitive for a lot of investors due to the fed rate cut leading to tons of home buying. This is a sector that is largely composed of individual investors. Therefore, they were forced into stocks exclusively.<p>I would simply need a lot more data to support that individuals being bored lead to massive movements in stocks. in 2016 14% of stocks were owned by individual investors. Let&#x27;s assume a 100% increase due to the media drought and thats 28%. That is not enough to truly influence large parts of the market into the hikes we&#x27;ve seen. Especially considering that during this time there was a lot of financial uncertainty for these individual investors. Many didn&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d have paychecks coming in (take a look at the mortgage forbearance to see how many people assumed they wouldn&#x27;t have money). So how many new investors joined in on their piece of the pie when they were also strapped for cash? I&#x27;d be surprised if it was 100% increase. The only people that could take advantage of the dips were people that had were likely already in the market and had consistent money coming in.')
