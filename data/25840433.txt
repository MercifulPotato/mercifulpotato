This gives you a visual memory of the things you&#x27;ve seen on the web. I&#x27;ve wanted to develop this for a while, as a browser plugin.<p>Being able to skim the past month or two click around the thumbnails would already be amazing. I&#x27;ve wanted to do that many times before to check if my memory was correct, or if a page changed since I last saw it, or figure out when I last saw something online.<p>You don&#x27;t need a special viewer for it, as your operating system&#x27;s file explorer can view the screenshots already, and you don&#x27;t need to set up a crawl. Screenshots also compress well, as webp or png after crunching it.')
