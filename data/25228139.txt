The modern C++ after that is more of a standalone language after some other languages&#x27; features adoption (e.g. D). Objective-C on the other hand is totally a separate language.<p>The original JVM written by Sun was in C not C++ or Java.<p>Windows NT the kernel part is mainly written in C. The chief developer of Windows NT Dave Cutler is probably the most anti UNIX person in the world, but the fact that he has chosen C to write Windows NT kernel in C is probably the biggest testament you can get. Dave Cutler is also part of the original developers of VMS, if BLISS with its typeless nature is better for developing OS than C, he&#x27;d probably has chosen it.<p>For whatever reasons Multics had failed to capture wide spread adoption compared to UNIX and the fact that its name existed mainly in most of operating System books as pre-cursor OS to UNIX. For most people Multics is like B language that is just a pre-cursor to C language. I know it a shame that Multics had become a mere footnotes inside OS textbooks despite its superior design compared to UNIX.<p>PL&#x2F;I language is interesting by the fact that it is quite advanced at the time but as I mentioned in my original comments, Dennis Ritchie had to accommodate the fact that some of languages features are over engineered based on the hardware of the day and had to compromise accordingly. Go designers, however, have chosen to compromise not based on the hardware state-of-the-art but what the language designers think are good for Google developers at the time of the original language design proposal.')
