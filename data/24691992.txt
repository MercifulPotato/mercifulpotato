I ask because unless you&#x27;ve experienced it, it would probably catch you completely off guard as well. Sometimes the part of your brain that would normally make you aware that you&#x27;re falling asleep is the first to go. I think this happens more while driving because you think you&#x27;re concentrating on driving but really your brain is shutting off bit by bit until you&#x27;re finally at a point where you&#x27;re basically a mindless zombie. It&#x27;s happened to me before and it absolutely caught me off guard.')
