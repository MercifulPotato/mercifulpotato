I felt like I was fighting too hard with eccentricities of Java than actually learning about algorithms. In retrospect, I was wrong, because one of the things I realized that it taught me was that implementation details of algorithms are _hugely_ important, and can cause drastic differences in time and memory utilization. I can easily forget the details, but I haven&#x27;t forgotten the experience of hacking out my stupid mistakes until the implementations fit the requirements.')
