Taking Zeeman splitting as an example of a magnetic field interacting with a paramagnetic spin: that will have an effect on the order of like 10^-7 eV, which is minuscule. Particularly in a human-shaped heat bath at 310K where kT is 10^-2 eV.<p>To put it another way: It’s surprising to me that a magnetic field would have significant biological effects at 3mT, yet cause no obvious acute effects in a high-field MRI at more than 3000 times that field strength (try taking 3000 times the therapeutic dose of aspirin, or a radiation therapy).<p>I’m perplexed. Interesting! I’m happy this was posted.')
