Most of the time the thought that goes into those decisions isn&#x27;t shared with the public. The prosecutor has a wide degree of independence, and they are always accountable to someone. Even prosecutors who aren&#x27;t &quot;progressive&quot; choose not to prosecute some crimes, to litigate everything would be ridiculous and counter productive to the business of government and commerce. My guess is your hair is on end because of a prosecutor(s) who was installed by the public.')
