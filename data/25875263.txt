I never saw two React projects with the same dependencies, project structure, and guidelines. This means the knowledge is not transferable from project to project, as can be the case in Angular or Vue.<p>For a developer just looking to make the thing their design team sent them as quickly as possible, this makes good sense to me. And I get that project&#x2F;file structures can be wildly jarring to an uninitiated dev - I remember looking through a Java repo for the first time :shudders:<p>But! Isn’t there a necessary step of understanding why decisions were made the way they were? In my experience as a front-end eng, even if a previous project involves other-worldly dependencies or FS compared to the one I’m on now, if I understand the trade-offs of the approaches for the previous project, no amount of knowledge is untransferable.')
