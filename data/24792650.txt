Don&#x27;t build something that&#x27;s manageable and then complain when people ask you to manage it.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before here, I&#x27;m pretty libertarian, and very much in favor of small gov, but at this point its become clear that anyone who strives to become an internet platform where market dominance equals monopoly or duopoly, should be held to strict regulatory standards, re: free speech, appeals, etc. similar to what a gov entity is held to.')
