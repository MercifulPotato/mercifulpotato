Side effects were killing me.<p>After I stopped, I was more hyperactive and less focused... Yet the hyperactivity compensated for the &quot;less focused&quot; part, and I finished a week&#x27;s work in a day.<p>That&#x27;s my experience with meds so far. They completely eliminate my anxiety and make me feel in control of my emotions. Yet they make me less productive than when I&#x27;m in a hyperactive rush (even if my focus is reduced).<p>So for now I&#x27;m just going to embrace my inconsistency (in terms of emotions, energy, and focus) because I think I&#x27;m way worse without it. Establishing a routine helps me cope much better - I feel waking up early and having a good morning dictates how productive my day will be.<p>On meds, I finally felt in control of my life and energy. But it also felt bland, boring. I didn&#x27;t feel anything. I had no anxiety to push me to go the extra mile. My personality &amp; cheeriness were nonexistent. And I was, overall, simply less productive.<p>Not doing that again.')
