It doesn&#x27;t have to global, just like it can&#x27;t be individual.&quot;<p>and again, that&#x27;s the point. neither extreme is realistic, but we have a bias toward one that we should actively compensate for. most of our esteem derives for the few hundred to a few thousand people that forms our social system, but our thinking tends to stray to where we stand in the wider, unfathomable society. it&#x27;s a component of why social media tends to be corrosive rather than creative and supportive.')
