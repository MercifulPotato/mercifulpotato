Item(by='bonzini', descendants=None, kids=[24711135], score=None, time=1602094410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710896, text='&gt; In GNU Smalltalk you don&#x27;t need to load an image (i.e. persisted Object Memory state) to do anything reasonable.<p>True but the first thing the VM does if it does not give an image is create empty classes and  load files that define those classes. Only then does it do whatever it was asked to do,  so the ObjectMemory was not loaded from a persisted state but is effectively indistinguishable from one.<p>Once the image exists, the main difference between the GST file-based approach and the traditional Smalltalk-80 image-based development is that saving the image back is not &quot;saving your work&quot; but &quot;preparing a cache&quot; in which to load source files ephemerally. But that&#x27;s just an additional possible use of the image that could be implemented in Squeak&#x2F;Pharo as well, just like GST had class browser for development if you really wanted.')
