I actually just downloaded the installer right from epicgames.com and it installed just fine. Apple doesn&#x27;t even try to stop me.<p>I remember Apple revoking Epic&#x27;s access to Apple&#x27;s developer tools because of a disagreement over their developer program TOS, but that only stops Epic from using Apple&#x27;s tools. It does not prevent me from installing any software.<p>I have a ton of software on my Mac that&#x27;s not part of the Apple developer program and the developers have never asked Apple&#x27;s permission nor given Apple any money for the software and Apple has never once tried to block those developers from creating that software or me from installing and running it.')
