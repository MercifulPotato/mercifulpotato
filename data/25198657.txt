If I wanted to generate a good driver for a course, Iâ€™d run a few thousand of these and pick the coefficients that complete the course in the shortest time.<p>It is worth pointing out that this strategy can likely overfit on the data that you have used for training: when you change the track, your car may not behave as good as before. In other words: the coefficients are only good for that specific track(s).<p>The author is still using Machine Learning, even if not with neural networks: the need for rigorous strategies for model selection doesn&#x27;t disappear.')
