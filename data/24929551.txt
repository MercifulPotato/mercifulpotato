If he&#x2F;she finds the ideas of Fa√ßade, DAO and Services interesting it means those patterns are new to him&#x2F;her. If that&#x27;s the case I was trying to redirect his&#x2F;her learning efforts to what most of the industry is using on a Java stack. Of course there still are legacy applications using Java EE, SOAP, XML payloads, etc... I&#x27;ve worked in projects using these technologies, but luckily the industry at large has moved on. Also Jakarta EE is copying many of the patterns and ideas from Spring&#x2F;Spring Boot.')
