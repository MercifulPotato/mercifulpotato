The opposite would be insane.\nEqually China is not willing (and able) either.<p>This is a balance of threats with both sides knowing where to stop.<p>The US are obviously not stupid and they never committed to intervene against China. They have just committed to &#x27;help&#x27; and make sure that Taiwan can defend itself, which is very different.<p>&gt; <i>Military confrontation between US and Chinese forces does not mean WWIII</i><p>It does when the US directly attack the Chinese over Chinese territory.<p>I.e. the US would be declaring war on China. I would not let anyone who does not see the insanity of that prospect have a job in government.')
