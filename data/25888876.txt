Several SV tech companies (in satellite offices - not in SV). Two pure startups. An engineering firm. I have never seen it be anything but a waste of time. And it <i>always</i> consumes significantly more time than the boosters claim it does.<p>And we can look at each other&#x27;s anecdotes with suspicion. But there&#x27;s a paradox that when someone says &quot;Oh it&#x27;s only 1 minute per person&quot; then my natural response is &quot;why isn&#x27;t that a status line they set in IM or something?&quot; at whatever asynchronous time it suits them best in their workday. How could it possibly be the best way to communicate 60 seconds of information by making everyone break their flow and gather together. And if it&#x27;s more than 1 minute, and you&#x27;re getting into actual meat, well then there are even bigger issues afoot like an inappropriately large and inefficient audience.<p>If you&#x27;re just stating exactly what everyone can see in JIRA or whatever product you use, then it&#x27;s a waste of time.<p>Aside: In probably half those teams there were remote developers who&#x27;d have to call in. Boy, that added a whole new fun level where everyone does nothing while technical issues are sorted.<p>EDIT: After the flurry of downvotes by these scrum disciples, I can&#x27;t even reply to the disingenuous reply to this that makes some astonishing projections, and again tries to moral high ground.<p>If you are on a team that derives value from scrums, you are probably on a shitty team.<p>Debating with the zealots of scrum land (who, like the guy below, will repeatedly tell you -- in between their evangelizing -- that they&#x27;re not <i>really</i> zealots) is a Schr√∂dinger&#x27;s Cat of productivity, where not only does it take no time and impose no flow penalty, completely and fully detached with every inkling of software development knowledge industrywide, it also conveys everything to everyone and is all powerful.')
