Similarly, the elements at 25% and 75% of the array are tested very often, in 50% searches&#x2F;each.<p>Modern computers have very slow memory compared to computation speed, and multi-level caches to compensate. Binary search RAM access pattern, when done many times, is friendly towards these multi-level caches. The elements at positions like 25%, 50%, 75% will stay in L1D cache.')
