When does this work?<p>- Is Java pass by reference or pass by value language? Why? (I ask this senior Java developers and never got correct answer)<p>- Can more than one processes listen on the same port on the same interface and IP address?<p>- What does `volatile` keyword do in Java, exactly?<p>- Explain what is a breakpoint and how it stops the program.<p>I would assume at least some of the things should be familiar to somebody who spent years programming in the given language.')
