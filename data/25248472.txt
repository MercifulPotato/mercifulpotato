Apple has never played well with FOSS and aren&#x27;t going to start now. Apple&#x27;s implementation will always be ahead, better, less bugs, and the linux port will always be a shitty experience that takes up several weeks to get working properly, and then it&#x27;ll be slower than expected.<p>Get yourself a laptop with an nvidia card and Ubuntu. Even today it&#x27;s a garbage experience that takes up hours&#x2F;days of debugging to get right, and then it&#x27;s still way worse than the mac&#x2F;windows experience.')
