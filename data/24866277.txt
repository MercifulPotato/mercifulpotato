I would not accept 70% less than minimum wage, and I&#x27;m sure these workers would all prefer to make more than 30% of minimum wage, but they have an entire labor market of other options and they have decided that this is their best option. The onus should be on you to explain why you think it&#x27;s better that these jobs not be available to them at all.<p>If people deserve some minimum standard of living, why should only employed people deserve that minimum standard? I don&#x27;t see why gig economy employers are the ones getting the blame here. Surely our legislature is to blame for allowing people to have such a low standard of living that they feel forced to accept such terrible jobs.')
