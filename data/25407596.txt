The human body is extremely complex, but all organs and systems in the human body work in harmony and with astounding efficiency.<p>We need to stop fighting complexity in software and embrace it instead. The goal shouldn&#x27;t be to pursue simplicity at the cost of ignoring complexity of the domain being modelled, but to acknowledge that we&#x27;re modelling a complex system, and design it such that subsystems work together in harmony.<p>This article in particular touches on an important point which resonates with me. It&#x27;s what I call &quot;displacement oriented design&quot;. I view a code base as a puzzle that grows in size over time; you can&#x27;t grow a puzzle just by adding to it and leaving all other pieces intact. As you expand the size of the puzzle you need &quot;displace&quot; some of the existing pieces, reshape them, and fit them with the new pieces.')
