Some were young w&#x2F;no obligations, some had families, a couple were single parents, and there were even a couple folks in the starting to have grandkids phase.  I didn&#x27;t particularly care what schedules people kept as long as work got done and they could be predictably reached.<p>As a result, there were people that worked 6am to 3pm(ish), 10-3, followed by 7-10 in the evening, 11-8, etc. I had a young child and handled school dropoff, so my hours were roughly 9am - 6pm.  My boss, the CEO, was a workaholic who arrived around 10am and worked to whenever.  I spent an amazing amount of time dealing with &quot;where is everyone?&quot; sorts of questions, despite the team running fairly efficiently and still completing work on aggressive schedules.')
