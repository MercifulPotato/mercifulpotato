Based on limited knowledge (e.g., the Finnish YouTuber who tried working as Wolt courier for a couple of days, and the recent articles about the courier who is trying to earn 8000e in January delivering with Wolt), it seems that the rate _when actually making deliveries_ is higher. I might be willing to accept that this quoted figure is the hourly rate when the courier is technically available for deliveries but not getting them all the time. So, the hourly rate would go up if more people made delivery orders, because there would be less downtime… Of course nothing prevents the self-employed couriers from doing other work in the meantime, e.g., delivering for another company or working on some personal project (studying comes to mind as a thing that can be done during downtime).<p>Now, admittedly if they were employees, they would be paid by the hour whether there were orders or not, but then both their salary and the number of couriers on duty would have to be adjusted accordingly, which means the majority of couriers would lose this job… Not a simple matter, IMO, I think there is a gap in legislation when it comes to this type of work.')
