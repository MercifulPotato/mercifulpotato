The African merchants traveling by ship need to know their home language and whatever language is spoken where they trade. If you stop at a port along the way you aren&#x27;t there to trade your goods, just a few supplies: possibly food, or alcohol and prostitutes (note that I always use the oxford comma!) which can be done with simple gestures. When you cross land you travel through too many villages to risk not knowing them all (or having a guide who does).<p>The cost of land travel as well means that almost nothing is going to be traded long distances. Any merchant from Asia is guaranteed to be talking directly to the powerful king - if there isn&#x27;t a powerful king (which England was just starting to get) there isn&#x27;t enough wealth to make anything worth bringing that far.<p>This does leave the curiosity.  The person who doesn&#x27;t fit in back home: so he travels far and lives as an exotic figure, moving around often enough before the locals figure out why he isn&#x27;t welcome back home.')
