If you&#x27;re willing to risk some time and money on failure you can have a go yourself, there are excellent guides online.<p>I have an iPad 2 that I bought new long ago and have since given to my young children. Unsurprisingly one of them dropped it and the screen stopped working. I ordered the kit, opened it up, and reseated the LCD. Would have gone flawlessly if I&#x27;d been more careful while opening it up, as it stands I now need to replace the digitiser, but it&#x27;s still much cheaper than a new tablet, especially while my elder daughter is in a phase of thinking she is smarter than us and can ignore warnings like &quot;if you balance that on your knees it will fall off and break.&quot;')
