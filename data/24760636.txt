Not everything needs to be a minimalistic sleek Webapp. All of this depends on who your target audience is and on which level they want to deal with the problem. A minimalistic UI isn&#x27;t automatically more or less powerful than a complex one if it combines well with other tools. To make every part combine well with the other parts to get out more than the sum of the parts is worth it, but find the right degree of minimalism vs complexity.<p>5. Make sure you waste the cognitive energy of people by having them figure out the same things over and over again. Rhe work of programmers multiplies: if you make one tiny thing a little bit nicer, it might make a hundred moments on a thousand days for a thousand people nicer. Same goes for making things that suck. So things should be obvious â€” if they are not (e.g. because the underlying problems are hardcore) make sure your software reduces the cognitive energy needed to solve that hard problem. Never claim that a hard problem is simple unless you <i>really</i> managed to simplify it.')
