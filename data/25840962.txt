This is simply an incontrovertible fact - India, Nigeria, Congo, etc... were in similar initial conditions and fared much worse economically.<p>Far from being worse than liberal capitalist economies - which are the majority of the world - it&#x27;s 73 in GDP PPP per capita out of 193 - solidly above average.<p>It&#x27;s also not <i>had</i> a period of high growth, it is still having a period of high growth, with 2.4% growth in 2020 which is by far the highest out of all major economies, and a predicted 7.3% next year. This is better than a lot of low income countries, coming from a medium-high income country.<p>It&#x27;s also set on escaping the middle income trap in 2-5 years as GDP per capita goes above 12500$, which is something that most liberal capitalist economies cannot achieve.<p>So no, it&#x27;s really not just in relative sense. In performance with its current position, it really is doing better than alternate models of liberal capitalism, and by quite a margin.<p>I don&#x27;t support the political reality that makes it work at all, but it is clear that liberal capitalism is not the undisputed king anymore.')
