Item(by='magicalhippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611221746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25856666, text='Datasheet does look nice indeed. It&#x27;s clearly written to be more approachable, which I like.<p>Though I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s &quot;only 600 pages&quot;. For comparison the STM32F417 reference manual is 1700 pages and in addition you need to read the datasheet which is another 200 pages.<p>Not a bad thing though, it has less numerous and less complex fixed peripherals compared to the STM32 family.')
