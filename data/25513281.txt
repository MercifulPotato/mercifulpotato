Seth Lloyd came forward, apologized, and showed extreme remorse, so he got severely disciplined. All the folks who went to Epstein&#x27;s island and partook of the girls didn&#x27;t even get mentioned in the &quot;Factfinding report.&quot;<p>The sin seems to be coming forward and apologizing.<p>I know I&#x27;ll get down-voted for this by MIT fanbois, but if you&#x27;d like to find photos of MIT faculty on Epstein&#x27;s island, you&#x27;ll find at least a half-dozen on archive.org for Epstein&#x27;s various charities.<p>MIT CSAIL shut down its mailing list because someone had the gall to raise the issue of Minsky, not so much because Minsky did anything wrong (he probably didn&#x27;t), but because Minsky was conspicuously absent from Factfinding too. Have at it:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;factfindingjan2020.mit.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;factfindingjan2020.mit.edu&#x2F;</a><p>I have a lot of insider information, but I&#x27;m only mentioning things which are public record at this point. A lot of people did a lot of wrong. The only ones who were punished were the ones who came forward.<p>Stepping beyond public record, lots of NDAs and non-disparage agreements at MIT now... MIT is a cesspool of corruption these days. And yes, if you went to MIT and care about MIT, you should NOT be donating money. That leads to more corruption. You should be pushing for it to clean up, although it seems too late for that...')
