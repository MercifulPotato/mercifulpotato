It seems to me that I remember playing with a toy quite like theirs as a child many years ago. Basically cheap poker chips with cuts around the edge so they can connect. So it seems quite unlikely that they&#x27;d try to protect that IP, since it probably wasn&#x27;t their invention in the first place.<p>The designs that they show being copied by others are an interesting problem. I got bored of all the pictures and didn&#x27;t compare one by one, but it seems like if you were to do a clean room design of a helicopter made of these snowflake chips, it would be legitimate to copy. I would guess they are suing this other company based on the copyright protection of their instruction manuals. Seems hard.<p>I&#x27;m quite glad my interests for developing products involve a healthy amount of algorithms rather than just pieces of plastic and instruction manuals. Success breeds competition, and in something like this I doubt it&#x27;s feasible to compete on quality, only price, which is a hard battle.')
