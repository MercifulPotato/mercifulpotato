That being said, if direct calls to violence and to insurrection against a democracy aren&#x27;t grounds to take away your megaphone, then what is? If you&#x27;re a free speech maximalist you&#x27;ll be opposed to any sort of &quot;censorship&quot; (then again, people with those views also tend to believe that &quot;private companies&quot; hold absolute authority over what goes on in their &quot;property&quot;). But if you believe inciting violence and other kinds of things should be punished by law, then you can hardly disagree with this.')
