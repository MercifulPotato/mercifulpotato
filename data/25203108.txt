The any workstation you want sprints (solaris, hp, alpha) didnâ€™t pan out. The Microsoft tax (later judged monopolistic, too late, as Ray Noorda of Novell confessed to me as had happened to him) killed our PC business. We ditched the OS and ran on Windows. We sold our source code to Sun to make a multiplatform OpenStep. No cigars. (They made Java out of it using many of our&#x2F;my ideas)<p>This is interesting. This is the first I&#x27;ve heard about a link between NeXT and Java. Does anyone have any further information about this? I thought James Gosling developed Java from a language called Oak. That&#x27;s the earliest origin story I&#x27;ve heard until I read this post.')
