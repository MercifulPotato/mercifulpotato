Presumably the people writing about swarms of killer drones have some justification or are fine with being supervillains, the field is trying to figure out where the other blindspots are and that requires broader search efforts.<p>Edit: I just want to add this is the first I&#x27;m hearing about this letter and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what it&#x27;s even in response to. Since my work is health adjacent, I haven&#x27;t had time this year to know much about conferences I wasn&#x27;t involved in.')
