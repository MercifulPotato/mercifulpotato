Maybe it&#x27;s just because I watched Contact, but I would expect the basic demonstration of intelligence&#x2F;etc to precede a more interesting message.  The basic math and science transmission could be used as a Rosetta stone of sorts, to bootstrap that more interesting message.  Otherwise what&#x27;s the point?  Maybe the aliens just want somebody else to know they existed I suppose.')
