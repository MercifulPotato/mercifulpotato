The risk then was that the entire financial industry was in a precarious position because even the ones  not holding enough bad mortgages to bankrupt them were still holding some, and the double whammy of that <i>and</i> being exposed to defaults by what people expected to be stable institutional debtors could have had a domino effect.<p>Right now the financial industry is already flush with stimulus money and interest rates are around zero. You don&#x27;t get the same domino effect. So big firms that made risky bets can suffer the consequences.<p>&gt; But two wrongs do not make a right.<p>Just the opportunity to <i>not</i> bail them out this time could be worth the consequences to act as a deterrent for this kind of careless risk taking.<p>&gt; Extreme volatility and irrational stock prices ultimately hurt everyone in the market who is trying to invest responsibly.<p>Explain how this has any significant effect on everyone investing in major index funds. Most of them don&#x27;t include GameStop at all and for the few that do it generally isn&#x27;t a major component. And even if it was, they would have then owned the same number of shares before this started and after it ends, so if the price goes from $5 to the moon and then back to $5 again over the course of a short period of time, that effects them how exactly?')
