No: lifestyle changes are a preventative and curative step that can avoid diseases and surgeries in many other fields.<p>Medicine is absolutely capable of demanding patients work diligently towards lifestyle changes before they receive surgical intervention. For example, if you want an organ transplant and you aren’t working diligently towards health (often with exactly the same list of lifestyle changes as above!) you may be denied your organ transplant.<p>The problem she fought against was that surgeons didn’t want to consider that the lifestyle changes method <i>could possibly</i> be effective. She was right; they were wrong.<p>So now it’s left to medicine to decide when and how to take that into account in their treatment recommendations and standards of care. As you describe, this is a Hard Problem, but it’s a familiar one. They already have lots of experience with treatment through lifestyle change, and now as a result of her work, they can apply those learning to this new area too.<p>Good work.')
