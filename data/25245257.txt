The idea was to use its ability to take ten pictures a second to take a rapid succession of images with very different lighting. The images were then processed by a series of tools I&#x27;d helped develop the previous year.<p>The timeline was pretty tight, so I had to begin development before I had the camera. I contacted Canon support to confirm that the 10 pics per second was only when given a continuous signal and to ask which speeds it could reach when taking separate pictures via remote trigger. Their support tech insisted it was irrelevant since I couldn&#x27;t possibly press the button that fast. I tried, to no avail, to explain that it was a computer sending the signal and it could do so (with the hardware I had) a thousand times per second. Reluctantly, he forwarded the question to their technical support, who never answered.<p>I ended up using a continuous signal and having my program listen to the remote flash connector. It worked splendidly.')
