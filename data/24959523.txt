But when two, or even <i>three</i> get chained together, in addition to whatever lag there is for building the new UI elements, it&#x27;s unbearable. And then there are the piss-poor apps on iPhone that seem to also depend on network data at some point, and delay all info display until the update comes through.<p>And the other issue with animations is that you&#x27;re never sure when it&#x27;s safe to tap a visible UI element, because it&#x27;s not clear when that button that&#x27;s sliding onto the screen will actually become active and responsive to user input. So the animation introduces tons of uncertainty about intersections too.<p>Animations should be capped to 100ms for any interaction. No chaining if one thing slides out, then another slides over. 100ms total, slide both those panels at once if you want to animate them, devs. Or bette yet, skip the stupid animation.')
