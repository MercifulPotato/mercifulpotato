Item(by='CinematicStudio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608815348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526421, text='Thanks!<p>Funny you mentioned that - when you open the app and start a new project, in the &quot;video area&quot;, there&#x27;s a link to a &quot;Getting Started&quot; tutorial :)<p>&gt; I realize now that, because of the size of video files and the time required to process them, the manipulate-the-file-directly workflow probably wouldn&#x27;t be feasible.<p>Yes, it is very unfeasible :) You don&#x27;t wanna know the things I do behind the scenes to make this as user friendly as possible :)<p>&gt; But if you think that Windows users inexperienced with video editing would have the same file-based mindset that I had, you might want to see if you can make your interface seem as though the user is opening, editing, and saving their video files directly.<p>Not sure what to say here. As far as I know, users have a far less &quot;file-based mindset&quot; as a while ago (I would know, I&#x27;m 42 years old :D)<p>I do think the UI shows to the user that he&#x27;s opening&#x2F;editing&#x2F;saving the files directly - but that&#x27;s for you guys to say :D<p>One thing I struggle with is this: how do I show to the user that he&#x27;s not modifying the original video files? And since we have a video project, if you later remove one of the original video files and reopen the project, part of it is &quot;lost&quot;. I need to add a &quot;Create local copies&quot; option and make it easy enough to understand ;)')
