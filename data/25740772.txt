It does come with some of the downsides the previous poster mentioned: the inability to make myself reachable from $the_world can be annoying, and I get a captcha on Google every time because of &quot;unusual traffic&quot; (I mostly use DDG, but sometimes fall back to it). Also, ACM blocked me at some point because &quot;my IP is infiltrated by SciHub&quot; (their words).<p>In the end, it&#x27;s an imperfect solution for a real problem that <i>mostly</i> works well enough.')
