I was reading this thread thinking that sitting alone with your thoughts does not necessarily bring you peace. It can often do the opposite.<p>I take time and pray to God each morning. I find that this gives me peace. I feel better prepared to deal with the day when I pray.<p>My routine is focused around praying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, as in the prayer Jesus taught.  Praying this prayer over years has enabled some truths to sink in. For example, the first part of the prayer is not about us, it is about God. I think it is good to start the day with the understanding we are not the centre of the universe. Secondly, I have been struck by how the Lord&#x27;s prayer does not start at the place of forgiveness. Whether that be seeking forgiveness or asking for forgiveness. This gives me peace in the knowledge I don&#x27;t need to have it all together before I engage with God in prayer.')
