Power is a proxy (a moderately good one) for air movement (a mix of volume&#x2F;mass at a specific [back-]pressure).<p>It’s not likely that a silent 2W fan will move a similar amount of air as the stock 14W fans. The enterprise gear from HPE is pretty well engineered; I’m skeptical that they over-designed the fans by a 7x factor.<p>Operating voltage tells you “this fan won’t burn up when you plug it in”. It doesn’t tell you “will keep the components cool”.')
