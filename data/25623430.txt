The difficulty is that Intel didn&#x27;t really have anything like Threadripper â€” their i9 series was the most comparable (high clocks and moderate core counts), but i9 explicitly did not support ECC memory, nullifying the comparison.<p>You&#x27;re looking at 2950X, probably?  That&#x27;s a Zen+ (previous gen) model.  16 core &#x2F; 32 thread, 3.5 GHz base clock, launched August 2018.<p>Comparable Intel Xeon timeline is Coffee Lake at the latest, Kaby lake before that.  As far as I can tell, <i>no</i> Kaby Lake nor Coffee Lake Xeons even have 16 cores.<p>The closest Skylake I&#x27;ve found is an (OEM) Xeon Gold 6149: 16&#x2F;32 core&#x2F;thread, 3.1 GHz base clock, 205W nominal TDP (and it&#x27;s a special OEM part, not available for you).  The closest buyable part is probably Xeon Gold 6154 with 18&#x2F;36 core&#x2F;threads, 3GHz clock, and 200W nominal TDP.<p>Looking at i9 from around that time, you had Skylake-X and a single Coffe Lake-S (i9-9900K).  9900K only has 8 cores.  The Skylake i9-9960X part has 16&#x2F;32 cores&#x2F;threads, base clock of 3.1GHz, and a nominal TDP of 165W.  That&#x27;s somewhat comparable to the AMD 2950X, ignoring ECC support.<p>Another note that might interest you: you could run the Threadripper part at substantially lower power by sacrificing a small amount of performance, if thermals are the most important factor and you are unwilling to trust Ryzen ECC: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apollo.backplane.com&#x2F;DFlyMisc&#x2F;threadripper.txt" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apollo.backplane.com&#x2F;DFlyMisc&#x2F;threadripper.txt</a><p>Or just buy an Epyc, if you want a low-TDP ECC-definitely-supported part: EPYC 7302P has 16&#x2F;32 cores, 3GHz base clock, and 155W nominal TDP.  EPYC 7282 has 16&#x2F;32 cores, 2.8 GHz base, and 120W nominal TDP.  These are all zen2 (vs 2950X&#x27;s zen+) and will outperform zen+ on a clock-for-clock basis.<p>&gt; And though ECC is not disabled in Ryzen CPUs, AFAIK it&#x27;s not tested in (or advertised for) those, so one won&#x27;t be able to return&#x2F;replace a CPU if it doesn&#x27;t work with ECC memory, AIUI, making it risky.<p>If your vendor won&#x27;t accept defective CPU returns, buy somewhere else.<p>&gt; Though I don&#x27;t know how common it is for ECC to not be handled properly in an otherwise functioning CPU; are there any statistics or estimates around?<p>ECC support requires motherboard support; that&#x27;s the main thing to be aware of shopping for Ryzen ECC setups.  If the board doesn&#x27;t have the traces, there&#x27;s nothing the CPU can do.')
