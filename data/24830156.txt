There are frequently openings if you&#x27;re interested. We made FAANG wages (and other compensation), as you can imagine. We hired a lot from the nearby studios in LA â€“ Dreamworks (who perpetually seemed to be a month away from or a month past a layoff), Sony, and some of the smaller effects houses. We even had a few former game programmers who did lots of graphics work. People from the film studios indicated that the conditions at the studios were suboptimal compared to working at a FAANG company, though compensation didn&#x27;t seem too much worse.')
