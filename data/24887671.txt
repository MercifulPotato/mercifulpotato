Is the government only using swabs + PCR?) are a problem, because they keep on piling but you lose track of who&#x27;s infectious.<p>You have very large, almost inflated case numbers, but (in the absence of symptoms) you don&#x27;t know if those people are still spreading the virus or had it and are recovering.<p>That&#x27;s because, if you are positive at a PCR test and without any symptom you may:<p>- Have not yet developed symptoms, and are infectious<p>- Have no symptoms, and are infectious<p>- Have cleared the virus, and are no longer infectious<p>Viral RNA can last in the throat for weeks in some cases (and it&#x27;s not unique to this virus). That is why you can&#x27;t detect the virus just with this test in absence of anything else (and the British Medical Journal wrote about this recently: advice to the doctors on how to interpret tests).<p>The New England Journal of Medicine argued for far more frequent antigen testing as a way to keep track of cases that are important to isolate, that is, the ones that are infectious[1].<p>My country did the same mistake (also using serological tests to assess positivity and infectiousness, a stupid mistake that just increased the backlog of tests) and of course tracing blew up.<p>EDIT: You can voice your disagreement instead of downvoting.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMp2025631" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMp2025631</a>')
