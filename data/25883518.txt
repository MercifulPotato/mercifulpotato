Even if its free, in 2021 the laws have been slowly catching up with the internet and your users could bring a lot of heat to your doorstep.  You could even become a &quot;free ISP&quot; for your neighbors and SWIP [1] out address space to them assuming you have a big enough CIDR block with that 10gb&#x2F;s connection.
