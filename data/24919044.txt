Not only does it need an aircraft and vehicle license, this car is a &quot;hybrid car-plane&quot; and its &quot;transformation&quot; from car to plane on the streets should also be regulated. (Imagine deploying and turning on those propellers in the middle of a narrow street, it would be necessary to take it to a heliport to transform it) apart from the control of the airspace and an endless number of other things (collisions with buildings?). It&#x27;s the classic pre-&quot;flying cars&quot; regulation from science fiction stories.')
