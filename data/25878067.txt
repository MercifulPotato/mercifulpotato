Neither intentionalists nor functionalists excuse the responsibility of anybody, least of all the organization&#x27;s leadership.  To both, the organization and its leaders are to be held responsible for the actions of the organization.  The functionalist model does not absolve anybody of guilt.<p>If you want to see the hazard of demanding proof of intention, look no further than the travesty of justice that occurred in the wake of Enron.  Every last Enron executive should have been jailed, but prosecutors had a hell of a time getting any of them convicted of anything because of this misguided obsession with proving intent.  And <i>nobody</i> from Arthur Anderson went to prison, for the same reason.<p>Obsession with intent allows the guilty to trot out the <i>&quot;we didn&#x27;t mean for this to happen, we&#x27;re all just idiots.&quot;</i> excuse.  Without a smoking gun email, that excuse is hard to conclusively disprove.  The antidote to that is strict liability; saying that their intentions are irrelevant and punishing them anyway.<p>Reminder, this is my point: <i>&quot;When software goes wrong, the company that decided to create and operate that software for profit is responsible for whatever negative impact that software might have, regardless of whether these problems were foreseen.&quot;</i>')
