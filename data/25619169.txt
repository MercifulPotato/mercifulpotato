Am I getting this right?<p>I wonder if POTUS has to at least sign all the kill orders.<p>EDIT FOLLOWS:<p>The problem is (independently) verifying that the targeted person was a combatant and in a war against USA. If anybody can be a combatant, CIA can kill anybody.

I don&#x27;t really think of (potential) terrorists as combatants.<p>* What about another organization designated as &quot;terrorist&quot;?
