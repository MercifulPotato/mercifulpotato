After some time macos hangs and then panics. I needed like 10 kernel panics to make it through the whole backup. Even better, I took my months of frustration to find out that my ssd was causing those panics. I mean who would suspect your backup device to be the root cause of kernel panics? It was connected to my screen so I completely forgot about itâ€˜s existence.')
