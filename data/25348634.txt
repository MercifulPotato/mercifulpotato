There needs to be good codec support on both ends and strong signal quality. All Bluetooth codecs are lossy, but the higher bitrate ones should not be perceptually different from lossless. Most of the problems with bad Bluetooth come from the SBC codec(degrades badly with low signal quality) or bad implementations. One advantage Apple has is that their AAC codec can transmit without any recompression if you are using an AAC source file. I have a Fiio Bluetooth dongle that uses LDAC with nice headphones and IEMs and I can absolutely not hear a difference with wired.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;wirecutter&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what-you-need-to-know-about-bluetooth-audio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;wirecutter&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what-you-need-to-kno...</a><p>And by the way, the Bose and Sony&#x27;s are considered top of the line for noise canceling wireless headphones. You absolutely lose sound quality from the noise canceling though, so that feature is a trade-off. Airpod Max may well be a contender, though it is not out yet, so it&#x27;s premature to give it the noise canceling crown.')
