Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607965331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419844, text='Anima Anandkumar (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anima_Anandkumar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anima_Anandkumar</a>) is a Director of AI at Nvidia, and a former Principal Scientist at AWS. She recently published a list of people she has blocked on Twitter as a list for her followers and AI&#x2F;diversity&#x2F;inclusivity communities to harass to try to &quot;change their views&quot;. She also further clarified in a later tweet that if these people cannot be convinced, they should be cancelled (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338298561692254209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;13382985616922542...</a>). She&#x27;s also looking to purge those who hold non-progressive views from the press (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338347254244024320" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;13383472542440243...</a>) as well as in academia even outside of the AI space. For instance, she is trying to pressure Harvard to drop renowned public intellectual Steven Pinker (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337997707386863616" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;13379977073868636...</a>).<p>Her feed is particularly focused on going after Pedro Domingos (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pmddomingos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pmddomingos</a>), a UW Professor who is also author of the bestselling &quot;Master Algorithm&quot;. Professor Domingos is not aligned to progressive&#x2F;far-left political views, which has made him a target for Anima Anandkumar as well as others. He has posted numerous comments that go against &quot;woke&quot; ideology, and has drawn attention from others in the academic community as someone to be purged for having different political views and opinions.<p>Lastly, Anima Anandkumar admitted her list contains false positives as well, meaning that some of the people she has targeted are not even people she meant to target (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338346125535821824" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnimaAnandkumar&#x2F;status&#x2F;13383461255358218...</a>). She asks that people DM her if there is a mistake, which is not possible since you can&#x27;t send DMs to someone who has blocked you. She claims here her list is not meant to be &quot;punitive&quot; even though she is urging followers to &quot;cancel&quot; those she lists.')
