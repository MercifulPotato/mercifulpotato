Kings and Emperors found that supplying their armies was much easier (especially in peace time) if they used the method of taxing the population in gold and&#x2F;or silver and then using that to pay their soldiers who would supply themselves on the open market. That way you did not have the standard problems of a planned economy. The peasants have now need for gold, so they would not need&#x2F;want to trade stuff for it unless they were forced to have some to give to the tax man. It&#x27;s much more complicated than that, of course, but like fiat money, gold and silver do not have much intrinsic value besides using it to show off your wealth.')
