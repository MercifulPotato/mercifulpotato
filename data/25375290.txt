If youâ€™re writing idiomatic Clojure this is the toughest case possible, as you end up littering your code with extremely similar cond-trees, which makes extension and verification unnecessarily hard.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t this where you would use multi-methods? If you can determine what the &quot;type&quot; of data is via `cond` (sounds like home-grown pattern matching?), couldn&#x27;t you replace these situations with multi-methods that switch on the same conditions?')
