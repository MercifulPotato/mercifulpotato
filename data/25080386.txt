I think what they were working on in the 2010s was how much the artic polar circle was at risk of breaking more often, and what that would mean for the average temperature (not much) and precipitations (probably drier winters&#x2F;springs in europe). Sadly they did not amke prediction about how much the polar winds descending south would kill buds and take a toll on orchards.')
