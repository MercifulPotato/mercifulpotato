So if you receive an email and call the police, nothing would change.<p>What you couldn&#x27;t do it save it for years and keep it as blackmail material &#x2F; until it&#x27;s politically opportune to use. Of course it&#x27;s not as clear cut as that, and an email may look harmless at the time, and only later, with more context, you might realize it contains evidence of misdeeds.
