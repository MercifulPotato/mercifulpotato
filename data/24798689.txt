The fixed timer is for the delayed ACK. That was a terrible idea. Both Linux and Windows now have a way to turn delayed ACKs off, but they&#x27;re still on by default.<p>TCP_QUICKACK, which turns off delayed ACKs, is in Linux, but the manual page is very confused about what it actually does. Apparently it turns itself off after a while. I wish someone would get that right. I&#x27;d disable delayed ACKs by default. It&#x27;s hard to think of a case today where they&#x27;re a significant win. As I&#x27;ve written in the past, delayed ACKs were a hack to make remote Telnet character echo work better.<p>A key point is asymmetry. If you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s doing lots of little writes, you can either turn set TCP_NODELAY at your end, or turn off delayed ACKs <i>at the other end</i>. If you can. Things doing lots of little writes but not filling up the pipe, typically game clients, can&#x27;t change the settings at the other end. So it became a standard practice to do what you could do at your end.')
