(not much of a backup, eh?)<p>4) You can only create per-channel exports, but this won&#x27;t export the entire chat, it will export up to ~12MB of recent media, and ignore the rest, silently. WhatsApp would only share the last 40 messages of a 4-year-old chat because the last few messages contained a few images.')
