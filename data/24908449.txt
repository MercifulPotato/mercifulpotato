You&#x27;re going to be paying probably $60-70 for spotty cellular service with a data cap and&#x2F;or throttling anyways, so might as well pay the little bit extra and not have to worry about it.<p>The one-time $500 setup&#x2F;equipment fee will be harder to justify. I expect Starlink will offer an option to spread that out over a year or two which would make it much easier for some households.')
