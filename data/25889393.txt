And furthermore: Any quantum mechanical system (i.e. all systems) is ultimately just a vibrational pattern, so trying to assign persistent identities to &quot;things&quot; is impossible because it&#x27;s like trying to label the peaks and troughs in some standing wave oscillating on some medium. The wave is a pattern only, and the peaks&#x2F;troughs are merely emergent phenomena with no actual identities, that have a history or a future, other than at the exact time of some observation.<p>My favorite philosophical thought experiment to ask people is: &quot;Do football stadium waves actually exist or is it merely people in two states (standing&#x2F;sitting)?&quot; The answer to that question is a superposition of both Yes and No. lol. It sounds like a silly question, but it actually gets to the heart of the deepest philosophical questions Physics.')
