When software systems were simpler, it was already difficult to know enough about a system to detect or observe abnormal behavior and that was with simple systems with a fairly deep understanding of how things <i>should</i> be.<p>Anymore, so many systems are some tower of SaaS APIs mixed with commercial on prem software, then mixed with internal developed software spread across multiple teams, developers with high turnover rates, focus on functional software over specification&#x2F;documentation for anyone to compare to, etc. that it seems like running over these issues are flukes discovered either by dedicated teams looking only for these issues (security auditing teams) or developers maintaining systems than happen to run across an abnormal behavior in the process of normal maintenance.')
