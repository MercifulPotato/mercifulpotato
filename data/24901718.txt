Item(by='nullc', descendants=None, kids=[24901846], score=None, time=1603747936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901421, text='&gt; did themselves a legal disservice by explicitly using copyrighted music video content as tests.<p>They had no alternative other than not having tests for that particular functionality. The tests were testing youtube-partner specific functionality: the procedure needed to download content from some youtube partners is different.<p>Moreover, the tests just throw away the downloaded material... it would be entirely reasonable for a court to conclude that there is no copyright interest involved in that activity at all and would be extraordinarily unlikely that any court would find it to be anything but fair use if they did conclude a copyright was involved at all.<p>If it hadn&#x27;t been the test cases the RIAA probably would have dug up some old forum post advocating infringement by some occasional contributor.  They were always going to argue something.')
