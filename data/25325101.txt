The last two jobs I had expected you to be fully productive in a month, and if you not had made major contributions in by 12 months (and more specifically didn&#x27;t fit in with management) you were going to be let go. Letting go of employees used to be relatively rare, but I find it&#x27;s becoming standard practice these days.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a single job I&#x27;ve had where ICs weren&#x27;t deploying code to production within two weeks and at full productivity in about a month.<p>Decades ago it used to be the case that you could take time to fit in, find your strengths and start growing. But the idea that you would &quot;just be getting started&quot; at 12 months is laughable.<p>Job &quot;hopping&quot; used to make sense a few years ago because it was the fastest way to get promoted. Now I would say it&#x27;s an essential survival skills as any place you aren&#x27;t happy at is likely seeing that an planning when they can start to pip you.')
