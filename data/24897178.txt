That&#x27;s it. It will probably end up being Rust, but that&#x27;s because Rust will eventually provide all the nice, clean, modern package management, idioms, libraries etc., not specifically because of the &#x27;safety&#x27;.<p>Granted I don&#x27;t want to diminish that in the attempt to create &#x27;proper memory management&#x27; you probably end up writing better software anyhow.')
