You, like many scientific materialists are asking for some study that shows you causality. The requirements of an IRB make it such that you most likely couldn&#x27;t study this, and if you can, the timeliness of the study would lag 5-10 years behind usefulness.<p>You only have to walk around Koreatown now to see this.
