Assumes 2 weeks unpaid vacation. And that&#x27;s assuming $0 expenses, so all revenue can go into your own crap salary. $1k MRR is $6&#x2F;hr, below minimum wage anywhere in the US. If all you&#x27;re getting is $1kMRR, you might as well just get a job at McDonalds, you&#x27;ll have a nice pay raise.')
