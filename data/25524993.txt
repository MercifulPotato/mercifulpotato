Users appreciate that. People like having a single point for discovery, reviews, updates, <i>and</i> refunds.<p>Every time an third-party app turned out to be different than advertised Apple refunded me within a day. Meanwhile an app which uses their own payments system screwed me over a month ago and I&#x27;m still waiting for a response from them.<p>Doesn&#x27;t campaigning for depriving users of the choice to use the App Store make <i>you</i> &quot;feel like a jackass!?&quot;')
