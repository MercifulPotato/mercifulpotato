As in, en masse, and in general? Or is it a loud and frustrated few, suggesting that &quot;people want this&quot;?<p>I genuinely believe that there are a few people who have raised the above concerns, loudly, some other loud people have hopped on the bandwagon, and most people don&#x27;t think about, nor care about, most of the things on this list.<p>Side nit:<p>On a fundamental level, &quot;wanting a right&quot; is an awkward fallacy, and this is border-lining a philosophical discussion. Like demanding a gift - it&#x27;s no longer a gift if you demand it be given to you.<p>Is this punitive language necessary or helpful in any way? It comes off as super childish to me to word a request like this...')
