It&#x27;s usually used to describe communicating with a hearing person who, for some reason other than physical hearing impairment, did not listen.<p>Therefor I think it is the exact opposite of a functional description. Instead it uses a physical disability to describe folks without that disability behaving in unproductive ways. Given that, it seems quite reasonable to say &quot;this phrase could be seen as excluding to folks who have that disability&quot;.')
