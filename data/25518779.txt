Clearly none are if a best-in-class screen recorder <i>just</i> gained the ability in a dev branch to recorder the screen under Wayland.<p>Ubuntu understands what I&#x27;m talking about-- 20.04 is <i>not</i> Wayland-based, and I doubt it took look for them to make that decision.<p>Whether best-in-class applications run correctly under Wayland is a perfectly reasonable and practical metric for Wayland&#x27;s current value to users.')
