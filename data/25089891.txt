A country that has been dependent on an oil-based extraction economy for decades and subject to brutal imperialism elects a socialist government that nationalizes... just that one industry, and the entirety of Western powers turn against them along with local national business owners, sabotaging their own points of sale as a form of economic warfare, instead selling across the border to support a black market.<p>As a reminder, despite the socialist label of the party in power, Venezuela has a significantly lower level of nationalization than France. But because France is not a target of both imperial <i>and</i> capital interests, but is instead firmly established as an imperial country itself, we don&#x27;t see sanctions or (inaccurate) dithering over election integrity.<p>Venezuela is what you get when you propose to move some of the power and profits away from capital and don&#x27;t have the footing to withstand their counterattack.')
