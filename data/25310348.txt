I mean, I presume that these are the dealerships that aren&#x27;t selling all that many cars, but... what total sales volume did they account for.  5%?  10%?  Does Cadillac want to lose that much of their total sales?  Do they want to <i>pay money</i> to lose that much of their total sales?<p>And, really, pay $300,000 for a dealership to go away, because the dealership wouldn&#x27;t pay $200,000 for a charging station.  Why not, you know, put up the $200,000, and keep the dealership?')
