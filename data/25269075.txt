The respondent group is 88% white people, 91% of the total group self-identifying with the literal string &quot;liberal&quot;. Less than 1% latinx, less than 1% blacks, less than 1% identifying by the literal string &quot;conservative&quot;. On top of that respondents were only targeted by Facebook and Twitter posts.<p>I guess it should be no surprise white liberals that respond to Facebook and Twitter posts are removing themselves from the gene pool. But maybe it&#x27;s not only them as other demographics are highly underrepresented in this study.')
