While it is probably more the case that newer protocols are serving newer content which is slower for myriad reasons, I find myself wondering if there are interesting correlations regarding what&#x27;s being served by older protocols. Is it the case the content on the older protocols is living in an intersection of mission critical to somebody (so it has never gone away due to simple lack of maintenance) and either sufficiently functional as is that nobody has seen a need to upgrade its infrastructure, or too deeply tied into a consumer that assumed quirks of a protocol for upgrading to be tractable?<p>It would be interesting to get a drill down on what is being served on those protocols.')
