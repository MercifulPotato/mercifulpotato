I have a strange compulsion to archive &#x27;stuff&#x27; like this for posterity. Even though, logically, I know it&#x27;s of no interest to anyone else apart from me and, after I&#x27;m gone and the &#x27;rental&#x27; is not being paid on it any more, it&#x27;ll all disappear forever.<p>Still, even though I very rarely look at any of it, I&#x27;m nonetheless comforted by the fact that it&#x27;s in safe storage. At least for as long as I&#x27;m around.<p>Ironically, one of the few things that actually gets me looking at old photos again is Google Photos &quot;This week X years ago&quot; feature, that pops up in the mobile app.  It&#x27;s fun to bore the missus with such nuggets of info as <i>&quot;Did you know, this week 7 years ago, we were in &lt;some place&gt; visiting &lt;some person&gt;?&quot;</i>')
