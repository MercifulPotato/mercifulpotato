It suggests, at least to my reading, that this virus was spreading in communities for several months before being noticed.  The fact that the IgM was found to be so much lower than IgG suggests an additional month or more before the September 2019 sample.  It also suggests that the virus may not have originated in China.<p>Both of these are at least vaguely plausible - if it was the in the early phases of exponential growth, and, unlikely as this is, didn&#x27;t make its way into high-risk groups during that time, then obviously it just had the appearance of a typical seasonal coronavirus.  If people over 65 didn&#x27;t exist, we&#x27;d probably have never even identified this virus.<p>The sample wasn&#x27;t random - it &quot;was  enrolled  from  September  2019  to  March  2020  through  the  SMILE  trial  (Screening and Multiple Intervention on Lung Epidemics; ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier:  NCT03654105),  a  prospec-tive lung cancer screening study using low-dose computed tomography  and  blood  biomarkers,  with  the  approval  of  our  institutional  review  board  and  ethics  committee.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what effect that might have in skewing the results; I look forward to expert analysis on this point.<p>On the second piece - the matter of origin - the evidence of Chinese origin is strong, but not airtight by any means.  It&#x27;s not altogether impossible for it to have emerged in Europe and been unnoticed.<p>Still, I have to believe that something is very wrong with this study, and that its findings are an error, until we these results reproduced or further analyzed.  As much as I&#x27;d love for it to be true.<p>The thing that I can&#x27;t reconcile is that seroprevalence this high wasn&#x27;t found in any surveys until much, much later - I believe late April 2020.  And there is no place that achieved seroprevalence without high-risk groups being affected (and substantial deaths as a result).  It seems likely that any situation in which these numbers are real has to at least have appeared as a very, very bad flu season, and that wasn&#x27;t the case in late 2019 in Europe.<p>So what the heck is happening here?<p>And why isn&#x27;t this huge, bombshell news around the world?  Far less meaningful studies have received much more bombastic coverage.')
