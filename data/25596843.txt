This  was the movie that made Kaufman famous (along with director Spike Jonze), around 1999.<p>It still holds up!  Great movie.  To be honest a lot of movies can&#x27;t hold my attention these days -- they&#x27;re &quot;thin&quot; and contrived to elicit certain reactions in the audience -- but this movie did after more than 20 years.
