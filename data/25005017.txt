Who do you think makes up VC capital from which startup investments are made? I don&#x27;t idealize rich people - as a whole, they have the same percent of assholes and criminals as any other group, and as people with many resources their assholery has an outsized impact sometimes - but claiming &quot;the rich are the reason&quot; for all problems and without them we&#x27;d all be paid tons of money of of somewhere magic - is just sheer idiocy. Sorry, I lived in a country where (almost) nobody was rich, at least legally - and it was shitty. I do not recommend it to anybody.')
