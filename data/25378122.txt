I buy a space and set up stalls for businesses to set up shop. The conditions for being part of this market are:<p>* You have to use my payment system.<p>* I get 30% of your gross revenue.<p>* You have to follow my guidelines about what you can and can&#x27;t sell and how you&#x27;re allowed to sell it.<p>* You can&#x27;t, while you&#x27;re at the market, advertise how customers can reach you outside the market. I&#x27;m not about to just let you use my space as an advertising channel for free.<p>And in this hypothetical universe my customers love it! They do all their shopping here. I can both see how businesses that don&#x27;t want to follow my rules would feel super frustrated but those rules are what makes my market worth coming to. My rules basically boil down to &quot;fuck you pay me&quot; and treat my customers well.')
