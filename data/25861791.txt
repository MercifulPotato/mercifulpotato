I have a bedroom that I&#x27;ve sealed quite well with 2 box fans constantly running filtering the air (tape a 20x20 filter to a box fan and it works great). When I work with media or anything I also use a flame. I still have some problems with contamination, but it is manageable.<p>There are also biological ways to get around contamination problems. So long as your media is clean, if you use a strain like Vibrio natriegens, it just outgrows literally everything, so it&#x27;s not that big of a worry.<p>I have a few ruuvitags + a raspberry pi to monitor the temperature, and I live in Coastal California, so we don&#x27;t have that much fluctuation. It hasn&#x27;t mattered for my experiments, anyway, which are mainly just DNA cloning.')
