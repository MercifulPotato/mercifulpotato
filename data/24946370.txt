The max theoretical is 500MB&#x2F;sec. So you can&#x27;t ever touch 10G with it. In reality  getting 75% of theoretical on PCIe tends to be a rough upper limit on most PCIe interfaces, so the 3Gbit your seeing is pretty close to what one would expect.<p>edit: Oh its 3Gbit across 5 interfaces, one of which isn&#x27;t PCIe, so the PCIe side is probably only running at about 50%. It might be interesting to see if the CPUs are pegged (or just one of them). Even so, PCIe on the rpi isn&#x27;t coherent so that is going to slow things down too.')
