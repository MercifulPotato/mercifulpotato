By default it emits one control-G, but if it is passed a numeric argument, it emits N dings in a row with a sleep 1 between each.<p>A few years back I was in a grind on a project where I would kick off regressions, then 30-90 minutes later they&#x27;d finish depending on how many slots I was getting in the server farm. I had a script that sent a message to my personal email account with a magic subject line. On my email client I had a filter that detected that subject line and attached a &quot;play a sound&quot; action to that filter, with the sound being an alarm clock going off.  That way I could kick off a regression, take a nap, then get woken up when it finished.')
