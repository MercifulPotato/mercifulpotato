I hear the word &quot;call option&quot; and I start chasing down what it means. I start buying them just to touch and feel the mechanics of how they work. I am a hands on learner who just plays with things. I want to build intuition. If I get stuck or having recurring thoughts&#x2F;pains about something I will look on Google&#x2F;youtube to get to the bottom of it, but it takes time and practice to arrive at these questions.<p>I recommend just getting into it.
