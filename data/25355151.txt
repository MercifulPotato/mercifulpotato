They have delicate flavor. However, nobody likes them in the US... potatos have to be at least deep fried and better yet dipped into some crap. Reminds me of when I was in Munich with some American friends and they thought pork (and potatoes etc.) were flavorless... it just had the flavor of pork :)<p>I feel like the worst parts of the US diet are not the staples or the meats or anything like that, it&#x27;s all the additions - too much butter, ketchup, dressings, syrups, sauces, cheeses, added bread (crusts, buns and crumbs) etc. on everything. When your taste buds are nuked by this stuff all the time it&#x27;s hard to appreciate subtle flavors.')
