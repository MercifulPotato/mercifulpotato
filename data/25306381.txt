The topic was that a net trained mostly on white people&#x27;s faces upsamples a downsampled photo of a half-black man (Barack Obama) into a generic white face. LeCun&#x27;s point is this is no surprise. If you trained it on leopards, it would upsample pixelated human faces into leopard faces instead. LeCun is an expert on how these nets work.')
