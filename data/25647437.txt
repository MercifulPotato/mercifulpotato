With VSCode I don&#x27;t feel like I have to choose between feature set and responsiveness, and as such I haven&#x27;t used either in several years.<p>I won&#x27;t say VSCode is <i>more</i> responsive than Notepad++&#x2F;Sublime, but I will say any difference is small enough that I don&#x27;t notice&#x2F;care<p>[1] Eclipse is Java, but that&#x27;s arguably still more &quot;native&quot; than Electron')
