Effectively they are giving drugs that alter ones perception of reality and then judging their effectiveness on the patients perspective.  But since they alter their perception of reality it&#x27;s tough to rely on patient reports.<p>Anecdotally speaking, there&#x27;s a lot of people in this world that think drugs make their lives better when an objective observer would pretty strongly disagree.  That raises a lot of difficult questions.  Most notably, do we give someone a drug that will make their life worse but also make them think their life is better.')
