I am currently in Australia, which shut down early and has been serious about fighting this from the beginning, despite repeated outbreaks from international travel, most recently in Victoria, which prompted a hard and long shutdown...that worked.&quot;</i><p>Except that it <i>didn&#x27;t</i> work. You did it once, and it came back. So now you&#x27;re doing it again.<p>And you&#x27;ll <i>keep</i> doing it again and again, unless you plan on keeping Australia isolated from the world until a vaccine has been administered to some huge percentage of the world population. Even if you do keep Australia isolated, it&#x27;s clearly not a cure, either: the current outbreak happened in spite of your country&#x27;s travel ban.<p>Reasonable people can certainly disagree about the trade-offs involved here, but you have to start from facts.')
