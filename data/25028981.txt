I keep asking you why you skip context and only use Y and you have no answer other than to say it&#x27;s different from X and is the &quot;real&quot; answer. This is, quite literally, redefining the terms to support your bias. Why are you so insistent on saying there is &quot;no real left&quot; in the USA when there clearly is? Who cares about these outdated global definitions? You&#x27;re disagreeing with the entire country to do what exactly?<p>I take great care in my discussions to be as objective and concise as possible, while focusing on the actual arguments and asking questions to get to the root of the matter. You clearly haven&#x27;t read my thousands of comments on this site if you think otherwise. However I find that you constantly use the same &quot;good faith&quot; excuse every time. Why is that? If your position can&#x27;t be clearly communicated and so easily breaks down under light questioning, then it&#x27;s a failure of your position.<p>But since this isn&#x27;t going anywhere, I&#x27;ll end it here.')
