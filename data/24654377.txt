The notation was confusing at nearly every level of my education perhaps starting with operator precedence in arithmetic and escalating exponentially in college with more advanced forms of math. I remember nearly flunking calculus (saved by a merciful curve) with no concrete understanding, only to find in my later engineering curves that calculus was downright <i>easy</i> and <i>intuitive</i> to me, but the notation (and perhaps the pedagogy) were inhibiting.<p>To this day, when I&#x27;m reading computer science papers, I have to look really hard to make sense of the math gibbrish and get at the actual meaning, and often when I do I realize that it would have been much clearer in a few lines of JavaScript or Python or Go or Rust or just about anything else.<p>Well, perhaps anything except Haskell, OCaml, and similar. Even after learning the syntax, I still haven&#x27;t internalized it as effortlessly as I did with other languages. Note that lisp is not very algol-like and I have a much easier time parsing it than I do Haskell despite relatively equal familiarity. I think Haskell has given us a lot of great ideas, and thankfully they&#x27;ve filtered down from the Ivory Tower of academic languages into pragmatic mainstream languages, such as Rust.')
