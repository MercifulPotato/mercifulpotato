I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a clear dividing line between science and engineering.<p>SpaceX has numberous &quot;firsts&quot;, including reusable rockets and some engine designs. So it&#x27;s not right to say they just do things we&#x27;ve been doing for decades.<p>And on the other end, the physics behind fusion is pretty well understood.

If a private company were doing the same thing, it would be called R&amp;D.')
