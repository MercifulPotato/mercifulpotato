It&#x27;s probably just a bit of time to digest the trade agreement and figure out what the best thing is going forward, shich I would guess is probably finding a way to ship UK destined saddles within the UK to avoid customs.<p>For some of the other bicycle companies mentioned, it seems they don&#x27;t have UK operations, so they may not want to have formal relations with the UK government. They&#x27;ll need time to figure it out too, but probably worst case is they&#x27;ll end direct mail order sales to the UK, and you&#x27;d have to buy through a retailer. But, again after some time to understand the new rules.')
