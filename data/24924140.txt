He is also a chemist and why his knowledge of engineering is better then those of the engineers at SpaceX and Elon Musk is highly questionable to me.<p>&gt; the safety issues of a car breaking down in a tunnel<p>The cars have front radar and can break. It would stop the line but I don&#x27;t see how it is a safety issue. Most danger in tunnels is from bidirectional traffic that Boring avoids.<p>&gt;  the enormous cost with digging deeper tunnels<p>The same could have been said about other Elon Musk projects. Nobody is surprised that an electric car can have better performance and power and yet a diesel driven tunnel boring machine can not be improved? Tunneling is incredibly conservative and uses both diesel driven tunnel boring and diesel driven locomotives to transport out the dirt. The inherent problems of having lots of diesel engines a tunnel are quite clear and eliminating it has clear operational advantages.<p>&gt; underground road tunnels are just not economical or particularly safe<p>What the evidence for underground one-way tunnels not being safe?<p>&gt; These kind of infrastructure problems are just hard and have a ton of trade offs, there is no silver bullet.<p>Therefore we should try to improve it with modern technology from other fields? Its not a silver bullet, it is tacking new technology from automotive and aerospace and applying it to tunneling and mass transportation.')
