I had a &quot;userService&quot; machine (embedded in a React UI) that handled all the legwork of an OAuth2 flow and ended with the user in an &quot;authenticated&quot; state with their details as part of the machine context (for use in any other part of the app via a custom hook).<p>You are absolutely right, it couldn&#x27;t be wrong. It always just worked exactly the way it was supposed to.<p>I&#x27;m now working on a project that handles logins via a set of disconnected boolean flags flowing through redux and it is a mess.')
