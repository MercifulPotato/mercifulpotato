I sampled a good number of religions and spirituality. I know for a fact I can train my brain to believe that I have an invisible soul that will live on. Or only if I die in battle. Or only if I wear a cross that has been blessed by the Pope. Or only if I smoke the right sacred herbs. Or only if body is preserved a certain way.
