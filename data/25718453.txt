I\njoined the company ~3.5 years ago. Since joining the company I have been\npromoted twice. My performance reviews are always very very good. I am liked by\nthe vast majority of my colleagues. They respect me because I know my stuff but\nalso because I am down to earth, relaxed and always helpful. We have a pretty\nopen feedback culture among colleagues.<p>This all sounds good and all but since I joined the company my satisfaction with\nwork went downhill. My main concern is the toxic new management I got about a\nyear ago. She is constantly gaslighting me + others. I have tried to talk to her. I tried to make things better - even give\nher tipps about what kind of actions could make my colleagues and me more\nhappy.<p>My manager is only one problem though. I think the whole company has\nissues. The company behaves irradic. Changes direction every 6 months -\nwhich is kind of okay for a startup&#x2F;small company but not for a big company. Right?\nSometimes projects are cancelled because of minor things (beta release 1w late).<p>I have worked on multiple projects - all but 1 got cancelled.<p>I like the “every yes needs 1000 now” approach - it really weeds out the\nbad stuff - but here nobody understands the reason behind the &quot;no&quot;.\nunderstands.<p>I really tried to change things here. I talked to many people. Talked openly.\nYou might ask: Why not just leave?\nThe truth is that I am half burned out. The last project I worked on got\neverything from me. I wanted to impress my manager in the\nhopes for more openness. More reasonable discussions. It just went downhill.\nOn the one hand I know that I can be gold for a company. But at the moment I am\nunable to really do something. Easy tasks are no longer easy for me. I don’t\nhave the self-confidence to just walk away. I need some advice. I feel that I\ncould do much more but my current circumstances limit everything. \nWhat would you do?')
