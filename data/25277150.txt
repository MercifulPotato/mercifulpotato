I would rather have 1 genuine relationship, rather than 100 superficial, inauthentic relationships.<p>I would say you&#x27;re looking at it completely wrong and you don&#x27;t have to forget somebodies birthday that many times before you write it down because all it does is hurt everybody.  Some segment of the population forgets these things EVEN WITH the inner circle of people they know.')
