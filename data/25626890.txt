It’s not crazy to think that modules of equivalent quality (same brand, same chip part numbers) would experience a greater incidence of that kind of single bit flip (which would be corrected on the ECC modules). If a manufacturer were shipping chips prone to bit flipping because of slightly radioactive packaging, as happened at times in the past, you might see something similar.<p>But you’ve got it backwards about the incentives. A manufacturer has <i>less </i> incentive to deliberately ship a defective part in the case of ECC modules. If the modules consistently log ECC errors, they can easily be identified and returned under warranty to the manufacturer. A consumer is much less likely to identify an intermittent problem with a non-ECC part.')
