Management wanted to minimize getting security clearance for employees since it involved a substantial amount of money&#x2F;effort to get and then it was almost guaranteed that the employee would immediately jump ship to another better paying job requiring clearance elsewhere.<p>The other disturbing trend I learned about was how even if a company lost a contract, they would almost inevitably still work on it as a subcontractor for whoever the new contractor was.  Part of that makes sense but it gave me the impression that no one ever really loses a contract.')
