Everyone should try and get as many interviews as possible. And a friendly and weird suggestion is this.. record your call (YOUR voice) and replay the mp3 later. And listen to what you said. 99% of the people never wonder what they said, never have mock interviews with a friend&#x2F;colleague. You hear them on a call with a recruiter, it is a trainwreck, and you ask them and they think it was brilliant.<p>Feedback, feedback, feedback!')
