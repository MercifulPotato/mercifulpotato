Item(by='hwc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605295652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085687, text='&gt; I have significant doubts that we will see it launch at that price-point within the next 10 years.<p>But what if it is only half as expensive per ton to low-Earth orbit as Falcon-9&#x2F;Heavy?  And if it can only deliver 100 tons at a time, not 150?<p>That&#x27;s still going to dominate the launch market for some time.<p>If they eventually prove it to be safe for human passengers and can demonstrate in-orbit refueling?  It then replaces SLS, and is still a fraction of the cost.')
