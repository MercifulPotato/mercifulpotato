This is a project website that I built out of frustration a few years ago. I know there are things that need improving and a lot of things that could be adjusted. I work full time at Brave Software (brave.com) and simply don&#x27;t have time to put a ton of effort into MuslceWiki.<p>I do however have a big backlog of videos to add and I&#x27;ve slowly been working on an app. We have also re-drawn the homepage images and my long term plan is to move away from gifs to webm or MP4.<p>FWIW, for some reason I was unable to log into my HN account. I made a new one, but the posts seem to be limited. So looks like I&#x27;ll be replying in the morning.')
