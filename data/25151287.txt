It is ok to forget later, as long as you are sure you understood it at least when there was a lot of discussion about that specific part of course material.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand something today, it is very likely the material tomorrow will refer to it and you will not understand that either. Even if you try to make up for it in couple of days, it will be rushed, will require more effort and your brain connections will not be the same quality.<p>Every person will have a different way to achieve that goal. Some people need to ask questions, some like to figure out by themselves, some will want to read, solve exercises for as long as necessary.<p>I have observed many people drop off and the reason was almost invariably the same. A bit of material passes by or maybe the load is too much, and the slippery slope of not understanding starts.<p>Especially when you start to study mathematics, the first couple semesters are foundational and if you don&#x27;t understand something it is like a pyramid, the further in time the more connections with the material that you did not understood and the more trouble you are in.<p>I have seen people drop off because they thought it is the same as in their past or in other study areas. It is not. Mathematics is extremely connected internally and extremely intolerant of ignorance.')
