Take the tab example: The author seems to imply that PCRE is needed to match a tab because there is no \\t escape sequence in BRE&#x2F;ERE. Presumably he cannot just type in a tab because he&#x27;s using a shell like bash, and tab has a special interpretation and cannot be typed in as a string literal.<p>The way around this is to use ^V as a <i>terminal</i> escape sequence, followed by simply pressing the tab key. This technique can be used to insert other control characters as string literals in arguments. Want to grep for EOF? &quot;grep ^V^D&quot; will get you there.')
