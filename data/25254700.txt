Item(by='piva00', descendants=None, kids=[25257478, 25255225], score=None, time=1606749963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253712, text='&gt; I think while you don&#x27;t have &quot;FU money&quot; it&#x27;s important for money to be the main focus of your life. You don&#x27;t have freedom if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money and you can&#x27;t be 100% happy without freedom, at least in my experience, though I know opinions vary here.<p>The thing is that not everyone can or will achieve that. If we know that, what&#x27;s the main drive for others to do that? We don&#x27;t live in a system where this is possible, I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve achieved it but preaching this &quot;money should be the main focus of your life until you have FU money&quot; will just make a lot of people frustrated and unfulfilled.<p>So why should that be the main goal of anyone&#x27;s life when there is so much more to life than that? Are we all slaves to money then? Are our lives only meant to be lived after we are free from the shackles of money?<p>I really don&#x27;t like that perspective.')
