It just isn’t. Why would the rules that govern the phone network make sense to apply to Wikipedia?<p>It’s weird to be having this argument on one of the very forums that benefits from 230. Do you think HN would be a better place if it were forbidden from moderating content? Were you here before dang came along? Can you imagine how much spam gets deleted before we see it and how unusable it would be if it didn’t?<p>And not for nothing but I wish my phone company would do an better job of moderating the junk calls and spam texts I get.<p>But set the phone company metaphor aside: I still don’t understand what outcome you want for social media. How do you imagine it will look? Or is this actually intended to put them all out of business? If so, taking down every comment section and discussion board seems like a lot of collateral damage.')
