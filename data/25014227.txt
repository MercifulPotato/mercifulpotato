Item(by='raducu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604744102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013984, text='I really like zolpidem and other substances.  \nI almost never took them for more than 3 consecutive days.  \nI still have a lot of zolpidem laying around and don&#x27;t take it, because I know the brain gets uses to them and the magic is gone. Amazing how people react differently to addicting substances.<p>Back when I used zolpidem, I found that it is best to use it as a reset button, not as a daily crutch.<p>I do take 300mcg melatonin but I found it has no diminishing returns and in fact it has a negative feedback -- after 3 days of melatonin, I don&#x27;t need it for at least another week.  \nI keep the zolpidem for &quot;recreational&quot; usage, but I don&#x27;t want to use it with my wife and daughter in the house in the remote possibility I get sleepwalking(never actually happened, I just get amazing auditory hallucinations before I fall asleep).')
