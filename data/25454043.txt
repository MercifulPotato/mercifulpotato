I&#x27;ve experienced that knowing the abstract theory of linear algebra is actually just taking away time and resources that could have been spent in increasing your competence in the non abstract parts of linear algebra. A lot of students aren&#x27;t ready for industry, not because they are incompetent or not smart enough but rather because they have directed all their time and energy on solving difficult problems which meant they had no time for the boat load of easy problems that industry actually needs.')
