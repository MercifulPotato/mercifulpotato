If they got an order, they could buy the item from another amazon seller, and onsell the item for a profit.<p>This broke in a predictably amusing way when there were only a few vendors for an item, and all of them were doing the same thing - each vendor updating their price to be higher than the others, quickly spiralling up to ludicrous values.')
