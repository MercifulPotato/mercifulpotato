Item(by='rvba', descendants=None, kids=[25132209], score=None, time=1605662332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130458, text='What is the purpose of this post apart from self promotion of its author?<p>It looks like some sort of a &quot;textual CV&quot;, where the author tries to push the agenda that he is not only a technical expert (without any real examples, just buzzwords), but also a managerial expert (here even less examples, just sucking own dick).<p>We can learn that he worked &quot;really hard&quot; on IBM products, so hard that he fell asleep during work (dear recruiters I can work hard at a startup, pleas hire me!!!), yet those products seem to be so irrelevant, that once when he writes about cloud, he does not even have the courtesy to list IBM as a cloud provider.<p>Also the integrity of this piece: guy writes about others changing their jobs to maximize the salary, but of course at the time when the author switched job, he didnt do it for better money, he did it for the great product and great team :)<p>IBM is a sinking ship, so for me it looks just like a story of a guy who changed job to earn more money, which for some reason allowed him to put his CV on their own website, so he can be headhunted by someone else (who will pay him even more money?).')
