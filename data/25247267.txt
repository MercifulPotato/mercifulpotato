A moderation marketplace is good for platforms because they don’t want to be the arbiter of truth, they just want users to have a good experience</i><p>&gt; <i>It’s good for users because they’re not forced into anything; they can pick which web they want to dwell on. This may sound like a filter bubble, where ‘everyone has their own truth’, but moderation vendors will still need to maintain their reputation for being right</i><p>The author is overly optimistic in thinking that people who fall for blatant misinformation, will not fall for grossly biased or incompetent moderators. Anyone who believes Trump&#x27;s election-was-stolen conspiracy theory, will also have blind faith in any moderator that Trump and his movement endorses, regardless of the moderator&#x27;s reputation among mainstream sources.<p>You may say that doesn&#x27;t matter because the vast majority of people will never tweak their settings and will simply use the platform&#x27;s default moderator. Which is a good point, but once again, that brings us back to the status quo where people get upset about the &quot;bias&quot; shown by the platform and its anointed default moderator. I do like the idea of decoupling the platform corporation and the moderator, but it still raises questions about who gets to control the moderator organization.<p>Call me crazy but these misinformation campaigns have made one thing abundantly clear. Popular voting is inherently susceptible to actively-misinformed voters and there are no palatable solutions to this problem. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlookzen.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;reasons-to-replace-the-popular-vote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlookzen.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;reasons-to-replace-the-pop...</a>')
