It&#x27;s not, though, so this is a stupid idea.&quot;</i><p>I have to disagree.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s part of the plan, but if cocaine were to become legal in Colombia, then Colombia could become a destination for cocaine tourism, just as the Netherlands became a destination for marijuana tourism.<p>That could result in a lot of tourism revenue (as has been the case for the Netherlands and other countries which legalized drugs).<p>In addition, legalizing cocaine would end organized crime&#x27;s involvement in cocaine production in Colombia, which would be a huge improvement for the lives of Colombians and for their government and legal system, which are all currently detrimentally impacted by said organized crime and the horrific and widespread violence and corruption that it causes.<p>The increased safety of Colombia, once organized crime is reduced would make it even more desirable as a tourist destination, which would bring in even more tourism revenue.<p>Add to that all the tax revenue that would come from taxing legal cocaine, and the financial incentives for legalizing cocaine become even greater.<p>This sounds like very far from a bad idea, and is in fact the exact same reasoning that was used to legalize drugs in other places all over the world and, to my knowledge, in all cases where this has happened it&#x27;s been a net positive.')
