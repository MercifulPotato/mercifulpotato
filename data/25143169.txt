Those are time-reversible.<p>There are other processes which are not of such kind. Some people don&#x27;t want to call those quantum processes, but they sure do have a prominent place in QM textbooks. For example spontaneous emission of light from an excited atom or radioactive decay of uranium atomic nucleus. Description of these processes isn&#x27;t reducible to unitary evolution, instead irreversibility is assumed by employing the golden rule.')
