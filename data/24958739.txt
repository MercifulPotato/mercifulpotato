Attempts to unbundle that have failed because they can&#x27;t sustain themselves. FB and google just gatekeep too much of the advertising pie. Things like substack attempt to use alternative models, but that is limited imho, their market size is not that big. If someone could unbundle advertising, we already have had the unbundled version of FB groups before: forums, communities etc.')
