Bringing up European laws on intellectual property and mixing it with US &quot;copyright&quot; is comical to me, especially after reading this [0] article on French law recently:<p>&gt; France doesn’t have copyright. Sorry for US readers, your “copyright” is nonsense that doesn’t apply here, though the word “copyright” can be seen misused verbatim once in a while.<p>I believe this interpretation of &quot;copyright&quot; is all similar around Europe. US copyright law is all about &quot;right to make copies&quot;, be it software or music&#x2F;video and it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense on the other side of the globe.<p>In the country where I live I can purchase a music or video file and legally make unlimited copies for my personal use. It is also legal to download it from any other source as long as I can prove that I paid for it some time ago in the past. Torrents are illegal as the protocol forces me to share the file, and sharing part is illegal. Downloading is fine xD.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehftguy.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;french-judge-rules-gpl-license-to-be-inapplicable-in-french-copyright-court&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehftguy.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;french-judge-rules-gpl-lice...</a>')
