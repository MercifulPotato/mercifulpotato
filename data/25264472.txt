I&#x27;ve cleaned my shower with aerosolised alcohol spray. Even with an open window and a cloth on my nose, I got quite tipsy &#x2F; giggly and ended up with strong headache. I was definitely not functional afterwards, or at least not safe to work.<p>I&#x27;d much rather drink a beer.<p>Edit: I misremembered. The product I used was Isopropyl Alcohol, which is not what&#x27;s mentioned here. Still, leaving as a warning if anyone thinks of trying.')
