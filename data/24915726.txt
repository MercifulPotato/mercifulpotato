To tell someone or something what to do you have to &quot;talk to&quot; them.  You need some language to do that. And when you are talking to a computer, the languages they understand are called programming languages, in other words &quot;code&quot;.<p>Another way of looking at is that English is code as well. It is code we use to communicate with humans.<p>Now maybe there is some visual language that could be used to communicate with a computer effectively, but then that is a language too, and thus is code.<p>What &quot;no-code&quot; could ultimately be is a system where the computer asks you to choose from set of options and based on your choices incrementally generates a program, a bit like when you install Linux it asks you a set of questions, and you answer and in the end you have a working system which you created without talking in code, unless yes&#x2F;no is considered a trivial (binary) code as well. But it is a very limited set of programs you can create that way in a limited time.')
