Not only that, but it was pre emptive. We can talk all day about GME, but the handful of other names like BB hadn&#x27;t even reached that point.  There was simply a risk of a short squeeze and we slanted the field here, too, enough time for the losing side to mitigate their risk.<p>Conspiracy or no, the end result is so far from your day trading 25K minimum example. Your example is a rule that already existed going in, rather than a rule that changed temporarily to convenience one side for a day.')
