Strictly speaking <i>the</i> Mafia solely exists in Sicily.<p>Likewise for the names of the five families, created by the media after the Joe Valachi hearings; cosa nostra members simply adopted the names for themselves. Internally, different groups under a distinct boss are referred to as &quot;borgata&quot;.<p>Colombo capo Michael Franzese has spoken on the infuence mannerisms and behavior found in The Godfather had an impact on actual guys on the street as they adopted the behaviors and idolized the movies. The Sopranos does a lot to point this out.<p>It&#x27;s interesting though that the article leaves out Joe Colombo himself commendeering and editing the script of The Godfather for all references to the word &quot;mafia&quot; and other related offenses which really did happen.<p>Franzese is also on the record asserting technological change and RICO sentences ended the prominence of the mob.')
