Probably not for all of medicine but generally speaking it is.<p>I recently started having a relapse of debilitating cluster headaches for a couple of weeks for the first time in about a half a decade (maybe longer). I tried avoiding all the typical triggers: Caffeine, chocolate, dust, smoke (difficult in winter when the neighbors love their fires), etc. Nothing worked.<p>Then I remembered: Ah hah! Sinus infections. I&#x27;d forgotten that the underlying trigger for me almost 90% of the time is a sinus infection I didn&#x27;t notice that got out of hand. About halfway through a course of antibiotics the headaches have largely subsided.<p>Problem is that my sinus infections never seem to manifest typically, probably due to anatomical abnormalities. This typically means that a week or longer of back-and-forth &quot;we don&#x27;t see anything wrong&quot; with the doctor worsens the problem until the pressure and pain builds up to a point that touching anywhere near the sinuses is very unpleasant. The best preventative measure I have, and probably the reason I avoided them for so long, is to do regular sinus irrigation. I lapsed about 6 months ago and stopped doing it--whoops.<p>Most practitioners are fine if you fit the majority of cases and the literature. If you deviate outside that, it&#x27;s much more difficult to diagnose for the reasons you highlighted regarding complex systems. Humans just suck at it.<p>I don&#x27;t have much advice other than to learn and know your own body. You probably know it better than any doctor. But you also need to become your own advocate if you think something isn&#x27;t quite right and you need some help!')
