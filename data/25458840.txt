For me, the switch to group mailboxes in urban&#x2F;suburban areas reduced package theft, since my last few group mailboxes have had parcel lockers, so I attributed that to the lack of USPS concern regarding package theft. I&#x27;ve only had one item delivered to the door by USPs in the last 6 years or so.<p>That&#x27;s my major concern with the attempt to privatize the postal service. Right now, parcels through USPS are protected federally, but I don&#x27;t think that extends to private couriers like UPS&#x2F;FedEx&#x2F;Amazon. These private couriers are also unable to use your mailbox&#x2F;parcel lockers (which does make sense since these individuals aren&#x27;t vetted like postal employees are).<p>Removing protections from parcels by privatizing all mail is rather chilling, as I strongly doubt we&#x27;ll get similar legal protections.')
