Deleting your data from a website which publicly displays your private information is a nightmare and often unsuccessful.<p>On that note, a pro tip for anyone incorporating a company in India. Give a separate email id, phone number when you incorporate because as soon as its available on the MCA(Ministry of Corporate Affairs) database the brokers buy it for (~ INR 100&#x2F; ~1.37 USD) legally and put it out for sale to the spammers&#x2F;scammers often displaying the email id publicly.<p>It will feel intuitive to give your personal phone, email in the forms when starting a company but you&#x27;ll regret it. I&#x27;m waiting for the Data-Privacy legislation to be passed, so I can sue the X out of these brokers; Until then I&#x27;m creating an account with these brokers to delete my own details and if not possible then updating it with fake data.')
