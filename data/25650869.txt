Headless servers doing basic file and network I&#x2F;O are pretty reasonable to sandbox. This is what Docker does.<p>But GUI applications are a whole different thing. The standards simply don&#x27;t exist to make that easy. It&#x27;s not just basic graphics. Things like internationalized text rendering, text input, and accessibility are ridiculously hard and only a few mostly-complete implementations exist. (Such as in browsers and operating systems.) And they need to keep moving as the culture changes; you want to support the latest emojis, right? Well maybe you don&#x27;t, but your users will.<p>Furthermore, these implementations are at least partially specific to particular programming languages. If you want something portable, you might build on the Skia graphics library but that won&#x27;t give you a way to build an app on its own.')
