Item(by='athms', descendants=None, kids=[25587993], score=None, time=1609366903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586389, text='&gt;Organic isn’t about greenhouse gases, it’s about keeping toxins out of food.<p>Organic is about selling expensive food to stupid people.<p>There is nothing inherently better about organic. It isn&#x27;t healthier. It isn&#x27;t better for the environment. At best, the yields are equal, but normally they are lower. With lower yields come higher prices. There are plenty of organic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers that are just as dangerous as synthetic varieties. There are more cases of food recalls for organic contamination than synthetic.<p>The issue with GMO is not food safety, it is patents. The use of GMO crops have reduced chemical usage while increasing yields. They have also introduced critical vitamins and minerals to groups of people that have deficient levels. This has been a boon in Africa.')
