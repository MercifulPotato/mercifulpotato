Item(by='alexashka', descendants=None, kids=[25051216], score=None, time=1605038246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050688, text='Yes, poll people who invest in YC start-ups if they&#x27;d be willing to invest in start-ups that improve upon HackerNews forums.<p>That should generate a few million.<p>Then hire somebody with a proven track record to oversee proposals for additions to existing HackerNews.<p>In other words, get money, then crowdsource ideas, then pay people to implement ideas with most votes, then provide beta tests, then provide HackerNews add-ons for a small fee that would cover the expenses. Run it as a non-profit.<p>---<p>Has this been tried before? Is this the first time you hear of such a proposal?<p>---<p>I&#x27;ll throw in two more ideas - make any action taken by a moderator public, with blanked out content that is flagrantly illegal (links to child pornography)<p>Make it possible to dispute any moderator action for a fee, in other words move from a dictatorship to a democracy.<p>HackerNews need not be a dictatorship where what moderators think is good, is what&#x27;s going to be enforced upon the rest.<p>There can be thousands of HackerNews that are filtered, sorted and moderated differently, based on people&#x27;s preferences. This would be trivially made possible by asking people who&#x27;d be interested in such a service, to pay a small monthly fee.<p>---<p>Trivial change - <i>please</i> make it possible to block specific users based on name&#x2F;how long they&#x27;ve been registered on site for X-number of days. For example if I see someone routinely making comments I am not interested in, who does it benefit for me to continue reading their input? It only causes tension, it&#x27;s like having to live with people you are fundamentally opposed to with no recourse other than leaving (no longer reading the comments section)<p>I predict this feature alone would decrease tensions among regular readers significantly, making your job easier.')
