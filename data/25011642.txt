Having bought a cheap HP inkjet printer recently, I was curious about the free ink plan.  But it&#x27;s a trick - you can&#x27;t agree to the free ink, then just buy 3rd party ink when you want more.  No, if you go over 15 pages a month, the IOT printer will automatically order you the ink and bill your account.  Buying cheaper ink will just be a waste of ink because you won&#x27;t be able to print with it without ordering more HP ink.<p>That is truly evil.')
