The menu UX is horrendous, there are numerous ridiculous bugs concerning characters T-posing, clipping through world geometry, animations failing to play or have key objects characters are supposed to interact with floating in random places.<p>These taken together make the game seem like a sloppy mess, regardless of how much money they appear to have poured into the rendering pipeline.<p>The fact that the game is such a disaster on current gen consoles should not be excused when a game’s production cycle has predominantly been during those consoles existence. Why are we letting companies off the hook when they advertise a product and fail to deliver, because we perceive that hardware as being unable to handle it? Rockstar has excelled at launching games of a similar complexity across multiple console generations. GTAV ran on hardware 2 generations old so let’s not pretend that this is out of reach for a AAA developer with hundreds of staff. I have little sympathy for a major developer and publisher failing to live up to the hype that they created or courted, and leaned into up until a disastrous release.')
