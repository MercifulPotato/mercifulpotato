Item(by='jarboot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611607143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908428, text='&gt; The basic surface-level story of WSB is this. It’s a bunch of autistic losers that live in their mom’s basement who are gambling what little money they have to try and become rich to live lifestyles of hedonism.<p>&gt; On the surface, it seems really weird but it’s mostly a type of gallows humor that permeates a lot of especially young millennials and zennial men.<p>The key is &quot;the basic surface-level story&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s mostly a type of gallows humor&quot;. It&#x27;s a story or myth, not reality. You&#x27;ll see a lot of this self-deprecating humor on other 4chan-adjacent communities.<p>Also, I do not think that Jeromy Sonne is speaking from a position of experience with the wsb community. He has an entry-level understanding of internet communities but the article is mostly fluff and speculation instead of first-hand knowledge or research. Plus, a lot of content on wsb is &quot;artistic works of fiction and falsehood&quot;, just like 4chan.')
