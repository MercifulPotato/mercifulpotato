But if that&#x27;s not sufficient for you, you could get the X1 Extreme which is the &quot;Pro&quot; version of the X1 Carbon, or you could get the Thinkpad P1 (ultra-portable workstation) or even a Thinkpad T series (corporate focused - cheaper than X1 &amp; P series). X1 &amp; P1 have a Carbon fibre chassis which is why they are more expensive than the T series, which has a magnesium alloy chassis.<p>The newer Thinkpads are not as extensible&#x2F;repairable as back in the day. However, anything is a significant improvement when compared to the horrible dictatorial ecosystem of Apple.')
