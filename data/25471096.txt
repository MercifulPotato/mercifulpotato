Typically DNA is copied to RNA, which is then used to generate protein, and there isn&#x27;t usually a mechanism for that RNA to go back a step to become DNA again. I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s impossible, or that there&#x27;s no conceivable negative effects, but cancer seems like an implausible result from mRNA therapy.')
