If you notice that Rust chain starts at g++ - can g++ be built from the basic assembler you listed?<p>Beyond that, as you can tell from your graph there’s an enormous amount of code that’s part of a build from a large amount of projects. Explode that by a factor of 100000x to get the number of lines of code. So even once you’ve proven the source matches the binary, you are still trusting that the source code is of a trustworthy nature in the first place. You can move the trust required around and in some cases reduce it, but ultimately you’re trusting a lot of people and code (heck you’re trusting the good will of general OSS to validate the source itself isn’t malicious).<p>Like I said, I’m supportive of the effort and guix&#x2F;nix are great projects and extremely valuable. There’s no theoretical basis though to back the design of solving the trust issue though (the best we have are reputation systems but even that isn’t backed by any mathematical model).')
