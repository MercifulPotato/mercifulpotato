A partial list is here: www.motionmountain.net&#x2F;bet<p>In a few words, the strand conjecture predicts the lack of additions or modifications to the standard model of particle physics and to general relativity. It might be the only conjecture doing so. So far, this summary prediction agrees with all experiments.')
