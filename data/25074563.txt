Sure it&#x27;s a problem and it requires thought and engineering skills. But overall it is not one of the complicated problems and quite standard work for an engineer.<p>Sometimes I feel that people have become so used to have a third party API for everything so that they are scared of doing actual engineering work... ;)<p>That said, of course weighing the cost of dev and maintenance in-house versus paying a surcharge is a very valid consideration. At the same time one should not underestimate the risk&#x2F;cost of getting tied to a provider for anything critical (and payments are obviously critical).')
