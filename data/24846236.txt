Item(by='eythian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603274058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24844929, text='The speed of electricity isn&#x27;t 1&#x2F;100th the speed of light. IIRC it&#x27;s something closer to 70% in copper. The speed electrons move is much lower, however something more like cm or m per second (presumably depends on voltage.) However, this isn&#x27;t related to the speed of electricity which is analogous to how the speed of water through an (already full) hose isn&#x27;t related to how soon water starts coming out the end when the tap is turned on.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard, but I can&#x27;t explain so you&#x27;ll have to look it up yourself, that none of this matters when keeping a grid in sync anyway. It just works out.')
