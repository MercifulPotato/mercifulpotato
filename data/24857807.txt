Last time I checked you had to choose between 3 installation approaches and then choose a 3rd party installer (all of which have bad UX) and set that up.<p>Fragmentation exists on Windows too, it&#x27;s just internal.<p>&gt; However, what we should really be doing, in my opinion, is something like AppImage (or NeXT Application Directories , or RiscOS AppDirs, etc.) combined with a sandbox-by-default similar to what exists on mobile, but without pops or the ability for the application to tell when it has been denied a permission.<p>You&#x27;re probably taking about Flatpak and Snap. One has great marketing but is not usable for ethical&#x2F;practical concerns while I haven&#x27;t had a very good experience with with Flatpak (its &quot;runtimes&quot; are basically extra Linux distributions).')
