Instead it relies on ssh (or ftp if you&#x27;re really old-school).<p>Open up your ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config file and set &quot;ControlMaster yes&quot;, &quot;ControlPersist yes&quot; and &quot;ControlPath ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;cp-%C&quot; and ssh will multiplex all of your ssh sessions across as few unique tcp connections as possible. This will speed up scp and sftp connections as well.')
