Perhaps in the near future, the SEC might find that Robinhood violated those rules by preventing people from buying more than one GME share.<p>(I get that the clearinghouse was the reason, because they upped their collateral requirement from 3% to 100%, so Robinhood just couldn&#x27;t cover the trades. Nor could anyone else. But that doesn&#x27;t change the reality of what happened. I wonder if it&#x27;s too much to hope that the SEC will aim at the clearinghouse, or congress enact legislation to prevent the clearinghouse from shutting down specific segments of the market by suddenly requiring 33.33x more collateral for certain stocks.)')
