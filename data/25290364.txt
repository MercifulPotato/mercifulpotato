Remember that nuclear is one of the few industries that designs for the worst case scenario which is part of the high cost. The other component of the high cost is often policy and overzealous bureaucracy.<p>&gt;On grids that still have gas &amp; coal fired power stations, every GWh of electricity produced from renewables displaces a GWh that would otherwise be produced from fossil fuels.<p>This is not true. A kWh from a wind turbine is absolutely not equal to a kWh from a coal&#x2F;gas&#x2F;nuclear&#x2F;hydro plant due to the fact that the capacity factor for a typical wind turbine is around 20-30%. A hydro plant often runs at &gt; 80% capacity factor.')
