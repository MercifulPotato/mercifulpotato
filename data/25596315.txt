Talking or debating issues involving inequality is hard and it is easy to feel like the &quot;bad guy&quot;.<p>But I must say, I cannot take seriously the idea that there is a &quot;victimhood culture&quot;. It just screams propaganda&#x2F;dog-whistling to me.<p>And &quot;culture war&quot; is such dangerous and empty language that is primarily used by the right to talk about the fact that historically marginalized people today want to be respected and treated as equals under the law.<p>Historically marginalized people who have been portrayed in the media using stereotypes for decades which has, in my opinion, lead to many well-meaning folks having socially harmful unconscious biases. Historically marginalized people who have been denied wealth.<p>This rhetoric is holding everyone back. Sure, culture will change as more people are empowered. Please stop calling it a &quot;culture war&quot;. I guarantee you, people who believe others are acting as &quot;unreasonable victims&quot; are not good students of history.
