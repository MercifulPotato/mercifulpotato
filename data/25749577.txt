It&#x27;s  unavoidable. Some of them are just trolls and troublemakers. The real question becomes how they deal with those people. Parler already had a moderation policy in-place, but to be fair they are a growing company that experienced an absolute surge of new users. Twitter is a fully mature company with much more moderation in place. Even still, you can find a ton of calls for violence on Twitter by blue checkmark people and nothing ever seems to come from that.<p>Just because radical things are posted on your website doesn&#x27;t mean all the discourse on the site is bad and your site should be deplatformed. We already apply that standard to Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and others.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;ve heard that the people who actually stormed the Capitol Building (not just holding signs outside of it, which is perfectly fine) used Facebook to coordinate and not Parler.')
