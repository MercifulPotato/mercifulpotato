E.g. it kicks off with:<p>&quot;Housing market returns are very bad. Between 1948 and 2004 the real increase in value in the U.S real estate market was less than 1% a year.&quot;<p>While that may be true nationally, as they say in real estate: location, location, location. There is <i>huge</i> variation in real estate prices, and that 1% average masks giant <i>gains</i> in some areas and enormous <i>losses</i> in others.<p>The thing about real estate is that a desirable, greatly supply-restricted asset is always priced at whatever the top earners in an economy make. That&#x27;s why real estate with unique, constrained features (e.g. waterfront, city center, etc.) has appreciated unstoppably, while there is a cap on price appreciation for easily-replicated homes (can always build another suburb further out in Phoenix).<p>Thus, blanket statements of &quot;don&#x27;t buy a home&quot; are ridiculous without more context of exactly which home it is you plan to buy.')
