DynASM [1] is the template assembler used in LuaJIT, so it sounds like they might be JIT&#x27;ing CPython bytecode. IIRC this is also what the first version of Pyston did. I&#x27;m curious how this is working out, both implementation and performance-wise compared to LLVM (used in Pyston v1). That could mean there is a lot of performance still on the table, at least for some kinds of code, but also a big complexity jump to get further gains.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luajit.org&#x2F;dynasm.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luajit.org&#x2F;dynasm.html</a>')
