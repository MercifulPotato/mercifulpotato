If they think it will hurt them in some way, they won&#x27;t.<p>I agree and said... pretty much the same thing. I just don’t think there’s a snowball’s chance in hell Apple will see Linux as a threat.<p>&gt; But I think it&#x27;s fair to at least consider the &quot;undermine&quot; possibility considering that on iPhones they&#x27;ve consistently blocked attempts to jailbreak or open that platform in the way an alternate OS does on their Macs. We&#x27;ve already seen incremental moves to make MacOS app distribution more centrally controlled. So I honestly don&#x27;t know where Apple believes their long-term interested to be on the topic of facilitating, or at least not actively blocking Linux.<p>Nope. Not likely, unless the mechanism for getting Linux on the M-series is software exploits of the macOS platform. They don’t do anything to undermine booting entirely other OSes on their hardware, even iDevices. But they do patch up their own stack.')
