Unfortunately the Microsoft Precision Touchpad on my Dell XPS 2-in-1 2019 (Wacom HID 48EE Finger) does not support ABS_MT_TOUCH_MAJOR; it&#x27;s worth mentioning however that Windows works perfectly and palm rejection seems to work on a hardware&#x2F;firmware level (no output when running &quot;libinput debug-events&quot; and moving a palm)  making libinput restrictions unnecessary and most definitely unwanted.<p>The touchpad is about 7 fingers in width and the palm exclusion zones are a little more than one finger on each side; this is roughly 30% of the trackpad, or 15% each side, certainly bigger than 8% and even that would be too much.<p>Additionally, although the documentation does state that rejections should only happen for a vertical like movement, it also happens for a completely horizontal one.')
