Is everyone excited to run a Graviton supported Linux distro on these M1s or is there something else?<p>I would also be surprised if every M1 graphics feature was fully supported on these Amazon chips.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about cross compatibility then we can&#x27;t use any binaries compiled for any M1 specific features either...So no.  Its not compatible by definition.')
