Please don&#x27;t make up strawmans.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not a strawman, that&#x27;s the definition of zero tolerance policies in schools - both parties in a fight get punished the same.<p>&quot;And by your reasoning, then bullying shouldn&#x27;t exist today because the school policies should prevent it, yet it&#x27;s more rampant than ever.&quot;<p>&#x27;I never said that.&#x27;<p>What you did say is that victims can&#x27;t solve bullying and that school policies should. What we clearly see is that bullying is a growing issue under zero tolerance policies because the victim is given disincentive to defend themselves - it becomes a vicious cycle that protects bullies. It also is at odds with my personal experiences.<p>If the zero tolerance policy isn&#x27;t the school policy you were speaking about, then what is? You imply that school policies should prevent bullying, but we clearly don&#x27;t see that.<p>&quot;Funny how I only hear the &#x27;stood up to bullies succesfully&#x27; story and never the other ones. See my other comment.&quot;<p>You do hear of the other stories - kids committing suicide or shooting up a school because they are trapped in a failed zero tolerance system that leaves them with seemingly all-or-nothing options. You also witness kids just &quot;taking it&quot; if you are observant enough.<p>So far you seem to be just trolling - offering neither arguments nor facts that support zero tolerance systems or refute the facts that I, and many other on here, have presented against those systems.')
