But I&#x27;ll conceded that normal programmer laziness (i.e., optimize just enough to make it run acceptably on latest hardware) ends up having the same effect.<p>Software patents &amp; much of copyright seem to me to be to be hurting more than they are helping.<p>I&#x27;d love to experiment w&#x2F; ditching those.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, we should legally mandate that devices are open to 3rd party app stores and be &quot;jailbroken&quot; by anyone that cares to do so.<p>(It&#x27;s pretty crazy that the dominant  artist medium of our time is controlled by a single, outrageously censorious entity. Thank god we&#x27;ve got the web, at least. (For now.))')
