The Intel Thermal management driver is buggy so the device shuts off on very high-load tasks. You have to find the old driver on the internet and install it, and prevent windows from reverting to a new driver.<p>2. Only after two years of hanging connections and dropped UDP-packets I ran a speedtest and realized that this is not my home-internet being weird, but a systemic problem of the Wifi-card, which others have reported on the internet as well. Switched cards - getting windows to recognize the new one was difficult - and now I have normal Wifi.<p>Both of these issues are terrible for customers, and I still wish I wouldn&#x27;t have ignored&#x2F;overlooked the Wifi-issue for so long, as it interrupted work for a very long time.')
