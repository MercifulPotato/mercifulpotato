It&#x27;s the same all over the world. The US doesn&#x27;t fight Japan either.<p>2) Europe&#x27;s true sovereign guarantor, the US and their Nuclear Umbrella, which is the other 1&#x2F;2 of the equation.<p>&#x27;The EU&#x27; is long after the fact.<p>Moreover - it&#x27;s besides the point - as I articulated, the EU has fundamental flaws with respect to democracy that can&#x27;t be addressed with any reasonable argument it seems.<p>EU citizens have little to no influence over their body politic, because all the power is a few points indirection away from their reach.<p>Europeans were told <i>after the election</i> who their anointed leader would be, what her political platform was, and what her vision for the EU was.<p>Just consider why for a moment the EU doesn&#x27;t require leaders to be publicly announced and vetted before elections? Wouldn&#x27;t that be a highly rational, reasonable, and arguably necessary element for legitimate democracy?<p>What were EU leaders thinking when they definitely decided that this would <i>not</i> be required?<p>It&#x27;s absurd.<p>Many citizens saw it was absurd, voted against the Constitutional Treaty, and it was passed anyhow.')
