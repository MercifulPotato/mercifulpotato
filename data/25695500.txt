Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=[25695815], score=None, time=1610158822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682281, text='&gt; San Francisco or Cambridge near the MIT campus would be a much cooler place to grow up.<p>Not sure how recently you may have been to San Francisco but it is not a place I&#x27;d take my kid (I live in the bay area) let alone live there with kids. The level of filth, crime and sadly mentally ill on the streets is not something I&#x27;d want to subject any child to.<p>&gt; Kids have a much better time in real walkable cities<p>What makes the walkability &quot;real&quot;? I&#x27;m curious what has led to the HN meme that one can only walk places in Manhattan or comparably dense cities?<p>We live way out in nearly-rural suburbs. This is as walkable as it gets. The kid can walk to big parks nearby, libraries and movie theathers, shopping, etc. I walk to my office and just about everything is a short walk or bike ride away.<p>&gt; Those suburbs are optimized for wealthy able-bodied adults age 35-60 who like driving their cars.<p>I&#x27;m in that demographic and feel exactly the opposite. These suburbs are for kids. It&#x27;s a picture perfect place of safe independence for growing up. They can walk to each other&#x27;s houses and play in the parks etc independently.')
