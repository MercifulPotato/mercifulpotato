Item(by='vips7L', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611075805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835263, text='Yes they do. Powershell is smart enough to find the argument as long as it&#x27;s not ambiguous. For instance:<p><pre><code>    Remove-Item -r -fo .&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;some&#x2F;directory\n</code></pre>\nPowershell is smart enough to know that -r means -Recurse and -fo means -Force because the Remove-Item cmdlet has no other parameter that starts with -r. For -f there are two possible arguments: -Filter and -Force which is why you need to be more specific with -fo.')
