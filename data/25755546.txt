I draw that analogy intentionally because in both cases there are subsets of the areas where the lines get a little bit fuzzy and individuals are doing a bit of both.<p>Second to your question.  The shortest answer is that mathematicians create mathematics.<p>There are significant distinctions in how they typically think about world (e.g. discrete vs continuous) or what motivates&#x2F;justifies the work (i.e. pure vs. applied) but underlying it all at the core is the act of creation, and of understanding those creations and how they relate to other things.<p>Many non-mathematicians use some mathematics routinely as a means to an end, but for mathematicians it is much of the end itself.<p>A couple of people have commented on the ways in which it is like art, and aesthetics is important.   Hardy said &quot;Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.&quot; , and I can&#x27;t think of mathematician who would disagree.  Applied mathematicians tend to take motivation from a problem from somewhere else, but also value aesthetics of the solution.')
