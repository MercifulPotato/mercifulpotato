It&#x27;s way to hard to tell where its coming from, and with everything else going on it&#x27;s just too much. And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a cooldown so the moment the effect wears off you&#x27;re hit again.<p>Theres a part where you&#x27;re upstairs and you can hear the ai trying to attack you from the floor below. The game is fun but only barely and I think the novelty is going to wear off quite quickly.')
