You spend a huge chunk of your life saving to buy a home, and you plan it so that you can pay the taxes on it when you retire, then the rest of the city forces you to &quot;enjoy&quot; higher taxes you never demanded, predicted, or wanted, based on an income stream that you no longer have to pay it with, suddenly driving you out of the home&#x2F;neighborhood&#x2F;town you worked your entire life to finally afford. In many senses it&#x27;s hardly &quot;fair&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is here; I see it as a tough policy challenge. There might very well not <i>be</i> a solution that&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot; to everyone. If you think there&#x27;s an easy &quot;moral&quot; solution and you can&#x27;t think of decent arguments for both sides, I feel like you&#x27;re only kidding yourself.')
