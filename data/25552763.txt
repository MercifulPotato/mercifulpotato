The first group added a filler that throws off the UV measurement.  They didn’t tell the second group about the additive because they didn’t realize the second group would use UV to measure the concentration.<p>Neither group could have avoided the problem without access to information they did not have.  Both groups under-communicated.  This sort of screwup is by far the leading cause of software bugs (most bugs occur at the interfaces between teams).')
