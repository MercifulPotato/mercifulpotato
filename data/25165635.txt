The first amendment is a non-issue. Freedom of speech is something completely different which has nothing to do with one law from 3 centuries ago that limited the power of the <i>federal</i> government to limit peoples rights to free speech in certain areas.<p>We know the opinions of the people who wrote the first amendment and they would have not been amused by the arguments we see today. These would have let the East India Company silence anyone who complained about their tea in the areas they owned a charter.')
