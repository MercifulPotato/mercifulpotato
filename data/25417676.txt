I don&#x27;t know of any studies (although I&#x27;m sure they exist) but after a certain size, companies stop being agile. Too much management, too much protecting what they have rather than seeking out the new. And then along comes some small, lean, agile competitor running out of their garage and disrupts them.<p>Sometimes the large company can buy them. Sometimes, they can copy the idea in time and name recognition carries them through. But it&#x27;s not uncommon for the big giants to topple when this happens.<p>Game development seems to be in a weird spot though. Many game devs seem to follow the pattern of making a name for themselves by releasing some hit, leaving, and then making an indie game &quot;by the makers of X&quot;. Not going to stop companies like EA from regurgitating the yearly Madden &#x2F; CoD release or whatever, but it does keep things interesting.')
