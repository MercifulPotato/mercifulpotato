I’ll prove my point with the one question they always ask us versus any other profession, ‘what is it that you actually <i>do</i> at the company?’.<p>I swear, I’d never think to ask this of anyone, doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses, cops, literally, I can’t think of one profession that gets asked this, I’ll try again, pilots, chemists, diplomats, translators, artists, mechanics, it’s endless.<p><i>What is it that you actually do?</i><p>How about fuck you, I’m not answering that anymore.<p>It tickles people the wrong way that you took software development into every possible industry you can imagine and not only started offering tech solutions, but business solutions too.<p>Incoming projection - I see it as the most passive aggressive low ball attack on one’s profession. It’s karma too, because we do the same to sales&#x2F;product&#x2F;people management elements within our industry. I know why I’ve done it, and it’s mostly insecurity, ‘oh those people aren’t smart, will soon be gone’.<p>^ Now imagine the whole of society looking at you like that.')
