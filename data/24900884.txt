The quality is the same as any other RV, so you are paying a huge premium for the aluminum shell which looks cool but not nearly as trouble free as the marketing leads one to expect.  You can basically own 3-4 trailers from any other manufacturer for the same cost, and would be ahead in every way.  You can also rent RVs including other people&#x27;s airstreams these days so unless you plan on spending a significant amount of time using an RV (like full time or as a guest house) it&#x27;s smarter to let someone else deal with maintenance and depreciation.')
