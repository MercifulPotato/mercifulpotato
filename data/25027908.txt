For Traefik, that&#x27;s really simple to setup (in general I actually find Traefik quite fiddly to configure, but for Let&#x27;s Encrypt it&#x27;s simple). For nginx, there are numerous sidecar images available that handle it for you, such as nginx-proxy. I haven&#x27;t used Haproxy, but I would imagine it&#x27;s the same ease of setup.<p>&gt; You will not use docker-compose at your job<p>I do, and I&#x27;ve seen it used quite on development projects, so that developers can reliably and consistently run services locally.')
