They make nice cars, but they would have to dominate the market in a way they can&#x27;t even dream of today.<p>For example, Tesla sold 300k cars last year - ford alone sold something like 6 million. Tesla have to compete with the entire world&#x27;s car industry including companies that have much more experience selling cars at that scale. Is it impossible, no, is it unlikely yes - Tesla will grow from now but I just can&#x27;t see that P&#x2F;E turning into cold hard cash.<p>Also, Amazon&#x27;s P&#x2F;E peaked at 3.6k but only for 2012. It&#x27;s been around a tenth of Tesla&#x27;s current P&#x2F;E for almost all of their time on the exchange.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;amazon&#x2F;pe-ratio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;amazon&#x2F;pe-rat...</a>')
