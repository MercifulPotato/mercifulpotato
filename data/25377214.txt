Most of the studies that have been done (and admittedly these studies are extremely difficult to do well) show lower or similar bug counts in dynamic languages vs static languages.<p>If you&#x27;ve built large scale system with statically type checked languages that solve all these problems, I assume you never had any bugs right? Never needed to write any unit tests?')
