Mechanical actuation generates transmission power. Ok, how is this better than RF induction given that you need to build an antenna into your object anyway?<p>2. Mechanical actuation changes transmission by tiny (fragile?) gears. This appears to be measuring the wrong thing in their demonstrative example. You don&#x27;t care about how many times a detergent bottle cap has been twisted. You care about how much detergent is left in the bottle.<p>All of their examples involve either no sensing or secondary sensing that would be best decoupled from mechanical actuation. A slider could be a super simple variable capacitor. A button requires no signal modification. Leak sensors are typically constructed by simply opening&#x2F;closing a circuit by direct contact with the liquid. Fluid level sensing is only slightly more involved than leak sensing, and is best done directly, not based on estimated usage.<p>&gt; <i>Gollakota suggested that e-commerce websites would like to know how a user might be interacting with the objects they sell</i><p>Oh, great!<p>&gt; <i>(after the user has given consent of course)</i><p>Of course.')
