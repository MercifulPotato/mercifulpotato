Like rental properties, you can earn a good hourly rate on your labor with some capital investment.  But the return on purely hands-off investing is minimal or negative.<p>I know a few people that run small, ~5-acre farms that grow soybeans or corn.  From what I gather, they work the equivalent of a few weekends over the summer and earn a few grand an acre after costs.  The gotcha seems to be equipment; it&#x27;s so expensive that one would need huge tracts of land to cover the costs.  One guy I know paid someone a % of yield to handle the plowing&#x2F;harvesting.  While my cousin keeps an old, depression-era tractor going and uses that.  I imagine some might just lease out the land and collect just enough to cover property taxes.<p>This seems like a pretty common setup in the midwest.  If you travel down some rural back roads, you&#x27;ll come up on small 2-5 acre plots surrounded by houses.  More than likely, these are owned and managed by someone nearby as a side hustle.')
