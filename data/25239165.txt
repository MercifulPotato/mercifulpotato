What exactly constitutes a &quot;weak&quot; American ... What do you mean by &quot;fade away&quot;?<p>By &quot;weak&quot; I mean ones with poor reading comprehension :) J&#x2F;K - I think it should be clear from the previous paragraph that I am making a contrast with those who can handle perceiving and learning from failure and those who can&#x27;t.<p>On a relative level - two kids go to the same school. They get the same math homework. The first kid gets it wrong but it&#x27;s told it&#x27;s fine. The second kid gets it wrong too, but he&#x27;s told that he got it wrong and feels bad about it but also learns to get it right.<p>Compounded over a lifetime, person B learns and accumulated strength and capability relative to person A, with person A having relatively less wealth and power. That&#x27;s what I mean by weakness and fading. Remember, kid B didn&#x27;t start off with more wealth and opportunity, he was just not shielded from painful learning in the name of self esteem.<p>&gt;&gt; do you recognize the socioeconomic&#x2F;environmental circumstances that greatly constrain how most of downtrodden America developed and continue to live<p>This is a different topic (I intentionally constrain my example to people who start off on the same rung) and not relevant to the point I am making.<p>But personally - as someone who came to the US as a penny-less immigrant (as did most of my current friends and family) - I refuse to &quot;recognize&quot; that and in fact attribute our relative success in this country to not thinking that way.')
