So far there have been zero APT attacks traced back to inside jobs. That&#x27;s not how modern spy agencies work anymore.<p>Code signing hardly means much. All you have to do is compromise CI to make an organisation sign a binary that isn&#x27;t based on reviewed code.<p>How hard is that? I think for the vast majority of us we have to admit our CI would be very easy to compromise. Especially if you can get administrator credentials as easily as these guys apparently can. But even without that, CI executes and runs arbitrary code that&#x27;s intended to only come from trusted individuals.<p>Step 1. Find a third party package or library that is being downloaded by a package manager onto a CI box.<p>Step 2. Compromise the open source dev&#x27;s laptop by phishing them or something else really basic.<p>Step 3. Put a back door into that package.<p>Step 4. Wait for it to be downloaded to and executed on SolarWinds CI.<p>Step 5. Insert a rootkit into CI.<p>Now that rootkit can just systematically insert the final back door into any build of that file it sees using link time editing. Every build will have the back door and the owners will eventually sign the binary and push it out to production.<p>In many orgs CI can actually request signing of any binary it wants, so you don&#x27;t even have to do that. You can just hack the CI machine, grab the credential used to authenticate to the HSM, sign your preferred binary and then ensure users are downloading it.')
