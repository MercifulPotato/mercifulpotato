I hope this finds audience. (Reply in body and link)<p>Answering user Rentiki:<p>Its called a case study - it usually the first step to multi-person large breadth studies.<p>Its a “we encountered X anomaly, which is very i interesting and hopeful, and we arent taking money to get lambos. Plz give funding”<p>Just the scientific method,<p>Case 0 (we are effed, ppl die. God will be done)<p>Case 1 (ooooh) - case study<p>Case E(mperical, study funding yay - larger chunk of department funding allotted)\nCase E+1 Peer review,  fellow&#x2F;sister studies adding proof. Sometimes skipped for major which bring experience or reputation, often natural sciences due the existence of logical verification methods.<p>* For social sciences, we have tests such as ANOVA, Eta^2 and Omega^2 (McDonald’s reliability) - there is an absence of logical verifications here due to systemic constraints, ie: its impossible to do studies with (Inf) participants.<p>Case E+1 -&gt; N+1 (proof or generialized applicability, or enough confidence to yolo a vaccine or medicine or new tech onto the population)<p>Edited: actually E comes before N and N+1 by expanding the case study to studies with control groups and more participants.')
