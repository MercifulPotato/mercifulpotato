What bothers me is these life advices always feel like bullshit. Like, check this guy out. He has his own website with a title &quot;Den Zhadanov\\nTechnology. Productivity. Inspiration.&quot;. This is life coaching 101. He writes about how burning man didn&#x27;t change his life and has pictures of books on beaches. How does one take this person seriously? Can someone read this crap and think &quot;Yeah, I find this guy to be honest and want to take his opinion seriously.&quot; I get that he&#x27;s a Forbes 30 under 30 but personally it all smells way more like hustle than some profound knowledge.')
