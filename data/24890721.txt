I am a new father, full time student graduating early 2022 located in the Midwestern US and feel that the pursuit to switch careers will be much more successful with an internship under my belt.<p>Due to insurance reasons an ideal internship would be full-time with hours after 4PM CST, or part-time the same. I&#x27;m reaching out to see if something like this is ideal for your team or one you may have run across. I have experience in PHP (CI, Laravel), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Rails), Node, C++, Java and highly prefer C#&#x2F;.NET at the moment. I am fairly well versed in the full stack, TDD, Agile Methodologies and version control (git). It&#x27;s a shot in the dark - but for the right situation I think I&#x27;d be a great fit and am eager to add value to any product for the experience of working with awesome teams.')
