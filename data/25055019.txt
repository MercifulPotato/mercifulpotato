Because you can&#x27;t put that much data close enough to the core.<p>Look at a Zen-based EPYC core- 32KB of L1 with 4 cycle latency, 512KB of L2 with 12 cycle latency, 8MB of L3 with 37 cycle latency.<p>L1 to L2 is 3x slower for 8x more memory, L2 to L3 is 3x slower for 16x more memory.<p>You can reach 9x more area in 3x more cycles, so you can see how the cache scaling is basically quadratic (there&#x27;s a lot more execution machinery competing for area with L1&#x2F;L2, so it&#x27;s not exact).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.7-cpu.com&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;Zen.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.7-cpu.com&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;Zen.html</a>')
