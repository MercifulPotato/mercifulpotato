I specifically listed PATCH, PUT, and POST as being effectively meaningless in practice. You can’t rely on APIs to do what the verbs say they will do.<p>I only called out GET to say that it is still only a good bet that it will do what it is supposed to do. It’s absolutely not guaranteed. You’ve never encountered GET web routes that mutate backend state? People rely on it —- but that doesn’t make it reliable.<p>“Throwing away” verbs like GET is not the same as throwing out caching. Please don’t twist my words into what they were not. In practice, you often still need to specify exactly which routes to cache, and how to cache them. Just using GET doesn’t magically make things cached, and you can just as easily cache non-GET routes once you’re specifying what to cache.<p>Caching can be done for anything. It isn’t some special feature of HTTP or REST APIs.')
