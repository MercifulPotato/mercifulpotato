It&#x27;s saying that when somebody says &quot;Open Source sucks compared to these proprietary options&quot; Open Source people have to argue 1) that it actually doesn&#x27;t suck, or 2) that it sucks because of reasons A, B, and C that will be overcome, or 3) agree that it does suck and will continue to suck (but maybe you should still use it because it&#x27;s free or something.)<p>Free Software people can just say &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s bad. I hope it gets fixed soon. Can you fix it? Do you know a company that might sponsor someone to fix it?&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no need to defend Free Software. It&#x27;s ours and it would be great if it gets better. We should work on it.<p>edit: Free Software is in a way <i>less ideological</i> than Open Source. Open Source relies on a sort of &quot;invisible hand&quot; that insists that the source being available for viewing and modification by the general public will make it more secure, result in fewer bugs, and in other ways result in higher quality. Free Software people <i>hope</i> these things are true, but they would prefer Free Software even if they weren&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t need to believe in any positive effect on software quality to believe in Free Software; instead they believe that people should have access to the control systems of the hardware that surrounds them. This is nearly orthogonal to software quality, other than that software quality can help propagate accessible control systems.<p>If Free Software can&#x27;t keep up with the state of the art, I guess I&#x27;m going to always have old things.')
