For a lot of average consumers&#x2F;customers, Walmart _isn&#x27;t_ taken seriously. They&#x27;re not aware (and don&#x27;t care) about the incredible supply&#x2F;logistics magic that Walmart orchestrates behind the scenes. They&#x27;ll pay a premium to buy stuff elsewhere to avoid the inferior goods connotations associated with Walmart.')
