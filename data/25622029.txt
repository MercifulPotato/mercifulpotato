The book &quot;Game Coding Complete&quot; shows how to isolate a 3rd-party physics engine so you can switch implementations.<p>Of course, every physics engine behaves a little differently from the others, so, if you game is physics centered (pinball, racing), switching implementation might result in a slightly different game - but having the core of your game depends on the implementation details of some 3rd-party library might not be a good idea anyway.<p>In general, the more you sprinkle your code with dependencies to 3rd party libraries, the less control you have over the resulting product.<p>Your point still stands, though, for some very low-level &quot;utility&quot; libraries like boost or the STL, or any standard library replacement , and more generally, libraries holding &quot;vocabulary&quot; types.')
