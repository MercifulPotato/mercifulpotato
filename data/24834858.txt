Minneapolis&#x27; third precinct, sure, they burned that sucker right to the ground. But not the DMV, the icon of pointless bureaucracy.<p>And no matter where I&#x27;ve gone, from Honduras to Pakistan, to Germany, to San Bernardino, folks have been waiting in lines for things, and doing stuff that didn&#x27;t really matter.<p>Doing stuff that sucks seems to be an unfortunate consequence of social organization for all of us normal folks who can&#x27;t pay to skip the line.')
