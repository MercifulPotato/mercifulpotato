Item(by='notsureaboutpg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610246933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708181, text='&gt;that undermines the fabric of democratic society<p>This has become our new blasphemy. It&#x27;s hip to be a Puritan again. It&#x27;s cool to collectively hate and punish anything which is deemed to &quot;undermine the fabric of society&quot;<p>Right now it means exactly what you all want it to mean. Wait till all sorts of things you liked to do and think are considered to &quot;undermined the fabric of society&quot;, then it&#x27;ll be too late. Good chance for people to sell some books about the delicacy of societal fabric and which outline all the baddies and ghouls that destroy the fabric of society with their various unorthodox moral &#x2F; political positions.<p>EDIT: People will point out that this specific group &#x2F; incident &#x2F; thing was objectively bad. Sure, I agree with that. But the precedent being laid down here will go farther than all of you intended. &quot;undermine the fabric of democratic society&quot; is what I highlighted. Lots of reasonable things undermine the fabric of society (especially corrupt &#x2F; unjust societies) but should still be allowed. Perhaps this was a poor choice of words, but when talking about what should be censored and what shouldn&#x27;t be, words matter.')
