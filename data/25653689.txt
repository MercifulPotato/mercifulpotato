Telcos each spend billions of USD per year on CAPEX.<p>Spectrum auctions are better than the previous allocation method of licensing channels for specific uses. If companies have to pay money they will efficiently deploy it, unlike incumbent users that refuse to digitize, simulcast on extra channels, or even leave it idle.')
