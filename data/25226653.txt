This kind of region-of-production-defines-the-allowed-name-of-identical-products idiocy is of course beyond stupid, but lets ignore that for now.<p>There is no way you could describe making that type of cheese without referring to it by name. The fact that they don&#x27;t like people making identical cheese to them is inconsequential - it seems like this kind of usage should be trivially covered under fair use. That said he sounds Australian to me, and I have no idea how trademarks and fair use work in AU.')
