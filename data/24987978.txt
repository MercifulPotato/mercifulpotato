I have a HL2270DW (duplex wifi) and a DCP7040 (multifunction print&#x2F;scan&#x2F;copy, USB only).  They cost me, respectively, $0 and $5 at garage sales.  They have &lt;$20 aftermarket toner cartridges in them and print flawlessly with these.<p>There are really two use cases for printers:  Heavy, frequent use, and infrequent use.  Laser printers excel at the latter because they use dry supplies.  I&#x27;ve had laser printers that sat idle for a decade, toner and all, simply power up and print.<p>I couldn&#x27;t get these Brother printers to work except by using Brother&#x27;s Linux printer installer, which works perfectly, but alarmingly, is still 32-bit software which makes me wonder how much longer it&#x27;ll work.  Similarly, the scan feature of the multifunction machine will only work after Brother&#x27;s installer is run (but then it works great - sheet feed duplex scanning (stack flip and second pass) with gscan2pdf).<p>Anyway so slight software concern aside, very happy with these printers.  I don&#x27;t think either of them has ever jammed in my use.')
