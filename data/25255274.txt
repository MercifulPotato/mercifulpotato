Your argument assumes that “blaming the gun” is condoning the users, and this is a false dilemma.<p>There’s really no room for absolutism, where blame is assigned to one source rather than distributed among many contributing factors. Imagine how dangerous air travel would still be if, after an accident, investigators looked for only one cause to blame, and tacitly condoned anything else they came across in their investigations.')
