Japanese long commuter-train journeys were normalized earlier than elsewhere, packed carriages didn’t suit newspapers, and reading literature is harder than average with all those kanjis (most people only know a relatively small subset of them), so mangas fit that niche better than anything else. This said, I wouldn’t be surprised to read that the sector is declining due to competition from phones and other devices - my personal feeling is that the material targeted at adults has significantly declined in both quality and quantity in recent years.')
