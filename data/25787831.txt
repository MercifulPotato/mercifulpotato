In Mathematica you can paste an image as input, and have the input embedded into the document and used as an operator.<p>Similarly you could imagine files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;etc be represented as elements of rich text.<p>This is _not_ an easy problem however! As an example, if I had a document referring to  `~&#x2F;.emacs`, it could be:<p>- the path on the system of the author&#x27;s machine<p>- the path on the system of the reader&#x27;s machine<p>- the content of the file on the author&#x27;s machine<p>- the content of the file on the reader&#x27;s machine<p>- A sort of lisp data structure based on the content of the file on (author or reader&#x27;s machine)<p>Basically you enter in to the &quot;reference or value&quot; problem on many things. Text doesn&#x27;t have this problem because it has no solution to the value problem, for the most part, apart from like embedding a base64 blob into your text.<p>But hey, if you&#x27;re building an entire OS anyways, and you have some rich text primitives, you could imagine having that in the base libraries and setting up some COM-like primitives all over and work from there.<p>I mean this is basically Word, at this point. But a programmer-y version of Word would be interesting from my perspective.')
