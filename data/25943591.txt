Because it&#x27;s a ponzi scheme. People who made money off this already (and are not holding the line) are not the people affected by the man. I don&#x27;t believe my plumber, my electrician, or the busboy at the restaurant are investing their money on GME stock using Robinhood. Who do I see doing it? My friends, mostly young white collar workers with money to invest&#x2F;lose in a bid to trying to get rick quick. Your typical reddit user of sorts.<p>I mean, my first few years on this country, while going to college at night, I worked construction. I worked with all kinds of people, from all kinds of lives and believes. When 2008 happened, many of them lost their life savings or their houses. At that point, I was working as a software engineer already, my older colleagues lost a chunk of their 401k - which they probably have regained and built upon by now.<p>Sticking it up to the man? I don&#x27;t think so. The end of this will be fast and painful to many.')
