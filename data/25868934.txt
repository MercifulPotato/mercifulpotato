For some reason, the HackerNews and Tech scene in general are very susceptible to this. (techies share the bizarre hubris of thinking they know better than everyone at everything, and can improve and &quot;disrupt&quot; any field)<p>Economics and health care especially are apparently &quot;solved&quot; fields where literally every one of these people are actually hidden gem PhD level experts. If you think I&#x27;m exaggerating, ask them a question about economics or health care, and listen as they &quot;expertly&quot; explain Everything(tm) to you.<p>Ffs, even the label &quot;rationalist&quot; itself is pathetic, and very revealing. It&#x27;s basically a way to signal &quot;I am right, take my word for it&quot;.')
