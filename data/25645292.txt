Item(by='mabbo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609853609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641412, text='&gt; The question of how it got to Wuhan all the way from Southern China remains unanswered.<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember that the related virus we&#x27;re talking about in southern China was identified in 2013. More than six years before the outbreak.<p>It didn&#x27;t stay still. It hopped around, bat to bat, maybe to other animals. We don&#x27;t have the history of the virus since then. It could have very well made the jump the humans or some other animal, years ago but only recently made the last few mutations to become the beast it is now.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s a virus. It didn&#x27;t take <i>one</i> path, it took <i>all</i> of them that it could. Each virus created a million more, repeat ad-infinitum.<p>So the idea that there&#x27;s some mystery to how it traveled to Wuhan doesn&#x27;t bother me. Viruses get around.')
