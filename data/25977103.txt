I mostly do this to cut down on sugar, since boba itself just has way too much. Though occasionally when I really am in the mood and I know the shop I&#x27;m at makes great boba, I do order it with the drink. It seems weird at first to call plain flavored tea boba if it doesn&#x27;t contain them, but then a lot of my friends will also colloquially call the same thing &quot;milk tea&quot; even when they purposely get a milk-less tea at a shop ;).<p>I think these days I&#x27;m more of a &quot;traditionalist&quot; if there is such a thing, because my favorite shop is one mentioned in the article: Ten Ren. I believe there are two Bay Area locations and I tend to frequent the Cupertino one, though the Milpitas one is far more traditional since it&#x27;s lined with canisters of teas of all kinds and the people who ring you up&#x2F;make your drink are the older generation (unlike most modern boba shops that tend to have high school&#x2F;college age employees). But anyway, in short Ten Ren, IMO, has some of the best-tasting and simple flavored teas compared to some of the weirdly, overly-complex ones at more hype shops.')
