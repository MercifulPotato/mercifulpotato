I have a lot of respect for what he accomplished in life. Keeping Tony&#x27;s problems secret and enabling them is a big part of why things ended this way though. There shouldn&#x27;t be a stigma about admitting that Tony was suffering from drug addiction and mental illness. People have been using him all year instead of getting treatment for him.
