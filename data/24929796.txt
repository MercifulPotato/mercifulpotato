Reason is I&#x27;ve only recently started to read some Lasch and I genuinely like his writing, and on top of that I&#x27;ve also become really interested in fringe&#x2F;heterodox left-wing writings as of late (I say that as a person usually on the right when it comes to politics). If it matters I&#x27;m also a fan of Jacques Ellul (which Lasch mentions among others as one of his inspirations).')
