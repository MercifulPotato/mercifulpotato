Your project might follow best practices but not your dependencies.<p>The crates ecosystem is the weakest part of Rust and it is not always subjected to the &#x27;same&#x27; high standards, despite the &#x27;strictness&#x27; of the compiler.<p>A simple command line app or library (even worse) can depend on hundreds of other third-party libraries and cargo reminds others of the same ills of npm to some extent as developers throw in unnecessary libraries in your project. Point (2) can be still said about Rust given that the developer can still abuse unsafe{} or still have dangerous .unwraps() written by the developer. Just look at the immense scrutiny that actix-web was under because of this.')
