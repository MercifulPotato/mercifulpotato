They chose a justifiable tradeoff - as you said most mac systems are single user systems and their design offers better protection to a far larger group of users. When you run `brew install ffmpeg` you are running an arbitrary ruby script from Homebrew git repo and it&#x27;s probably better that it doesn&#x27;t run as root. I can&#x27;t see how that is bad advice; I&#x27;d argue that the opposite - sticking to &quot;tradition&quot; despite the changing the landscape of how personal devices have changed security is the broken mindset.<p>I&#x27;m sure most macOS users are far more concerned about an arbitrary script exfiltrating their keychain than some contrived multi-user setup where another user installs a keylogger in the system path.')
