Beating it by chance is irrelevant when what you&#x27;re looking for are sustainable, continuous profits.<p>&gt; A lot of institutional investors are long-only. That is their mandate. All the information they may have does not change that fact.<p>There are also lots of institutional investors that are involved in day trading. My claim merely was that: 1) There are enough of them for new information to get priced in faster than average private individuals could take advantage of them on a consistent basis. 2) Private individuals are not likely to beat institutional day traders.<p>&gt; Efficient market hypothesis is nonsense.<p>As with all real-world applications of science, the match between theory and practice is not perfect. IMO it is good enough, though. If it were possible to foresee stock prices on a consistent basis, then we&#x27;d see tons of successful investors. I have yet to hear of an investor or a fund manager, though, who consistently beats the market. All instances where an investor has been able to do that over, say, a 10-year period can be explained by statistical outliers. (In the sense that, yes, there will always be outliers but unfortunately, it&#x27;s impossible to predict who it&#x27;s going to be and how long their run is going to last. There are countless fund managers who were successful for a number of years, only to be very <i>unsuccessful</i> during the following years.)<p>&gt; Furthermore, you can not &quot;buy the market&quot; in the first place. You can buy ETFs replicating stock indices, but that is not the same. If you bought the S&amp;P you will have performed differently than if you had bought MSCI world.<p>That&#x27;s true, I was being a bit sloppy here. I was referring to MSCI-like indices as, compared to smaller indices, they minimize risk due to additional diversification and still yield higher profits on average. (This is the usual paradox: diversification usually leads to lower risk <i>and</i> higher profits. It&#x27;s the only free lunch you&#x27;ll ever get.)<p>&gt; Ultimately, stock picking is just a less diversified version of buying an index.<p>Sure, but in contrast to stock picking, there are 140 years of world market history backing the claim that long-term investments (over at least ~15-20 years) in &quot;the&quot; world market (i.e. MSCI-like indices) will, on average, yield profits in the order of 4-8% p.a., depending on what exactly your definition of &quot;world market&quot; is. There is no such data supporting investments in single stocks.')
