Pepe was and still is used as a generic meme in so many contexts it just makes no sense that people declare it a hate symbol.  I was watching a keyboard review by a Korean guy the other day and it had pepe meme in the video. He has hundreds of thousands of subscribers. English isn&#x27;t his first language. You really think he&#x27;s dog whistling to thousands of racists, or people just like stupid memes? Do you think whoever made this (extremely popular) short is a racist? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gAbi2_n8_Mw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gAbi2_n8_Mw</a><p>It really feels like some CNN broadcaster said something like &quot;Trump bad, and Trump Pepe!&quot; And suddenly there&#x27;s this small subset of the population who dropped everything they were doing, faces flushed, veins popping, and started vehemently writing about why this crude depiction of a frog used by teenagers for laughs should be #cancelled. It&#x27;s absurd. It&#x27;s like progressives are parodying themselves.')
