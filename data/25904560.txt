Item(by='sixdimensional', descendants=None, kids=[25905117], score=None, time=1611589822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903971, text='I worked in obsolescence in a previous job - it was a small department, with a very specialized knowledgebase, and tricky purpose.<p>People don&#x27;t realize that it is a very difficult balancing act to keep electronics working over the long term due to the ever advancing pace of technology (hardware and software), complexity of manufacturing, materials availability, customer demand, etc.<p>One part of that could include rapid design refreshes planned on a schedule to avoid obsolescence issues, for example.  When viewed a certain way, pumping out new products rapidly and not supporting old products for long periods of time could be perceived as planned obsolescence, but is possibly a reaction to customer demands..<p>I am not defending planned obsolescence here (perhaps pointing out a different concept entirely given its current negative definition), but there is a point of view that planning for and addressing obsolescence in a controlled and transparent manner, proactively, may actually be a good thing, not a bad thing.  But it could be quite hard to see that perspective as a consumer.<p>Also, certainly, when done behind the scenes for reasons that only serve the best interests of a private organization and not the customer and&#x2F;or environment - that is an entirely different story and not acceptable.')
