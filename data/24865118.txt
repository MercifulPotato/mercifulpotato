Item(by='kinkrtyavimoodh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603415426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864250, text='&gt; Uber very publicly threatened to shut down in CA if they did not get their way with respect to AB5 and the suit alleges that they continue to threaten layoffs. If that isn&#x27;t an attempt to coerce drivers to vote a certain way by threatening their jobs, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>They &#x27;threatened&#x27; to shut down the same way a shopkeeper &#x27;threatens&#x27; to shut down when the mafia boss wants 100% of the profits. It&#x27;s not punitive shutting down, it&#x27;s existential shutting down.<p>Uber as it exists right now (with the service level, coverage etc.) cannot exist if AB5 has its way.<p>(Could the downvoters please reply explaining what I said wrong? I think the numbers make it clear that Uber doesn&#x27;t have the margins to do what AB5 expects it to do while not changing prices drastically)')
