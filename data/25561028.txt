Does that mean Empiricism &quot;includes Electrical Engineering&quot;?<p>EE&#x27;s can also give computer scientists with machines to compute. The EE part is the mechanism. Why you even create the device, and what it does, is CS.<p>Deductive sciences also use the same computational machines to automate proofs.<p>An anthropomorphic family homily of science would go something like this: Father Rationality and Mother Mathematics had 3 children called Empirical, Deductive, and Computational. They shared many toys.')
