They are still trying to take over European markets so they have to maintain quality to compete, but once there is no competition it will degrade until it&#x27;s barely tolerable for the average consumer.

Quality control (like moderation or ethics) just doesn&#x27;t scale, and we must maintain infinite growth at all cost.')
