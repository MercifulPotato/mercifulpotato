Just have a file on your hard drive with a canned response that instructs the reporter that they need to provide more information, and how to provide it.  Every time you run into a weak bug report, copy-paste that response into the issue comments.  If the extra info gets provided, great, now it&#x27;s a useful bug report.  If not, you can close the issue, and not feel anywhere near as bad about doing so.')
