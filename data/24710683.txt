Costs to exist and costs to fix.<p>Eg: my software has a bug, with a workaround that only affects 20% of my clients, once a month. This bug costs $20 each occurrence. So call this a $400&#x2F;mo bug.<p>But we&#x27;ve got other bugs are $4000&#x2F;mo bugs.  Or $6k OTC bugs.<p>And we know what our dev time costs.<p>So, stop gaming devs against a broken guessing game.<p>Use real numbers, if you care about your code. This bug costs $400&#x2F;mo to exist - spend $4000 of your dev time to fix it.<p>It&#x27;s not: can you fix in time-guess for points - that depreciate over time (reducing motivation)<p>It should be: managers will leave you alone for 16h so you can work this one problem to death. Devs can then finish their tasks and gain confidence and pride.<p>Gaming devs against each other is not a good long term strategy.  Measure the priority and allocate resources from that.')
