They usually just mean cooked onions. I expect when I order a dish that advertises &quot;caramelized onions&quot; I&#x27;ll get cooked onions 99 times out of 100. I was well into my 20s before I ever even had fully caramelized onions. (and I really wasn&#x27;t impressed if I&#x27;m being honest)<p>However, I also noticed in Montreal &quot;caramelized onions&quot; actually always meant caramelized onions.<p>So it&#x27;s just really just poor terminology rather than a ploy to fool you.')
