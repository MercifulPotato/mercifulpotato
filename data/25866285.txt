Item(by='mbesto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611272624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864605, text='&gt; It&#x27;s worth noting how much soft power the political left in America has, despite being about 50% of voters.<p>This is not technically true. (1) politics is a spectrum (2) the US is generally left leaning as a whole, but the largest demographic designation of people in the US is generally considered <i>moderate</i>.<p>&gt; This means you should expect to have an uphill battle if you want to do anything in these areas that might counter their preferences.<p>The <i>population</i> of the US leans left - those outlets are simply a reflection of that. It&#x27;s absurd to think that all of these elite people who run those companies get together and conspire to keep left ideas alive. If you know anything about the Democratic party you would know they are horrible at creating a coordinated strategy. To think that same party is somehow regurgitating a coordinated theme through commercial means while at the same time having an uncoordinated government strategy is absurd.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s possible to go to university, watch movies, read the news everyday, and have no idea what the other half of the country is thinking or saying.<p>I agree with this but not for your aforementioned reasons. Those echo-chambers exist because communication is no longer at the town square but on social media and messaging apps.')
