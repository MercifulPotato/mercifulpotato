Item(by='wazoox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602334441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735488, text='&gt; if the price of renewable energy keeps dropping, it will be cheaper to make hydrogen than frac gas or mine coal.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that we can&#x27;t know the real price of NRE because they&#x27;re heavily subsidized everywhere. It&#x27;s cheap only because we have other sources (coal, nuclear, gas) to provide for the baseline (that 60-75% of production that must be precisely tailored to the demand). If we hadn&#x27;t that baseline, it would be very expensive.<p>&gt; Even better, one accepted way to deal with renewables intermittency is to over provision. Over provisioning means we produce lots of unwanted electricity that is effectively free.<p>Over-provisioning is very much not free; you must invest tremendous amounts of capital to get first this over-provision, second masses of storage. Case in point, Germany spent 300 billions â‚¬ building windmills in the past 20 years, and still burns masses of coal; had it spent 100 billions on nuclear, it would be 100% carbon-free <i>today</i> and would have been for years.')
