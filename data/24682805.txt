If I&#x27;m good, that makes I&#x27;m stable and relatively happy. If I&#x27;m okay, I&#x27;m probably depressed. It goes on from there. I&#x27;m able to talk about how I feel without getting into the details no one want to hear every day.<p>I want to mention how kind and empathetic this is. My mother had bipolar disorder and Iâ€™m very appreciative reading this comment from you.')
