But still, no resolution after 4 months.<p>In contrast it took me a few days at most to publish to Google Play and the App Store, which I did at the same time as I submitted to F-Droid. And I&#x27;ve shipped numerous updates to both since then.<p>So &quot;Switch to F-Droid!&quot; rings a little hollow for me.')
