The internet still is mostly free and wide open.<p>An audience though is something you earn, these networks have EARNED their audience. What you&#x27;re wanting is the equivalent of walking into the 7 o&#x27;clock news and demanding to be put on the air so you can tell everyone about your goat&#x27;s birthday party on Saturday.<p>Seriously, nobody cares about your goat&#x27;s birthday party. ABCD news has ZERO reason to put you on the air, you have zero rights to their audience, or to a platform at all.<p>Platforms like twitter&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;etc are NEW. It&#x27;s an EARNED thing, as long as you&#x27;re a good global citizen you can keep participating, when you go against social norms you get cast out, like pretty much every civic organization in the history of the world.<p>Town Drunk, sex offenders, felons, etc. all cast out for going against norms. Should they all get equal platform time to defend themselves 24&#x2F;7 and everyone is required to let their content go across their feed on social media? How&#x27;s that not also authoritarian, sounds a lot like communism to me...<p>The state seizing control of private business communication channels and forcing it open for everyone regardless of their message whether it&#x27;s a birthday party, or terrorist organization recruiting message.')
