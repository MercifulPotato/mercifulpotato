I&#x27;m not talking about teaching kids to program; I&#x27;m concerned about <i>preserving in the future</i> the knowledge of how to create all of the complex tech we use today. Many civilizations throughout history collapsed after they lost the technical knowledge on which their civilization depended.<p>&gt; Because modern computers are much more complex and do much more than before, you don&#x27;t do much bare metal programming anymore<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the problem! Unless those skills are actively used and passed on to the next generation of engineers, that knowledge decays. Part of the reason you don&#x27;t see a lot of bare metal programming anymore is due to the knowledge decay that has already happened!<p>&gt; nothing is stopping a kid from buying a microcontroller and playing with it<p>This article is about how those same kids <i>are</i> being stopped from learning the complex systems we currently use.<p>&gt; didn&#x27;t turn everyone into a nerd.<p>Nobody is trying to turn everyone into a nerd. I&#x27;m talking about making sure the nerds of he future have the ability to learn about the tech they use, so the ability to understand and make that tech isn&#x27;t lost. Locking down the OS into an &quot;appliance&quot; that cannot be inspected or changed is a direct attack on the ability to learn,')
