Mobs don&#x27;t accept apologies.<p>Public apologies stamp official guilt on the individual and therefore serve as a license for the mob to further punish them because now they have admitted their fault and therefore are &#x27;officially&#x27; guilty of the crime. Public apologies, therefore, are the metaphorical equivalent of blood in the water for attracting sharks.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s better to just ignore and maintain innocence because then at least there is some gray area?
