Do you know what are the involved timescales here?  How long before the buried wood is decomposed and has released most of its carbon back?  Is it 50 years or 5000?  Maybe it depends a lot on the type of soil?<p>EDIT: as the sibling comment observes, burning the tree cannot be &quot;awful&quot;, as all the carbon from that tree came from the atmosphere.  Growing and burning a tree is the epitome of carbon-neutral thing to do.  Now, burying a tree may have a positive (non-neutral) effect.')
