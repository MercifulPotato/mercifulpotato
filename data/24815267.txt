So we&#x27;re not talking about the internal cost structure of those industries, but simply their price. I might be mis-reading the whole thing.<p>Oddly enough the outstanding curves on that graph are ones where the &quot;market&quot; is an archaic mixture of private and public entities with little resemblance to free markets.')
