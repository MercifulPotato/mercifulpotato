AMD can be slower to fix bugs or have more of them on release day due to having smaller teams, but they are gradually ramping that up, and their current level of support already doesn&#x27;t bother me, while they are providing a proper open source driver. Nvidia don&#x27;t and have no plans to. I&#x27;d take AMD over Nvidia today any time.<p>Regarding slowing down progress, I was talking about modern desktop like Wayland compositors and so on. Nvidia was hindering it for years. And their attitude towards Nouveau is disgusting.')
