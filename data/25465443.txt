Not well, I&#x27;ve actually got back into console gaming after a near 10 year hiatus specifically for 2077, and to be honest after beating Watchdogs Legion and dealing with all of those bugs (also delayed online play due to bugs across all platforms) I&#x27;m actually ok just watching Youtube videos of people playing 2077 in HD rather than buy it myself.<p>I just wished most would not talk when playing, these youtube personalities are completely intolerable. And while I get that very embellished behavior is critical to their revenue stream, it&#x27;s appeal is completely lost on and I&#x27;m perplexed by who would sit and listen to this for the 8+ hours they play for without wanting to jump out of a window head-first into concrete. Let alone pay them for the experience.<p>In a way it reminds me of that annoying friend we all had as kids and tolerated because his parents have him all the latest and greatest toys and games and junk food; how these people (Twitch specifically) managed to monetize this awful experience confuses the hell out of me when you realize the roles have been reversed.<p>I&#x27;ve always frequented arcades since I was a kid and now into adulthood, and nothing clears a room faster than an overly dramatic, and annoying player that wants nothing more than to seek attention.<p>With that said, this PR disaster is just par for the course for 2020, so maybe with a proper series of patches&#x2F;updates it&#x27;ll be all forgotten? I&#x27;ll likely pick it up when its enabled multiplayer Online play and on discount, assuming they ever fix it on PS4 Pro.')
