There exist systems which can do the job, but most people haven&#x27;t even heard of multi-level secure systems, and most people also believe it impossible to secure a computer.<p>The model of trust that everything linux, windows, etc. is based on is faulty. The process is given access to everything it&#x27;s owner is allowed, by default... which was fine for academic computing in the 1970s, but not in the age of the internet.<p>There is hope... Capability Based Security is on the way, slowly but surely... and then we can kiss virus scanners and the like goodbye.')
