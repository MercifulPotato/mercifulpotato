Seminars, discussions, textbooks and exercises accompanied by a giant screen with code and a whiteboard.<p>What’s harder is the practical aspect; getting down to 1:1 coding effectively.<p>Classroom layouts, screen sizes, OSs, peripherals: anything can be changed in my budget but I just don’t know what makes for an optimized classroom coding environment.<p>Do they want privacy?  Headphones?   Or do pupils crave collaboration and discussion?<p>(Aside: Thank goodness for repl.it multiplayer!)')
