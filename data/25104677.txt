You weren&#x27;t ready to tell Bob, and you never intended to tell Alice. Eve has outed you as trans to Alice and Bob.<p>- The public part of your transition is complete, you can pass for cis, and you don&#x27;t want people to know you&#x27;re trans. Eve tells Alice and Bob that you&#x27;re trans. You weren&#x27;t ready to tell Bob, and you never intended to tell Alice. Eve has outed you as trans to Alice and Bob.<p>The 2nd kind of closet is often called &quot;going stealth&quot;. Some sources says it used to be called &quot;woodworking&quot;, i.e. blending into the woodwork. Some people call the 1st kind &quot;stealth&quot;, but I think &quot;closet&quot; is less ambiguous.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t hide my trans status from my parents or a school that I attended pre-transition.<p>This is true. I came out at work recently, so almost all of my coworkers know that I&#x27;m trans.<p>But there are a few new hires who might not know. It would be impolite for someone to tell a new hire about me, at least without asking me.<p>So for children, the 1st case is probably what they&#x27;re talking about. If a child is questioning their gender identity, it&#x27;s not kind to out them to anyone. They will probably be bullied.<p>It&#x27;s the gender identity equivalent of gossiping about Alice having a one-night stand with Eve. Is it wrong to bully her about it? Of course. But as long as the bullies exist, it&#x27;s also wrong to gossip about it and expose her to danger.<p>Defense in depth means don&#x27;t bully anyone, and also don&#x27;t open them up to bullying.')
