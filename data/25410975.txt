Google never promised anyone &quot;Unlimited&quot; anything, the details of the contract always said &quot;we reserve the right to modify this in the future&quot;.<p>People who aren&#x27;t data hoarders, who contracted with Google in the spirit of the contract (&quot;more storage than you will need&quot;), are still getting what they signed up for. People who contracted with Google not in the spirit of the contract (&quot;Haha, unlimited, huh?&quot;) are <i>also</i> getting exactly what they signed up for - the letter, rather than the spirit of the contract. Google is keeping the spirit of the contract with people who took them up on the spirit of the contract, and Google is keeping the letter of the contract with people who took them up on the letter of the contract. I cannot see any fault in this.')
