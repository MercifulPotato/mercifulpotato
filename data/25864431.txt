The guy who said we should use &quot;tabs&quot; instead of Bitcoin while we waited for Lightning Network to be finished?<p>While I don&#x27;t claim to know that Back was involved in the creation of Bitcoin, it&#x27;s also really hard for me to understand why many people think Satoshi was just one person after all this time.<p>If anything Hal makes more sense and has way more circumstantial evidence if it was just a single person, but even then I don&#x27;t think it matters much who was&#x2F;were the thing we refer to as Satoshi Nakamoto and is actually a cool part of the mythology we&#x27;ve created over the years.<p>It&#x27;s like something you&#x27;d expect from a Neal Stephenson or Daniel Suarez Book.<p>Because in the end, they don&#x27;t matter anymore; it&#x27;s gone so far from the original codebase that its entirely academic and quite honestly incredibly uninteresting in comparison to everything else that has been accomplished in this community.  Though I argue much more could dhave been done if we didn&#x27;t have to be derailed by this kind FakeToshi BS drama we so all too often in Bitcoin.')
