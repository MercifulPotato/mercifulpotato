Now that later on has arrived, I see little reason to upgrade: I use my machine mainly for browsing the web, watching Netflix, and occasionally running scripts in Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Matlab, etc. Most of these tasks would not run noticably faster on a beefier cpu; those that would are not really slowing down my overall productivity. Of course, this only describes my personal situation, but I do wonder if we have past the point where hardware upgrades matter for 95% of the population. Except for really hard-core gamers who really demand the best and  people who do a lot of video processing&#x2F;ML&#x2F;scientific computing, I doubt most people would really benefit from switching from a last generation cpu to a newer one. I&#x27;m happy to wait another ten years to upgrade.')
