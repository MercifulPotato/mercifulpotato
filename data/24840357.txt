I tried to find the same app that allowed me to choose where to put my data.<p>I tried the likes of Synology, MyCloud WD, ownCloud, Syncthing, Resilio, Duplicty, rsync,...<p>The software that gives you an easy experience isn’t private, and the software that gives you privacy is a pain in the ass to use. The rest is just extremely expensive (e.g. Synology).<p>So I decided to build the tool I was looking for for myself.  Then as I realised a lot of people around me wanted it as well, I decided to turn it into a full-time project to make a living out of it.<p>Technically speaking, I built a Dropbox style app plugged to a Git (kind of) repository. You just tell the app where the repository is, and you&#x27;re connected to the cloud. Anything that can store files can be converted into a private cloud.<p>I also built an automatic configuration module to configure automatically the standard file sharing capabilities of the internet router to work with the app.<p>In a nutshell, it allows non-technical people to create a private cloud in their home using a USB stick &#x2F; hard drive plugged into their internet connection, in 3 clicks.<p>Here&#x27;s the demo video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TsNXKVTrF04" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TsNXKVTrF04</a><p>Here&#x27;s the website if you want to check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duple.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duple.io&#x2F;</a><p>You can also download it and try it out, feedback would be much appreciated!<p>PS: I open sourced everything (servers, interface, etc...) except the core library containing the algorithms, reason being that the core library is our only competitive advantage.<p>Ask me anything, I&#x27;ll be around :-)')
