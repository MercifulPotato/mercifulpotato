Item(by='qz2', descendants=None, kids=[25090111], score=None, time=1605311377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088335, text='When my wife and myself got together approximately 20 years ago we had a combined CD collection of about 1200 CDs with a ton of overlaps. Eventually the iPod came along and we ripped them all, kept the CDs for a couple of years but eventually sold them on ebay laboriously. This was augmented with various things from mp3 sellers such as 7digital etc. Then along came Apple Music and the convenience lead to the realisation that dragging this huge chunk of data around as unnecessary. One day naively, we had a discussion and then deleted the whole collection as we hadn&#x27;t touched it for about a year.<p>In January this year, one of my favourite tracks disappeared from Apple Music, I assume to a licensing dispute. Regret is a terrible thing. I haven&#x27;t worked out where to go yet but streaming services are not the answer.')
