I&#x27;m not for eating humans lol. This sort of phrasing is intellectually dishonest.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s what the entirety of animal agriculture is. We go WAAAY out of our way. It&#x27;s expensive, inefficient, unhealthy, and immoral, and we do it anyway.<p>So are you against eating all meat or in favor of reforming industrial meat farming? These are two very different positions.<p>&gt; It never needs to.<p>Yes I didn&#x27;t say it needs to. I said sometimes it does. Foie gras involves sticking a pipe down a duck&#x27;s throat and force feeding it until it has liver desease which makes its liver extra large and tasty. It is what it is. I support it because it&#x27;s delicious. My taste buds are more important than a given animal&#x27;s suffering, plain and simple.<p>I know I&#x27;m being blunt but I feel this holier-than-thou attitude on the vegan&#x27;s side needs to be confronted with a little bit of &quot;silent majority&quot;-type viewpoints.<p>I&#x27;m not making controversial points, I&#x27;m spelling out widespread ideas to you.')
