They just don&#x27;t name it &quot;attention token&quot; and they don&#x27;t give you anything for yours. Brave pays for your attention with &quot;BAT&quot;, and you have to opt-in for it. Once you have BAT then you can pay it forward however you see fit - for most frequently visited sites, for sites you chose manually, for git-hub commits, individual reddit comments, etc (Brave has separate buttons near those). Or you can decide to keep it for yourself.<p>I am pretty sure it is a massive improvement over the current way of doing things. Sure Brave would get a big cut because of being in the middle of this. But it manages to use ads in a way that profits everyone: users, content creators, ad companies, and Brave themselves.')
