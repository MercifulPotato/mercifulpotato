Too quote:<p>The probability of former Vice President Biden winning the popular vote in the four  Defendant  States—Georgia,  Michigan,  Pennsylvania,  and  Wisconsin—independently given President Trump’s early lead in those States as of 3 a.m.on   November   4,   2020,is   less   than   one   in   a   quadrillion,   or   1   in 1,000,000,000,000,000.For  former  Vice  President  Biden  to  win  these  four States collectively, the odds of that event happening decrease to less than one in a quadrillion to the fourth power (i.e., 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,0004).<p>This - of course - is only true assuming votes are evenly distributed though out each state, and urban centers vote the same as country areas. He doesn&#x27;t even mention that in his affidavit.<p>And he tries to use Z-scores to claim that it&#x27;s impossible this mean people voted differently compared to 2016! That&#x27;s ridiculous and - very notably - he fails to to do the same for eg Trump vs Romney or Obama vs Clinton.<p>No wonder trust in science is decreasing with people asking us to take this crap seriously.')
