As OskarS says, you don’t need trigonometry for this at all. Just take the wedge product of the two vectors, and check the sign.<p>That is, if your direction is the vector (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), and the displacement to the target is the vector (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>), you can compute <i>ad</i> – <i>bc</i>. If this quantity is positive turn left, else turn right.')
