I could keep my savings abroad I suppose.<p>A disaster would mean I get perhaps 60 or 70 or 80% if my projected pension - but I’d live ok on that too. I’m not saving <i>nothing</i> personally, it’s just where I live you usually have to invest in a house if you want one. So the situation is you trust <i>either</i> the pension system or the housing market to hold up. If both were to fail I’d have problems.')
