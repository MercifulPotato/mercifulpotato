I guess it&#x27;s theoretically open to having someone else do the assignment, but so are lots of other things.  Because I could just sit and attack the problems like problems, without massive time pressure and my every action monitored, I enjoyed those assignments and exams.<p>Similarly, in CS classes, I always enjoyed assignments where I got to go write a program to do something.  Again, it could be cheated, but so could lots of other things.<p>The fact that some students cheat shouldn&#x27;t ruin classes for everyone else.  Since cheaters do lower the value of a degree, maybe universities should start taking legal action against them instead.  Provide a huge disincentive without messing everything up for the majority of students.')
