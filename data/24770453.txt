It was less deep of a port than USB, sure, but it was still a port.<p>As for why not, there could be many reasons, but I have a feeling it might have something to do with their waterproof&#x2F;dustproof rating. That&#x27;s just a pure speculation on my end though.<p>Or, more likely, it is simply because swapping the lightning port with a magsafe one would make the phone pretty much impossible to use while charging. But with a lightning port + magsafe wireless charging, you get to have both use cases covered (using while charging with lightning, drop off for an overnight charge on your magsafe charging surface).')
