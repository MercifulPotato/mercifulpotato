Our department has trained on hybrids (don&#x27;t cut the big orange cable!)[0] but not electric per se. Doesn&#x27;t matter. Unless there&#x27;s someone in the car, we&#x27;re going to stand back, let it burn, and keep it from spreading.<p>Cars contain bigger hazards than batteries: Airbags are basically bombs, and gas lifters (the things that make the hatchback open smoothly) can become missles in a fire. And that bit about cyanide? Ha! When your sofa catches on fire it releases cyanide. That&#x27;s why we wear positive pressure SCBAs.<p>[0] We typically cut battery cables on conventional cars to lessen the danger of an airbag exploding in our face during a rescue.')
