Our mission is to further innovative mental treatments (ranging from FDA-approved psychedelic medicine to neuromodulation) for those who are suffering the most. We do this by empowering providers, improving patient care, and accelerating research. Our software is used by mental health doctors and their patients. We analyze multimodal data from the software to help the doctors deliver better care and also offer insights to help research and development of new treatments that actually work. Together, we can usher in the mental health revolution and help solve our world&#x27;s mental health crisis.<p>We are looking for mission-driven, passionate full stack software engineers to join the team. This is an opportunity to be part of a fast-paced, high-growth health tech startup. Our engineers work cross-functionally and have full ownership over their projects. We utilize a React&#x2F;React Native, NodeJS, and AWS Lambda stack.<p>We are a team of Stanford graduates (CS&#x2F;Engineering, School of Medicine, Graduate School of Business) with deep experience in healthcare and tech (AWS, Verge Genomics, etc.) backed by General Catalyst and Y Combinator.<p>I&#x27;m co-founder&#x2F;CEO and you can reach me at lucia@osmind.org.<p>More info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;osmind.breezy.hr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;osmind.breezy.hr&#x2F;</a>')
