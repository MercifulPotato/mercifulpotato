The Ralph Lauren&#x2F;Lacoste&#x2F;Calvin Klein&#x2F;etc clothing that has gratuitous logos is basically a different product than their higher end products.  You won&#x27;t even see it sold in the same stores as the higher end clothing.<p>Luxury brands also frequently sacrifice a brand every few years and drop it down the &quot;status&quot; level, such as Michael Kors&#x2F;YSL&#x2F;etc, and you will start seeing low quality product with the huge labels slapped over it sold in stores like Macys where they wouldn&#x27;t have been seen before.<p>Zara&#x2F;H&amp;M&#x2F;Uniqlo are nice in that they sell non logo&#x27;d utilitarian clothing at the lowest cost (I&#x27;m a big fan).')
