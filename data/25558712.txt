We hear about (and people complain about) these issues because they are the exception. Apple has done a good job to the point where everyone thinks Apple products should just work. And, for the most part they do.<p>I think Apple&#x27;s problem here is that when they don&#x27;t just work, Apple has not optimized for that experience. And that lack of optimization is mostly around communication.<p>Lack of communication has bit Apple other times. In the battery slow down case for example. Slowing the phone down was the right move, but not communicating what was happening was the issue.')
