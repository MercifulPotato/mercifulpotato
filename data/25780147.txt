Upstate New York might have gone along, though not the politicians. Upstate and the city are wildly different in culture, political beliefs, tolerance levels, and more. Many upstaters also hate that many assume the city when someone says &#x27;I&#x27;m from New York&#x27;.<p>Both have amazingly nice people in places, and bad ones in others.<p>But if secession hasn&#x27;t happened there, I don&#x27;t see it happening with any city (which is good in my opinion).<p>Also, I used to live in upstate NY.')
