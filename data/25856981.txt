Basically instead of time we can look at it as a change of states, just a linear process. There is no time. If you place something on a table (in a perfect environment with no decay) you can&#x27;t tell how much time it sat there. It could have sat there for 1 hour or 1 million years. It just didn&#x27;t move and no one tracked the &quot;time&quot;. Time is just a concept in our minds to track changes in space (or state of space). Special relativity I think doesn&#x27;t contradict this. It just says that the &quot;speed&quot; of the state changes (e.g. you go from A to B) is relative. But this speed can&#x27;t go negative. There is no trace of previous events where you could go back to.')
