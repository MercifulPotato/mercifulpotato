I&#x27;d be very happy if post offices evolved and became places where you could get things delivered and you could retrieve them without needing to wait or speak with anyone, but they also allowed you to retrieve other shared items (ok, maybe some requiring a reserve first) that I&#x27;m not going to need often. Tools are a good example. Some cooking appliances would also qualify. Some equipment for hiking, board games, bikes and other small vehicles, instruments, etc.<p>The lack of environmental problems and abundance of clean energy also sounds good, though it just appears magically in the essay, so we can&#x27;t say much about it.<p>Lack of privacy is terrible, and we can make it much better. Flying cars are terrible. Not owning everything is terrible. I&#x27;m the complete opposite of a materialist person, but I can understand how it&#x27;s very useful to own some things. I mean, besides your underwear. Some might have sentimental value, and others are used so much that it&#x27;s more practical to own them and know they are always available at the place you left them.')
