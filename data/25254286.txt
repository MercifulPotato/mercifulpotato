Now I only use YouTube, Gmail, Play Store and sometime the backup service (Google Drive or maybe Photo, I don&#x27;t care) on my Android phone.<p>If Google wants to ban all microG users, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s Great! It was fun Google, thank you for the service.<p>Plus, can Google actually block a microG user ethically? Using microG isn&#x27;t hacking or abusing Google service, and &quot;suspicious&quot; is not enough for an account to be blocked, at least permanently.')
