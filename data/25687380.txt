Also, $200 steaks are typically prepared (at which point you&#x27;re paying for restaurant ambiance and the chef&#x27;s time).  Raw steaks don&#x27;t get up that high unless aged or pre-prepared in some way.<p>But more generally, steaks just scale well to the high end. They keep getting better and better as cut, livestock, and preparation improves. That&#x27;s not necessarily true for other foods.  E.g., most pastas (while obviously delicious) will only get so good barring a virtuoso chef.<p>I recommend a test. Find a friend who&#x27;s really good at preparing steaks.  Have them cook a good cut &amp; a regular cut from your 1&#x2F;4 beef, and you cook one of each too. You&#x27;ll taste the difference from cut and preparation quality.')
