I’ve seen teams unable to optimize things because there were so many levels of indirection that they were unable to reason about the system.<p>This is not Java the language but enterprise Java the culture as the problem. I have at multiple points seen a web app replaced by Perl (in the 90s), PHP, or Python to get whole multiple performance improvements and stability increases (no more mystery OOMs where it helpfully stays running serving errors rather than exiting so the OS would restart it) when the previous team literally had no idea how to make it faster or stable within the libraries they thought Real Developers™ had to use.<p>That’s entirely culture, not the core language, but a very high percentage of developers I’ve interacted with had thought that good Java developers were supposed to write code with that much extra complexity. I’ve been  wondering whether something like Kotlin will spur a bit of a renaissance as people realize that they don’t have to do things the old enterprise Java way.')
