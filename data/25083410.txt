The shared link doesn&#x27;t even show the album title. You can&#x27;t add text or locations like you can on Gphotos. This makes trip albums less good IMO.<p>* Scrolling and UI seem faster, although I have far fewer photos.<p>* Desktop upload is nice for people who have non-smartphone cameras<p>* Albums list can be sorted by Date Created or Name. GPhotos default sort is by the date of the most recent photo.    \n* Adding and removing from albums seems slower, but is also async, so &#x2F;shrug<p>* Selecting multiple photos is much harder- Google allows a Press, hold, swipe gesture to select multiple photos. Amzn doesn&#x27;t have that on the app. On web, they do have shift+Click, though.<p>* Different photo layouts is nice<p>* The shared photo screen is very aggressively in your face about advertising amazon photos. GPhotos has no ads.<p>* AFAICT, Amzn does not share the accounts&#x2F;names of signed-in people who access shared content. Gphotos leaks this info to anyone who views the shared content. It&#x27;s one of my main problems with GPhotos.<p>I have not really tested the &quot;Groups&quot; feature (which seems to be the equivalent of shared albums).')
