The driver was paid close to minimum wage... Regardless of how you feel about this, it&#x27;s definitely the case that people who are paid minimum wage will typically give minimum effort. This was totally forseeable. The people in charge of making this decision at uber were either negligent or willfully ignorant, but there&#x27;s no excuse to hire someone for near-minimum wage for this job if you truly care about safety.')
