Item(by='opan', descendants=None, kids=[25043417], score=None, time=1604987408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042852, text='I&#x27;m all for &quot;free&quot; over &quot;open&quot;, but from what I understand, the difference is ideological. It sounds to me like you&#x27;re equating &quot;open source&quot; with &quot;visible source&quot;, which is of course inaccurate. A public repo with no license file is not &quot;open source&quot;. I&#x27;m more familiar with these issue in software than hardware, though, so maybe I&#x27;ve missed something here.')
