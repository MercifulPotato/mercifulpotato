Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607996748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425991, text='&gt; One thing that might be helpful, if I&#x27;m in favor and you&#x27;re opposed, then maybe identify one obstacle - it can be as big as you wish - where if resolved, you&#x27;d be in favor of reparations. Then maybe that is worth engaging with.<p>On the contrary; if I represent the status quo and you represent a new idea, the onus is on you to defend it. It&#x27;s your responsibility.  Put it out there.  Say exactly what your thesis is, and back it up, and defend it.  Sunlight is the best disinfectant - anything about your ideas that are indefensible will be shown to be so, and what&#x27;s left will be gold.<p>To make my point via <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, let&#x27;s flip the script and use something hyperbolic: you represent the <i>status quo</i>, and I represent (heaven forbid) some new variation of racial cleansing. But, I declare to those opposed, &quot;engaging with those who don&#x27;t like the idea [of racial cleansing] is a fool&#x27;s errand, because a lot of these people will just cherry-pick whatever objection they can think of in bad faith.&quot; So, I say to you, the skeptical defendent of the <i>status quo</i>, if you don&#x27;t like the idea of racial cleansing, &quot;then maybe identify one obstacle - it can be as big as you wish - where if resolved, you&#x27;d be in favor of [exterminating a race].&quot;<p>To me, flipping your proposition on its head like that makes it pretty obvious that it&#x27;s unsatisfactory as the starting point of an intellectual discussion. It even tends to beg the question: you&#x27;ve made your position the &#x27;null hypothesis&#x27;. The <i>status quo</i> should be the null hypothesis.<p>&gt; And even in good faith, people who don&#x27;t like the idea all have different reasons. Start with the root axiom &quot;Slavery is wrong&quot;, people will be happy to engage with you on that. Disregard them and move on to the next syllogism, you&#x27;ll have a different set of people objecting.<p>Yes, exactly. Your job is to answer every set of people who don&#x27;t like your idea. Just because <i>you believe</i> that this new thing is moral and right does not make it so, and it is the acme of hubris to distain to justify your proposed actions.')
