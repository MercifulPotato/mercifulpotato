Fiddling with my i3 config and i3bar is a favourite procrastination, and I can genuinely say it&#x27;s changed the way I use my computer.<p>But Zoom is a nightmare. It&#x27;s clearly only designed to work with conventional windows. It opens new windows a lot, and each time it does that, i3 grabs the new window and puts it in whatever workspace my mouse is currently at. I&#x27;m constantly shifting Zoom windows between fullscreen and normal mode, and switching workspaces for them. Starting a breakout session immediately kills everything and I have to start moving everything around again.<p>I get that Zoom isn&#x27;t optimising their application for Linux, and especially not for i3. Fair enough, I&#x27;m in a tiny market segment here. But it&#x27;s annoying enough that I want to warn people who want to try i3 that (no fault of i3) some applications really don&#x27;t work well with it.')
