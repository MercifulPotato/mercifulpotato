Item(by='dontbeevil1992', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607704759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378478, text='&gt; To say they are &quot;taking advantage of the commons&quot; implies they&#x27;re leaving the commons worse off<p>I don&#x27;t agree. All it means is that they&#x27;re benefiting privately from something that belongs to everyone. This is particularly glaring in this case because Nestle has a history of unethical behavior - for example, there is a plausible argument that one of the reasons why the Flint lead problem hasn&#x27;t been fixed is because of profits on bottled water. Taxation is not a perfect solution because the government doesn&#x27;t always use the funds ethically, particularly when it is in bed with corporations. But it&#x27;s better than nothing.<p>&gt; The amount of water they&#x27;re pumping really isn&#x27;t that significant compared to agricultural or industrial users.<p>Then why not have them pay a use fee that is proportionally small compared to agricultural and industrial users? If we don&#x27;t charge them at all then logically why can&#x27;t they just go ahead and privatize the entire water supply for the cost of $200? Natural resources shouldn&#x27;t be made arbitrarily available for private profit.')
