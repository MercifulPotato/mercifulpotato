Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604689181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009566, text='&gt; FYI, I just switched from a battery electric mower to a manual reel mower because of shrinking battery capacity and expensive batteries. An extra battery costs well over 50% of a battery and mower together. I still have the mower, I just don&#x27;t use it much anymore. I do use the battery powered strimmer&#x2F;weed eater.<p>Yep. The only reason I find it viable is because I built up a big supply of compatible battery powered tools. Prices for batteries are coming down though, hopefully this will trickle down to tool batteries as well because I want a couple more batteries for my chainsaw and really can&#x27;t put out $300 for them right now.')
