They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re inanimate f----- objects. They&#x27;ve never maliciously set out to cause someone harm because they&#x27;re inanimate f----- objects. They don&#x27;t have an understanding of the concept of morals or ethics because they&#x27;re inanimate f----- objects.<p>When I ingest them into my body -- that&#x27;s when all hell breaks loose. They become a problem for me when I use them.<p>&gt; Technology is designed to trick humans into engaging with it. They use us for profit.<p>Who is this mythical &quot;they&quot;?<p>Technology is designed to do many jobs. Some of them include gamification to &quot;maximise engagement&quot; or some other cringeworthy buzzword. Some of them are literally as simple as &quot;turn the lights off at 10pm&quot; or &quot;wake me up at 10am&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s how we, as a collective species, implement and use technology that&#x27;s usually the problem.<p>&quot;technology&quot; itself is, again, an inanimate f----- object.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s asymmetric warfare. One or two parents, with jobs and responsibilities, against kids with peer pressure and billion dollar industries hawking them on, claws in their back and brain.<p>I think this is called life? Yes, lots of things all happen at the same time and there&#x27;s alway societal pressures one way or another.<p>But calling it warfare is pretty extreme and may be something useful to reflect on.')
