I did not see the introduction of “further division between two races”. I saw articles that covered some uncomfortable facts. If you’d rather ignore that reality you’re free to not read the Times.<p>Edit: just looked at your comment history. I&#x27;m sorry your experiences with nonwhite people caused you such animus.')
