The main problem with letter of the law interpretations is they go out of date quickly, and there might be significant loop holes - so they didn&#x27;t do that. Do you think it&#x27;s possible to come up with a definitive list of &quot;type of sites&quot; that don&#x27;t have to comply? Might be tricky.<p>And I definitely don&#x27;t blame organisations blocking EU traffic; it&#x27;s at least an honest admission they won&#x27;t protect your privacy. (Although it may not be a decision of the site itself, I&#x27;ll get to that in a second.)<p>Recital 23 is spot on though. Can a New Hampshire-based local news site be said to offer goods or services to members of the Union? It sure sounds like you could say &quot;no&quot; in good faith (which is a defence, IANAL etc).<p>Can the same be said for either a huge multi-national, or trackers and ad-flinging networks a local site might use? Probably not...')
