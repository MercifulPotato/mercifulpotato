I didn&#x27;t _have_ to, and the money I got from it was available to me as spending money - it wasn&#x27;t needed to contribute to the household budget or anything.<p>But also, you&#x27;ve got things like family farms (dwindling in the US but still present), where there&#x27;s a fine distinction between &quot;chores&quot; and &quot;work to run the farm,&quot; and I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s going to accuse farmers of exploiting their kids as they ramp up responsibilities as the kids get older.')
