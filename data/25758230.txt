Item(by='teakettle007', descendants=None, kids=[25758400], score=None, time=1610512802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25757631, text='&gt; Section 230 doesn&#x27;t &quot;grant these businesses privileged immunity.&quot; Section 230 applies to all persons and all devices connected to the Internet in the United States.<p>This is specious; said blanket immunity <i>is</i> a privilege, and we do not demand any concessions in return. We allow <i>platforms</i> (happier?) to profit from the benefits of operating as a public square and an editorial publisher, simultaneously.<p>&gt; If there was no section 230, it would <i>destroy</i> free speech on the Internet.<p>Prior to the CDA’s passage in 1996, the internet provided almost unlimited, unhindered free speech. What we have now pales in comparison.<p>If you think existing protections for common carriers and “mechanical distributors” are not strong enough, then we can surely update them for the internet.<p>However, that does not even <i>remotely</i> begin to justify the give-away that 230 represents. If we’re going to grant the privilege of immunity to platforms such that they can safely privatize the public square, we ought to demand they actually make some concessions to operate like actual public squares.')
