Item(by='anthony_romeo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605745851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144267, text='I liked the stance in <i>Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach</i> by Douglas Walton, wherein &quot;logical fallacies&quot; are thought of as more the consequence of an argument which inappropriately shifts from one argumentative context to another.<p>For example, if during a formal debate you were to threaten to harm your opponent if they didn&#x27;t agree with you (an &quot;Appeal to Force&quot; fallacy), this wouldn&#x27;t be an appropriate argument for this context. But in, say, a contract negotiation between a union and a business, the union could threaten to strike if the business doesn&#x27;t agree to terms, and it can be part of a valid argument. Thus appeals to force (and, as Walton argued, all &quot;informal fallacies&quot;) aren&#x27;t inherently fallacious in all contexts. Rather, the threat of harm was an inappropriate change in context from a formal debate to a negotiation, and it&#x27;s the <i>change in context</i> which creates these fallacies.')
