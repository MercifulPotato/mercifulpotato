It seems obvious that they broke the DMCA in using the exploit and the FCAA in collecting and publishing the data acquired.<p>If so, and the data were obtained through criminal means, is it even admissible in a criminal case?<p>Full disclosure - I have&#x2F;had a verified Parler account, dating long before the Capitol stuff. I tend to join pretty much all the new social network stuff to claim my name and so I know what I’m talking about when I discuss it elsewhere. I don’t think I ever posted a “Parley”, and if memory serves the only PMs I sent were asking a friend about LED headlight options for my wife’s vehicle. I’m not concerned about that conversation leaking, but it will amuse to me see if it’s in the collected dataset.')
