Places with just two numbers are common, they haven&#x27;t caught up with the &quot;new&quot; law from the 1962 yet.<p>Numbers are often written without suffixes, but in most places with three numbers the suffixes are 丁目-番-号. In one city - Wakasa in Fukui - the last two are reversed. I have never been able to find any mention of this at all, let alone why it would be the case.<p>Some cities are laid out in a clock pattern with slices named after animals of the Chinese Zodiac.<p>Neighborhoods are typically divided into blocks with numbers (or the number is omitted if there&#x27;s just one block). But as addresses change over time, sometimes just one block goes away, so there are many places where block 1 no longer exists or there are gaps in the numbering.<p>On Yahoo Answers I once saw a person who was confused after their local post office adamantly told them one of their two or three numbers had a hyphen in it (so it was like 1-(2-3)) because it represented two joined lots, but that shouldn&#x27;t be possible.<p>Mail is always complicated...
