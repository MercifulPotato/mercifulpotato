By your logic it would be sensible to add even more interfaces even though the intermediate classes do nothing except pass a function call to the next layer. Want to add one parameter to an SQL query? Well vbezehnar said it&#x27;s fine to modify 6 or 8 files to accomplish such a trivial task.<p>The irony is that the whole code base was garbage and hardly readable and the biggest culprits weren&#x27;t the overuse of patterns (they were just the cherry on top) but rather the fact that a random bundle of libraries has been misused for purposes that they were not designed for.  My personal favorite is keeping hibernate objects beyond the lifetime of a hibernate session and the hibernate session was configured to live as long as the http request. Combine this with a web framework that completely abstracts away http requests and it means you can never use hibernate correctly because you never know when the session has expired.')
