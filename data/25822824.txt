If you read the testimonies from children from the foster system like you, or from children with mentally unwell parents, the ones that made it out ok always have some sort of story about how one adult in their life took an interest and helped them get through it. From what I’ve seen, teachers and coaches are the most common adult to help. Not peer reviewed stuff obviously, but the pattern is striking.<p>Anyways, glad you made it out of such a tough spot doing ok.')
