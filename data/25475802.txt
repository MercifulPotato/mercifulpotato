CDPR intentionally barred reviewers from reviewing or even _showing footage_ of the console versions prior to the release. They knew it was a completely broken console experience but did not want consumers to make an informed decision on their purchase, so reviews were only allowed to use footage from high-end PCs.<p>This is shady business practice at best, downright unethical&#x2F;scamming at worst.
