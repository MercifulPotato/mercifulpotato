I tend to think increasing the cost of patents is a silly idea, because right now they cost nearly nothing if you file &amp; do the reject&#x2F;re-apply dance yourself (and know how to). unless we the people are going to start charging billions for good ideas being monopolized, I tend towards a fair reasonable &amp; non-discriminatory access model for all ideas, with a depreciating over time scale. i&#x27;d rather open the closed system than try to find the right price for it. but either way, I think the uspto &amp; Congress has a lot of power to fix this practically free hand out that ongoingly locks down this world &amp; obstructs progress time &amp; time again.')
