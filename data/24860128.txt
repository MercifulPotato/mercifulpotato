Don&#x27;t you risk the &#x27;Eureka moment&#x27; being something that&#x27;s not important? I wonder if one could, as a teacher, manufacture this with seemingly nonsensical one-liners that eventually become clear.<p>I sort of do this with my kids, dropping titbits to try and entice interest: &quot;of course we are time travellers, moving at a second-per-second <i>most of the time</i>&quot; but that could be more explicitly tailored to &quot;... except under time-dilation&quot;. Perhaps the latter gives a hook &quot;time dilation&quot; to hang the concept on later when it&#x27;s learned -- maybe like reserving disk space when downloading a large file. Or perhaps it&#x27;s the &#x27;transfer&#x27; of the concept to the hook, at some point, that makes for a &#x27;repitition&#x27;.')
