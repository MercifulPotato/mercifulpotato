The under-laying technology &quot;Plasmashell&quot; is able to run different view modes: the traditional desktop mode, the mobile mode and the smart tv mode (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plasma-bigscreen.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plasma-bigscreen.org&#x2F;</a>). The missing link is the possibility to switch the view at runtime.<p>Now while I think the feature is cool, I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is. I don&#x27;t really see myself using it and would prefer in almost all the case using my thinkpad with a good processor and plenty of RAM. This might change with future versions of the Pinephone getting more powerful with the time. For the moment, I&#x27;m happy to have the convergence of the applications with Kirigami, so that I only need to develop them once and use a similar interface on both my phone and laptop. And having KDE Connect to share stuff between my phone and my laptop.')
