We must find ways to dismiss their success and try to drag them down in our perspective<p>None above the herd!<p>I know it&#x27;s hard times in the world right now, but better to face that emotion in your own situation and feel better by doing better, than trying to feel better by pretending others are worse. The stories of others success raise anger and fear in hard times, but do you want to be successful? What would the Airbnbs do? Get angry and revise others success to failure to feel better? Or would they build? Please convert your emotion to constructive useful output<p>If you don&#x27;t have that success attitude, you don&#x27;t have the right to judge others success,  nor even be angry with your own lack, if you won&#x27;t do what works to get it yourselves.<p>Choice, how you react to this comment, is the first step of your new path. Which way will you choose to go?')
