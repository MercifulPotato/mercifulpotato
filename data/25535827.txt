Apps are not installed through an installer, but through a .zip file. A pro is that you do not need to be admin on your PC for Scoop to function (handy for PCs that are not in your control). A con I&#x27;ve encountered is that Windows is not very friendly towards apps that are not installed through an installer. I&#x27;ve installed IrfanView through Scoop, but for some reason, Windows restores &quot;Photos&quot; as default app for opening pictures a few times a week, this was not the case when I installed IrfanView with an installer.')
