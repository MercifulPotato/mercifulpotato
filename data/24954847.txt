But understanding implicit bias and&#x2F;or the reasons behind the framing of certain arguments from a source is necessary, in my opinion, because several, if not most, of the content we consume is crafted disingenuously. To judge the merit without understanding a dimension of it is just making an uninformed judgement.')
