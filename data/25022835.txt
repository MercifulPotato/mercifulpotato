It obviously has a very deep argument behind it that has convinced the author. But given the context of the discussion, it&#x27;s impossible for the author to explain why he thinks that is true, in a way for a counterpart to verify and explore.<p>Similarly, those on the other side who believe the Russia collusion isn&#x27;t a &quot;manufactured story&quot; also have very deep arguments that can&#x27;t be included here.<p>It&#x27;s the same with &quot;orchestrating a hijacking of the Democratic primary&quot;. It&#x27;s an assertion that comes across as completely ridiculous to people who don&#x27;t believe it, based off of counter arguments that are also very deep having to do with the intricacies of how the primaries work.<p>And so then of course the conclusion is that Trump is bad but the media is worse, based off of those previous two assertions being true. And the discussion goes absolutely nowhere.<p>I am literally highly interested in the thinking behind why the Russia collusion story is manufactured, and how the Democratic primary is hijacked. Yes because I believe those conclusions are false, but I want to respectfully explore <i>where</i> in the argument I think it falls down. But to do it would take a long exchange, probably with time in between to research, that just isn&#x27;t supported by forums like this.')
