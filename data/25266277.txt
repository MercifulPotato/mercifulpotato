I&#x27;m not trapped in an office twiddling my thumbs while having to put off the problem for later.<p>I also find this makes me much more amenable to dealing with work problems on non-work hours. You aren&#x27;t leeching my life problem solving time during the entire work day, so I don&#x27;t have to be as protective of it when I&#x27;m on personal time.')
