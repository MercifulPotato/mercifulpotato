Fine to have a few risky things, but that should largely be driven by the business, not dev. Having 20% risky deps that you might need to track changelogs on adds up quick. We do some wild GPU and data stuff, and time spent on weird js&#x2F;python&#x2F;docker&#x2F;etc lib issues is time not helping our core and our users.<p>Putting 20% on innovation in the codebase makes more sense when thought of as % time gardening, not the mix of risky deps. Improving CI may be useful innovation in the codebase... and done with boring code.')
