The problem in this particular case seems to be that they ignored their own CoC and picked on someone who didn&#x27;t violate their CoC, while the committee did violate the CoC.<p>That situation is indistinguishable from not having a CoC at all. If you&#x27;ve got a CoC, it needs to be clear, and you need to be consistent about how you enforce it.<p>It has been shown plenty of times that if you don&#x27;t have a CoC, there will be some people who think that racist or sexist jokes, sexual harassment, etc., are okay. They are not, and a CoC can help to make that clear. But you have to take your own CoC seriously and follow it, and not use it as an arbitrary excuse to harass people, like what seems to have happened here.')
