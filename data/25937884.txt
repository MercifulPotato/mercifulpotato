But... almost the entire order book was gone. So they sold very low. Which triggered more stop-losses. Which sold lower, and so on.<p>In the end stop-losses ended up largely selling to one <i>super-lucky-account-that-I&#x27;m-sure-set-this-up-as-a-joke-and-forgot-about-it</i> who had a limit buy in for 10c&#x2F;ETH.<p>IIRC the price was ~350 when this started. When people were able to start buying again, the price jumped up again (obviously).<p>But this lucky person was able to buy ~5k ETH at 10c, because all the stop-losses triggered.<p>¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
