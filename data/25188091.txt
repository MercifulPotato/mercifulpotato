When you have a  large budget, you can start doing interesting things.<p>A friend of mine got some Samsung flagship(don&#x27;t remember which one but something new and expensive) from this year, she&#x27;s into Instagram filters whan she showed me some fun ones she likes I noticed that these filters have significantly slow FPS on live preview - something I am not used to see on an iPhone. I tried the same filters on the lowest end iPhone I have access to, which is iPhone 6s, and that device gave much much better FPS on the live filters of Instagram.<p>This got me thinking, maybe the Andoid ecosystem is degrading the iPhone experience too? Probably Facebook is holding back on filter capabilities in the name of having the same features on all the platforms? If this Samsung flagship is not better than iPhone 6 in Instagramming, god knows what&#x27;s the experience on lower end devices.<p>BTW, TikTok filters have superior face tracking in my experience with excellent iPhone 6s performance. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the Andorid situation on TikTok.')
