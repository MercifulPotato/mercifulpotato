I am trying to follow the Hindu Lunar calender. But it’s a 2 week schedule based on full moon and new moon.<p>Basically on the 11th day after full moon and new moon, one fasts from sunrise to sunset. That’s twice a month. It’s called Ekadasi Fast.<p>But the real trick is preparing to fast 6-8 hours before and after the day of the fast.<p>Also the day after the fast, the food has to be grain&#x2F;gluten free(rice seems to be ok) and has certain ingredients like greens, herbs and spices. It’s very light.<p>Full moon and new moon days are always food for milk and fruit fasts. And there is a whole bunch of other religious day fasts. Example: no salt on 6th day after full&#x2F;new moon..a lot of ingredient restrictive fasts etc. I don’t know a lot about that but I have seen my mother observe it. I must find out more.<p>There seems to be a whole method to the madness and when scheduled properly, one can do staggered and scheduled partial fasts 6-7 days for a lunar fortnight. The calorie restriction mostly comes from the rules against certain ingredients.<p>Even in the pared down format I follow, I feel like I connect more with my food and am more mindful when I cook. Most of all, I don’t waste as much food because it’s so much work preparing the food! Of course, it’s seasonal. Having said that, I guess annual menu and schedule format has to be reversed for those in the Southern Hemisphere.')
