Their boss could tell because people weren&#x27;t screaming.<p>The other reason you bring your own people in at very senior levels is because, when battle lines are drawn (do X or Y, where X is better but Y has a collective millenia of man-hours already sunk in), a sr exec has to know their reports have latched their careers to them, and not the rest of the company. Because if that&#x27;s not the case, the sr exec has no chance at all.<p>It&#x27;s Hobbes&#x27; leviathan: you are your org, and vice verse.  Gotta make sure everyone acts like it.')
