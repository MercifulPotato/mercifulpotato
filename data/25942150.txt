We’re proud to have created a platform that has helped everyday people, from all backgrounds, shape their financial futures and invest for the long term.<p>&gt; We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.<p>&gt; Amid significant market volatility, it’s important as ever that we help customers stay informed.<p>&gt; We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets. We’re humbled to have helped many people invest in the markets for the first time.')
