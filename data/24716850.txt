Those 50ms to 100ms round-trip time between the user and the server, that&#x27;s what is causing most of the visible delays.<p>Ship your users an app including a copy of the data ahead of time, and you have no visible delays. It&#x27;s as easy as that :)<p>And before you criticise that this won&#x27;t work for every use case, consider that IMAP is basically an offline-capable newsfeed. Also, I can buy a DVD with a directory of all US businesses.<p>The only reason why Facebook and Yelp work the way they do is because otherwise they would have to give up on some of the tracking. Because for some reason, people are more tolerant towards privacy invasive tracking if it&#x27;s a &quot;web app&quot; instead of a native app.')
