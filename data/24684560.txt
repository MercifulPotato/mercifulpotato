With PHP&#x2F;FastCGI, it&#x27;s not a problem because after every request, the memory is thrown away. You just need to trust that PHP-FPM itself doesn&#x27;t leak.<p>But that said, I do use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactphp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactphp.org&#x2F;</a> occasionally for certain types of tasks (like running a websocket server) and that works great too, but it takes extra care to make sure not to use blocking IO and to take more care of memory management.')
