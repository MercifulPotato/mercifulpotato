I have the same exact story from 25 years ago.<p>Before freshman year, I had to sit down with my guidance councilor to select my electives. I chose Spanish and Drafting. She said both of those were a &quot;bad fit for an honors student&quot;; that I should take French and Art instead.<p>I acquiesced, not too happy about it but also trusting she knew what was better.<p>A few weeks later I got my schedule. Apparently French was booked up so I got Spanish. But still had to go to Art class.<p>I dropped that a week later and switched to drafting, which I did all four years of high school. The first two years were technical drawing and the next two were architectural drafting. This is when I convinced the teacher to let me fire up the 386s in the back of the room. They all had Generic CADD[0] on them, which remains one of my favorite CAD programs of all time. Simple, but wicked fast with two-key commands for everything.  (i.e. &quot;ZB&quot; for zoom to box, &quot;C3&quot; for a 3-point circle, etc.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;winworldpc.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;generic-cadd&#x2F;60" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;winworldpc.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;generic-cadd&#x2F;60</a>')
