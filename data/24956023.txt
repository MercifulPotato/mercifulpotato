The original Rust compiler was implemented in it. By this, Rust has a very clear (OCa)ML heritage.<p>It&#x27;s meaningless to argue, whether Rust got ADTs from Haskell or OCaml, because the author (Graydon Hoare) had been clearly familiar with both and both got ADTs from ML, which is much older than either of them.<p>On the other hand, traits are a different story, those just Type classes with a different name, and that is a Haskell thing.')
