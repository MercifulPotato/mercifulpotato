It&#x27;s impossible to provide a valuable product or service for free without institutionalizing either slavery or robbery, and not everyone agrees on that trade-off.<p>Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum of opinion regarding this, it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that there are some people with philosophical objections to encoding nonconsensual interactions like slavery or robbery into the fabric of our society.<p>Many reasonable people agree that providing healthcare (or other important services) for &quot;free&quot; to all people is more important than not having the government rob people to pay for it.<p>Many reasonable people agree that that is a bridge too far, and that we shouldn&#x27;t be robbing people, regardless of what the stolen money is used to do.<p>Both are sincere positions held by sane, reasonable, intelligent, empathetic people.')
