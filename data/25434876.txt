If cattle eat on grass how can they increase CO2 emissions?<p>I know farming will create some to run the machinery and transport the meant and milk but isn&#x27;t it a closed loop for the cattle? They eat grass for energy. They use that energy and create CO2. But the grass had to pull the same amount of CO2 out of the air to store that energy right?<p>Is it that the other gases are more harmful or is there something I&#x27;m missing?')
