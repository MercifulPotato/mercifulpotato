Our governments are quietly implementing all the worst aspects of Chinese authoritarianism and pervasive surveillance without any of the benefits of having a competent government that&#x27;s able to deal with large scale problems.<p>China dealt with the pandemic swiftly and decisively and life is getting back to normal there now. Meanwhile, the West had months of warning and vast majority of the governments chose to do nothing. Instead of stocking up on supplies and preparing the public the officials and the media called Chinese lockdowns authoritarian and played down the severity of the problem until thousands of people started dying. Our governments chose to protect business interests and to sacrifice the public for the sake of the profits.<p>The pandemic is just a small preview of what we can expect to happen with climate change in the coming decade.')
