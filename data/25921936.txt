The traders charged by the SEC were acting in coordinattion to drive stock prices up and down with manufactured orders.<p>On the other hand, WSB is just a bunch of different people and a lot of them have bought GME because they thought would go up.<p>By your logic, anytime a stock goes up, how&#x27;s it not just manipulation?
