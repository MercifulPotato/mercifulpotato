With people generally being wary of air travel due to Covid, and the economic pressures to not spend as much, a road trip + an AirBnb do seem like an attractive vacation option: it&#x27;s far enough from home, and it&#x27;s more affordable than a hotel.<p>On the topic of luxury, I&#x27;m not sure people appreciate what air travel becoming a luxury really entails. My wife mentioned a few months ago that air travel from North America to China was going for something like $80k per ticket at some point (and this is for economy class!). If we see Covid case numbers increasing again due to the flu season coming up, and if we see subsequent governmental pressures to limit air travel for even more extending periods of time, then the laws of supply and demand might make air travel prohibitively expensive even for relatively well-off people, like FAANG folks.<p>Perhaps a silver lining is that in such a scenario, maybe places like Bali might get a chance to take a break from tourist ecological destruction.')
