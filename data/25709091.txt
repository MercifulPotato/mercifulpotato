Even though it&#x27;s also mostly centred around the USA (it&#x27;s natural as that&#x27;s the demographic it seems), it&#x27;s not bad. Wanted conversations where others were not trolling, or giving knee-jerk reactions, and responses full of sense of self-entitlement and ones that basically just said &quot;you are doing it wrong!&quot;. I also wanted to have a place where you are visibly anonymous but not really anonymous when you try to get away with something nasty.<p>SA:<p>It was a mistake.')
