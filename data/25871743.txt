Let&#x27;s say you want to wait for it to be correct; how long do you wait?</i><p>I know how long I want to wait, 30 minutes in one of my cases as I know that I&#x27;ve seen 95% of the important data by then. In the streaming world there is _always_ late data so being able to tell what should happen when the rest (5%) arrives is crucial for me.<p>This differs from use-case to use-case for me and being able to configure this and handling out-of-order data at scale is key for me when selecting a framework for stream processing.\nApache Beam and Apache Flink do this very well.<p>Taken from [1]: <i>Apache Beam has some other approach where you use both and there is some magical timeout and it only works for windows or something and blah blah blah... If any of you all know the details, drop me a note.</i> \nIt obviously only works when you window your data as it needs to fit in memory. The event-time and system-time concept from Beam and Flink are very similar, also the watermark approach. \nThank you for sharing the links, For me it is now clearer where the difference lies between differential-dataflow and stream-processing frameworks (which also offer SQL and even ACID conformity!). I&#x27;m using Beam&#x2F;Flink in production and missing out on one of these mentioned points is a deal-breaker for me.')
