Evading arrest is not a capital offense and they don&#x27;t mention that he had a weapon or that they believe he intended to harm anyone, so it&#x27;s hard to see how pulling their weapons is justified.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to use the fact that he hit some stuff while <i>fleeing from the men with guns</i> to justify drawing the guns. In fact, provoking panicked flight seems like a pretty foreseeable outcome of drawing a gun on someone. If I had a gun drawn on me I might very well flee in a panic, potentially hitting cars with mine. They drew the guns before he did any of that and it&#x27;s reasonable to think them drawing them made those outcomes more likely.<p>Edit: Here are the NJ deadly use of force standards [1]. My reading of the standards would not allow the use of deadly force in this situation. The rules also state that officers should only unholster their weapons when &quot;circumstances create a reasonable belief that display of a firearm as an element of constructive authority helps establish or maintain control in a potentially dangerous situation.&quot; It&#x27;s hard to see what was &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; in this situation before the guns were drawn.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nj.gov&#x2F;oag&#x2F;dcj&#x2F;agguide&#x2F;useofforce2001.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nj.gov&#x2F;oag&#x2F;dcj&#x2F;agguide&#x2F;useofforce2001.pdf</a>')
