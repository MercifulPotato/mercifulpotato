The traveller must be infected (sub 5% odds)<p>2. They must decide to break isolation (most people are honest)<p>3. They must actively be infectious at the time they do (most people infect zero people. The household attack rate is 17%!)<p>4. They have to go someplace where they can infect many (e.g. a bar rather than breaking isolation for a park or groceries or family)<p>5. The govt must be slow to react once cases are detected<p>NZ has had outbreaks but reverted to normal. As you say, everyone is waiting for a vaccine. Seems infinitely preferable to wait in NZ rather than in France or UK which just locked down again. Youâ€™re functionally quite free in australia and NZ.')
