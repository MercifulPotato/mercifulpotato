We have quite a few &quot;makeObservable(input)&quot; in our code to make @Inputs observable. That the framework doesn&#x27;t do it automatically is a bit of a let down.<p>Same about Reactive Forms.<p>Patching each @Output and @Input through a component by hand is also pretty annoying, especially if they change relatively often. A custom input field for a reactive form gets quite large due to all the in- and outputs.')
