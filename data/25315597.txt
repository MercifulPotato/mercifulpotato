It was joined soon after by other newspapers and journals that received support from officials and businessmen linked to the regime. &quot;<p>&quot;Until 1992, Radio Rwanda was very much the voice of the government and of the president himself.... Before the daily news programs, Radio Rwanda broadcast excerpts of Habyarimana’s political speeches. This national radio sometimes broadcast false information, particularly about the progress of the war, but most people did not have access to independent sources of information to verify its claims.<p>In March 1992, Radio Rwanda warned that Hutu leaders in Bugesera were going to be murdered by Tutsi, false information meant to spur the Hutu massacres of Tutsi.&quot;<p>[later Radio Rwanda becomes less partisan:]<p>&quot;With the new direction at Radio Rwanda and the voice of the RPF increasingly strong, Hutu hard-liners decided to create their own station. They began planning their radio in 1992, incorporated it as Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) in April 1993, and began broadcasting in August 1993....&quot;<p>&quot;Although nominally private and opposed to Radio Rwanda, RTLM in fact was linked in a number of ways with the national radio, with other state agencies and with the MRND. RTLM was allowed to broadcast on the same frequencies as the national radio between 8am and 11am, when Radio Rwanda was not transmitting, an arrangement that encouraged listeners to see the two as linked, if not as identical. The new station also drew personnel from Radio Rwanda, including Nahimana, who played a leading role at RTLM after having been dismissed from ORINFOR, and announcer Noel Hitimana.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;1999&#x2F;rwanda&#x2F;Geno1-3-10.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;1999&#x2F;rwanda&#x2F;Geno1-3-10.htm</a>')
