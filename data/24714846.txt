Item(by='borroka', descendants=None, kids=[24714879], score=None, time=1602122069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693324, text='I speak English and Spanish well, I&#x27;d say fluently (my native language is neither English nor Spanish). I studied English in high school (2 hours a week), but I first chatted with native speakers ~ 15 years ago. I have been living in the US for 10 years and I use English continuously: I read in English, I listen to the radio in English, podcasts, TV. I have a very rich vocabulary, I&#x27;d say in the top 15% of native English speakers. For the life of me, I cannot watch movies without subtitles. That does not happen with podcasts, radio, or live talks. It is not that I understand nothing, but I struggle. My hypothesis is that the movie dialogue is not &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;intuitive&quot; and I cannot predict in some way what will be said. That prediction—I hypothesize—is needed when, allow me to use this image, the language is still not &quot;yours&quot;. I still make mistakes when writing, I forget &quot;s&quot; all the time when using the third person and other minor mistakes that native speakers basically never make. I just don&#x27;t feel the language they way I feel my native language.<p>I have yet to meet someone who has learned a language in their 20s and became as fluent as they are in their native language. The brain is increasingly less plastic the older we get and that is undoubtedly true for anyone who is not living in fantasy world for both motor and cognitive abilities.<p>PS, I am sure there are some typos, despite me having read my post a few times.')
