I’m sure their lawyers charge between $200-750&#x2F;hr (pretty standard for a decent lawyer), so $1MM isn’t going to go very far. If they employ lawyers full time for this at 200-500k&#x2F;yr, there won’t be many working on this team for very long.<p>Defending a medium complexity case against a deep picker (RIAA) will easy surpass that, and that’s just a single case.<p>The question is how can this be sustainable and not a trivial token?')
