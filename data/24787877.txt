It is enough when a political rift goes through society and also the military. This rift could lead to failure of command coehesion, split of the military and ultimately infighting.<p>Which could, if you ask me, be a risk in case trump wins but it is rather clear that the election was fradulent (not saying it will be, but let&#x27;s assume for the arguments sake it was). In which case the military would have to decide which &quot;president&quot; to follow, or to follow congress, or the senate, or someone else. Which could tear the military appart, let alone to speak of the national guard.')
