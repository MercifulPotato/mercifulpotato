Is it emissive vs reflective? Why would this make a difference? The only source of strain I can imagine for a monitor is if 1) it&#x27;s too bright, 2) it&#x27;s at bad distance so your eyes have to accommodate or verge uncomfortably. Does it have something with the spectrum of the reflected light?')
