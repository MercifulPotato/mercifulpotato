If I have an ARM laptop and I want to run a proprietary application on it that was compiled only for x86... well, I largely can’t. (Microsoft and Apple have both had to develop translation systems for this independently, and it slows things down and eats battery life. At least MS’s implementation, we don’t know much about Apple’s yet.) Contrast that to free software applications, where distros like Debian have thousands of them available in the repositories for all supported architectures, and you can build them yourself if they’re not in the repos.<p>If you want alternative OSes to be an option, buy hardware that runs with free software.')
