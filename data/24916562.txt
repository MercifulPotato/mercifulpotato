The issue with fake claims on Amazon is that they donâ€™t seem to be percentage based, so whether you sell 1000 items or 100k items the 4 fake claims might still get you suspended.<p>They will also reject invoices based on them not being in the exact format they are expecting. So a completely legitimate invoice that is missing an address&#x2F; phone number&#x2F; has a different entity could be rejected.<p>The whole thing is basically dangling a carrot, there is a massive customer base on offer, but in the end unless you fit a very specific profile as an authorised seller with solid local deals you are probably wasting your time.')
