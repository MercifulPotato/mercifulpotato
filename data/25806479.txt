One where they followed up the EV1 with a whole portfolio of electric cars. Maybe even converting Saturn to its first electric only brand.<p>Where would this put electric cars today? Would we see cars with a 500 mile range selling for $30k? I kinda doubt it.<p>My recollection is that GM instead pivoted massive investments in hydrogen fuel cells, which require much smaller batteries. It was probably a hedge against the slow advancement of battery technologies. Unfortunately it seems like hydrogen fuel cells are getting skipped entirely for battery electric vehicles for consumer vehicles.')
