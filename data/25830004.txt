No lost steps over the years, aside from crashes.  It will snap a 1&#x2F;4&quot; bit without losing a step.  It&#x27;s on a steel frame that is 900+ lbs of steel with 3 sheets of 5x10 3&#x2F;4&quot; mdf and it still vibrates every now and then.  Machine time to planning&#x2F;cad work is probably 1:10 which is about in line with my development work - 10hrs design for each hour of programming.')
