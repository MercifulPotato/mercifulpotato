Sex is about power.&quot;<p>I think the debate is not really about porn, but people&#x27;s sense of justice, cheating, deserving things or not etc.<p>Some feel like porn gives unearned satisfaction to young men, a virtual substitute they don&#x27;t have to work for. The bitter other side will say, no shit, I won&#x27;t slave away to get screwed over, it&#x27;s much more straightforward business to consume porn.<p>A wife may feel cheated and less desired, and therefore feel like they are less necessary, a &quot;resource&quot; they provide is devalued.<p>Puritans may feel like so much sexuality and hedonism tries to cheat and get the benefits, while not suffering consequences, like pregnancy, adult responsibility of family life etc. That it hollows out the sanctity of this intimate and symbolic act.<p>Others may feel camgirls are collecting undeserved money, they don&#x27;t do actual noble valuable work, just cash in based on their genetics and immorality.<p>It all comes down to a feeling that people get things they don&#x27;t deserve.<p>It&#x27;s about feelings that the young man should work his ass off to obtain status than satisfy himself with porn. The female performer should rather hold on to her sexual value and motivate men to work to get it and then only give it out when also taking on the responsibility of childbirth.<p>And therefore it&#x27;s not likely that the debate will get &quot;resolved&quot;, because it&#x27;s not about some objective disagreement but about who deserves what. It&#x27;s more metaphysical and depends on one&#x27;s fundamental worldview and framework of justice.')
