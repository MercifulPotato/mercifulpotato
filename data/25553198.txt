Office politics BS is commonplace and it&#x27;s part of human nature in a place where humans interact socially, but that becomes a lot harder when you&#x27;re working remotely (no references to give you about this statement, but I believe a lot of people have been saying this in the past few months). Can you really not believe that people can do work without a manager telling them to? I think that if that&#x27;s all you know, yeah, can be difficult to adjust... but I am fairly certain most people would adjust just fine to a situation where they are their own manager: they have a job to do, a target to achieve, and they have to figure out how to get there. Some level of administration is always needed, but that doesn&#x27;t require a manager as we normally have them. Just another worker whose focus is on metrics&#x2F;people.')
