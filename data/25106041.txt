Also you can listen to his podcast:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelinggood.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;dr-davids-blogs&#x2F;feeling-good-podcast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelinggood.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;dr-davids-blogs&#x2F;feeling-goo...</a><p>His podcasts cover a lot of the book and have some live therapy sessions etc...<p>If you are in the Bay area he works with a clinic that dos TEAM therapy in Mountain View.<p>I consider myself an expert in depression and anxiety having had them since I was a teenager.  His book Feeling Good helped me.  I first picked it up 10-15 years ago and never read it.  I finally did read some of it in the past 2 years, but in actuality it has been the podcasts that have really helped.<p>There&#x27;s another podcast called &quot;Therapist Uncensored&quot; that is also really great.')
