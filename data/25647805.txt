Yes, some are terrible, or haven&#x27;t been maintained but others are exceptional and make Gutenberg look simple (edited: I originally wrote &quot;joke&quot; but that was too harsh).<p>The biggest pain I have with page builders are related to licensing as most are &quot;bundled&quot; with premium themes, and most clients don&#x27;t understand that a premium theme isn&#x27;t a one-time purchase, but is instead an annual service (to enable updates)  Typically, the client has to either re-purchase the theme (with the newest versions), or purchase a stand-alone license for the page builder.')
