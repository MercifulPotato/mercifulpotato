The states have these doses, and it is the state health departments which are just refusing to give the vaccines to people out of &quot;fairness&quot;.<p>In my state, Arizona, the injection sites are open from 8-5 every day, and were closed on New Years Day.<p>This is so far past frustrating to me that I don&#x27;t have words for it.  Get the fucking vaccines into people&#x27;s arms YESTERDAY.  Don&#x27;t take one minute of rest until you have to as you wait to get resupplied.<p>Here&#x27;s a tracker: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;covid-vaccine-tracker-glo...</a><p>We were giving 400,000 vaccine doses.  So far we have used 1&#x2F;4 of them.  75% of our supply is sitting on a shelf while people go home every day at 5:00, or take a day off to celebrate the new year.<p>Not acceptable.<p>I just absolutely do not understand why these state health departments won&#x27;t get going.  For the love of god this is NOT the time to be <i>taking vacation days</i>.  I just cannot even wrap my head around that.  This pandemic is so awful that we are locking people in their homes, doing who knows what sort of damage to an entire generation of children, locking the elderly in nursing homes isolated from the world, destroying businesses, neglecting cancer treatments and screenings, and sprinting as fast as we can towards a collapsing economy.<p>We have the solution sitting in a freezer.  Instead of putting it into practice, people are going on vacation.<p>Is this a catastrophic global pandemic or not?  Why are people seriously taking VACATION time during something which is causing the collapse of our society?<p>Here&#x27;s a story from 5 days ago where a New Mexico man has had to sue for the ability to <i>touch his wife</i> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fox19.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;31&#x2F;husband-sues-right-touch-wife-nm-nursing-home-amid-covid-pandemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fox19.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;31&#x2F;husband-sues-right-touch-wi...</a>). And people are going on vacation instead of solving this?  They&#x27;re going home at 5:00?')
