You can talk about how it&#x27;s necessary for businesses to let the &quot;public know about their products&quot;, but you can&#x27;t really get around this description of it. It&#x27;s pretty inconsistent with the idea of free speech, but supposed defenders of free speech don&#x27;t seem to have any problem with <i>paid speech</i>.<p>A lot of advertising is negative, not in the sense of attack ads, but in what it is that you agree not to say, for money. When advertisers pull &quot;funding&quot; when a platform doesn&#x27;t censor &quot;swear words&quot;, the lack of swear words is now an advertisement. Do we really think that there is a consistent definition of free speech which is compatible with advertising?<p>Freedom and anarchy are <i>different</i>.')
