For example, all companies are exploiting employees (by gaining a profit on them) and certain business opportunities in some shape or form. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s necessarily bad as &quot;giving back&quot; might be part of that exploitation. Many businesses have incentives to keep the exploitation sustainable.<p>If you have an issue with this, then you have an issue with capitalism, IMO. And that&#x27;s fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t frame it as having an issue against exploitation.')
