So hash those random ids with a key that this someone has no access to. Now you have anonymized ids you can count uniquely and that cannot be linked to individuals.<p>You can anonymize data if you really want to and use it for understanding trends, usage etc in a privacy respectful way. Few companies bother these days though. And yes if you want a 100% watertight way, it’s hard.')
