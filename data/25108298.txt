Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605503641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107132, text='$10K is a move[0], or a huge chunk of a down payment on a reasonably priced home[1]. If you&#x27;re a high paid tech worker who&#x27;s been seeing a huge percentage of your salary go to sky high rent, that extra $10K might be enough to do it.<p>[0] I&#x27;ve moved cross states a few times into and out of 2bd apartments; for a self pack move you can easily expect to pay about $6-10k, depending on distance, housing arrangements, and truck configuration (single truck is cheaper than a transfer to a semi-truck).<p>[1] Minimum down payment on a house is typically 3.5% with good credit. $10K is enough of a down payment for a ~$300k home, minus closing costs.')
