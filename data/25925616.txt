As a profession we base our decisions on blog posts and potential fun.<p>I&#x27;m all for these technologies, I&#x27;m against the fact that regularly as a profession we order multi million dollar digging equipment to dig a small hole. I&#x27;ve literally seen a bored group of devops start building their own cicd solution and give up after a few months of (highly paid) work<p>Not to mention that all these powerful technologies are super complicated and developers don&#x27;t take the proper time to learn how to operate it correctly.<p>Just think of the Hadoop craze 5 or so years ago when people were throwing it at few gig datasets. Or even now what&#x27;s happening with &quot;data engineering&quot; where we build massive pipelines that could be handled by a competent python script. It&#x27;s crazy and we don&#x27;t as a profession have any success criteria on our deliverables and we&#x27;ve just accepted that &quot;things are hard&quot; while getting paid more than most professions can dream about')
