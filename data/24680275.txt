And that means hearing stories about punch cards and building basic computers too.<p>My first computer memories were using a TRS-80, DOS, and then Windows (from 3.11). But for Linux, it would be in that experimental college phase, building computers, getting compiz to work (and RAID, Wine, ...). I wrote about this recently (in the context of gaming as well) [1].<p>In short, I just like tinkering, hacking, making my computer my own. Linux is just fun for me, and I have been using exclusive that for several years now, having finally moved away from Windows for games (thanks to Steam and Proton especially, as well as more Linux indie games) and photo editing (thanks Darktable! [2]).<p>Now back to literate programming for my dotfiles with Emacs org-mode :-)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boilingsteam.com&#x2F;my-journey-to-finally-ditching-windows-for-good&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boilingsteam.com&#x2F;my-journey-to-finally-ditching-wind...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9bladed.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;foss_photography&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9bladed.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;foss_photography&#x2F;</a>')
