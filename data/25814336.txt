In 50 years time I seriously doubt github.com will still be the same place it is today doing the same things. Maybe older protocols will die out, making accessing content over HTTP(S) impossible, maybe P2P will just break due to advances or newer stacks taking over. Maybe the &quot;internet&quot; will change in some fundamental way, and breakage is part of the &quot;innovation&quot; process.<p>The way you write a comment on HN is likely to change over the course of decades, I doubt it&#x27;ll still be the same HTML, HTTP, networking stack etc.')
