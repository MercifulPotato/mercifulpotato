Just because you&#x27;re dealing with money does NOT mean you should be able to build or accessa digital portfolio of everyone. It&#x27;s ludicrous. I&#x27;d like to know how these people think we even got to the position we&#x27;re at that they can even think of doing it. People allocated capital. Lack of info be damned. The world runs on and in spite of inefficiencies, and arguably a lot more equitably when there isn&#x27;t an absurd amount of data being expected to be in place from the ground up.<p>Absolutely mind boggling.')
