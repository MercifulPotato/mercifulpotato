There is one (perhaps two) month with excess mortality. &quot;very high excess&quot; is not a term I would use since it would leave almost no room between standard variance in death numbers and &quot;high excess&quot; or &quot;medium excess&quot; or &quot;low excess&quot;. I see what mind-set you bring into this though - good, you are part of the group I wanted to reach.<p>I will post what I just posted below:\n&quot;Do you need help interpreting the data and graph given previous conversation? The height of the bars represent the number of deaths over different years and the bars are basically same height. I.e. considering all deaths, covid and actions taken (no lockdown but more distancing), no more than usual have died. Especially considering last year was a bit lower and therefore likely some old people who didnt die last year unfortunately did so this year.&quot;<p>If you only look at one month then yes there is absolutely an increase. If you want to stare blindly at that month then go ahead. Scream if you want to also. But I think some might be interested in hearing that no more than usual have died in Sweden this year. I have seen similar stats for other countries.')
