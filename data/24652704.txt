When at home, the port would go to a hub, and the hub connects a few monitors, a keyboard, a mouse, and power. Out and about, the hub would go to power.<p>Sadly, on my expensive as hell, powerful work supplied macbook pro, I need to plug three different USB-C dongles in to get multiple monitors, and I have to plug the USB keyboard and USB mouse into separate dongles, and power into a third. Why? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s just the only way it works.')
