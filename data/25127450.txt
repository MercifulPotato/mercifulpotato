Most writers are not deliberately sequencing their word order in the sentences which results in passive voice.  Instead, most writers are <i>omitting the active agent</i> because it&#x27;s the <i>easier default</i>.  Unfortunately, this overuse of passive voice lacks punch.<p>Example of a classic passive voice sentence: <i>&quot;Mistakes were made.&quot;</i><p>Writers love hiding behind passive constructions like that. With no explicit agent, there&#x27;s nobody in specific to point blame at nor offend.  But the reader wants to know _who_ made the mistake. If possible, write the agent into the sentence: <i>&quot;Nixon made mistakes.&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;Kissinger made mistakes.&quot;</i><p>There was a writing style book that compared 10-K annual financial reports from companies that got hit by accounting scandals (Enron, Worldcom) vs clean companies (Berkshire Hathaway &amp; Warren Buffet). <i>There was a significantly more passive voice sentences in the dishonest companies.</i> In contrast, Warren Buffet writes in a lively active-voice style (&quot;I invested in this. We lost money on that.&quot;)  I just checked the BH&#x27;s most recent 2020 10-K and Warren Buffet still writes in active voice.<p>(I wonder if there&#x27;s a hedge fund that uses text analysis software to scan 10-K filings to quantify which company is overusing passive-voice as a parameter to their models.)<p>For technical reports like &quot;post-mortem of website outages&quot;... the heavy use of passive voice is understandable since it&#x27;s just trying to explain the problem and eventual solution and not focus on _who_ fat-fingered the command-line with incorrect config to cause the outage.')
