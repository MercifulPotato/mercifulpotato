E.g. they&#x27;re not about &quot;I like it more or less&quot; but e.g. about the taste changing from sweeter to less sweet.<p>For example tomatoes (it&#x27;s covered in a few books on the subject) have lost a large part of their sugar content after the 80s due to mass market techniques and genes that yield more and less quickly riping ones, but of lower taste.')
