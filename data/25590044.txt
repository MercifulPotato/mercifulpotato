The system learned n-grams from names you liked, and other info like name origins etc. I tidied it all up into what I hoped was a tasteful Mac app, used some free Google Ad credit, and it was very satisfying to see that people used it, but it was never popular enough to pay its own way, despite briefly being the number one lifestyle app on the UK Mac App store.<p>I would have done better if I&#x27;d tweaked the algorithm more, done an iPhone version, or just taken it seriously, but it mostly came out of a personal need and in the absence of clear signs it was valuable it was easy to let go (especially when later sandboxing rules for Mac apps broke some fundamental stuff around persistent documents).<p>You can see some screenshots at:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lemonwatcher&#x2F;status&#x2F;1286082683412582403" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lemonwatcher&#x2F;status&#x2F;1286082683412582403</a>')
