I lead you to my garage. You look inside and see a ladder, empty paint cans, an old tricycle--but no dragon.<p>&gt; &quot;Where&#x27;s the dragon?&quot; you ask.<p>&gt; &quot;Oh, she&#x27;s right here,&quot; I reply, waving vaguely. &quot;I neglected to mention that she&#x27;s an invisible dragon.&quot;<p>&gt; You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon&#x27;s footprints.<p>&gt; &quot;Good idea,&quot; I say, &quot;but this dragon floats in the air.&quot;<p>&gt; Then you&#x27;ll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.<p>&gt; &quot;Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless.&quot;<p>&gt; You&#x27;ll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.<p>&gt; &quot;Good idea, but she&#x27;s an incorporeal dragon and the paint won&#x27;t stick.&quot;<p>&gt; And so on. I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won&#x27;t work.<p>&gt; Now, what&#x27;s the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?<p>&gt; If there&#x27;s no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?<p>&gt; Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.<p>&gt; Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder.')
