Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604409888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972918, text='&gt; Fortunately Fields Medal tier mathematical problems have never come up in my professional programming career.<p>Ah, but you see, I&#x27;ve used this problem only because you could be easily convinced of its difficulty because it&#x27;s a well-known one and others have tried solving it unsuccessfully. But hard problems come up all the time, especially when concurrency is involved. You just don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re hard at first glance. For example, the specification that a database be kept on multiple computers to offer redundancy without loss of data is a staple of distributed computing, but finding an algorithm that does it (perhaps together with some other latency requirements) is <i>extremely</i> hard and it took many years to find the first one that could do it.<p>That easy specifications are easy to derive doesn&#x27;t help us, because they might also be the same programs that are easy to test or be convinced of their correctness in some other ways. The whole point of formal methods is to help us with the hard cases, which, sadly, are <i>very</i> frequent.<p>&gt;  A program can feasibly be derived that can&#x27;t feasibly be verified without access to the discrete documented steps of the derivation.<p>Not if it&#x27;s done <i>formally</i>. A formal derivation guarantees proof, and, in fact, the problem of verification is easily reducible to derivation, i.e., derivation is no easier. Here is the proof: X is a program, and so, also a specification, and P(X) is some property that you want to verify for X. A formal derivation of a program from the specification X âˆ§ P(X) will, therefore, prove P(X). This is the &quot;trick&quot; I used with the &quot;Goldbach program&quot;, except it&#x27;s not a trick, but a basic result in the study of the hardness of program analysis, a subject that&#x27;s been extensively studied for a few decades now. The claim that it&#x27;s easier to derive than to prove is just mathematically false. With regards to claims about informal &quot;proofs&quot; or &quot;derivations&quot; it&#x27;s hard to say anything, because the problem is not well-stated.')
