I suspect but cannot prove that they would be very useful in conjunction with constrained optimization engines.<p>Specifically: many optimization engines give very arcane feedback about infeasibilities and singularities which cause optimizations to fail and users to be frustrated.  I feel like plugging a datalog system into the optimization engine would give end users a really powerful way to ask questions about the sources of infeasibilities and singularities.  If changes to the optimization problem were tracked I would expect these systems to be a very intuitive way to say things like &quot;tell me all the rules which participate in an infeasibility that have been changed recently.&quot;')
