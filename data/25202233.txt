At the very least, generally you need to at least apply a transformation (e.g. logistic) to create a nonlinear model from a linear model, because most problem spaces are nonlinear. A nonlinear model doesn&#x27;t have to be particularly complex though.<p>B) Machine learning (i.e. automatic tuning of parameters) is far simpler for the user than manual tuning of parameters. It&#x27;s not a question of whether you &quot;need&quot; machine learning, but whether it will save you work. In fact, the author here is in denial - he actually says he would do machine learning, but doesn&#x27;t realize that is what it is: &quot;Instead of doing anything fancy, my program generates the coefficients at random to explore the space. If I wanted to generate a good driver for a course, Iâ€™d run a few thousand of these and pick the coefficients that complete the course in the shortest time.&quot;')
