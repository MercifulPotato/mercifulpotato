Microsoft is possibly the worst among them. Gone are the days of being able to use a free edition of Visual Studio to develop Windows applications with no strings attached. And good luck even figuring out what the privacy policy is, a problem that also applies with VS Code. I mean, why should <i>desktop software</i> even need a privacy policy?! Oh, right, telemetry, the plague of 21st century software. And then you have the mobile platforms and the offensive conditions and financial cut demanded by their gatekeepers, keeping Microsoft company in the obnoxious developer experiences department.<p>Meanwhile, OSS development tools and open platforms seem to be blowing away much of the proprietary stuff in administrative and business terms (as well as often in technical terms) now. Too many greedy platform owners trying to lock everyone in, not realising that Ballmer was right all along and without developers their platform is worthless anyway. And discussions like this, and the emphasis today on cloud-hosting (usually running FOSS) and web apps, are the result.')
