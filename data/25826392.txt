Most people in a relationship have been arguing about the same inane shit for years that they can&#x27;t take a step back and look at the big-picture perspective of the problem in their relationship. They might see it as &quot;My wife doesn&#x27;t want to move to another city I got a fantastic job offer in&quot; but the real problem might be something like &quot;my wife values her social connections in this city&quot; or &quot;my wife doesn&#x27;t want to interrupt her own career because that provides her a sense of security&quot;. Some of these underlying issues can be resolved or negotiated, some can&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re dealing with a meta-problem like &quot;my husband is unwilling to compromise on anything&quot; or &quot;my wife has contempt for me&quot;, it&#x27;s quite unlikely that you can fix that and impossible that you can just come to an agreement on that.')
