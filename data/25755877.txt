When I say &quot;state-of-the-art&quot;, I meant &quot;up-to-date techniques currently practiced in the industry&quot;, not theoretically optimal. For example, &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; cryptography is TLS v1.3, AES-GCM, or the Signal protocol, while a theoretically optimal one might be an &quot;one-time pad&quot; (or superoptimization in your example).<p>In other words, &quot;We all know standard compilers are slow. Does it mean that for a compiler to reach ICC&#x2F;GCC&#x2F;clang&#x27;s -O2 performance in benchmarks require inherently expensive optimizations? Or is it simply that ICC&#x2F;GCC&#x2F;clang&#x27;s optimizes are poorly implemented in terms of compile performance?&quot;')
