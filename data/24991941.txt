An employee works for an employer, employer pays them for their work. That should be the only contract. The health insurance market should be the same no matter who you work for. In fact living in Australia, the user experience I want is to pay a bit extra in tax and receive the same level of affordable healthcare.<p>I just find it so hard that many Americans don&#x27;t see the logic in this. This is NOT a new idea. It&#x27;s being done for over a 100 years in many modern nations. Employee healthcare is only an American thing AFAIK. It&#x27;s a shitty deal for both employers and employees.')
