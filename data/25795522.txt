I mean, it doesn&#x27;t look to me, as if there is a management behind this, that actually has a goal.<p>It looks more like they are giving funds to projects who apply for them. IMO, they should state 3 clear goals and sponsor specific projects which reach those goals. To give some example how those could look like:<p>- create a decentralized, federated instant messaging platform, that is build on public standards<p>- create an e-learning platform that is usable with already established devices<p>- establish a market for the created software with partners<p>Naturally, all result would have to be open-source products and the goals would need some details&#x2F;numbers to measure them. They could even invest into already established projects, but please, with easy to understand goals.')
