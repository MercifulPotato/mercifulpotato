Today there are all sorts of jobs that used to provide a living wage, that don&#x27;t anymore. With no college and limited training, you could hire on at an assembly plant and make enough to support yourself. These types of jobs are getting scarcer and scarcer.<p>raising minimum wage makes this worse, not better. even more jobs will be automated by technology removing even more unskilled labor jobs<p>&gt;This is a really hard aspect to design for. I agree that we can&#x27;t require that all jobs pay enough to support a single earner&#x27;s ability to rent an apartment, feed themselves, pay for a car, auto insurance, healthcare, etc. If that were the case, I would never have found work in my teens and early 20s.<p>yup<p>&gt;I could not agree more. The labor market become so much freer when these things are taken out of the employment equation. My employer should not be anywhere near my healthcare. The way we allowed ourselves to tie those 2 things together is one of the greatest drags on our economy, and for labor mobility and opportunity. If we had a UBI along with healthcare, I could see minimum wage being thrown out altogether. Employers would offer what the job is worth, and workers would work for what they value their own time at.<p>yup. absolutely.')
