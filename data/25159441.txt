It will absolutely make sure that your filesystem doesn&#x27;t get corrupted by a power loss but if you didn&#x27;t fsync your write you had no place believing it was persisted.<p>Doing that IMHO matches real world use much better.\nIf I do a compile and get a power outage I don&#x27;t care\nif some object files get lost. If I do an INSERT in a DB I do care a lot but the DB knows that and will fsync before\ntelling me it succeeded. So making sync explicit\ngives you both great performance and flexibility.')
