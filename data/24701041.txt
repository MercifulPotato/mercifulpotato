How can a community of people be so aligned with my interests, and yet they are the most unpleasant, unfunny, stuck up people on the planet?<p>Everyone in this community is used to being the smartest person in the room, and it shows. No one ever assumes good faith on the part of other posters. No one ever actually tries to understand the other point of view. No one even understands what they themselves are saying. This is an echo chamber of the most egoistic people on the planet, and that&#x27;s why I browse HN. It&#x27;s like some kind of massive terrarium for the socially doomed.<p>Even your comment is offensive, with the passive aggressive &quot;Let&#x27;s not do X,&quot; as if we&#x27;re part of some kind of collective, or I&#x27;m some kind of child that needs to be gently chided for my remark.<p>You don&#x27;t know me. I don&#x27;t know you. Where does this holier-than-thou attitude come from?')
