The same investment in nuclear wouldn&#x27;t be net beneficial in the same way because less immediacy in the spend, and so less effective economic levers for the right-now economic problem: out the other side, we&#x27;d have an amazing modern supply network built out of a mixture of sources, and maybe thats ok?<p>I see huge correlations being leftist in general, and anti nuclear. There is a small c conservative movement who believe in the integrity of the land and oppose nuclear because its just not how fox-hunting people of tory bent, envisage the land being run. But, they are a tiny minority. Most of the active anti nuclear people are either declared centre-left or lefterward of center-left (IMHO)<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the covid question.
