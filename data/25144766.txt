But it doesn&#x27;t mean the revenue share they currently have is unfair.<p>Other companies have a similar revenue share on their platforms on open platforms. So that suggests to me that it is fair.<p>&gt; Epic&#x27;s app store, for example, would take 12%, instead of 30%. This would help consumers if they were allowed to use it.<p>Would it? It will help developers but it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily reduce the prices for the games because the market price for a AAA game is still what Â£50? The devs would make more money per unit sold I would suspect.')
