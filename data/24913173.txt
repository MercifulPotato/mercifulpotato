The industry is willing to skip ton of great candidates that fail the &quot;audition&quot;, just to avoid false positives. Otherwise great people and employees are ruled out, just because they can&#x27;t reflect their true value at work in a stressed 1-2 hours interview. Cheaper false positive hiring may ease the pressure on the companies side to let them in. Having said that, because of stress, questions on interview should be 50%-60% difficult since the interviewee is not at 100%.')
