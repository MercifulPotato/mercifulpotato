Synced per the above.<p>- nextcloud includes a calendar server, to which I sync my google and outlook calendars.<p>- I have face recognition run on my photos by a nextcloud plugin.<p>- nextcloud also includes online collaborative docs, and other capavilities that I don&#x27;t use yet. Probably there are some for Geo data.<p>The whole thing is searchable through the web, desktop, or phone clients. I can pick a day and call up all the photos, notes, calendar appointments, and files for it. Or search by person, or search names and contents of files... It&#x27;s also got a WebDAV interface and a standardized API, share links with optional passwords, and it&#x27;s multi-user friendly.<p>Oh, and of course it&#x27;s the cheapest way to get terabytes of storage.<p>Highly recommended!')
