How can do that?&quot;, then the bugtracker is not being used correctly.<p>Not filing bugs is easier than filing bugs.  If someone stops to file a bug (as the original commenter wrote, &quot;to help the project&quot;) and someone responds to the bug reporter as if they&#x27;re trying to <i>get</i> help, then it&#x27;s just going to annoy the bug reporter and make it clear that they wasted their time.  That it&#x27;s possible for the ambiguity to even exist is a consequence of mixing bug reports with other types of feedback.  Bug trackers should be for tracking bugs.')
