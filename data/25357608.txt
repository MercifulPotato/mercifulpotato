Already saw social media sites that were censored (German specific law on reddit for example, at least they referenced the local NetzDG law). I have foreign proxies for stuff like this, but they shouldn&#x27;t be necessary. The cases where I saw it applied were mundane and in my opinion pretty harmless, because they were jokes.<p>Not a single constructive thing will come from this and the EU surely lacks the legitimacy for content control in this manner, even if current bad actors are states. They lack the legitimacy too, but that is another discussion.')
