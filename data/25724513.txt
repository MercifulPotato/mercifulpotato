That being said:<p>1) Single Family Home rentals are more rare, due to former SF dwellers seeking more space. (if living with roommates is preferred) SFH near campus tends to be particularly scarce &#x2F; pricey.<p>2) Rental terms less than 12 months are rare since landlords prefer stability and want to avoid the financial and temporal cost of re-renting.<p>3) The commonly available units will likely be pricier than Stanford dorm rooms.<p>4) The friction involved to rent a regular off campus housing unit (paperwork, security deposit, etc) is more burdensome than the turn key nature of on campus housing.<p>I imagine virtual-learning college students still prefer to live off campus but in the general area so that they can meet up with classmates off campus?')
