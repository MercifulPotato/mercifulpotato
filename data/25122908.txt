While AirBnB has received a lot negative press for facilitating the letting of would-be residential property by large-scale professional landlords, the marketing from AirBnB&#x27;s side has always favoured the &quot;local guide, personal human experience&quot; angle, an angle CouchSurfing has always tried to cover non-commercially.<p>So in my mind it&#x27;s a comprehensively bankrupt proposition from either side of the spectrum. It&#x27;s worse than a hotel (no service), worse than traditional self-catering tourist apartments (more expensive), worse than a long-term let (a LOT more expensive) and infinitely worse than the social, warm-fuzzy personal experience of CouchSurfing (free).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CouchSurfing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CouchSurfing</a>')
