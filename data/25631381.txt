There are a <i>lot</i> of H1B&#x2F;L1B workers stuck at bad teams with high amounts of pressure&#x2F;stress and incompetent or downright abusive managers.<p>For them, leaving the company isn&#x27;t an option because it means leaving the country and leaving a life-changing amount of money on the table and denying their children the advantage of growing up in the US.<p>You might argue they can switch teams, which is technically true, but this can complicate and delay the green card process, and vindictive managers often smear engineers with HR because people bailing on them makes them look bad. At Amazon for example, particularly bad managers will PIP an engineer to block them from transferring teams.<p>So while in general engineers are treated well and can choose where they want to work, I think we should also show some solidarity with our friends who don&#x27;t have the same options that we do.')
