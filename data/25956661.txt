A few months ago Monzo froze my account without warning or any reason.  Thankfully they de-froze it after an hour, but I&#x27;ve spent months since then in a kafkaesque nightmare trying to get an explanation for their actions.  &quot;It was a mistake&quot; ... &quot;the law says we cannot tell you why&quot; ... &quot;if it was a mistake why does a law protect you from having to explain?&quot; ... &quot;the law says we don&#x27;t have to answer that&quot; ... &quot;which law?&quot; ... &quot;the law says we can&#x27;t tell you which law&quot;.<p>Absolutely demented.  Apart from that they refused to send me a machine-readable copy of their response to a DPA request for my records and the support team behind their app literally ghosted me when I kept politely pointing out the inconsistencies in their arguments.<p>Bonus: when I complained they used someone else&#x27;s name when responding to it.  When I complained again they sent me their response to _a totally different person&#x27;s complaint about a totally different thing_.<p>Eventually I went back to First Direct (which is owned by HSBC).  Avoid Monzo like the plague.')
