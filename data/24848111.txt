Firefox is down to single digit marketshare. If Firefox is gone, it&#x27;s pretty much just Safari on mobile... and who else? (Chrome forks don&#x27;t count.)<p>As far as Firefox&#x27;s hands being tied: they had a deal with Yahoo starting in 2015 for 5 years.. and they terminated it in 2017 when their contract gave them an opportunity. So that should say something about Firefox&#x27;s choice in the matter.')
