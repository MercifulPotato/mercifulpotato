I think having a workplace is a benefit of having a job. The cognitive load of pretending that you are at work, without any benefits of having a OSHA&#x2F;legal workplace, is a cost that gets put on the worker. Companies should, at the fucking minimum, provide a stipend if they arent going to provide a workplace. Not to mention the skills that the employee loses by working at home, getting burnt out or over-worked, and then suffer and are paid less when they change jobs.\nBut....
