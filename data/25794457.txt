Right now our tax programs are not only lacking in transparency but are straight obtuse. This exists, i assume, because they had to work around peoples aversion to taxes and sticker shock when paying taxes.<p>A massively increased tax spend will only serve to illustrate the sticker-shock problem more. I just don&#x27;t see UBI happening until people can learn to pay for the common good, recognizing what they&#x27;re getting out of it and how the common good has material impacts on their self - even if entirely selfishly motivated <i>(as most Americans seem)</i>.<p>Unfortunately the only way i see UBI <i>(or similar)</i> happening is in the face of mass layoffs and lack of work due to a large technology change - like various forms of automation. Until then, it&#x27;s a problem people can&#x27;t see, aren&#x27;t directly affected by, and won&#x27;t want to pay for.')
