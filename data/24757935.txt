Because the car did not have connectivity at the time it detected the issue, it went into full lockdown (judging by the comments, it kept trying for a while, couldn&#x27;t connect, assumed the worst).<p>The car performed exactly the way it was programmed to perform. Tampering was detected. No connectivity was found. Lockdown. It will now have to be serviced by Ferrari, a local tech is not enough.<p>It is difficult to imagine a system that&#x27;s just as secure but less inconvenient. If you open the door for local &#x27;patches&#x27;, then you open avenues of attack. Better to do a `rm -rf *` and blow up a firmware chip or two for good measure. Threat vectors are potentially more sophisticated for these cars, if there&#x27;s a way to locally bypass the lockdown, it will be found.<p>The target demographic for these cars will not be inconvenienced much. As per the post, the owner went and got his Maserati.<p>So the takeaway for any Ferrari owners is: make sure there&#x27;s connectivity if you are trying to perform any changes to the vehicle.')
