But it might not be! You have absolutely no evidence either way - nor could you, even in principle! - and it’s extremely irritating to see such strongly-stated ignorance.<p>One of the major impetuses for the body positivity movement is the incredible danger of anorexia nervosa, which is the most lethal mental illness and has been spiking dramatically since the 80s. And as an unambiguously psychological disorder, nervosa rates are much more easily understood as a consequence of societal views of body image than obesity rates.<p>To be blunt: although there isn’t extant data, I strongly suspect that body positivity saves more lives than it loses. There will be many more women discouraged from starving themselves than women discouraged from moderate exercise and reasonable diets.<p>Regardless, obviously the body positivity movement has nothing to do with the 21st century rise in US obesity rates (not to mention Mexico). The problem in both countries is much more agricultural&#x2F;economic. And it strikes me as a bit ridiculous (or dishonest) to suggest that marginalizing body-positive ideologies can reduce the obesity rate.')
