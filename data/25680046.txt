I joined the National Space Society, which cost about $20 and then I was able to join the FCU. Then I cancelled my NSS membership. Not a bad signup cost, plus space is cool so I didn&#x27;t mind paying $20 to the NSS. I think the NSS also sent me a couple magazines, so it wasn&#x27;t just like a donation.')
