I store all my personal notes in Apple Notes. When I am at work and I need to store personal notes, I use my Google Keep that I will move to Apple Notes when I get home (Apple iCloud is blocked at work but not google  ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯ ). At work, I store all my notes in OneNote. OneNote is by far the best note taking tool I have ever used. I wish the Mac version was better. On my Kali box, I use Cherrynotes. I only use it for HackTheBox. If Microsoft would have a good linux and Mac version, I would use it instead of the others.')
