It asserts that the brain works as a sort of recursive two-sided process, with theory creation on one side and evidence collecting on the other.<p>SlateStarCodex has a nice article[1] about this.<p>&gt; The key insight: the brain is a multi-layer prediction machine. All neural processing consists of two streams: a bottom-up stream of sense data, and a top-down stream of predictions. These streams interface at each level of processing, comparing themselves to each other and adjusting themselves as necessary.<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt; You’re not seeing the world as it is, exactly.
