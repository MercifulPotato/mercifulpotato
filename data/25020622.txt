Or, maybe you&#x27;ve accidentally added a datapoint in the direction of the argument I&#x27;m making, which is that it is elitist to believe or desire or suggest or push the notion that people with college or higher degrees are better able to determine leaders than the non-educated.  I can expound on this - fundamentally ethical, not rational - argument if desired.  I&#x27;d argue even that it is an anti-democratic attitude.  My argument begins like this.  College degrees correlate with wealth, and people without degrees are, on average, lower in the income scale than those with college degrees.  70% of American adults don&#x27;t have American degrees.  Therefore, if you continue down the path of associating college degrees with correct voting, not only are you classist, you&#x27;re an elitist.<p>And you&#x27;ve also threw in &quot;not politically-correct&quot; into sexist and racist.  As if, political correctness the correct approach, and it&#x27;s on par with sexism and racism.  That actually bothers me a lot, because sexism and racism are often actions, political correctness is speech, and speech is considered on par with action.  But it bolsters the arguments that elites don&#x27;t understand what the polling is saying, many Americans don&#x27;t like political correctness.  It skews right-wing, but there are a large number of economically left-wing people who, also, don&#x27;t like political-correctness.  The polls show it. And the two journalists I quoted above also reference this, and I can send some data if desired.')
