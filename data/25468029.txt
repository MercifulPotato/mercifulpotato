Item(by='cryptica', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608305741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466854, text='I remember when I started coding 15 years ago, I was one of a tiny handful of people in my town who learned how to code. I got into coding because I enjoyed it. My dad advised me against it and said that I should be a lawyer instead. There weren&#x27;t many jobs back then for programmers; especially in the town where I lived.<p>The only opportunities were web development for local businesses so it looked like a bad financial move at the time but I enjoyed it that much and not many people were interested in it back then.<p>But it feels like something went seriously wrong along the way. The industry seemed to have turned into some kind of giant ponzi scheme which attracted all kinds of crooks... People who don&#x27;t give a shit about coding; it seems that these people managed to get themselves promoted into all the decision-making positions.<p>The industry is so rotten. Luckily, I managed to get into blockchain space which also has a lot of rotten parts but somehow I managed to secure an income from working on my own stuff so I don&#x27;t have a boss anymore. Now I&#x27;m building a sane&#x2F;intellectual community from the ground up and being extra careful about what kinds of people we allow in.')
