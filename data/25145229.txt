I grew up in the era of Dreamweaver and Visual Basic where you could just draw your user interface and then write code to glue it together. It wasn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s a form of Rapid Application Development that we just don&#x27;t have anymore. If it wasn&#x27;t for VB.NET and its ability to turn my drawings into code scaffolding, I wouldn&#x27;t be here right now. No-code and low-code are great for many use cases, and full hand-written code is endlessly powerful, but for the middle ground, these can be powerful tools.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried Anima yet but I appreciate its very existence.<p>(I especially like that this UI-to-code tool isn&#x27;t owned by Adobe or Microsoft... not everything was great about those old tools)')
