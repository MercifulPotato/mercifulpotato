But plenty of people are arguing that vision-only (or vision + RADAR) systems cannot possibly work, and that you <i>must have</i> LIDAR in addition to vision to do self-driving.  If you <i>must have</i> LIDAR, then you can&#x27;t make an all-weather system that has the same performance in good weather and bad.<p>It also seems odd that you would accept degraded performance during driving conditions which are especially challenging... It&#x27;s like saying that you&#x27;d turn off your airbag in the rain because you still have seat belts.  If anything, I would think most people would want better performance during bad driving conditions.')
