After all, no one wants to work on something that their boss doesn’t care about.<p>&gt; Yes, your CI&#x2F;CD system is absolutely critical, but it’s easy for executives to not think about. This leads to a failure mode where you have a lost garden of internal tools.<p>I love maintaining stuff. I don&#x27;t care that my boss doesn&#x27;t care about something. I care about... what I care about :)<p>I don&#x27;t mind the &quot;boring&quot; tasks like keeping library versions up to date, being on the latest runtime version, and using a recent version of the framework we&#x27;ve adopted (we&#x27;re currently running on an ancient version of it). I like doing that stuff. I like keeping things tidy. If things are up to date, I can move on to making our CI better, or improving our test coverage, or really <i>anything</i> that improves the whole team&#x27;s productivity. There&#x27;s always something to update or polish or improve.<p>My dilemma is that as much as I&#x27;m willing to do all that stuff, I&#x27;m essentially not allowed to. My lead and their boss say my skills are too valuable to be spent on that, so instead I must do things like lead the new team they&#x27;re forming to build a new service... which I&#x27;m not interested in at all. I&#x27;m not keen on the whole lead thing. Glad to be a follower. I&#x27;m also not thrilled about building new stuff. I like to say I&#x27;m more like a car mechanic rather than an engineer: I like tweaking and tuning and fixing existing stuff, not creating new stuff.<p>Does anyone else feel like this? I&#x27;ve tried bringing it up in chats with coworkers and everyone looks at me like I have two heads.')
