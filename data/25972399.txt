It will also increase worker mobility, because a worker already working 2 jobs should be much more willing to take risks and try out new jobs. This will create competition between employers, because many employees will be working two jobs. If you treat your employees bad, the will request fewer hours and spend more time at their other job, or just leave.<p>Or, the extra time off could be used for entrepreneurial pursuits. Or just to relax, etc.<p>This is an alternate plan that has many of the same benefits as a higher minimum wage and universal basic income. I haven&#x27;t hear it discussed by anyone else though.')
