For example, if you have two interacting places where the compiler has guessed what to do, maybe the compiler resolves the interaction in the wrong way. It&#x27;s the same problem that arises if you don&#x27;t commit after merging into a Git repository (which, by the way, is possible but takes explicit opt-in): it keeps on working fine up until two previous merges conflict with each other.<p>I much prefer Rust&#x27;s approach, which is to fail out but also make it extremely easy to apply the fix the compiler has guessed.')
