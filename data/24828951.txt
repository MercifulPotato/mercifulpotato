Or artificially limited even if you land something.<p>I&#x27;m old enough to know that nothing is impossible, but how hard do you want the road to be?<p>I went back for an undergrad in CS in my mid-20&#x27;s, pulled my MS in CS in my early 30&#x27;s, and even after a decade of dev work, it took a lucky break in my personal network to get me into the academic research world in the medical space.<p>Just eat the time and knock out some type of undergrad - when asked, I usually tell folks to major in X with a minor in CS.  The minor in CS is enough signalling for most programming jobs and the major in X with that minor gives you a head start on the competition in X.  I think this is generally true for X=math, biology, chemistry, business, etc.')
