I&#x27;ll sum it up this way: I frequently oscillate between thinking &quot;This is amazing, it truly is a joy to work with SwiftUI&quot; and &quot;Holy FUCK this is the most infuriating thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my life&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on the documentation, because there isn&#x27;t any. The closest thing you get is the WWDC videos from the past few years where most things are outdated anyway. There&#x27;s also lots of third party tutorials and what not that open with &quot;Apple doesn&#x27;t say anything about how this works, but I think I might have figured it out&quot;. And a lot of those third party sources are pretty good, but still. It&#x27;s hardly ideal.<p>There are also a lot of inscrutable little edge cases where something just doesn&#x27;t work, and there&#x27;s hardly any path to figuring out why. Scrolling performance will tank, for example, after some trivial change. The framework &quot;works like magic&quot;, until it doesn&#x27;t. And you&#x27;re stuck tweaking random things hoping something makes a difference.<p>BUT, at the same time, it&#x27;s awesome. Code reuse is like, a real thing this time, not just something that works on paper but not in practice. You can compose things very quickly and succinctly, and you no longer have the unreadable, un-mergeable, unsearchable, existential nightmare that was storyboards. When it works, it really is fantastic. Don&#x27;t count on the &quot;live preview&quot; though. That thing never works for anything other than the most trivial of examples.<p>If I could go back to 8 months ago, I probably would have chosen differently. But it is clear that SwiftUI is the future, and within a year or two it will be unequivocally better than UIKit. So if you&#x27;re starting now... maybe. Just be prepared for some pain.')
