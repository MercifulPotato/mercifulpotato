I overclock the RAM , and ECC is nice there since it gives more confidence that the overclock is stable. But more importantly, ECC was really useful once one of the sticks started failing. Not only did the ECC errors immediately point the blame at the RAM (no need to triage random crashes or corruption), it made it clear that all errors were coming from only one of the sticks. Figuring out <i>which</i> stick it was involved some guesswork of the physical -&gt; logical -&gt; Linux utilities&#x27; layout mapping, but just replacing that one stick fixed things and the system has been stable since. Definitely glad that I went with ECC for this system.')
