You can bring back to life old hardware and put it to do useful things (this is also true with other BSDs and low footprint Linux distros, but so far my experience with FreeBSD has been superb). At the moment the only machine I&#x27;m running it is a ThinkPad X230 and everything works perfectly and the documentation is top notch. The FreeBSD Handbook is an excellent place to start for newcomers. vermaden&#x27;s guide on setting up automount (who also wrote automount) on FreeBSD has been really really useful, thanks a lot for that! One gotcha that I&#x27;ve learnt about FreeBSD is that you have to run RELEASE in order to be able to upgrade the system!')
