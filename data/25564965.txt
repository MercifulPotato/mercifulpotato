Ray tracing can be much slower, or same time, or much faster for equivalent quality, depending on what you&#x27;re rendering. An example of where ray tracing is much faster than rasterizing is when you have extreme amounts of geometry via instancing. With ray tracing, you can render a quadrillion virtual triangles at interactive &#x2F; real-time rates, where rasterizing can&#x27;t do that. This is because ray tracing renders a pixel at a time, where rasterizing renders a triangle at a time. Here&#x27;s an example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2blG7YXq_O8&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2blG7YXq_O8&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>')
