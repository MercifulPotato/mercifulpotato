Not calling it a beta doesn’t not make it a beta. It’s directly taking the role that RHEL beta releases used to have (ie. be a point release ahead, and be for the public to test and report issues before going to stable RHEL).<p>Regardless of what your blog post says, RHEL was not a beta for old CentOS. Old CentOS was a rebuild&#x2F;copy of RHEL, bugs and all included. RHEL will not be a copy&#x2F;rebuild CentOS Stream, so it’s not a reversal of roles.<p>Using outdated packages doesn’t make a distribution stable. It’s stable when its combination of packages and configuration has already been tried by a bunch of people, and confirmed to work, or has had its issues thoroughly documented with effective workarounds.')
