The idea was that capabilities become available to us for exploration, via mass consumer and gaming products. A rather narrow and higher-latency channel.  Rather than say a dynamic market of small companies and a diy community.  Leaving plenty of low-hanging fruit not yet grabbed.<p>A less concentrated industry might have been more interested, creative, and effective, at gathering such fruit, and exploring for accessible markets.  Perhaps yielding a less slow takeoff.  A counter argument is that Intel&#x27;s RealSense does exist to build on, and Leap Motion&#x27;s hand tracker and Project NorthStar.  A counter^2 argument is these are outliers, with LM&#x27;s work only remaining available, because they dropped IIRC three separate acquisition attempts by Apple.  Most work hasn&#x27;t remained available to use and build on.<p>But perhaps a healthy commercial-diy blended market was never an option. Given a patent regime optimized for pharma-shaped industry.  There seemed a long-term pre-concentration pattern of patent dodging via non-commercial software, and hardware &quot;kits&quot;.  Leaving many capabilities already unavailable, because a bit of commercially-motivated effort was needed, but discouraged by a too-small community market and&#x2F;or associated patents.<p>The current concentration of effort may well get us more quickly to eventual phone-scale broad consumer adoption of XR.  It has motivated the supply and R&amp;D tech chain in a way a small market never could.  But perhaps it has also contributed to a less-diverse flatter takeoff.  And perhaps, if XR encounters difficulties with mass consumer adoption, it maybe have added a fragility risk of larger delays.')
