I got tired of hard coding tooltips and modals in my web app and updating them each time I launched a new feature.<p>So instead, I&#x27;ve been building a WYSIWYG editor powered by a chrome extension that lets you create modals, tooltips, hotspots, and full product tours without writing another line of code. Our element selection algorithm eliminates the need for tagging elements with unique IDs or specifying CSS selectors when positioning tooltips and hotspots. It also detects platform changes and updates tours accordingly. I hope it saves you some time over building complicated in-house tours.')
