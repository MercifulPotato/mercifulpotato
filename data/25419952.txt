They do still kill games, no denying that, and their track record with MMO&#x27;s is terrible, but comparing the number of old EA games you can still play on GameRanger with the back catalog of a publisher like Ubisoft, EA has WAAAAY more old games still playable online with GameRanger.<p>Again, it&#x27;s not a complete solution, butit seriously supports the vast majority of popular old EA games.
