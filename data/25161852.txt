If you want me to do something for you, (and you are not a close friend or relative) you will pay me appropriately for it. Want me to fix a bug for you? Pay me. Want me to merge your drive by pull request? Pay me. Want &quot;to arrange a zoom call between me and your team to discuss how we can better use your project to add value to our business&quot;. Pay me. This idea that we should all be giving away our labour in the name of the great God&#x27;s FLOSS and freedom is bollocks and one of the great con jobs of late stage capitalism.')
