Also we were helping small businesses that was harmed by Facebook actions. Sometimes it was possible to fix it, sometimes not.<p>In this particular case I strongly believe the platform developed was competing with Facebook and it may be the cause Facebook shut it down.<p>It is my personal opinion however and may be not true.<p>But all of my experience and knowledge tells me so.<p>There might be that public pressure will force Facebook to reenable the business and I hope it will happen.<p>However there are a lot of businesses that was shut down and died because there they wasn&#x27;t able to put a pressure on Facebook.<p>It is the main reason why Facebook in particular should be prevented from making more harm, and we should all do everything what is possible to not be dependant on 3rd party companies.')
