Maybe do some research on your own and sleep over this.<p>China is actually the only country I would compare US&#x27;s democracy with, because a lot of candidates have no choice but to join one out of two partied to even get considered to be elected. And it&#x27;s not the 1st vote that decides this, because democracy in the US doesn&#x27;t differ between party votes and candidate votes (whereas most other democracies have moved on, for like hundreds of years, and fixed this).<p>Thr problem I see here is that the US didn&#x27;t have a revolution. Europe had to be crushed a couple of times in order to learn how to prevent their architectural mistakes in future.')
