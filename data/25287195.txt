The joke from these times was &quot;ask an engineer what is 2 times 3 and he&#x27;ll take out his slide rule and say between 5.9 and 6.1&quot; Whoever thought that up maybe wanted to show how the engineers just use tools and don&#x27;t think, but I&#x27;ve seen the opposite: it was some with just a theoretical mathematical training who blindly believed in every digit of the result they saw or produced, even when it was really meaningless or where it was obvious to me that the process resulted in an error.')
