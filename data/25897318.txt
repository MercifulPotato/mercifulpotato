These 2 should net you GPU acceleration in the remote session.<p>For GPU accelerated encoding you can also set &quot;Configure H.264&#x2F;AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop Connections&quot; to &quot;Enabled&quot;.<p>Those 3 policies are all I usually tick but the rest of the policies in that tree are nerd knob tunables with many relating to bandwidth&#x2F;resource utilization&#x2F;image quality tradeoffs if that so interests you.')
