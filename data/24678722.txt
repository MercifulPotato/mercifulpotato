It&#x27;s written by herself. Maybe she shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to express herself and hide it. We can all then live a happy fantasy where everyone is a good person in any depiction.<p>My first thought when reading the manga, how can we stop this?<p>Suffice to say, I didn&#x27;t enjoy it one bit but I never thought this should be censored.<p>There are many similar manga that depicts all sorts of stuff. Some of them written by the people which were unfortunate.<p>It&#x27;s also evident you don&#x27;t care about the medium because you used the word <i>comic</i>.<p>Censorship of evil acts was rampant in the history. People didn&#x27;t want to admit what others were doing. There are broader issues if people are pushed to the extreme by media. Why would someone join a terrorist group after watching one of their videos? There must be something else causing the problem. The videos are a symptom, not a cause.<p>Last, I have consumed media of both your examples. It didn&#x27;t turn me into a child abuser or a terrorist. I want to help make world a safer place for children and terrorism free more than before. I want to stop it so it stops get depicted on its own.')
