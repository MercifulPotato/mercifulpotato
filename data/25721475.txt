I know from experience that it&#x27;s easy to get database failover wrong. I could probably cobble something together, but it would be mediocre and wouldn&#x27;t handle network partitions reliably. On the other hand, RDS is used at a scale well beyond what I could afford to build out and has benefitted from much more usage. Problems that are low probability for me are regular events for RDS and have that experience built in.<p>Ultimately, you are paying a cloud vendor for service value and operational experience. Some services aren&#x27;t as good as others in both regards, but for the ones that are good, the overhead of doing it yourself is an exponent, not a fraction.')
