Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=[25650220], score=None, time=1609871653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648531, text='&gt; you&#x27;re basically saying that users who are capable enough to even need&#x2F;use decentralised version control systems are too dumb and incompetent<p>Do not put words in my mouth. I did not say that, you just did. I said that usability is a real concern, because no matter what you expect people to do, it will never work perfectly 100% of the time.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not talking about security in general.<p>You can say that now, but that&#x27;s not what you said previously. \n &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;trade-off&quot; when it comes to cyber security&quot;<p>&gt; you instead share your entire private life with these companies?<p>Again, I did not say that. Github is a social coding network. I am not saying that I have all of the answers as to how this should work, but I am saying that if 1 member of a 100 person organization loses access to their account, and the other 99 members all confirm that their account access was lost via some event and assert their identity, you could have the start of a reasonable recovery path.<p>&gt; the CEO running the show is in an entirely different category<p>Not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying that a CEO is just automatically more responsible and not going to lose something? Or are you saying that he&#x27;s clearly just more important so it&#x27;s okay to bypass the stated procedure for just him&#x2F;her?<p>&gt; Do you leave your house key under the doormat? Do you keep a post-it note with all your passwords taped to the back of your phone - you know, just in case you forget one and for convenience?<p>This is not even a valid comparison, and you&#x27;re just trying to be condescending. I don&#x27;t leave a house key under my mat just in case I lose it. But I also don&#x27;t expect to never be allowed to enter my house again just because my key is lost.<p>&gt; if you can&#x27;t afford a data storage solution I seriously wonder why you have a need for a distributed version control system in a (semi-)professional environment.<p>Because many people use Github for non semi-professional environments? It is full of amateurs. Just because you don&#x27;t find someone&#x27;s work valuable, doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t. Saying &quot;Well it&#x27;s not professional, so if you lost it then it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; is not correct.<p>&gt; 20 bucks for a protective case for your phone - no problem. 50 bucks for a half decent 1TB portable USB HDD to backup<p>You&#x27;re comparing a 1 time action to a recurring action. I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t have back ups. You obviously should. But people are human beings. Even if 99% of people have perfect back ups, that&#x27;s still 560k (according to Github home page numbers) that will have failed backups or some other issue.<p>PS. you keep widely including the term &quot;decentralized&quot;, as if just because <i>git</i> is decentralized, that nothing on Github should matter. For better or for worse, Github has become the central git repository provider for millions of people. Claiming that Github services should be magically decentralized just because git is decentralized is an invalid claim. Because <i>Github</i> is not decentralized.')
