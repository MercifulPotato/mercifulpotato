Item(by='vl', descendants=None, kids=[24714214, 24724875], score=None, time=1602104377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712444, text='&gt;Tesla is no BMW or Porsche<p>O, please. I own both BMW and Tesla, and while BMW is more refined car, service and quality miles better with Tesla. BMW gets obscure error codes, and then dealership lazily tries to fix it for weeks (this year BMW spent 7 weeks at the shop, last year 3 weeks). Tesla needs service, technician comes and fixes it on your driveway!')
