Designers are delivering exactly what they want. And customers are ruined by conditioning from marketing that &quot;touchscreens are better! who wants those stupid buttons and dials&quot;, bean counters are getting their bonuses because they just replaced expensive buttons&#x2F;dials (with automotive reliability ratings) with a $13 touchscreen a bunch of software to control stuff. So, we&#x27;re never going to get out of this.<p>The market for utilitarian design is vanishingly small. The public is depressingly gullible and moronic.')
