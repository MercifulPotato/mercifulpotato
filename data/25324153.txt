Suite for education.<p>Long story:<p>Shortly before the first lockdown was announced in Germany, I helped one school to setup the Google G. Suite for education and run a pilot. Cheap solution, everything works, easy to share exercises and the solutions. Mobile first solution, features-wise was everything that every teacher dreamed of.<p>Then as expected, because of &quot;privacy issues&quot; (none of them really existed, we talk about them later) the School had to move to a closed source, half-backed state solution (that nobody knows how much costs to develop and run). From the user point of view (Teachers and Kids) and web development best practices in 2020. Most schools are not using it and instead are trying to do everything offline. We keep running G. Suite for extracurricular activities, which are optional, but mostly used by kids that want to go to the High School. As usual I&#x27;m sure that the state-based, closed source, tax-payer supported solution, isn&#x27;t the best one.<p>References:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berliner-zeitung.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;the-absurdity-of-germanys-privacy-obsession-li.122671" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berliner-zeitung.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;the-absurdity-of-germanys...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.de&#x2F;20200908&#x2F;german-schools-lag-behind-other-countries-when-it-comes-to-digital-learning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.de&#x2F;20200908&#x2F;german-schools-lag-behind-o...</a>')
