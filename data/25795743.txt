You&#x27;d just have to determine which calendars are considered &quot;busy&quot;.<p>As for upkeep, I found that the app is self-motivating. It&#x27;s not measuring anything so if you miss an hour or a month it doesn&#x27;t matter, there&#x27;s no overwhelming guilt. The only thing you miss is being able to review what you worked on.')
