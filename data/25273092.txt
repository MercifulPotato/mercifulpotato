The full table scan in this case would also usually take the lock on the whole Order table instead of only narrow block&#x2F;range-level lock in the index like it would in the case of indexed FK. Such table lock may force some other threads&#x2F;sessions to wait, and provides increased surface for deadlocks between seemingly unrelated transactions.')
