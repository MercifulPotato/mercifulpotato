If we let single people or families completely control the direction of legislation and justice systems, at some point it will go terribly wrong. Sure right now, Zuckerberg or Musk or Cuban, might be cool dudes with the right intentions and making great things, but what happens when they&#x27;re gone? Who&#x27;s going to take control of all that wealth and power?<p>Democratic states aren&#x27;t perfect, but at least there are fail safes against the wrong people having power at the wrong time. The people supposedly all collectively own the wealth and direction of a state, so a single person can never be that powerful. Authoritarianism or dictatorships will always feel appealing in the face of dysfunctional governments, because there is always someone who is actually good at they do, and effects real change (if you disregard all the usual xenophobia&#x2F;populism&#x2F;oppression). In this case, you can see people saying &quot;government is not doing anything about this, so why shouldn&#x27;t these people fix it&quot;. Power eventually corrupts, if not the person then its descendants, at some point it goes terribly wrong and itends up tearing a society apart. This has happened pretty much everywhere.<p>Also the level of wealth some people are accumulating right now is absolutely unheard of in history. You can now &quot;easily&quot; have a business that reaches billions of people from your basement. If this exponential accumulation of wealth continues, government as we know it will become obsolete, and democracy will stop functioning because some people just have too much lobbying power.')
