At one point the speaker said that millennials are &quot;dependent on technology&quot;. I know what he meant was networked technology like smartphones, but it made me irrationally upset. He&#x27;s dependent on the car he drove to get here. We&#x27;re all dependent on the refrigerator and electric lights in our homes. That&#x27;s what technology does, it makes us dependent on it. It&#x27;s like arguing it&#x27;s bad we&#x27;re dependent on the wheel.')
