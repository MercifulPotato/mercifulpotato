The result of the growing influence of those trained in the field is that much of our economy is now similarly fraudulent.<p>I think a lot of people, including major stakeholders, know this to be true, or at least feel it to be true, but are willing to continue acting as if it isn&#x27;t, because the very act of re-evaluating the fundamentals of the field will cause both existential and market crises which will be too painful to endure.')
