If they refuse to do this, the legal problem is that they&#x27;re not allowed to use the code anymore -- in other words, they&#x27;re violating the contributors&#x27; copyright. And to sue for copyright infringement, the plaintiff needs to be someone who holds the copyright.<p>That&#x27;s my non-lawyer understanding of why Drew needs a contributor to start a lawsuit.')
