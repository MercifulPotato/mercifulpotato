Neither have assets that support their price or that there is something inherent in the company to support that value. They don&#x27;t. They have projections(Tesla) or excitement(GS).<p>Throwing up a bunch of survivor-biased stocks to prove that sometimes people make winning bets (or rather, that some best win) doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Amazon, Apple, MS all eventually moved past speculative and most people in the market would assume that they&#x27;re pretty stable blue chips (in fact, that&#x27;s why we have terms like &quot;blue chip&quot; in the first place) with assists that support the price.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about how to make big money on stocks, I&#x27;m talking about the idea of inherent vs projected value. You said you think Tesla is risky, and that&#x27;s my point. It seems much more likely that someone (car companies, energy cos, the government) would come in and kick the legs out from under Tesla than any FAANG company at this point (except maybe FB but I might just be projecting there)')
