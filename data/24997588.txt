That 5 minutes could translate into many years of learnings which may be applied immediately to their system if they share a similar context.<p>Being rich is a mindset, and therefore anyone who identifies as it, is it. In most ways, I&#x27;m already rich.<p>Sharing my journey could be considered philanthropy for the planet and all living things on it.<p>Yes, I spend time making videos but I think this is my most important work so far, if I don&#x27;t share then the experience dies with me.<p>I will have no regrets for trying.<p>I&#x27;m only one person after all, and we need global change so I need help and community. This post is a call-to-action, will you join me?')
