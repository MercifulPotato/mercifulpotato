I could go on, but the entire edifice is built on confidence, and once that confidence evaporates for a second time, it&#x27;s going to be very hard to recover.<p>There is a lot of risk investing in bitcoin, it is nothing like commodities, that&#x27;s just the latest identity have dreamed up for it after it completely failed to live up to the hype of the previous identities first as a currency outwith government control, then as a distributed trust-free database, then as a foundational layer for myriad apps, and finally as a &#x27;commodity&#x27; which nobody actually uses (unlike other speculative commodities like oil or corn which usually have a use value which the current value fluctuates around).<p>You do in fact have lots of protection when you buy other commodities, in the form of rules against cornering the market, rules against fraud, insurance, regulators etc. Look up the silver corner or similar episodes for what happens when markets in commodities are completely unregulated, as we see in the Bitcoin market at the moment.')
