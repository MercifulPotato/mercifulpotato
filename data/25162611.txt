I am not a numbers guy so I needed visual forecasts to help me plan a financially stable future for my business.<p>My goal with the tool is to help other decision-makers who share similar struggles with cash flow, manage their money in an easy, fast, and powerful way, without needing any accounting &#x2F; financial skills. \nI&#x27;m looking for beta testers who&#x27;d like to try it out. \nThanks a lot')
