SpaceX would not have been able to build Falcon 9 without it, or likely survive. Then NASA gave SpaceX and Boeing contracts to fly crew members to the ISS, and SpaceX delivered well ahead of Boeing, and for billions less. Finally NASA has given SpaceX small contracts to gain access to new SpaceX technologies such as in-orbit refueling, which would save NASA tens of billions if it was ever allowed to use it.<p>And we provide tax credits to zero emission vehicles to make up for allowing ICE engines to  omit CO2 indiscriminately. A better solution would be a limited market in carbon emissions, but most of the coal state politicians would lose their jobs if that passed.')
