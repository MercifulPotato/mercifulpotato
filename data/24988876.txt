Politicians are unconstrained by facts. Science is conducted by press release. Higher education rewards bull over analytic thought. Startup culture elevates bull to high art. Advertisers wink conspiratorially and invite us to join them in seeing through all the bull â€” and take advantage of our lowered guard to bombard us with bull of the second order. The majority of administrative activity, whether in private business or the public sphere, seems to be little more than a sophisticated exercise in the combinatorial reassembly of bull.<p>We&#x27;re sick of it. It&#x27;s time to do something, and as educators, one constructive thing we know how to do is to teach people. So, the aim of this course is to help students navigate the bull-rich modern environment by identifying bull, seeing through it, and combating it with effective analysis and argument.&quot;')
