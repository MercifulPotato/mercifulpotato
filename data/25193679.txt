It&#x27;s a little bit dubious given that it&#x27;s the same agency asking for and receiving the benefit, but money is fungible. Suppose the Sheriff had insisted on iPads for some other department, like the schools.<p>Governments do stuff like this all the time. In fact constituents get mad when they <i>don&#x27;t</i>. The Planning Commission is considered derelict in its duty if it just gives away a building permit without getting something good from the developer in return (park, street cleaning program, extra BMR units, promise to use union labor).<p>SFMTA considers corporate philanthropy, coverage of unprofitable neighborhoods, and low-income discount programs when deciding who gets the permit to run scooters in San Francisco.<p>If it is bribery when a government agency asks a permit applicant to spend a bit on the agency&#x27;s mission, then there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more to prosecute all over the Bay Area.')
