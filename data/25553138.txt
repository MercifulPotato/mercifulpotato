But birds are definitely both, and exist in a web of predator-prey relationships.<p>Therefore it is contingent upon the presenter to provide at least some evidence that this is a &quot;runaway&quot; situation - a &quot;die-off&quot; rather than the usual alternatives, which happen all the time as Exmoor states in his initial post on this thread.<p>Instead we&#x27;re shown a bunch of dead birds. That is followed by a chorus of webshits here providing  subsequent &quot;the sky is falling&quot; lamentations, moaning and gnashing of teeth.')
