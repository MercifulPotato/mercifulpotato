Maybe they can issue debt, but that comes with a lot of drawbacks wrt. equity investment. (2) most workers have their job as their main source of income, so they don&#x27;t actually <i>want</i> to incur the excess risk that&#x27;s inherent in &quot;sharing in the profit (and losses!) of their firm&quot; because that literally means putting all your eggs in one basket. Outside investors can incur that risk more easily, whether by diversifying it away or by investing only part of their assets in a risky endeavor.<p>&quot;All enterprises as co-ops&quot; is a nice idea but doesn&#x27;t actually work in the real world. Co-ops and partnerships are totally fine for very low capital intensity businesses like law firms, but quite unsuitable elsewhere.')
