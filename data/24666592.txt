That does not mean I am not interested in discussion - I am, genuine discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t know what a sea-lion account is.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not, but based on the perceived implication I don&#x27;t think it is.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why it is acceptable to defame a company or its Founders.  Inflammatory comments without citation are worth questioning.  I am very interested in the assertion Palantir is a threat to liberty if it is true.  And equally so if it is not.<p>As far as I can tell it is not.<p>Furthermore, if the discussion takes down a rabbit-hole that ultimately points to where the responsibility and accountability then all the better for concerned citizens.<p>It might be elected officials are where we should channel our energy, if it&#x27;s intelligence and military, perhaps oversight should be the target.  I don&#x27;t claim to have any or all of the answers.  It just seems odd to create a boogie-person in Palantir.<p>It&#x27;s been said elsewhere in a similar fashion, but is database technology a threat to liberty?  What about database administrators?<p>A &quot;threat to liberty&quot; is a pretty serious accusation.')
