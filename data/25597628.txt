He&#x27;s never received any help from anyone, no social security, no government insurance, no pension, nothing - but still managed to save for build a little house that we still are finishing 30+ years later, and despite all the difficulties we had, give my sister and me a somewhat decent education and life.<p>If that seems though, just imagine all the people who had to fled their lands and left the only thing they knew to do in life because of the internal conflict and people killing them to steal their lands, there where the local media won&#x27;t put their gaze and the goverment ignores to keep their rampant corruption and inequity.<p>It&#x27;s great there&#x27;s people thinking about them and working to make their products reachable for others.')
