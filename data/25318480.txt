That allows one to see more connections across different thinkers.<p>One instance of this is John Vervaeke&#x27;s Awaking from the meaning crisis (which isn&#x27;t only philosophy, but also cognitive science).<p>Other courses like that are those from John Searle (philosophy of language, philosophy of mind).<p>Hubert Dreyfus has a course on existentialism in literature and film.<p>Thinking of it, there is also a channel called Like Stories Of Old. The maker publishes video-essays, which are often philosophical in tone and reference existential thinkers like Kierkegaard.<p>My own journey into philosophy started with Wittgenstein (apart from an introduction in Greek Philosophy in high school).')
