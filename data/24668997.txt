Yes, there have been efforts to scan a lot of old books, but often that has just been making fairly low-resolution scans with little or no clean-up process, and assembling those scans into huge and ungainly PDFs. That is OK for old prose works where a reader may only need to consult a single page. But appropriately digitizing something like a book of elaborately typeset poetry, or an art book (i.e. a large-format book with reproductions of paintings) requires a great deal of human effort, and that is expensive. It is no surprise that the print format still reigns in those genres.')
