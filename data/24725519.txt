You can&#x27;t move Chapter 4 to before Chapter 2 or the implementation has to change. By contrast, the order of functions within a class, or classes within a package, isn&#x27;t really part of the API -- they&#x27;re most often in alphabetical order, which is totally mechanistic, and changing the order doesn&#x27;t change the API.<p>A ToC is also not a rigid formal specification (like a recipe), but that&#x27;s the core of what an API is.')
