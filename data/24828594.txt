At some point, you just have to work through some problems and the math just makes sense. So I&#x27;ll explain the terms above, but best bet is to just take a few courses on the topics I mentioned above.<p>Quick definitions:\n- Exponential: is the constant e to the power of some number. e, like pi, is a ubitiqous constant in mathematics and nature. You run into pi when doing geometry, and e when doing calculus.<p>- A function in mathematics is similar to a function in programming, but not exactly. A course in Discrete Mathematics helps here.<p>- F-apostrophe is notation used in calculus to show the relation of one type of function, called a derivative to another. f and f&#x27; are related. How, though, is better explained by taking calculus.<p>- An eigenfunction exists in a system of equations. Think of it like a &#x27;balance&#x27; point. Linear Algebra will help make sense of this term.<p>Resources\n- Essence of Calculus: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM</a>\n- Essence of Linear Algebra: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQ...</a><p>Those 2 video&#x27;s will do a good job of giving you the &#x27;intuition&#x27; behind Calculus and Linear Algebra. Like programming, though, you just have to actually work some problems out by hand for the stuff to sink in. For that, do something like MIT opencourseware or a local online college course.')
