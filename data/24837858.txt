Also the author asks for $2 Million and doesn&#x27;t seem to be a Python Core Developer. Given the repos age I&#x27;m probably answering to Mark Shannon himself.<p>Edit: This post wasn&#x27;t supposed to be an hostile attack against anybody. Just found it odd to ask why an 2 hour old repo wasn&#x27;t more known. I did not know that Mark Shannon is a core dev. Certainly did not pick that up from the repos contents.')
