In all cases I need some browser running.<p>What I really love is having <i>separate histories and sessions</i> both in the shell and in my browser.<p>For now what I ended up doing is:<p>* use the same mac user<p>* [works ok] use iTerm profiles, and set different environment variables &#x2F; launch commands for each iTerm profile notably to change shell history files<p>* [works ok but needs trickery] use tmux + plugins + iTerm for saving shell sessions<p>* [works bad] separate Firefox profiles.<p>I wonder what other people are doing on that?<p>From where I stand, I feel like using separate Mac users for each project is the best bet, as per simplicity. I feel it&#x27;ll have the added interest of better psychological separation of projects (different desktop, etc.). But will need a heavier setup (notably: synching dotfiles).')
