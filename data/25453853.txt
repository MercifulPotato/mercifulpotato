Currently working through my second databases course, I still can&#x27;t help translating all of the relational algebra nonsense into proto-SQL in order to make sense of it. I was already working on large-ish business applications and databases for a few years before the first course and I didn&#x27;t even know RA existed. Now it just gets in the way.<p>Not to mention relational expressions or whatever that thing is called where you use the &quot;exists&quot; and &quot;for every&quot; operators, which I still haven&#x27;t been able to apply in practice.')
