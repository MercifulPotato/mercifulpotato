Life has been kind to me since I was ill, partially because IT is a good field to be in, and mostly because my family was upper-middle class and able to help financially. I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;d be if I didn&#x27;t have the help from my parents, or had a job that was more physical. I guess I would have had to declare bankruptcy, with all the costs that entails.')
