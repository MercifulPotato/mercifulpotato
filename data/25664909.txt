Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=[25665111], score=None, time=1609978674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25663985, text='&gt; Your link about mail in ballots says they are secure because of measures like signature validation, except we got rid of that.<p>I was not accurate, but you were also not accurate. Pennsylvania did not &quot;get rid&quot; of signature verification for absentee voting; it never had signature validation in the first place. States have the power to hold elections in the manner of their choosing, and of the last 28 years, Republicans had trifecta control of the legislature for twelve [1]. They had the full power to amend the election code as they saw fit, but they chose not to.<p>In any case, the absence of signature validation still does not prove fraud. The purpose of signature validation is to &quot;prove&quot; is the person who cast the ballot is the person who registered to vote. To take advantage of a lack of signature validation, an attacker would have to:<p>1. Find people who are registered to vote, but who don&#x27;t intend to vote -- even in person.<p>2. Acquire their ballot by either:<p>2-a. Re-register them under a new address controlled by the \nadversary (which notifies the voter).<p>2-b. Steal their ballot from their mailbox (and the voter may become suspicious if they don&#x27;t get a ballot).<p>3. Fill out their ballot and mail it in.<p>Steps 1 and 2 each <i>very difficult to do</i> without raising suspicion. Step 3 is nearly impossible to do by a single person for a large number of votes. The vote difference in Pennsylvania was 81660 votes. So if Biden had 81661 fraudulent votes, then Trump should be the winner.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that if more than a hundred people notice that their ballots were missing&#x2F;voter registration changed, then there would be an investigation and the attacker would be exposed. In other words, the attacker must flip ~80,000 votes, while only alerting suspicion 100 times. Their success rate per ballot must be therefore greater than (1 - 81661 &#x2F; 100) = 99.878%. A thousand? That would still require a success rate of 98.775% per ballot.<p>How many reports are there of missing ballots in Pennsylvania? I can&#x27;t even find one person claiming such a thing, much less a hundred or a thousand.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Party_control_of_Pennsylvania_state_government" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Party_control_of_Pennsylvania_state_...</a>')
