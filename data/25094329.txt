Particularly if there&#x27;s any kind of treasury, an opportunist will become tempted to take that role, but any kind of credit will attract people who want to take the credit without doing the work, power structures will attract people who want the power, and programmers who &quot;just want to code&quot; and avoid politics will find themselves at the bottom of a dysfunctional infected organisation structure with no power, no credit, and being instructed by distorted requests.<p>IIRC he tried to design the ZeroMQ organisation so that there wasn&#x27;t any way for one person to insert themselves in a key point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where on his blog I was reading that, but it&#x27;s related to his writings about psycopaths[1] as the opportunists, and might be part of his book Social Architecture[2]<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hintjens.com&#x2F;blog:_psychopaths" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hintjens.com&#x2F;blog:_psychopaths</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hintjens.com&#x2F;books" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hintjens.com&#x2F;books</a>')
