I&#x27;m rooting for you!<p>That said, Caddy&#x27;s killer feature for me was automatically configuring certs, that&#x27;s what made me switch from Apache back when we were moving everything to HTTPS. I still don&#x27;t fully understand how certs work, but fortunately I don&#x27;t really need to. Until Maddy does this, it won&#x27;t be a good comparison.<p>Also I would really appreciate some documentation for making this work with Caddy handling TLS certificates for me. I guess I&#x27;ll file a bug about that.')
