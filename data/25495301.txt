In the article the author mentioned that the pro and consumer camera division of Nikon was responsible for so little of their overall revenue (equipment for photolithography was the money-maker for Nikon) that board members were, at that time, advocating selling off Nikon&#x27;s camera business.  If that ever happens I hope Sony is the buyer... the idea of Nikon&#x27;s ergonomics and color science married to the autofocus system on Sony&#x27;s Alpha line would be incredible.  Granted, its more wishful thinking than anything else (based on the small bit of logic that Nikon uses Sony sensors in most&#x2F;all of their cameras) but it would be a powerful combination.')
