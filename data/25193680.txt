The stats for gun deaths in the US make this absolutely, unambiguously clear, far beyond the point where there&#x27;s any realistic case for debate about it.<p>Widespread fire extinguisher use dramatically lowers the odds of you dying in a fire.<p>Widespread gun use - not just the presence of guns as an option, but the assumption that guns can be used on the street - dramatically <i>increases</i> the odds of you dying because of someone else&#x27;s gun.<p>Proponents always seem to reduce this to an imaginary heroic encounter where Random Shooter is stopped by Heroic Armed Citizens.<p>That&#x27;s almost never how it works in practice on the street. It&#x27;s far more likely that Random Citizen is shot before they can even get their weapon out. And even if bystanders are armed they either won&#x27;t have time to do anything to prevent a shooting, or they won&#x27;t risk trying to shoot one of two people who are fairly close together at some range, or they&#x27;ll simply decide it&#x27;s not their problem and the most they&#x27;ll do is call the police after it&#x27;s over.<p>At this point someone usually says &quot;But this one time...&quot; And it&#x27;s true there are exceptions.<p>But they don&#x27;t change the statistics, which are completely clear - more gun use means more random gun deaths, partly because concealed guns really aren&#x27;t particularly useful against attackers who already have their weapons out.<p>You have a far better chance of survival if you learn some distraction and confusion techniques and&#x2F;or fast self-defence moves than by trying to shoot someone who is pointing a gun at you at close range.')
