I only paid about $800 US for this, with some corporate discounts that most people can easily find. Comparing it to my Macbook, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s only 1080p, but I really don&#x27;t mind it at all because it&#x27;s matte instead of glossy. And the keyboard is pure bliss compared to just about anything.<p>&gt; with extensible memory and replaceable NVMe SSD<p>Not only that, but there is a WWAN slot that you can add an additional NVMe drive to. You can find 512GB 2242 form factor drives on AliExpress for about $50. There are 1GB ones for about $100. That&#x27;s my current experiment. Hoping to dual boot Windows and Linux.<p>But this thing has an <i>ethernet</i> port. In 2021. And all the other ports you&#x27;ll ever need. Mine came with an Intel Wi-Fi 6 card installed in a slot which would appear can be upgraded or replaced as well. Just insane utility. I even like the soft feel of the case more than the cold aluminum of the Macbook.')
