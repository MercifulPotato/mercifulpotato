I would have expected them to follow &quot;great circle&quot; routes since they are the shortest. For example, the shortest path from Long Island to the Bristol Channel goes through Newfoundland and the southern tip of Ireland. There are several cables on the map with those end points but none of them are shown as taking that route. I guess this is poetic license that ignores the distortion of the map projection. Is there a map that shows the routes more accurately?')
