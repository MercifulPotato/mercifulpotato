Meanwhile there&#x27;s plenty of experience and R&amp;D that&#x27;s gone into optimizing gas engines.<p>Most trips are short and easily covered by battery. The gas engine then comes in on the highway. I really think that&#x27;s the best of both worlds. Especially given that BEV&#x27;s aren&#x27;t cheaper or lighter - because the missing gas engine&#x27;s weight and cost is more than compensated by the additional batteries needed.')
