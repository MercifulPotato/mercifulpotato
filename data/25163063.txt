This isn&#x27;t a post about locking you into AWS. Pulumi, Terraform, and friends are tools that work across cloud providers, and even your own infrastructure.<p>The real meat of this argument is that in the future DevOps won&#x27;t be managing infrastructure to hand off to application developers. It will be creating meta programs that are designed to be used by application developers to let them build their own infra securely and reliably. This is what the `awsx` package in pulumi is. A predefined set of best practices that can be used by the application developer to create.<p>As someone who&#x27;s worked as various stages of sysadmin throughout the past 10 years, I see this (pulumi-like) as the future. And I agree with the article in general.')
