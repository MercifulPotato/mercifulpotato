I don&#x27;t use it for anything much because no one else is on it. Some friends and I have a groupchat on Signal and we decided it would be good to have a backup method to chat if Signal breaks (or to just move to for the reasons that there are, such as not being centralized by design).<p>It took me at least twenty minutes to figure out how to add my friends to a room I created too long enough ago to have memorized the UI. And they added &quot;Communities&quot; which I created one of but cannot even tell what functionality it even provides.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a client issue or not but it seems like (maybe?) it&#x27;s trying to be a social network in addition to a chat app? Some kind of adding in Discord functionality or something?<p>I guess as long as I can not use social network features and still use it like I use Signal... to flexibly chat with whomever I know the ID of.')
