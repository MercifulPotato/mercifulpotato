Systems where waiting IO doesn&#x27;t map 1:1 to threads scale to more concurrent users better (Erlang, Node, Go all do this). With evented IO you can service hundreds of thousands of connections (if you have a good way to round-robin between them or some other way to schedule them well). Having the same number of threads will be difficult.')
