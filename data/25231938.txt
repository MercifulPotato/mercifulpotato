I&#x27;ll probably pay up to $3K for such a bike.  There&#x27;s advantages to having it be an e-bike over just buying a scooter or such, like storage, parking downtown, etc. so it&#x27;ll be pretty easy for me to justify a budget for a bike, as long as it&#x27;s nice.<p>I don&#x27;t really like the external gearing of this bike, and not sure it needs standard Di2 type of components for shifting and whatnot....<p>This bike looks about 10x better than almost every other e-bike I&#x27;ve seen, so far.  I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re about to see a lot of improvement in the next couple years of e-bike styling and tech...')
