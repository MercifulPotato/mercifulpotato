A few years back, I created a PDF which displayed its own MD5 hash by making every single letter a separate chain of sub-documents and using MD5 collisions to change which sub-document each pointed to without changing the hash. Pretty much every PDF reader managed to interpret this cleanly as ordinary, copy-and-pasteable text because it wasn&#x27;t any worse than they could expect to encounter in an ordinary PDF, and they all had robust heuristics for dealing with these kinds of shenanigans. (The exception I found was PDF.js, possibly due to the fact it was rendering the whole thing to HTML.) The only real issue was that every PDF reader had a slightly different idea of what characters I could safely use in the names of those nested documents.')
