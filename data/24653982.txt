Start taking off bolts and look at the flecks of paint stuck to the underside of the bolt.<p>Also, we still have the techniques and materials used to make old paints.  New batches can be whipped up (assuming they aren&#x27;t too toxic) for comparison.  Lead based paints obviously are more problematic, but modern technology is really good at replicating paint colors.')
