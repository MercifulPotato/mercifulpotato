Driver situation on Linux was quite dire, but it improved tremendously around 2013 (when Steam appeared on Linux).<p>Even though I was still advising AMD in the bulldozer era, Intel was winning performance-wise. On the GPU side, though, GPU drivers have been quite hassle-free since 2015, <i>provided your GPU wasn&#x27;t the latest and greatest.</i> They got better at supporting their latest GPUs recently.<p>Intel and Nvidia always had despicable market segmentation and anti-consumer practices, which is the main reason I always went ATI&#x2F;AMD.<p>Intel: No ECC on consumer CPUs, reduced number of PCI lanes, restricted frequency multiplier.<p>Nvidia: Signed GPU firmware, non-redistribuable. Driver limiting the use of GPUs in datacenters. Proprietary tech everywhere: G-sync, 3D vision, Physx. Artificially restricts the speed of nvidia libraries on non-nvidia hardware (Intel did that too, to a lesser extent). Cripples FP16 <i>and</i> FP64 on &quot;consumer&quot; hardware.<p>I recently got myself a HTC vive. It works fine, while not perfectly, on my R9 Fury under Linux. Go team red!')
