Undocumented limitations caused major problems with us with AWS SQS.  It is now in the documentation (maybe because I complained to our AWS rep), but SQS has pool of 20k messages that it will pull from when serving requests.  If you are using a FIFO queue and you have 20k messages with the same message group ID in that buffer, then you are unable to process any other message regardless of how large the queue is. It caused multiple severe degradations until we rearchitected how messages are grouped.  If only it had been in the documentation from day 1.<p>Gotta love it!')
