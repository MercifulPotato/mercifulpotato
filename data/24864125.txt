It is badly broken at all levels. It&#x27;s slow speed, incredibly expensive interactions, and hard-to-understand system of laws need a big time upgrade. We need relatively simple laws that ordinary folks can understand, and a much faster time-to-judgement. It is really the complexity and cost of the system that leads to so many of these unjust outcomes, because hardly any actors in the system actually want to present their case and hear a verdict out of a judges mouth, because to get there takes years and millions of dollars.')
