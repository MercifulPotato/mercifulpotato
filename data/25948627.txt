In a cash account, it would certainly be suspect.<p>Preventing opening buys hurts everyone who is long -- including a large number of Robinhood customers -- by barring trades that would provide liquidity to sellers and thus dampen the sellers&#x27; stock impact. So essentially, Robinhood chose a course of action that disproportionately imposes losses upon its own customers.<p>The concept of price impact is part of the reason that stock buybacks are able to &quot;return capital&quot; to investors. Demand from buyers pushes prices upward.<p>No idea if that is a central argument of the case.')
