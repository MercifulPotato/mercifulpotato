The added economic output could do more than fix the highest budget deficits on record; we could be looking at paying off the national debt, free healthcare, and money left over. You&#x27;re concerned about negative consequences? We can work something out.<p>Instead, we fret that this is &quot;bad for local workers&quot;, condemning the would-be immigrant <i>and</i> our own nation to linger in mediocrity.')
