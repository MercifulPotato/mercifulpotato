Utilities included in student rental, otherwise 30eur. clothing and fun things: everything else.<p>Current system provides a government backed loan at 0.00% interest of up to 800eur&#x2F;month, which you then need to pay back depending on income in 35 years. (Much like ISA, but with the government). You get 100eur&#x2F;month for health insurance (basic health insurance costs the same). and 100 euro&#x2F;month for renting. These last 2 are based on income and available for everyone under a certain income limit. (Almost all students are below this limit)<p>We had a system where you received 300&#x2F;month and could then get a loan on top of it. But that was replaced by the neoliberals.<p>Hope that enlightens it a bit.')
