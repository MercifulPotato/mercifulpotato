Also, it seems that I have periods when I dream a lot, essentially every single day and periods like now when I don&#x27;t. \nI suspect connection with screen time as the period I had dreams was when I was reading a physical book before sleep while for the last 2 months I&#x27;ve been reading from Kindle.')
