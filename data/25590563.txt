See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;georgemauer.net&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;dominos-v-robles.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;georgemauer.net&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;dominos-v-robles.html</a> for a good breakdown of the rulings.<p>In particular, Robles wanted the court to order Domino&#x27;s to make their site WCAG-2.0 compliant. WCAG is completely silent on JavaScript. It&#x27;s possible that some screen readers don&#x27;t support JavaScript, but if Domino&#x27;s site used ARIA tags and complied with WCAG the court would almost certainly consider that accessible (there&#x27;s no official DoJ guidelines on what constitutes accessibility, so the court and businesses have latitude here.)<p>The ADA is all about reasonable accomodations. Supporting major screen readers is reasonable; supporting all of them clearly isn&#x27;t. 98% of screen reader users have JS enabled (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webaim.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;screenreadersurvey4&#x2F;#javascript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webaim.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;screenreadersurvey4&#x2F;#javascript</a>), so it&#x27;s clearly reasonable to provide an accessible webapp.')
