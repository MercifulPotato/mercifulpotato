It is important to note that, at this point, it doesn&#x27;t matter what is true. Which is stupidly hard to determine right now -- institutional credibility is at an all-time low, across the board. What matters right now, in the churn, is what people <i>believe</i> to be true.<p>Human beings are not logical. We construct our beliefs, and search for evidence to support those beliefs, not the other way around.<p>Right now, the set of things-believed-to-be-true between Democrats and Republicans is mutually disjoint. Wholly different realities. I don&#x27;t see those converging in any peaceful way.<p>Look, I get it.<p>You want your team to win, because the other team is a bunch of People So Horrible That We Can Not Even Speak To Them (Did You See What They Did?!?).<p>If somebody doesn&#x27;t see what you see, they either need to be educated -- as you are attempting to do with me -- or they are evil, and must be attacked.<p>I do not live in the United States, and I have not for a decade.
