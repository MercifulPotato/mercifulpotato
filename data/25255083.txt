I have a background in mechatronics, and when I think &quot;robotics&quot;, I think of an assembly line with a number of specialized devices on the line. When I talk to other people about robotics, they think of a &quot;humanoid robot that can cook and clean and move stuff for them&quot;. As far as I can imagine, a generalized robot would also need a generalized intelligence to perform general tasks, and to learn how to use the tools available to it to accomplish those.')
