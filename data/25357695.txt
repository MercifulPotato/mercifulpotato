So no DOM in this case. But I am thinking of ways to optimize this. I know this will be used for screen recordings and that gives me some flexibility in what assumptions I can make in the optimization pipeline. At the moment I plan on trying to come up with an algorithm to detect scrolling&#x2F;jumping regions (like in the demo where the whole line height grows once the first emoji is typed on a given line) and animate their scrolling and cropping using CSS animations instead of image patches. But I think what you describe is definitely something to explore and I might take that up next if I figure a use case for it as it sounds really interesting and fun!')
