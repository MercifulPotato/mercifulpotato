Item(by='bostik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607802646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400346, text='&gt; <i>If you passed a law saying that twitch has to pay fines for false DMCA takedowns</i><p>You have to dig deeper, beyond the platforms themselves: make it <i>extremely</i> expensive and dangerous to file copyfraud claims. As long as the incentives are in favour of carpetbombing, you will have lots of casualties.<p>Repeating something I have said before, it feels to me the correct solution would be to go full Hammurabi on the perverse incentives. To eliminate the asymmetric warfare, one change would be enough. -- If a company, or an agent acting in their name, files a fraudulent copyright takedown, then the victim of that takedown gets to choose one item from that company&#x27;s catalog that will become  public domain. The company also becomes liable for all the lost [royalty] income for the creators of that particular item.<p>The point is not to eliminate takedowns or make them technologically less effective. Goal should be to eliminate the incentives on abusing them, and make the depletion of culture a bad default.')
