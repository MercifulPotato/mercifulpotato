It&#x27;s like the freedom to flaunt not wearing a face mask. Your freedom can actually hurt you and society in general. China for example a country without as many freedoms has handled covid way better then the US do in no part to less freedoms.<p>Additionally specifically for the drug thing we already draw lines in legality even for people like you who promote total freedom. Should a 5 year old be allowed to sniff coke and shoot up on heroin just for his freedom? Well he&#x27;s a kid... and doesn&#x27;t know any better so he needs to be controlled.<p>Does that same logic apply to adults who don&#x27;t know any better who walk around without masks? Where is the line drawn? Why do kids have to be restricted but not adults that don&#x27;t know any better, what affords the child the &quot;privilege&quot; of more restriction?<p>If you legalize heroin and coke you are definitely going to reduce drug related violence and the lacing drugs with impurities but you will increase the amount of addicts and regular users including users who start using at childhood.')
