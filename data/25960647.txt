Classically, price is considered an equilibrium of supply and demand. If I print money, but don&#x27;t use it to demand goods, why would the price of goods change?<p>Reality is more complex than classical economics (and I should note, I&#x27;m not an economist). Expectations of inflation (due to say, seeing a giant pile of cash coming off the printing press) can trigger prices to rise.<p>But hopefully that helps to explain why it&#x27;s generally accepted that velocity plays an important role in inflation, not simply supply of money.')
