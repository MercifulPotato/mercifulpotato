France might have stricter rules, but didn&#x27;t enforce them. German police enforced (and enforces) the rules that they have in terms of contact tracing, quarantine&#x2F;isolation, indoors mask rules, regional&#x2F;local lockdowns etc far more rapidly and stringently than France, Spain, UK or US. (Not as well as East Asian countries, but in European comparison the stereotype of following orders kind of works.<p>Also Sweden does not only have geographic proximity to Norway and Denmark, but similar holiday travel behaviour, similar wealth level and business travel pattern, similar cultural mores of proximity. A far far more even comparison than with France, say. (And yes Finland has cities, ever heard of Helsinki with 1.4m people in the metro area?)')
