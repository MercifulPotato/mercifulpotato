Its latest incarnation (PVRTC2) was introduced in 2013. Being able to load and render the texture format (whether efficiently or not) doesn&#x27;t appear to require a licence. I used to use PVRTC assets when developing for the original iPod touch. I can imagine Apple retaining support for the format on new hardware for backwards compatibility reasons, such as being able to load and run apps with PVRTC resources<p>It could very well be the case that PVRTC resources are no longer rendered using the same tech on modern Apple GPUs, and general performance improvements since 2013 make it a non-issue<p>I don&#x27;t think support for the PVRTC format implies that a PowerVR GPU design is in use or that &quot;plenty of PowerVR tech&quot; is present in modern Apple GPUs')
