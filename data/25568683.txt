Item(by='phaemon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609239969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564426, text='I suppose I should be the first to point out that 982.002 is not actually an integer :)<p>But, as the article puts it, &quot;suspiciously close&quot;. Except, I guess you&#x27;d accept .003 as close also. And, from the other side, you have .999, .998 etc. If you accept the range .995 to .005 as &quot;close&quot;, that&#x27;s already 11 values, so around 1 in 90 chance of hitting it at random.<p>Except, there might be other &quot;suspicious&quot; values. Like, .100, .200 etc. That gives us another 9. And then you could have things like .111, .222 etc.<p>If you accept around 50 different suspicious values of some sort then there&#x27;s a 1 in 20 chance of hitting one at random. That doesn&#x27;t seem so suspicious to me.')
