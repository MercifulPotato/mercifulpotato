Apple has been fairly straight about timelines and people who want to stick with Intel have plenty of time and options to get their stuff in a row in advance. More important, Apple fixed most of the major irritations with the MacBook Pro. If they hadn&#x27;t launched the 16&quot; MBP last year, people would have been stuck with a fairly old&#x2F; compromised design.<p>I suspect Apple is going to maintain MacOS right where it is now. People have been worried about &quot;iOSification&quot; for nearly a decade now and while there have been some elements, the core functionality is fundamentally the same.')
