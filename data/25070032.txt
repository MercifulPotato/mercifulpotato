Item(by='cryptica', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605190475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068594, text='Emigration is going to be essential to avoid technological enslavement over the next few decades. I plan to move to a sovereign country with small population which has a good number of educated and well connected rich people and which has strong relationships with the elites of large (soon to be enslaved) countries. Ideally a country where the elites feel safe to have their holiday houses and send their children to school.<p>The reason why the country must have a small population is because it&#x27;s not profitable for corporate interests to take control of small countries. Corporations will want to enslave countries with large productive working populations because they are more profitable to exploit. With the US, for example, you just need to corrupt one election, one legal system and you can potentially acquire 350+ million workers&#x2F;slaves in one fell swoop; that&#x27;s very profitable. You just need to change one single law and you can reduce the freedoms of 350 million people to squeeze additional productivity out of them... Again in one fell swoop. That&#x27;s extremely profitable.<p>On the other hand, if you want to enslave a small country full of rich educated people, it&#x27;s going to be challenging because these rich people can leverage their political connections and bribe your corporate insiders (or use their personal connections to manipulate them) to steer you off course... And then these people are not useful to enslave anyway; firstly, there are too few of them (doesn&#x27;t scale), secondly, they have no skills to produce anything useful... Rich people are a liability; you want to take countries full of cattle you can milk, not parasites.<p>As soon as people realize what&#x27;s going on, it will be too late to leave. Just like what happened in North Korea. If you want to have a decent life, you need to think like a parasite. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did early in my career thinking that anyone will try to protect your rights in the name of &#x27;justice&#x27; - There is no justice. Human evil has no limits.')
