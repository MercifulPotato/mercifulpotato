A study is done at the typical (very low) level of quality, and it gets published somewhere.<p>2. A more careful study tries to replicate the effect and finds that it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>3. The world concludes that the effect doesn&#x27;t occur in the very specific context observed in the second study, but does occur in all other contexts.<p>Gelman makes the point that if the two studies occurred in the other order -- first, a high-quality study finds no effect, and second, a low-quality study finds an effect -- no one would conclude the effect was generally present. But the order in which you perform studies is not actually relevant to anything.')
