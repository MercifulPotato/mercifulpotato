Definitely more important for me than any of the other &quot;why we love Clojure&quot; points.<p>As long as Rust doesn&#x27;t offer something similar as the REPL driven development Clojure offers, there is zero reason of preferring Rust (for me) over Clojure for the same tasks. Which, because of the last point (&quot;Rust is not homoiconic&quot;) won&#x27;t happen any time soon.<p>Now, if you need to do embedded system development, Rust might make more sense than Clojure, but it won&#x27;t replace Clojure for the same tasks today.')
