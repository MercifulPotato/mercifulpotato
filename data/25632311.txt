For large providers (i.e. those that would be used for handling one-time link emails), this normally isn&#x27;t a problem however for small or self hosted email servers it can be from time to time.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what all goes into ~~the algorithm~~ that google uses to decide to tarpit emails from a server but I&#x27;d make sure that you have your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all set up properly to give google as little of an excuse to dislike your server as possible.<p>It&#x27;s not a great solution but I&#x27;ve long since given up on any attempt at self-hosting email and just use my own domain with protonmail at this point since the industry seems to be so hostile to self-hosting.')
