Which country is this for? What kind of driver?<p>I got a new Volvo XC60 T8 last year(400bhp, £60k car), my fully comprehensive insurance as a 29 year old is...£400 a year. With their highest tier premium insurance option, with premium courtesy car, full EU cover, glass cover, full legal cover, 20 million euro liability cover....etc, full package basically.<p>Before that I had a Mercedes GLA45 AMG and my insurance was marginally more expensive, like £500 a year.<p>I can&#x27;t believe any of the cars you listed would be more to insure than these two....so what gives? Why is it so expensive?')
