If you find some infinite leverage exploit on coinbase, how are the effects different compared to one on robinhood? The gp commenter mentioned something involving &quot;separation of ownership in a case of bankruptcy&quot;, but even then, I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s any different than finding a infinite leverage exploit on robinhood, finding a withdraw exploit, withdrawing to your bank account, then buying cryptocurrencies with it. At the end of the day as long you can find a infinite margin exploit + withdraw exploit on any margin platform, you can make wealth dissapear into the aether of cryptocurrencies.')
