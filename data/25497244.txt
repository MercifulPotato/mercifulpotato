It&#x27;s easy to get around third-party audits if you want to.<p>The most private solution by far is to self-host, but that&#x27;s also very challenging these days.<p>And any email you send to a non-private service (Gmail, Yahoo, anyone&#x27;s work account) is instantly going to be just as insecure as if you yourself used that other person&#x27;s service.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that email is inherently a not-very-private communication method and you should try to avoid it. The amount of time required to make it more private is not going to have much benefit for most people (whose contacts will be using Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.)<p>You also can&#x27;t easily or meaningfully get E2E encryption with email, so there&#x27;s a lot of surface area to lose your privacy.')
