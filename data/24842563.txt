Certainly we can think of experience as very significative in the way people act and think. Also if you replace the word <i>experience</i> by <i>education</i> (see as being the same thing here), you end up with anything from study environment, to culture to politics that actually determine a lot how people behave.<p>That&#x27;s actually my main criticism of the politics in my country. It&#x27;s not so much that the politicians are saying dumb things, they actually are great people if you look closely. It&#x27;s just that their politic is not how I would &quot;educate&quot; people, the way people experiences it is the bad part in my feeling.<p>In short, I think those impulses have a lot to do with experience&#x2F;education.')
