A tool is only a tool while someone is using it. “Science” does not exist as such outside its employment by human beings, it is not some Ideal floating in conceptual space. There is no science except insofar as human beings are using it for ends that human beings judge good or ill.<p>So it’s entirely reasonable to consider whether “science” - which I think here is really standing in for a certain kind of technological mindset - weighed in the balance, would be found wanting, whether there is not a better way of approaching the world and the things in it, including ourselves, rather than considering everything in it a sort of Heideggerian standing reserve.<p>This seems particularly true as we advance rather thoughtlessly toward the development of things like AI and genetic engineering.')
