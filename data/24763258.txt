But apart from my CV in the middle, the rest are real applications. Not everyone has a lot of work experience when they start their journey :)\nOh, and they got the job with the CVs mentioned on the landing page.<p>Regarding the ATS, here is a response I gave to a similar question:\nIf you don&#x27;t know how ATS extract data, use a text-based resume and the right keywords. A word document is most of the time, the best choice. But if you know how the data extraction works, you can play around with the layout and design. Imagine we have a scale from -4 to 4. I will put you at 1 with the template because the data can get extracted in the right order, and the keywords for the sections are right. But the rest is currently up to you. Check out the job description. What keywords are they using there? Skills mention earlier are more important than the ones at the bottom. Use them in your resume as well.')
