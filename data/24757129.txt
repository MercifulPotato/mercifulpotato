Item(by='svrb', descendants=None, kids=[24758238, 24759048], score=None, time=1602524721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756621, text='Welcome to social media, where the facts don&#x27;t matter.<p>Ballot harvesting is not only legal but standard procedure... for the Democratic Party. The only difference wish these boxes is social distancing. But because ballot harvesting mostly happened in... different neighborhoods than the typical HN reader live in, therefore it&#x27;s strange and unfamiliar and this didn&#x27;t really happen, apparently. So naturally when the wrong team does the same thing (but with social distancing) it&#x27;s the end of the world. And you can bet your last dollar that if the wrong team had collected the ballots in person, that would have been evidence that they&#x27;re endangering peoples&#x27; lives with COVID.<p>This sickens me.')
