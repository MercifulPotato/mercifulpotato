Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609457820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598233, text='&gt; <i>that&#x27;s a lot of people mate.</i><p>I agree, but I think my point still stands even if it doesn&#x27;t apply to everyone, or even a majority of people.<p>&gt; <i>The particular person here runs a charity for inmates, and if you&#x27;re self-employed or own a business in a sense ironically enough you have even less control over your schedule because you can&#x27;t just dial the numbers down and people depend on you, in this case both workers and clients.</i><p>This is a manifestation of the same problem of not setting boundaries.  People only depend on you if you agree to take them on as clients.  It might be heartbreaking to have to make those kinds of decisions when it comes to something like working with inmates, but I do believe you&#x27;ll help a smaller number of inmates much more effectively if you&#x27;re well-rested and take care of your health.  And, again, that actually is entirely within your control.  You can certainly choose to help more people at the expense of your health, but that may not be the best decision for yourself (or the people you&#x27;re trying to help) in the longer run.  But it&#x27;s still a choice.')
