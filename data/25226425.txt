Many amazing pieces of code involve pre-rendering or other various forms of precomputation that are extremely computationally expensive but the final result will run on a low-powered machine.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing on the BBC Micro, MegaDrive&#x2F;Genesis or other evergreen demo platforms is not &quot;what would happen if computers never got any faster,&quot; rather it&#x27;s more like &quot;what would happen if only the computer running the final product never got any faster.&quot; We still need faster, better hardware.')
