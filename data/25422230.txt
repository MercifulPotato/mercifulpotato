Heat loss depends on temperature differential so there will be less energy lose.<p>The real question you should ask isn&#x27;t is it true - it is.  The real question is it significant enough to worry about.  If you are going to be gone for several days it is.<p>If you are only talking about a part of a day though things are different, and get complex.<p>If you heat with electric (including heat pumps!), keeping the house a consistent temperature makes you use an even amount of heat all day, and so your house can be better supplied by renewable energy.  If many people turn the heat up when (or just before) they get home at 5pm - the renewable power available isn&#x27;t enough and the power company will have to turn on fossil fuel plants to make up the difference.  Thus you might use more energy but use a better type of energy by keeping the house warm.<p>For many houses solar heating (from windows) is nearly enough to keep the house warm all day even on the coldest days, so it doesn&#x27;t matter as the heating system isn&#x27;t working anyway.<p>Note that the previous two paragraphs contradict each other. I don&#x27;t know how to work that out (for cooling it is a big deal), so you will need to ask questions - be prepared for different answers at different times.<p>If your house is well insulated you shouldn&#x27;t see much a change in temperature indoors, and as such there is only a tiny amount of energy save with setbacks. So why not just enjoy a comfortable temperature for the rare exceptions to your schedule? If your house is not well insulated, fixing that should be your priority.<p>There are probably other factors I can&#x27;t think of.')
