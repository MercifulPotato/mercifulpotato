My view is that the risk we in democratic countries face is not from political entities co-opting Facebook, it&#x27;s from companies like Facebook becoming political entities in their own right. We&#x27;re all well aware of how America&#x27;s lobbying system works. What I think is much more insidious is companies who control the flow of information pursuing their own political agendas. Twitter and Facebook can have more influence on the political landscape by altering the algorithms they use to promote information than the equivalent of millions of dollars of lobbying. That should frighten you.')
