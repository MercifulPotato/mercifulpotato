There&#x27;s no god mandated set of borders defining &quot;types&quot; of science.<p>There are fields so complex that they have to be dealt in so high an abstraction level that we call them subjective. Absolutely does not mean that the objects they study are unworthy of study. Precisely the opposite, in fact.<p>Also does not mean that, even if a portion of people are faking, there are no valuable insights coming from the scientific field.<p>I&#x27;ll point out that there are a huge number of &quot;fake efforts&quot; in the hard sciences as well. Cost of doing science at scale with bad incentive engines.<p>Finally, if your issue with the &quot;humanities&quot; is with a perceived politization of the academia, I&#x27;d suggest formally educating yourself in those subjects and taking a place in said politics instead of, you know, acting like a reactionary teen or twentysumthin. No offense, but complaining about politization from the outside is a useless venting effort.')
