Almost everything in this statement is wrong.<p>The only thing that might be right (price fortune telling) isn&#x27;t the problem you think it is.<p>Oil prices have decreased over the last 30+ years, with steady increases in overall production until covid.<p>I&#x27;m paying the same numerical dollar amount for gas that I did 20 years ago, for a product that&#x27;s only increased in quality and regulatory costs (ethanol, refining requirements, safe production costs, etc).<p>Fracking technology improving is exactly why it exists and has until recently, boomed.<p>Wells drilled with 1950s technology (which was still the same basic drill, inject, penetrate &amp; pressure as today) are all of a sudden profitable again, because you can re-fracture, and squeeze more from extant wells.<p>That&#x27;s improved technology, efficiency, and economics.<p>&gt;Pushing water through hard rock is expensive and technology isn&#x27;t magic<p>Not magic, chemistry. Thats why they let the chemical reactions create pressure. The pumping is to get the figurative vinegar and baking soda down the hole to start the the science fair volcano.<p>As to markets, if anything public markets are irrationally dumping profitable oil and infrastructure due to somewhat successful intimidation tactics by the environmental movement.<p>For instance, Shell is selling or shutting down almost all of its smaller US refineries because they&#x27;re not &quot;green ready.&quot; They&#x27;re giving away profits on a political calculation, not a financial&#x2F;economical one.')
