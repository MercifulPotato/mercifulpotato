This had nothing to do with the wealth of our families, it&#x27;s available for everyone. Just like all the education before that.<p>We had our first child and bought a house in our 20s, easily done since one can get into work life without any debt. Oh, and we both had a year off work to spend with the said child. Expecting a second and planning to do the very same with her.<p>We reside ~30 minutes from the city center that&#x27;s accessible via affordable public transportation and even walking &#x2F; cycling roads where cars are not allowed. The air is clean and these roads go through small forests and parks.<p>When it comes to income, we&#x27;re well off nowadays, probably in the 5% of top earning households (in our early 30s). But despite that, due to sensible city planning and good social policies, we have a lot of friends from different income brackets living next to us, having pretty similar quality of life as we do, who also bought their own apartments in their 20s and had kids. Our children go to the same kindergarten, will end up in the same schools, and they will do so with other kids from all walks of life. That&#x27;s a real treasure in my opinion. Compared to the rest of the world, they are also quite safe in here. Some US cities look like warzones (statistically speaking) compared to our roughest neighbourhoods.<p>I have an idea what the SV top earner life without kids looks like, it&#x27;s pretty sweet I can admit that. Would I trade my life to have that? Never, if it means that my friends without jobs have to live on the street without healthcare. Life is just so much better when everyone has a decent standard of living.')
