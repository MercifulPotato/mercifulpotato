Copy pasting it here:<p>Everybody here seems to agree that unions have the potential to do good or bad in every thread on it. The next logical step to me is that there needs to be a selection mechanism in place.<p>For companies, the selection mechanism is competition. If someone else does better, the consumer or worker can choose someone else. And we have anti-monopoly laws to make sure that that someone else exists, to foster that competition and choice.<p>Is there such a mechanism for unions? My ideal scenario wouldn&#x27;t be me on my own as it is today. I&#x27;d want a handful of unions to pick from to represent me, not too differently from my choice of medical insurer. Five unions to represent 575,000 amazon warehouse workers would still average 115,000 members each, so it&#x27;s a huge step forward in collective bargaining. And then people can change unions if one of them ends up how folks are worried about in every union thread.<p>It seems like it would get at all sides of the issue. We&#x27;d get collective representation and a safeguard against the potential pitfalls.<p>How could this scenario come about? Could it be something like medical insurance with an open enrollment season? There would need to be something akin to anti-competitive behavior built in, so you couldn&#x27;t end up with an agreement saying you can only hire from our union. What else would it take?')
