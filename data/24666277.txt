If you have a copyable type with a destructor where the cleanup should only happen once, then you already need some kind of refcount  to only run the cleanup when the last copy is dropped. Either the refcount is in your own type, or you&#x27;re wrapping another copyable refcounting type like shared_ptr.<p>Notice how I said &quot;cleanup-via-destructor&quot; rather than just &quot;destructor&quot;, for this reason.')
