I wish our roosters were that motivated. Even trimming his crest, our polish is practically blind so he&#x27;s constantly being surprised by everything. He&#x27;s useless for protection and frequently goes after our toddler. Our two silkie roosters are&#x2F;were pretty timid, which is good and bad. Unfortunately our favorite (by appearance and temperment) was taken recently.<p>We didn&#x27;t pick the roosters, we just ended up with the 3 because some of the chicks were unsexed. A well-tempered bantam would be nice.<p>We could fence them into a smaller area... but we like letting them roam around the property. Tough choices.')
