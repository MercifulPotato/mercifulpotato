It employs a client-server architecture.<p>The windows (clients) send their local framebuffers to the X server, X sends them to a compositor, the compositor joins them together into a big framebuffer that has the different windows in their respective positions and sends them to the X server. The X server then displays them on your screen.<p>There&#x27;s a relatively new (~10 years old) protocol, called Wayland, which will replace X. The architecture is better and it has some other constraints (vsync is always on, so there&#x27;s no screen tearing). Some distributions are using it by default (Fedora), but most are still sticking to X, since Wayland is not completely ready yet (in practice) and other projects are still transitioning into Wayland.<p>Maybe I got some technical details wrong, but that&#x27;s the basic idea.')
