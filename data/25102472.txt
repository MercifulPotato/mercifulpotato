Item(by='extra88', descendants=None, kids=[25103103], score=None, time=1605458418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102206, text='&gt; Do you seriously think Scalia cared about protecting people&#x27;s rights to bear arms beyond the text of the 2nd amendment?<p>Whatever rights to bear arms there are, they come from the 2nd Amendment. It is absurd to stretch an Amendment about &quot;well regulated Militia&quot; to mean D.C. can&#x27;t require people to store a handgun with a trigger lock because it would impinge on their ability to use it for personal protection. Yet that&#x27;s what Scalia in the majority decided.<p>&gt; what constitutes a true liberal originalist?<p>You keep missing my point; if anyone was actually an originalist, some of their decisions would seem conservative, some would seem liberal, because they would just obediently be following what the text says. No judge actually does that and that alone, I&#x27;m only aware of conservative judges that claim they do. The term &quot;originalist&quot; was invented by conservatives so that&#x27;s not surprising.<p>I am not saying all conservative judges make wrong decisions and liberal judges make right ones. I&#x27;m saying conservatives attack outcomes they don&#x27;t like as not being &quot;originalist&quot; instead of being honest that it&#x27;s an outcome they don&#x27;t like. They&#x27;re hypocrites.<p>But this is not really relevant to the original claim of the Federalist Society undermining democracy; I think it would go to far to say to be conservative is to be anti-democratic. If the Federalist Society is anti-democratic, it&#x27;s more in their means than in their ends.')
