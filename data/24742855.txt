Item(by='stopachka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602374803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24742423, text='&gt; I  sometimes wonder if people on HN even know what privilege is or how they sound to the entire rest of the world. You think it&#x27;s typical that people making $7&#x2F;hr just happen to land a job at Google?<p>The initial comment mentioned that the person making 7 dollars an hour finished a bootcamp and _could_ work at google.

The elites will continue to do just fine.<p>If not having a boss, living a certain kind of life is advantageous, we should do what we can do go for that. If our means don’t allow for it, let’s work towards it.<p>—<p>(This comes from an immigrant without a degree, who got one of those great jobs, and now works without a boss. For now at least.)')
