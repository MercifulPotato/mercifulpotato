The fundamental problem is that HTML on its own is flawed and unusable. Even the most basic features that users expect will require a few lines of javascript.<p>Half of the webapps I make are just digitalizing existing paper forms. There is barely any javascript but the javascript that is there is absolutely essential. If the noscript warriors actually thought about ways of making plain HTML good enough that a JS free site was possible then I&#x27;d have sympathy for them. As it is right now they are asking the impossible. They would even complain about htmx even though it is exactly what they want.')
