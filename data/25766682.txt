Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=[25766819], score=None, time=1610565337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763213, text='Apple has poorly documented APIs and locked down platforms and app stores.<p>Windows has decades of cruft and the OS itself is basically adware at this point with &quot;recommendations&quot; and shit showing up constantly, un-removable foistware, dark patterns to herd you into MS cloud, and loads of gratuitous telemetry. Windows drivers, driver signing, and installers are all horrors that can reduce one to a gibbering lunatic like the poor souls in Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction. Networking is horrific too, and NTFS is slow.<p>Linux has fragmentation, fragmentation, fragmentation. There are at least three package formats, two or three inits (though I think we&#x27;re converging on systemd in spite of its many warts), and loads of gratuitous distributions and sub-distributions and spins of distributions that have no reason to exist except for some minor holy war over some minutia or license holy wars. Oh and the most popular package formats, dpkg and RPM, are arcane nightmares from the pit of hell.<p>Every time I get mad at Apple I try working with another platform and realize Apple is not that bad. They all suck.')
