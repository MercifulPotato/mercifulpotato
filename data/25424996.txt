However, since I last looked at it back in May there have been a lot of studies that have since completed and they seem to overwhelmingly point to it having no benefit.<p>Unfortunately many of the studies don&#x27;t test it correctly in my opinion, as they often test HCQ alone or with Azithromycin. There were some early indications it works as a zinc ionophore to transport zinc into the cells and it&#x27;s the zinc that has the effect. I personally supplement with zinc and quercetin for this precise reason - I will continue to do so.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that&#x27;s wrong, but I will certainly concede that the data now supports that HCQ by itself doesn&#x27;t seem to have a clinically significant effect on mortality or severity of illness with Covid-19.<p>I won&#x27;t exonerate the media though, because they were quick with their early claims that it doesn&#x27;t work at a time when the evidence was stronger in the other direction (in my opinion) or ambiguous at best. One need look no further for support of that than the sheer amount of studies that were triggered into HCQ for Coivd-19 treatment (over 150 registered clinical trials!) That would have been silly if there was no good reason at the time to think it might be effective.')
