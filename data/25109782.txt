Item(by='peteri', descendants=None, kids=[25110112], score=None, time=1605518938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106357, text='You can export the key to something else (and it&#x27;s worth doing) personally I&#x27;ve gone for passing it to Microsoft (I&#x27;m not sure I could find whatever USB key I&#x27;ve stored it on otherwise). The option is under &quot;Manage bitlocker&quot; &quot;backup your recovery key&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve had bitlocker fail to find the key after doing a BIOS update where the TPM has been messed up (although usually it&#x27;s just been disabled and needs re-enabling). If Microsoft has the backup key you can login on another PC or phone and get the key again (from memory it&#x27;s around 25 random characters).<p>My threat model is theft of a PC not Microsoft one drive being hacked. Just means whoever steals the PC now has to either:<p>a) Hack the TPM<p>b) Hack my Microsoft account<p>c) Give up and reformat the PC before resale<p>While a &amp; b are not impossible they seem unlikely for a random thief, while option c seems like the most likely response to a PC stolen with bitlocker enabled.<p>Bitlocker makes me less likely to be a victim of identity theft after having my PC stolen.')
