Sure, there&#x27;s a bit of jargon and memorization to be able to discuss the problem. You can&#x27;t be amazed by the results of concentration gradients, gene expression on the formation of proteins if you think concentration means something about your eyebrows, gradients are a function of WordArt, gene was a guy who played Willy Wonka, expressions are things your face does, and protein is a number on your dad&#x27;s whey powder.<p>If you can make students excited about using, testing, and comprehending the awesome information about their world that are just behind a minor speed bump of some jargon you need to cross, most will hurdle those difficulties as if it was effortless. The standardized tests that check whether they know the jargon will be just a wasted day that they don&#x27;t get to learn more about the subject!<p>If, instead, you set the end goal as passing the standardized test that checks whether they know the jargon or not, they&#x27;ll begrudgingly do the minimum required to not get in too much trouble. The tragedy is that kids who don&#x27;t even know the bare minimum jargon are often unprepared to function as independent adults, and so the rational, fair, game-theoretic optimum outcome demands resources need to be allocated to help those more than they need to be allocated to help those who are already functional.<p>Also, there&#x27;s the tragedy that teachers who pour their hearts into their students aren&#x27;t adequately valued by society - we pay lawyers and administrators huge sums of money as if what they do is more important than  what my 9th grade bio teacher did while using his weekends to crawl through the mud on bog walks to learn about sphagnum mosses and carnivorous plants with some kids he met for an hour a day for 8 months, while barely keeping his family out of poverty.')
