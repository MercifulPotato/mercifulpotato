There&#x27;s tons of games I&#x27;d love to actually play but just can&#x27;t.<p>By the way, I agree with your assessment that some games are simply better suited for a first person perspective. I don&#x27;t know if I perhaps created a wrong impression before, but I have never said that game devs should change their designs just so folks like myself can play <i>all</i> games under the sun (although jumping through hoops to tailor to small minorities is very much en vogue these days in other fields).<p>For Cyberpunk 2077 specifically, it&#x27;s just a bit disappointing for me personally because I am a huge fan of The Witcher, and I&#x27;m sure a sci-fi RPG story could have been told using a similar mechanic. But, yes, it would have been a different game -- sadly, one that I could have actually played.<p>I also liked the old Resident Evil titles, and that series has now turned to first person too.
