Many states have a higher bar [1]. Many people working for 10 bucks an hour will still be earning minimum wage in their respective state.<p>If you take a look at the nation-wide wage distribution, you&#x27;ll see things don&#x27;t look that good. At the 50&#x27;th percentile the income for a family with 2.56 people is 57k, before tax etc.<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t.<p>Maybe they should. In the end they&#x27;re benefiting from all the education that you as an individual pay for (or that is state-supported) and from all of the extra training you&#x27;re supposed to do on the side without remuneration.<p>&gt; Neither do people owe them fealty.<p>On the other hand there&#x27;s no reason why people should ever owe fealty to a corporation. Societies are (de jure and should be de facto) centered on human individuals, not on various legal fictions. Corporations have no natural rights and they are not people (despite what the US supreme court might say) - no need for a human being to owe them anything.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:State_minimum_wage.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minimum_wage_in_the_United_Sta...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Household_income_in_the_United_States#Distribution_of_household_income_in_2014_according_to_US_Census_data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Household_income_in_the_United...</a>')
