One project&#x27;s test suite ran in about 5-10 mins in our linux CI&#x2F;CD environment, and about 50+ mins in macOS with docker.<p>There was a very in-depth thread on the docker forums where the devs explained why there was such a huge performance penalty. IIRC it was due to all the extra bookkeeping that had to be done to ensure strong consistency and correct propagation of file system events between the virtualized docker for mac environment and the host file system.<p>The test suite would run integration tests that performed a lot of npm&#x2F;yarn operations which meant lots of disk IO.')
