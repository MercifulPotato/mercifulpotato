Generally, expanding on the current state of the art is paramount in academia. In this case, I guess that defaulting on closed-world and unique names is frowned upon because academic people &quot;know&quot; that SemWeb concepts would be &quot;easy&quot; to implement under such conditions (for some interpretation of &quot;know&quot; and &quot;easy&quot;). A university lab would be reluctant to invest on such a project, because it would likely result in less publications than, say, a bleeding-edge POC.<p>Of course, practical solutions based on well-understood assumptions are exactly what a commercial operation needs, so it&#x27;s no wonder that TerminusDB chose that path. They might not publish a ton of papers, but they have something that works and could be used in production.')
