Is Jack2 not available for guix? Jack1 has a bunch of limitations compared to jack2 and hasn&#x27;t been in active development for a while apart from bugfixes.<p>I write in a rambling little post I made last year about my Linux audio mastering workflow [0],<p>&gt;&gt; We will be using jack2 because using jack1 in 2019 is stupid! The multi-threading, MIDI, and other various features of jack2 are deal-breakers, not nice-to-haves.<p>In my experience, the need for jack2 is amplified even further when you want to work with modern plugins like the ones you mention at KVR.<p>&gt; Being able to arbitrarily patch the inputs and outputs to any other input and output between jack aware software is honestly one of the coolest things i&#x27;ve seen.<p>Indeed! When I was a studying audio engineering at university this was a huge revelation and few of the professors &amp; professionals I was surrounded by had any idea this functionality was out there. The fact that it was FOSS blew their minds.<p>If you want to go even further down the modularity rabbit hole, check out non-daw [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grathwohl.me&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;linuxmasteringflow-1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grathwohl.me&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;linuxmasteringflow-1.html</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;non.tuxfamily.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;non.tuxfamily.org&#x2F;</a>')
