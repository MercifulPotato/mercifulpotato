If you throw everything and the kitchen sink at a problem, it&#x27;s very hard to figure out which of the things you did actually worked.<p>The closest thing I&#x27;ve seen to a controlled study was a Danish one that showed that wearing a mask - everything else equal - reduces your risk of getting it from 2.1% to 1.8%, which is a weak 20% reduction. No study on the efficacy of preventing spread to others. (It&#x27;s a bit problematic to perform an experiment like this in a controlled setting to say the least.)<p>I&#x27;m sure masks do <i>something</i>, and mask mandates hopefully have a net positive effect, but how large is it? I have no idea.<p>2) I live in Hawaii which is also an isolated island in the Pacific, and it has a case curve that looks like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;usa&#x2F;hawaii&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;usa&#x2F;hawaii&#x2F;</a><p>The mask mandate went into effect on April 16th, and there&#x27;s just <i>zero</i> correlation between that and the case curve. It&#x27;s two weeks after the peak of the initial bump in cases, and apparently the mask mandate and obligatory quarantine for all incoming travelers and everything else in the emergency orders did nothing to stop the much larger peak in July-August. It&#x27;s also not the case that people have been slacking off, mask compliance is very high.')
