But where next?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m about 10 yrs into a frontend career, and I&#x27;m at the end of my rope.<p>I work at a WordPress agency doing 95% of my work at the very front of frontend — css&#x2F;html&#x2F;ui js.  I&#x27;m so tired of nudging things 1px this way and 2px that way, I could scream when I see another QA ticket come in.<p>I&#x27;m realizing now that without setting any actual long-term goals, I&#x27;ll be doing this forever.   So I&#x27;m determined to set some actual goals and try and get somewhere new.<p>Trouble is, I feel frozen with self-doubt. I&#x27;m really struggling to figure out where to go next. Maybe I&#x27;m burned out, maybe I can&#x27;t see the road ahead? Maybe I&#x27;m just burned out with agency life? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;d really, really appreciate some new perspectives.<p>In my head, I&#x27;m constantly going back and forth — Try rails!  Stay in JS-land!  Keep doing React! Keep doing Vue! You&#x27;ll never master backend, just give up! etc<p><i></i>What do I know?<i></i><p>I’m solid on all frontend stuff — css&#x2F;html&#x2F;js&#x2F;WP. Intermediate with React and Vue<p><i></i>Time<i></i><p>With young kids and a full-time job, I only have about 1-2hrs a day to devote.<p><i></i>Options include?<i></i><p>1. Move up the stack, away from CSS and towards the middle of the frontend. I don&#x27;t see this job anywhere at my current company, so I have trouble imagining what it would even look like.<p>2. Try backend. I&#x27;ve never BE. I&#x27;m playing with Rails at the moment, just because I played with it about 10 yrs ago and recall liking it a bit. At this point, I really don&#x27;t know if BE is &quot;for me&quot; at all.<p>3. Since I know JS, maybe I should dip into Node?<p>4. Maybe I should focus all my energy into React or Vue? I worry about getting sucked back into the frontend&#x2F;css vortex on this path though.<p>5. PHP since I’m at a WP shop already?<p>I&#x27;m not the sharpest frontender on the team, so that&#x27;s where my doubts about BE come from. It seems like it&#x27;d be harder than frontend .....but maybe that&#x27;s just because I haven&#x27;t spent any dedicated time learning BE.')
