Young people are more comfortable online and kids in high school ten years ago are the tech bros in FAANG.<p>This seems to be a time for them to ‘give it back’ to an oppressive older generation they can rebel against. I too never agreed with my previous generation but I never wielded this kind of power.<p>The 50 something year old who is banned from Twitter by a 25 something techie probably cannot comprehend why he is suddenly a hateful racist villain. Just 7-8 years ago, he had friends! I see many a middle aged woman on Nextdoor completely bewildered by why high school kids are calling them ‘Karen’ between zoom class breaks. If it werent so tragic, it would be comical.')
