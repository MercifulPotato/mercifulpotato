Nothing very interesting.<p>Now we are using a Black Magic gadget from BlackMagic Mini Pro. It has 4 HDMI inputs, some additional audio inputs and you can to some extent mix them, switch, etc. As far as I know you cannot merge.<p>Given all sorts of different devices that we have used as inputs, getting to HDMI was not always easy and even not compatible.<p>I started thinking that it would be cool to have a program and&#x2F;or hardware that would take multiple different Airplay (audio and&#x2F;or video), treat them the same as HDMI inputs and allow mixing of the inputs.<p>Seems to me it could all be done in software as an application. \nand perhaps there are already a lot of them out there and I am just ignorant of them.<p>Of course having both HDMI and Airplay would be even better.<p>In thinking about this I figured as a messy prototype 4 Raspberry PIs converting Airplay to HDMI and then into Mini Pro.<p>Of 4 Mac laptops, or 4 iPhones.<p>I would love to hear input from others.')
