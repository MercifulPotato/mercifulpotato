And I can see how it launched an unfortunate trend of liberals believing future elections either were or would be stolen. Greg Palast, for instance, is a celebrated journalist in some circles despite incorrectly claiming that the 2006 election would &quot;go down in infamy&quot; as a stolen election, and saying the same thing again in 2008. Despite being a Democrat, I find Palast&#x27;s record to be deeply inaccurate and I am disappointed in the lack of critical reflection on his record by people who cite him.<p>But those claims come from a completely different universe than the 2020 claims, and I don&#x27;t think they had anything to do with explaining the sociological forces driving election skepticism in 2020. Instead, that <i>breed</i> of skepticism has come from Trump and a media ecosystem that established an entirely alternate reality, with fever pitched adversarial thinking.<p>The content, social forces and motivations are completely independent, in their sources, in their character and in their scale and should not be equated to each other.')
