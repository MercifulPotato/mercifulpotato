Everything combined, Google News is a net positive for publishers. They weren&#x27;t as discoverable as they are now and probably see less traffic from any other source. They want to be compensated for being publicly indexed? Google should honestly just remove the complaining publishers from Google News or Google altogether. See how they like that. Let them opt-out if they dislike it that bad. It&#x27;s like complaining to a phone book it lists phone numbers in an efficient manner.')
