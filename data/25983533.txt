This wasn&#x27;t exceedingly pleasant, and was a fairly common case of cts&#x2F;rsi&#x2F;etc. I had had rsi issues previously which had been very painful, but never something which to me looked like some kind of partial paralysis.<p>So I started looking into it, and realized that I could greatly improve my situation by paying attention to ergonomics, starting with my mouse. First problem : convincing tech support to replace my old ball mouse with a led one. They didn&#x27;t want to give me a new one since &#x27;it was obviously a joke&#x27;...<p>The good news is that things are a lot better now than they used to be, from decent mice and keyboards (ergo mechanical keyboards are a godsend) to all kinds of accessibility options in OSes, and rsi issues being broadly known. Rather surprisingly I&#x27;m in less pain now than I used to be (some things will most likely remain off-limits forever, such as using a laptop ), after having adjusted mouse, keyboard, chair, screens, font sizes, and general software environment to avoid doing &#x27;bad&#x27; movements.<p>In any case, if you want to go down this road, please do! You&#x27;ll improve everyone&#x27;s life.')
