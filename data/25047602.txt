I have the exact same printer (HP Color LaserJet M254dw) and was curious to see if it automatically updated itself.  The firmware datecode on my printer, 20190807, is even older than what the author downgraded to.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I turned auto updates off when I set the printer up.  I did go through most of the configuration UI via a web browser and know that I switched it to &quot;IT-managed&quot; mode - maybe that turned off auto updates.  The printer is on a VLAN that connects to the internet, but I&#x27;ve turned off every option that sounds like it reaches out to a cloud service.<p>Overall, this is a decent printer for me.  It seems to meet all of my requirements - I can leave it unused for long periods and it will still wake up and print as soon as I tell it to.  It&#x27;s a laser printer, so no worries about clogged nozzles&#x2F;dried up ink.  There are four individual toner cartridges, so no need to a set of three colours because one ran out.  Windows and MacOS both discovered the printer on the network and automatically figured out the drivers.<p>Printers generally suck, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to suck too badly.')
