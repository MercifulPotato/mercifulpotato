My understanding is that the Twitter block in 2016 had less to do with Twitter as a company and more to do with Tayipp not being able to control the flow of information.<p>Remember Wikipedia was blocked because Tayipp&#x27;s page was painted honestly, which he found to be very unflattering, and because Wikimedia refused to remove references to the recorded&#x2F;leaked conversations about money laundering with his (Berkeley-educated) nitwit song Bilal (There is a saying here when somebody does not understand what you are saying: &quot;Explain it as if you are explaining it to Bilal&quot;.<p>This is also why soundcloud was blocked for 3 years, because people used it to post the recordings of him telling Bilal to remove all of the cash from the family houses in case they were searched.')
