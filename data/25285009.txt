Seriously I&#x27;m glad some people want to do it.<p>Me, I remember the first time I was sure I didn&#x27;t want to do that. I met a lady running a bar&#x2F;restaurant&#x2F;hub. It was clear her life was the place. It was open nights so she was there every night. It had lots of events. No more free nights for her, going out with friends, dancing, dinning etc. Her nights, while she did get to greet people, were mostly running around the place putting out fires. I&#x27;m not dissing that life at all. If she enjoys it that&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not for me in the same way I&#x27;m sure staring at a computer screen is not for her.')
