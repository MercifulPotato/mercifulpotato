Some of the issues could be handled spending a lot of money. The basic concepts (and issues) are the same in all Bluebook offsprings. You probably mean GNU ST; it has the advantage that there is a compiler and library available outside of virtual images and you can use it like a &quot;normal&quot; compiled language and easily re-assemble a virtual image with the objects and versions required. This allows you to use the image as a cache to reduce startup times like e.g. Dart does it. But this is not the original Smalltalk virtual image idea, i.e. not the &quot;whole environment&quot; the fellow referred to.')
