Ditch &#x27;em and try again<p>There used to be pro-familly policies in USA that basically assumed that is male is in the house, the male is responsible to be breadwinner. That meant that if there was make, woman would not get social support money on her nor on kid.<p>They were even quicker to kick unemployed male out due to that - his presence meant they risk support. It sucked, imo.')
