I didn&#x27;t know this was a thing until I read this post.<p>When I was in university I worked for a year as the News Editor \nof the school paper. Every couple of weeks or so, we would get letters from a random guy. They were papers that had text written on almost every inch of them, sometimes both front and back. They were grammatically correct, but mostly just ramblings about topics like philosophy and war and politics and science. They started coming before I was there, and sometime during my tenure they stopped. Some were thrown away for sure, but I managed to collect what I could in one place, and when I left I took them with me. There are around 150-200 pages total. They are just cool.<p>Anyways I couldn&#x27;t quite pin down what would cause someone to write such letters, but now I possibly have a name for it. Hypergraphia.<p>Samples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9nRzL6o&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9nRzL6o&#x2F;</a>')
