That&#x27;s a report from a single hospital.<p>&gt; And critically, NYC, as with all major metros, operates as a system of hospitals. So the data to support your assertion would be total NYC bed &amp; ICU bed capacity &amp; utilization.<p>&gt; &quot;Overwhelmed&quot; means unable to provide care.<p>Yes, and about half of [2] comes from Michael Dowling, the head of the largest hospital system in New York, where he goes on at length about patients dying in hallways having never been treated because they didn&#x27;t have enough staff, ventilators, bed space etc... Did you not read the articles?<p>&gt; The situation on the Comfort in NYC (swapped my coasts, oops!) was... complicated. The Navy was essentially commanded to &quot;Send a big ship to NYC so it can be seen.&quot;<p>This has nothing to do with how overrun NYC hospitals from, nor how effective the Navy hospital ships were at helping ease the burden.<p>And right back at ya: Please see guidelines for HN commenting. Specifically, &quot;Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize.
