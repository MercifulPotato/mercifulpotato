I&#x27;d argue that the heavy use of Github combined with the adoption of advanced Git workflows is currently the biggest threat to open source. There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;submitting a patch&quot; these days. You&#x27;re expected to be a master of a project&#x27;s Github workflow to contribute. Most of us (myself included, with a few exceptions) just don&#x27;t bother.')
