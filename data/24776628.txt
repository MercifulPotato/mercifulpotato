After all, the simplified script was created by people who were already using traditional and were attempting to make logical and consistent simplifications!<p>On the other hand, your friend might find some very common traditional characters brutal to learn as a beginner. 醫生 (doctor) often comes up within the first few lessons and 鬱悶 (depressed) within the first couple of semesters. In contrast, someone starting with simplified won&#x27;t be so daunted learning the simplified equivalents 医生 and 郁闷. Later, as an advanced student, the traditional forms aren&#x27;t so daunting as they would have been to start with.<p>It&#x27;s still more work for someone who knows 医 to learn the rest of 醫 than it is for someone who knows 醫 to learn that they just need to write the first 8 strokes that make up its upper left corner to make the simplified version, of course.')
