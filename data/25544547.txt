Those are the expectations I’m trying to temper here. If you want to develop for N64, you’re going to go through a lot of fuss getting an EverDrive 64 or a similar alternative, setting up an accurate emulator like CEN64 (the popular emulators are not suitable for development), getting toolchains running on your development system, etc.<p>I think some people have equated “Linux has been ported to system X” as “development for system X is now solved”, when Linux is only a small part of the solution, and for smaller systems (like the N64, which has only 4 MB RAM base), Linux is probably not your kernel of choice anyway.<p>The Nintendo 64 development scene would definitely benefit from more people pitching in and doing tools development. This is a good time to do it, there are a lot of gaps ready to be filled, and the number of people doing N64 development has increased quite a bit over the past couple years.')
