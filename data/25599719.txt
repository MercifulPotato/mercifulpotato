The new money transfer system (Pix) allows anyone to send money to a key, which can be a person&#x27;s CPF (the tax ID number nearly everyone has), a phone number, an email, or a randomly-generated number. These all map to a bank account (you can also use Pix to send directly to a bank account number); the directory with these mappings is kept by the Brazilian Central Bank, and the mappings are inserted by the participating financial institutions.<p>So assuming my email was something@example.com, and I had asked my bank to map the Pix key &quot;something@example.com&quot; to my bank account, anyone could &quot;send cash&quot; through Pix to my something@example.com email; the cash would arrive at my bank account nearly instantly (even during weekends and&#x2F;or holidays).')
