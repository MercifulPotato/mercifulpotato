Most mining happens currently on underutilized hydropower stations, because grid energy or fossil fuels wouldn&#x27;t be as profitable. Because of the mining difficulty adjustment and diminishing returns in improving ASIC hardware, the only way to profit is to find cheaper energy sources than all other miners.<p>In the long term, Bitcoin mining accelerates the development of abundant and cheap energy, which is not fossil fuels.')
