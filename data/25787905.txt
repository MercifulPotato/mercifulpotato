I wrote an app several years ago and haven&#x27;t had to update or do any maintenance on it since and it has happily served several million requests a month without errors.  Actually the only reason I&#x27;ve touched it is to upgrade the Heroku stack it is on. The best part is I actually had a lot of fun writing the app and even writing the docs. So much of my preference for Elixir is in the developer experience and how quickly I can ship changes with high confidence; all of the amazing performance and distributed aspects I may never need for my projects.')
