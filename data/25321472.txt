How many?<p><i>&quot;People sacrifice their lives to eat in restaurants...implicitly, when they drive a car to&#x2F;from and risk an auto accident. It is probably small numbers against small numbers&quot;</i><p>Like I said elsewhere in this thread, just the other day the US had over 3,000 COVID-19 deaths in a single day.  That doesn&#x27;t sound like a small number to me, and I&#x27;d be surprised if anywhere near that number of people died driving to a restaurant that day.<p><i>&quot;The poster didnâ€™t propose to ignore effects on the 70+...where did you read this?&quot;</i><p>Right.  They just happened to only quote the IFR rate for people &lt; 70 years old, and not mention the IFR for people 70 and older.  That sounds like they ignored them to me.')
