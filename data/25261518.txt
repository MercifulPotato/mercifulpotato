Thinking that the rapid gains being made by the current deep learning approaches will soon hit a wall is a reasonable outside-view prediction to make: nearly every time we&#x27;ve had a similarly transformative technology in the AI space and elsewhere, hitting the wall is exactly what happened. The onus would be on practitioners to show that this time really is different.<p>What a take. Neural networks just took a huge bite out of protein folding and your take is: This just in, the Deep Learning boom is about to go bust! Asinine.')
