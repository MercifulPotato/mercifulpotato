If you still want those -- and if you want it to replace cloud services, you do -- you&#x27;ll need to configure the VPN, which is an enormous hassle on both client and server. Also, sometimes there&#x27;s an update and it just stops working until you pay attention to it. Ditto for network shares, but I think the problem there is in Android &#x2F; iOS network filesystem implementations. It often Just Doesn&#x27;t Work, and then I try dropbox and it Just Works. Even when the NAS network share does work, managing permissions is a nightmare, even for simple setups, ditto storage, ditto the VM that theoretically runs nextcloud but in practice gets taken down by an update on a regular basis.<p>For my next NAS I&#x27;m going to try Synology, but they depend on many of the same open source projects that I&#x27;ve seen Just Not Working on the QNAP side, so I&#x27;m not terribly hopeful.<p>Nextcloud devices look promising in the long run but the market hasn&#x27;t shaken out yet so you&#x27;re either going to have to invest tons of time in research or you&#x27;re going to have to do trial and error. In both cases you&#x27;ll have to make up for deficiencies.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com&#x2F;devices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com&#x2F;devices&#x2F;</a>')
