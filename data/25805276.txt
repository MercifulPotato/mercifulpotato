I generally know if I&#x27;m doing a good job or being a load, and I don&#x27;t look to external support or denial of that. I prefer regular work reviews but I don&#x27;t need to hear it all the time. People are people and quite varied, some will think you&#x27;re doing a great job and never say a thing, others prefer to be &quot;positive&quot; and lay it on a bit thick. When I want an honest evaluation I just ask to please point out both the good and bad from my manager&#x2F;peer.')
