For example, there&#x27;s a town called Dingle in Ireland which is super beautiful and beloved by (mostly American) tourists.<p>Anyone who doesn&#x27;t already own a house there and works in any of the businesses is unable to rent, and they normally commute from one of the larger towns, 40-60 mins away (over pretty bad roads, up and down mountains). It&#x27;s gotten so bad that businesses are considering putting on buses for their staff.<p>And if you want to hear a 45 minute rant, mention AirBnB to anyone who lives in Santa Cruz and doesn&#x27;t own property :)')
