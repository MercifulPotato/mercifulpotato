It&#x27;s flashcards for vocabulary and writing. I was very excited about it a couple of years ago but then I stopped and now I&#x27;m the only one using it.<p>It&#x27;s written in go and postgresql and Vue, and right now its just running inside of a &quot;screen&quot; session in a terminal on Linode.')
