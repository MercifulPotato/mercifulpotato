It&#x27;s certainly possible now if it wasn&#x27;t then; people like Michael Feathers have done great work charting paths out of an accumulation of garbage code. But at the time of JWZ&#x27;s resignation letter, Martin Fowler&#x27;s book Refactoring had been out for all of 3 months.<p>In particular, Netscape was faced with a choice: they could either do a total rewrite quickly, or take much longer to do a slow rewrite while still pushing forward, but at a much reduced development speed. That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re some large enterprise in a stable field with a solid revenue stream. But a startup competing in the then-fast-evolving world of the Internet? Competing against the monopolistic giant of Microsoft, who was desperate to dominate the space?<p>There&#x27;s little reason to think a slow cleanup would have been any better than a fast rewrite for Netscape. Especially if their solution involved open-sourcing things, which a) requires a non-awful code base, and b) reduces the pace of refactoring and cleanup. So I think it&#x27;s fair to say that either way Netscape was killed by technical debt.')
