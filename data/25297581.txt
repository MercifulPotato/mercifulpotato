I stated to you that it wasn&#x27;t malware, and you said &quot;I know.&quot;<p>How can it possibly be fair to paint something as malware if you &quot;know&quot; it wasn&#x27;t? It&#x27;s not even &quot;like&quot; malware - the whole point of the software was to inject notices that Google wanted its employees to see when they visited sites. That&#x27;s the whole reason it exists!<p>Calling it &quot;basically [...] malware&quot; paints it as evil and bad by association, completely overlooking the fact that Google itself wanted that extension installed and the only thing done here was add another site to the list of sites that got a pop-up.<p>If you don&#x27;t agree with what was done, fine. But don&#x27;t call it a &quot;fair description&quot;; it&#x27;s not remotely fair.')
