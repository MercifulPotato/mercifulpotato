My grandfather also had it, and it&#x27;s terrifying to me that I might end up like him in 40 years or less. I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if I ever did get diagnosed with it. Unfortunately, my father refuses to discuss it and the possibility he might be at risk, even though he&#x27;s slowly getting closer to the age my grandfather was when he was diagnosed.')
