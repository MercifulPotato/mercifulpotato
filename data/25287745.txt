People optimize for who their customers are. Knowing what devices your code runs on is trivially easy, and so is measuring its performance against them. People aren’t going to instantaneously make their code 20x slower just because the new Apple chip is so good. But they’re also not going to optimize for that old Samsung phone that represent 0.0003% of their user base.')
