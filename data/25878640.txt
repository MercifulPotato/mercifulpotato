A ton of mental overhead: videos padded for time, clickbait titles and thumbnails, in video promotions, reminder to check their patreon, reminder to like and subscribe, interruptions for Google ads, etc, . All this adds up and makes you question if the time waste was worth the chance at maybe getting to view some decent content. A system where you are throwing a penny at somebody to unlock a video is preferable.')
