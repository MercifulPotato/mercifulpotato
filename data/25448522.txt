They agreed on a way forward, instead of full-stop condemning Facebook.<p>I’m curious, what are the City Council’s demands? Is there any way forward for Mark Zuckerberg, or is he definitively considered a supervillain by edict? I definitely don’t defend him, but it seems absurd for this condemnation to occur, especially in the context of a global pandemic.')
