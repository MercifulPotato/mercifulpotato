Selection and system clipboard integration.\n2. Ability to quickly scroll to look something without moving the cursor, then return where I was by pressing an arrow key (one of the largest pain points of emacs for me).\n3. Proportional fonts with proper text rendering, especially for notes.<p>I use 1 and 2 almost on a subconscious level, and it&#x27;s hard for me to be productive in an editor which doesn&#x27;t support these features. I&#x27;m sure, vim users can relate.')
