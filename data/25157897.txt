The gameplay itself is just.. different. Not the story or whatever but strictly the movement. What you wrote about vsync just hit me on another level. I remember playing  CS Source (don&#x27;t ask) and that was just awful, I still played it for hundreds of hours, but it just was not hitting it like before. I think there is a technical reason for it, because I turned on CS 1.6 in between these comments and the difference was noticeable immediately')
