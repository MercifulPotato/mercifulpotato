Here&#x27;s the problem I solved for myself and hopefully for others:<p>Problem:  \nAfter going down the rabbit hole of personal development a few years back, I found myself picking up hundreds of self-help&#x2F;business books in hopes of becoming a better version of myself. One book after the other my bookshelf became overwhelmed. I wanted to read more, but I couldn&#x27;t fit another book.<p>Solution:  \nI started to notice that books I&#x27;ve already read just sat on my shelves collecting dust for months. I could donate them to a local thrift store, but what if I could exchange them for books that I wanted to read. That&#x27;s when the idea for Biblo came to mind. I knew I most likely won&#x27;t ever read them again so why not trade my book with another reader for a book that I want to read. This way, I won&#x27;t exceed my book limit and I could continue to read topics I&#x27;m interested in. A classic win-win situation .<p>Why Use Biblo:  \n- It&#x27;s simple to get started. Just swipe left or right on available books  \n- Never buy another book again. Books can cost up to $25 which add up to large amounts overtime. By using Biblo, the cost of acquiring a new book is about ~$4 (the cost to ship your book). That means that for every new book you could have bought at your local book store, you can trade 6+ books on Biblo  \n- Save money on books  \n- Save the trees')
