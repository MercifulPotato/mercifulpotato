Item(by='Pfhreak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601850203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680483, text='&gt; Nope, you can go to prison without being arrested first if you showed up to court voluntarily.<p>Pretty sure you cannot just check yourself into prison by going to court. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong. I suppose there are certain crimes that can result in a summons to court that are detected by automated or research.<p>&gt; the cop canâ€™t even know if prison time is a realistic outcome.<p>When I don&#x27;t know the risk of a particular outcome, I generally need to consider it, which strengthens my original point. If cops aren&#x27;t sure whether someone will be incarcerated AND they aren&#x27;t considering the impact of incarceration, then we&#x27;ve got two problems.<p>&gt; It sounds like your beef is with state prosecutors...<p>If you don&#x27;t believe that prosecutors and police are strong, strong allies, I don&#x27;t know how much further we&#x27;re going to get. I literally commented on the relationship between prosecutors and police in the comment you are responding to.<p>&gt; You have yet to identify these problems though. What issues do you think the officers in Cody, WY have?<p>Scroll up, my previous comment had a list. It was, in fact, the sentence previous to the one you quoted.<p>I can sense you are perhaps angry or frustrated by my comments. If not, it certainly reads that way to me. Can we agree to continue without resorting to jabs at each other? (E.g. &quot;you just don&#x27;t understand the system well enough&quot; comes across as needlessly patronizing in a discussion that could otherwise be interesting.)')
