The patch in question disables the ability to fetch packages from online sources, requiring you to specify the URL of the required packages <i>and its hash</i> beforehand. Plus, it&#x27;s not even meant for general use and instead is meant to help with packaging for Nix. For general use, you can very easily use the unmodified build instead.')
