Forums were a more personal experience. Fewer people, shared interests, avatars.<p>Look at HN - how many commenters do you personally recognize, except for the ones that are popular because they&#x27;re part of YC (so for things outside of this discussion forum) or because they also submit articles they&#x27;re written (so again for things outside of this forum)?<p>I probably recognize maybe 10 people, and with the way this discussion forum is designed, I recognize them despite the software, not because of it.')
