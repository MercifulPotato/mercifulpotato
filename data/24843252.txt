That a 48 port witch with ~10% of the ports in use doesn&#x27;t overheat and isn&#x27;t even spinning its fans at max when in a garage in Texas in the summer isn&#x27;t really surprising. It isn&#x27;t surprising in the same way that a modern desktop or notebook system in the same environment not overheating in if all you de is power it on and let it idle is is not surprising.<p>Start using a significant portion of the switching backplane capacity and see how well it does then though.  That would be a much more interesting result, whether the device succeeds or fails.')
