The 9th Circuit did not hold that fair use was a right in that case (the dancing baby case), only that a copyright holder must consider whether the alleged violation was potentially fair use before filing a lawsuit.<p>Importantly, the copyright holder is only required to <i>consider</i> whether the violation is fair use. They can still decide that it is not, and proceed with their lawsuit, with the only additional effort required being to state in their claim that they considered fair use and decided that the violation was not fair use.<p>(Note: while the 9th Circuit precedent is limited to the West Coast of the US, because most tech companies are HQ&#x27;d in CA or WA, so as a practical matter this case governs the internet.)')
