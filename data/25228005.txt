I feel like the most valid &quot;post code&quot; would just be the name of the postman they should ask if they&#x27;re not sure.<p>But I have to call out Ryanair in this context.  For many years, before eircode, they demanded a postcode on their payment page.  An Irish company, serving Irish customers, demanded postcodes when most the country didn&#x27;t have them.<p>(And I paypal still believes my postcode is null.  I don&#x27;t recall ever entering that, so I wonder where&#x2F;when it derived that.)')
