I always thought of myself as handy with cars though, not necessarily of heavenly origin. In fact, one person whose car I repaired with a leatherman and a coke can as my complete toolset and materials store thought I was a miracle worker. (I hope that fix held up until he got home...).<p>More seriously though, people who are that far into religion will see &#x27;the hand of god&#x27; in just about every normal phenomenon, my paternal grandmother was one of those and she deeply believed all these things to be true, even when there were perfectly ordinary explanations for them. That never stopped us from getting along just fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t press her on such items because her world was fragile enough as it was.<p>Religion is comfort food for the mind, and if someone needs their &#x27;angels in human form&#x27; then maybe we should just let them.')
