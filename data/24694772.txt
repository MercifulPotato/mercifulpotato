And a lot of websites use highly different font sizes, and layouts without sidebars or with sidebars of varying widths. Combine those facts, and you&#x27;ll see that if people tried to size their browser window to the desired width, they would have to resize it every time they switched tabs to a different website. Not ideal: it&#x27;s better if sites include styles to default to a readable column width given their own specific layout.')
