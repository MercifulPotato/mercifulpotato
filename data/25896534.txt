This is hinted at in the article by saying &quot;easy distribution&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t really discussed.<p>The goal of open source is to create a market for the product that is 10x or 100x bigger than a proprietary product would have. You won&#x27;t ever capture 100% of the market. But if you capture a fraction of that larger market you still come out far ahead of the proprietary product in which you capture close to 100% of the market.<p>Probably there are some products for which the market is finite or open source won&#x27;t make it bigger, and for those the scarcity based viewpoint of this article makes sense.<p>It is also worth noting that Red Hat has shown that open source doesn&#x27;t require distributing your product for free.\nAnother note is that many companies today take an open core approach to try to gain some of the advantages of open source without all of the downsides.')
