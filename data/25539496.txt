Statistics are still predicting growth in IT and software development. And looking at how tooling has evolved, yes in some ways it is now a little easier to create a 1995 style website, BUT websites have become super complicated and now it is the full time job of somebody to work on just the front-end. A 2020 website still takes a lot of effort to produce, in fact definitely much more effort than a 1995 website.<p>Secondly you mention a bunch of fields, some of which I have experience with. These more fundamental fields have little demand, and because of that the pay is relatively bad. If you go work at Intel writing NLA libraries using Fourier Transforms, you would be lucky to get paid market average salaries and certainly much worse salaries than doing generic SWE stuff at FAANG.<p>And thirdly, honestly you won&#x27;t be able to transition into these more technical fields because it is just too much of a steep learning curve. And nobody would hire you anyway. There&#x27;s no shortage of graduates fresh out of uni with multiple semesters of theory, practical projects and internships.<p>The actual way to prepare would be as always: maximize your salary and save as much as possible.')
