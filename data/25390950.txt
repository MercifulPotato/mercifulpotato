I grew up in a below-middle-class family raised by my widowed mom. My dad passed away when I was 12. I have two younger siblings.<p>As I look back on the last ~40 years of my life, it&#x27;s mostly about struggles sprinkled with brief periods of joy lasting no more than a couple of days at most. Most of the time, I&#x27;m studying to get good grades so that I can get scholarships, without which I&#x27;d not be able to go to college; helping my widowed mom with her chores (including taking care of younger siblings) because she is occupied with making money to survive; and even now that I&#x27;m an adult with a stable income, I spend most of my time working for someone (selling my 8+ hours a day to my employer) while worrying about if I&#x27;ll have enough money saved by mid-50s when I hope to be able to enjoy life a little more (e.g., going on vacations) with some spare money to spend.<p>All I&#x27;m trying to say is that life is a struggle for most people (the poorer family you were born into, the truer that statement becomes). We never have moments of peace because we have things to worry about constantly. I&#x27;d never bring another human being into this mess unless I can have a discussion with my future progeny before s&#x2F;he is conceived (which is, of course, impossible). In other words, unless some ghost&#x2F;spirit is begging me to let him&#x2F;her incarnate because s&#x2F;he see value in this rat race, I&#x27;d not make this decision one-sidedly.<p>As a tangential note, I am a strong proponent of euthanasia and hope that one day, it&#x27;ll be commonly accepted by the society.')
