On Mac I ended up using Audacity for cropping audio files, ffmpeg (cli) to compress it, and used either ffmpeg or Handbrake for transcoding. I don&#x27;t remember what I used for pdf page split&#x2F;combine, but I do remember that it was a pain.<p>Honest question - as I still use Mac occasionally, it&#x27;d be great to know what are those builtin tools so I can actually use the features the OS has.')
