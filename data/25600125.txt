Would you want to hold some amount of currency A throughout the year to ensure you could pay that debt?  I suppose you could argue that you&#x27;d buy some currency swaps or somesuch, but most people would just hold that currency.<p>Remember the Asian Financial Crisis, when a bunch of the &quot;tigers&quot; had loans denominated in USD, Francs, etc., and then there was a big capital outflow, tanking their local currencies against those debts?  People will want to make sure they don&#x27;t float against the currency they owe.')
