This interpretation seems to me like an attempt by you to fit the data into this non-fitting notion that everything is based on psychomotor processing, because your mind is in love with this idea. And it&#x27;s a beautiful idea, I agree. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most truthful one in this space.<p>&gt;  (NB. political correctness is here just a regulation on how we socially coordinate).<p>The question was, how specifically is it rooted in motor cortex or psychomotor functions? To explain that you will likely have to widen the definition of &quot;psychomotor&quot; to such an extent that it would lose all its useful meaning. Which is exactly one of the signs, for me personally, that your theory is only making very limited sense with regards to everything we know about brains and minds and behavior of consciousness. That it&#x27;s a beautiful theory that unfortunately too thin to fit the real world in it.<p>You touched on an interesting thing regarding AGI. In the purely practical sense, I see that a lot of people have taken this apparent rule(or a &quot;universal truth&quot;) of making an AGI that says &quot;a mind requires a body to even function or be able to be aware&quot;-thing. People think it means actual bodies. In reality they can very likely be implemented as virtual bodies or just address spaces that can interact with their environment in an adressable way. Thus, a &quot;body&quot; is just a part of the AGI, a computation structured in a certain way to make sure the rest of it works properly. Like a generator in a GAN network.<p>In very simple terms, the machines&#x27; bodies can be just avatars in some video game, it would be enough to satisfy the requirement of the aforementioned rule, if game connects all the inputs in the correct way.')
