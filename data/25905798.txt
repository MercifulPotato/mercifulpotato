The problem I noticed is that I never really have time to go back to my notes unless I am searching for something specifically. Linear notes with a date usually help me locate the info I am looking for.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering, how do people review their notes? When? Are they using a strategy for this? Also I&#x27;m not really looking to commit to memory my notes.')
