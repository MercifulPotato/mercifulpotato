I&#x27;ve skimmed your thesis in preparation for reading it closely and I&#x27;ve seen enough to recognize it as beautiful. This recent work too.<p>I started thinking about bezier curves in the ... &#x27;80s? &#x27;90s? – as a child I was basically raised at my grandmother&#x27;s graphic design office in front of Macintosh computers. I had the Adobe Illustrator pen tool in my hands as a child and later, FreeHand&#x27;s bezigon tool.<p>The hyperbezier pen tool is beautifully natural to use (&quot;This is it!&quot;) – I&#x27;m also very glad that I&#x27;ve almost by chance learned enough mathematics to grasp how it works and how it was arrived at. Just barely. And I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m going to learn more math and understand it more completely.')
