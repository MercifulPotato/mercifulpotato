If anyone can prove me wrong, or give a single other example as to why Apple should not be trusted, please do.<p>I have no doubt that this is an obvious walled garden problem, where the gardener is held responsible if an app is seemingly used to cause damage. However, claiming that the gardener was held responsible <i>by an oppressive power</i> seems to be a leap in this case.<p>First, if they were, one would assume that (A) the app would not have been reinstanted in App Store a couple days later, and (B) E2E-encrypted messengers such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram would have been taken off HK App Store, as groups there were used as the source of much more up-to-date information.<p>Second, considering the political split within Hong Kong population itself, I don’t doubt that a significant portion of citizens in fact reported this app to Apple at their own volition.<p>Third, on a more sentimental note, I was on location and have seen first hand the destruction of property when the police were known to be away. It can be legitimately distressing no matter how much one supports the democracy.<p>In fact, it is far from clear to me that the most extreme instances of such destruction were in fact initiated by honest pro-democracy protesters. At the time they seemed to pretty obviously play into CCP’s hand, alienating more politically neutral HKers from the freedom movement, and as time has shown they were used by Beijing as an excuse to force a new security law on Hong Kong.<p>Bear in mind that genuinely peaceful pro-democracy protests—attended by many thousands of people—did not require police evasion apps.<p>* * *<p>I don’t see how it can be concluded based on facts available that Apple has violated the trust so far, and for the more casual user trusting Apple seems undoubtedly a more reliable bet than trusting their own infosec faculties.<p>That said, it’s true that the level of trust required makes Apple hardware unsuitable for users with extremely heightened security needs.')
