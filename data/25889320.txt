A lot of those banking jobs don&#x27;t exist anymore.<p>Any job that can be WFH will be easy to outsource. You aren&#x27;t need in office so why do we even need you in this time zone? Outsource it cheap. If it really is manageable from a 30 min standup and Jira then why even bother with expensive devs?<p>Before you had a small competitive market in a central location. Now you&#x27;re opening it up.<p>On top of that, remote work I find is starting to bleed over. I have meetings well past 5 now, quite often. I get messaged late and early. Whereas with the office it was different. People respected boundaries much more. Fully remote workforces lead to a lot more timezone issues as well.<p>I like flex time. I want to be able to work from home when I want to, but also want to go into the office for many things that are easier to do as a group.')
