It is cheaper to buy an off the shelf GPU than it is to buy an ASIC.<p>You also have to factor in the fact that the latest GPUs are not necessarily the best ROI. If you can get lower speed GPUs for a fraction of the cost, then your return on that is much faster. Of course, that is starting to change now that mining is becoming so profitable again. But regardless, you are still tied to GPUs, so anything you can get there is good.')
