They&#x27;re saying that selling rich people overpriced kale and strawberries can fund further research and innovation. Maybe the next step is corn. Maybe it&#x27;s bankruptcy. But it has cash flow to invest in the research to see which one it is, in part from growing and selling the less impactful stuff now.<p>Something about vertical farms for staple foods just doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test.  One big aspect of farming is the conversion of solar energy to edible chemical energy.  Assuming natural plants and some efficient way of using natural light, stacking farmland vertically just means less energy per acre.  And barring some new kind of clean energy like fusion, using artificial light will just introduce conversion inefficiencies and expense, at best.')
