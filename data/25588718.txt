As someone who learned games programming in Flash, and loved Flash, and benefited quite a bit from it -- no, you couldn&#x27;t just email someone an SWF. That never worked.<p>Nobody had a standalone Flash player installed that wasn&#x27;t in a browser, and when I moved to newer versions of Flash, I would regularly run into problems where someone would have a Flash player that didn&#x27;t support the stuff I was trying to do.<p>Flash was really important for its time, and I agree there are things I still miss about it that the web hasn&#x27;t been able to replicate. But my goodness, as someone who uses Linux today, I can&#x27;t express how glad I am that the websites that never worked on my Linux machines now <i>do</i> work on my Linux machines. Cross platform my butt, Flash was only ever &quot;cross platform&quot; on Windows, and occasionally on Mac. Everybody else on mobile and Linux got ignored because Flash was a proprietary blob of insecure DRM-riddled code and Adobe couldn&#x27;t be bothered to give anyone any attention unless they were big enough that they were impossible to ignore. Yes, I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed that the web hasn&#x27;t captured everything Flash did, but it is <i>good</i> that we have gotten rid of Flash because mobile and Linux users deserve to have a version of the web that works on their machines.<p>These people who are lauding Flash as a universal environment either just have rose-tinted glasses or they lived in an even smaller programming bubble than the one they accuse HTML advocates of inhabiting.')
