The second to <i>values</i> (how we arrive at judgements).<p>There&#x27;s a fair argument that values might need to be less rigorously arrived at but more tightly helf.  Many values are beyond proof and more closely resemble axioms or premises.  Even here <i>some</i> inclination to revise assessments might be warranted.  E.g., &quot;kill, if necessary to save your or another&#x27;s life from one killing unjustly&quot;.  Moral absolutes are  hard to find.<p>Interesting thought though.')
