Item(by='qdot76367', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609209886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565797, text='It&#x27;s not really a technical reason as much as it is personal.<p>It&#x27;s not C&#x2F;C++ because I loathe C&#x2F;C++, and if I never write C&#x2F;C++ again, it will be too soon. The reasons for these feelings are borne out of decades of experience with them.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m currently an embedded engineer again at the moment, so &quot;never&quot; is actually &quot;every day&quot; unfortunately. Luckily embedded Rust is really looking good these days, and I&#x27;ve been using it a bit lately.<p>I don&#x27;t really care about what other libraries do, and really, Buttplug isn&#x27;t your normal &quot;hardware driver&quot; library. Either way, other libraries made their choices, I made mine. I hate C&#x2F;C++ enough that I&#x27;d never spend my free time on it, and this is basically my back yard shed project that also happens to be a business, so it gets done with technologies I&#x27;m comfortable in.<p>As for exposing things, I mention that C&#x2F;C++ FFI is coming in the post, mostly for Unreal Engine support. I currently have Rust exposing cdecl calls for the FFI, but it&#x27;s bottlenecked to be as few calls as possible, mostly flinging protobufs back and forth because that&#x27;s easy. The main thing holding up C&#x2F;C++ FFI is figuring out how to translate some of the async paradigms I use to C&#x2F;C++ in a way that will be generally useful.')
