I&#x27;ll flip it the other way as a European Brit visiting the US.<p>Homes:  You have an entire continent, with only 400 years of (European) habitation, so you have a <i>lot</i> of space.  Your home building is also largely after the invention of the motor car.  In Europe we have, are, and will, walk everywhere.  So everything is closer together, and so are the houses.<p>Food:  not quite sure what the issue is with European food, but as a European in the US, I&#x27;m astonished at how little fresh food and meat there is.  If it&#x27;s wrapped in plastic, I have no idea how old it is.  Ugh.  If I ask a butcher for a cut of meat, I know that meat has only been hung for a certain time, and on display for a certain time.  Similar fruit and vegetables, and fish, and bread and so on.  A massive bag of chips, or a gallon of high fructose corn syrup is not an achievement.<p>And then car sizes.  European roads are historically dictated by horse and cart.  In the US, you have Eisenhower and the freeways... after the invention of cars.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the USA.  I&#x27;ve spent about 5 years of my life, cumulatively in the USA.  I think the European fantasy, is seeing America, and realising (from a European perspective), how much the USA could benefit from doing some European things.  I want to just walk to the shops, or cycle down the road.<p>High speed rail would be an absolute game changer for you guys.  Connecting up SF and LA, or NY and Phili, but you (or rather your politicians) just don&#x27;t get it.')
