At this stage nobody actually needs your product so you&#x27;ll have to do it by hook or by crook.<p>* If you&#x27;re post-product&#x2F;market fit then people actually _need_ your business. Once you make it clear that you&#x27;re going to action on their feedback they&#x27;re highly incentivized to help you out – so use the same strategies as above but make it clear what you&#x27;ll use the feedback for.<p>* Set up automated surveys, especially ones that are unobtrusive in order to not create a shitty user experience – this allows you to baseline your product&#x27;s effectiveness which is the first step towards continuous iteration. Eg last quarter we were at 3.3&#x2F;5 satisfaction, let&#x27;s get to 4.0&#x2F;5 this quarter. These surveys are also a great way to find customers to interview.<p>* FullStory and Hotjar both allow you to view user sessions, highly recommend them as well.<p>The most important point: if you&#x27;re an enterprise business, I highly recommend identifying the &quot;best&quot; customers that you have, building relationships with them, and favoring their guidance over others&#x27;. Once you hit scale all of your customers will want to give you feedback, but only some of them will have the wisdom&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;creativity&#x2F;whatever to have a great sense for what _you_ should build for _your_ business to succeed. When you find these customers, get them onto a customer advisory board &#x2F; meet with them a lot as they will help you in the art of pulling a great product out of your market.')
