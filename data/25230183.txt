In my previous job I only cycled 7 km, it was easy and took about 15 mins. Then when I changed job my commute was 18 km, it was manageable, and better than the two infrequent buses I would have to try and catch but you would be pretty tired at the end of the week. It would take between 45 and 55 minutes depending on weather and traffic.<p>We recently bought our first home and this meant we had to move a little further away resulting in my current 25 km commute. The 90 minute bus trip is exhausting and you arrive at work and return home groggy.<p>On my ebike I can get to work in 50 minutes and still feel like Iâ€™ve exercised without depleting too much energy.')
