The benefits of the specialization are much, much less than expected, and the costs of being custom very high.<p>Instead, they gave the machine large caches and tweaked a few general purpose features so they work particularly well for their preferred workloads.<p>I wonder if they made trap on overflow after arithmetic fast.')
