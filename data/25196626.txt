Whether those bugs are a major blocker for people to use them or not should be taken into account.<p>The issue that you pointed out are difficult items which need more time and thought to take care of. But they aren&#x27;t something which should cause any major pain in your day-to-day usage of Go. I would say as of 1.15, GC has improved by leaps and bounds and at this point, all major warts with the system are taken care of.<p>But then again, I don&#x27;t know in what context you are using Go. It may be the case that you have been affected by any of these bugs, and unless they get fixed, using Go is a blocker for you.')
