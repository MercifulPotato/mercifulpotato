Other TEs, in order to increase their chances of winning the drag race, will skip updates they think you won&#x27;t see. This can be enabled via a command-line option or X resource in xterm, but makes xterm less compatible.<p>* comes with every Linux or BSD distro and works fast on nearly any graphics adapter')
