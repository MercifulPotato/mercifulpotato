So if those genetic variants are correlated with COVID outcomes, then we say it&#x27;s because of Vitamin D. Notice the problem? You need to assume that the genetics do <i>not</i> affect anything else except via Vitamin D. Now I think that&#x27;s where this is very tricky: they&#x27;re identified variants that predispose someone to high&#x2F;low Vitamin D via a genome-wide study, i.e. just check everything for correlation with Vitamin D. The obvious problem is that correlation isn&#x27;t causation so some or most or all of those variants will influence other factors too, and it becomes harder to say that Vitamin D is the reason COVID was severe or not. Ideally you have instead hand-picked variants with obvious known mechanisms as to how they affect Vitamin D metabolism, say. In lieu of that, you have to do various tests that try to spot how problematic this problem is. (Look for &quot;pleiotropy&quot; in the paper. Back-causation is the other problem you need to consider generally, but it&#x27;s not really a concern here.)<p>Personally I don&#x27;t trust those tests further than I can throw them as they make some questionable assumptions. The main method this paper uses is MR-Egger, which (IIRC) assumes that the non-Vitamin D ways the variants affect the outcome are inconsistent across different variants. Like, this variant might act on Vitamin D and immune system but this other one acts on Vitamin D and your cardiac system so we don&#x27;t expect the non-Vitamin D portion to be consistent. That seems highly questionable, even I would expect the typical state to not be that, where variants that affect Vitamin D are likely in pathways that also affect specific, consistent other attributes. The authors are aware of these difficulties. I can&#x27;t assess whether they&#x27;ve succeeded in addressing them or not, but I believe the problem is extremely difficult and they have an up-hill battle.')
