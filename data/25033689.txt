I know from my own experience that it&#x27;s harder to laugh off these kind of things if you feel they&#x27;re more pervasive in society than just one idiot. Of course, it&#x27;s hard to draw good conclusions from anecdotes but they&#x27;re still evidence of prejudice that too many are too quick to dismiss.<p>&gt;  I rarely noticed cops hanging out near us when we are in mostly white group.<p>I heard something similar from a mixed race footballer in the UK (where I&#x27;m from). Again, it&#x27;s difficult to draw conclusions but these things add up. Part of the problem is how to measure or validate things like this in such a way that they become persuasive to change.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again, or the good far outweighs the bad (which may be all we can hope for in life!)')
