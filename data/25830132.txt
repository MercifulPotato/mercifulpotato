Item(by='rgbrenner', descendants=None, kids=[25832889], score=None, time=1611031967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829255, text='The US uses a common law legal system.. meaning the law isn&#x27;t just what it says.. it&#x27;s also how it&#x27;s interpreted by judges and how it has been interpreted in the past.<p>You&#x27;re arguing that we should use a civil law legal system... but you&#x27;re several hundred years too late for that debate... and it has no relevance to this question.<p>So back to the interpretation: If this case went to the supreme court, why do you believe they would say: welp guess you&#x27;re free? They also have the ability to say: Since the constitution says what it says, the court districts must be redrawn, and therefore the defendant must be tried in the redrawn Idaho district court. That&#x27;s the way it would be solved by the legislature, and that&#x27;s the way the court is going to force it to be resolved if the legislature doesn&#x27;t.. because at no point did the legislature intend for a piece of land to be outside of our laws. An oversight is not intention.')
