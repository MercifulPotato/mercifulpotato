The damages from retaliation by members of the elite NSA club, and their military-industrial cronies, could be HUGE.<p>Are we willing to live in that sort of society?<p>This is not a good basis of support for State Secrecy - which has, incidentally, <i>ALWAYS</i> been a corrupting influence in every single society which makes it a keystone policy of conduct.<p>Secrets are corruption.
