Item(by='crocodiletears', descendants=None, kids=[25805139, 25804976], score=None, time=1610826490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804667, text='The current information hygiene and media literacy curriculum as I understand it leans heavily on using &#x27;reputable sources&#x27;. This is well and good until those sources start to lose their reputability by publishing stories that stretch credulity (WaPo and the NYT with their &#x27;anonymous intelligence sources familiar with the thinking of people near the matter&#x27;), become increasingly partisan, or simply appear too selective in their coverages with the benefit of hindsight. Noticing these things invalidates the majority of the curriculum in a student&#x27;s mind, and leaves them unequipped to deal with the beasts wandering the information wilderness.<p>If I were to reform this, I&#x27;d place greater emphasis on information composition, and source&#x2F;author auditing. Acknowledge that mainstream publications often miss things that less reputable outlets will cover (albeit poorly), and teach students to think in degrees of certainty.')
