You&#x27;re looking for a specific niche codebase, whose authoratative source has disappeared, and end up at a non-authoratiative archive. That&#x27;s Google on hard mode. If you knew you wanted the reference converter, a more specific Google search would have worked:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=ttf2+to+woff+reference+converter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=ttf2+to+woff+reference+conve...</a><p>A more in-depth research effort into the solution space also turned up things like FontForge and github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;woff2, neither of which showed up in the GitHub results, but depending on your use-case are likely to have been compelling options.<p>I think it&#x27;s more important to use FOSS infrastructure for FOSS projects than it is for those projects to turn up in a search result. I also think that projects can and should market themselves in a manner which extends beyond appearing in search results. However, I do acknowledge that GitHub search can be useful. I have been thinking about letting you link up repositories hosted on not-sr.ht for your sr.ht projects, which are indexed here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sr.ht&#x2F;projects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sr.ht&#x2F;projects</a><p>So you could, for example, have a GitHub repository, a GitLab repository, and a sr.ht mailing list, all under the same project, indexed in one place. This would go a long way towards establishing a single list of FOSS projects. It would be centralized at first, but I have also been thinking about using RSS to federate the project list across many independent sr.ht installations: centralization gone.')
