You are a (free) developer trying to get your crypto library FIPS 140 certified. You want to do this because it is the US Federal standard for properly implemented crypto and it is hard to use in the Federal space without it. Ignoring the fact that you need a third party lab to validate your work, you quickly hit a documentation problem.<p>FIPS standards are publicly available on NIST. That&#x27;s great. But they in turn reference lots of other documents and expect you to follow the latest version of those documents. That is fine as long as other NIST documents are referenced. However references to ISO and ANSI documents do slip in. Each of those documents is a few hundred dollars a piece. You must comply with the contents of those documents in order to be certified. As a free developer, you now have a non-free documentation problem.')
