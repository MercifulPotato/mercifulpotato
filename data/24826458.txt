VIC-20 was the first computer to sell 1 million units.<p>Regardless, this article is 1978, before the VIC-20 or C64 came out.<p>The TRS-80 was, by far, the best selling of the 1977 Trinity. This was because it had the lowest price and it was readily available from Radio Shack stores. Commodore had trouble producing the PET and the inclusion of the monitor and tape drive made it have a higher price.')
