This is the first messenger RNA .. thing (this isn&#x27;t a vaccine; not like any attenuated or inactivated virus vaccines that have come before it. This is something very different in the way it works). There are no Longitudinal studies. This will be a significant increased risk for people under 40.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t see to fast track any drug, vaccine or treatment outside of the normal process. I wish the inhaled steroid controlled studies had completed because I was curious of that would have been a useful treatment (a lot of doctors are using them off label) and we wouldn&#x27;t need something this untested.<p>Fast tracking medications is how mistakes are made. Let&#x27;s be critical of how these emergency powers are used.')
