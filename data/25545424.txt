We have advanced long from the Audi 200 days to where part-time AWD is as simple as $700 in parts (for my car).<p>4WD (4x4) is full time (typically selectable but cannot be changed while in motion). 4WD has a greater gear ratio to really put power to the wheels that have grip, so while all 4WD cars can be considered AWD, AWD cannot be considered 4WD.  Iâ€™m sure some jeep owner can give a better rundown on why 4WD is named the way it is..')
