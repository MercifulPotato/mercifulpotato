The article is specifically talking about cases where experts are incorrect within their field of expertise and then cited as a source of truth in published papers.<p>Yes.<p>But I still think that Linus is a good character to discuss within the scope of the article. Linus is clearly considered an expert, and many people follow his bombastic words (retweeting, or using them to form the basis of their argument around here).<p>&quot;Because Linus said so&quot; is a common way to end various arguments. Linus&#x27;s opinion is truly &quot;expert&quot;, people copy it without further analysis because... well... Linus kinda deserves it. He is an expert after all.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean Linus is always right.<p>--------<p>The &quot;feedback loop&quot; of the open source world is pretty quick. If you&#x27;re a bad programmer, people figure it out when they start working with your code.<p>But the &quot;feedback loop&quot; of &quot;chip ISA opinions&quot; is slow. There&#x27;s not really any way to prove, or disprove, whether or not AVX512 is a good or bad idea.<p>Linus&#x27;s expertise in programming doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to chip ISA design. And as such, Linus can get details (expected power-characteristics of future chips) dramatically wrong.')
