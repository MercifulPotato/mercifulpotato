Also taught myself a couple more tech skills in the 2 months post-certificate before I got hired, but nothing special. Applied to several dozen jobs a week (easy to do when most don&#x27;t follow up in any way...)<p>Went from about spot-on median salary for the US prior to switching into tech, to 50% more in my first role. In my first 3 years I increased my income over 400%, though I also switched from salaried to contract, so it end up about 300% increase for net pay.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t have been able to afford a CS degree, in terms of either money or time, so it was a huge opportunity for me to  go the bootcamp route. Have moved up into a senior&#x2F;lead position, as well, so all the late nights of working on my skills post-bootcamp (and still while working, even now!) seem to have paid off.<p>But I don&#x27;t know what the market in Europe is like.
