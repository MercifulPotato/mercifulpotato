I&#x27;d say this is worse than people disliking the product. If it&#x27;s the latter it can be improved!<p>Thank you for the time taken to provide your view about the website and the product, really appreciate it!<p>Based on your comments, we will try to better convey the value of the device describing more specific use cases. I was afraid the sim card and the internet connectivity wasn&#x27;t well explained so we will improve that too and will add more information about he company. We didn&#x27;t focus too much on the privacy policy as we are just starting but will definitely get it fixed. \nFinally, about the weird places of the OBD2 port in some vehicles, we are aware of that fact, this is the reason why we will be shipping the devices with an extension cable included in the set.<p>Thanks again for your honest review!')
