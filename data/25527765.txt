Whenever one adopts a dog that is not a puppy you have to be ready for anything. You don’t know their past experience or if they were socialized with children or other pets.<p>Some dogs do have a very high prey drive and may see small animals &#x2F; children instinctively as prey. Typically this can be socialized out at puppyhood, but for some dogs it may require constant reinforcement. If it is not addressed at puppyhood it may always be an issue and the dog just won’t be suitable to have around babies and small pets.')
