If I made a wrong decision it was still the only thing that could have happened. ANd probably it was even the best choice at the time.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to change as a person, but for me it&#x27;s like this:<p>I&#x27;m OK with being average in some ways and I don&#x27;t have to be remembered either. I enjoy life while it lasts, I don&#x27;t have big plans, I don&#x27;t collect many keepsakes. I simply optimize for being a decent being and enjoying life (life of course washes you elsewhere sometimes).<p>If I die tomorrow it will be a bit short, but I had a good run I guess. I try not to waste thoughts on things I can&#x27;t influence.<p>In the end nobody wants to die, it&#x27;s a always a tragedy and even fear might get to me, but as long as I have no reason to believe my end is near I&#x27;ll be fine.<p>About the aging body: I&#x27;m fine as long as I don&#x27;t have too much pain and I&#x27;m still sharp in the mind. For pain: I guess morphine will do in the worst case, so that&#x27;s a solved issue. For a deteriorating mind: I hope there will be a cure against alzheimers, but if it&#x27;s coming I might plan an exit strategy and try to execute it while I still can.<p>The only thing that does bother me a lot: pissing a way my life with a full time job. But even that: has to be right now, can change, I&#x27;m working towards that.')
