I would definitely put this in the premature optimization bucket.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter nowadays anyway, because now I write my for-each loops like:<p><pre><code>  for (let elem : arr) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  arr.foreach(elem =&gt; { ... });\n</code></pre>\n(Well, technically now I write Android &amp; C++ code and do leadership&#x2F;communication stuff, but I brushed up on my ES6 before getting the most recent job.)')
