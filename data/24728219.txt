It was an interesting article though.<p>I come away with the impression that this is someone whose work has fulfilled him, and he is someone who doesn&#x27;t seek the benefits or potential paths that many people would try to exploit success for.<p>He&#x27;s not using his name to seek fame, be really highly regarded, or make great wealth from it.  His work just has happened to give him some of that as a side benefit in his mind.   I wouldn&#x27;t even say &quot;he&#x27;s made it in life&quot; in the traditional way you might say about someone who reached monetary satisfaction.   He seems to have reached the fulfillment of his purpose in life, and that is kind of refreshing.<p>Not satisfying for fans, but refreshing.  And maybe he&#x27;s right that some of the negative reaction to this kind of perspective shows exactly the stress and &quot;badness&quot; of fame that creates a sense of entitlement among your appreciators.<p>Today it seems that every media&#x2F;IG&#x2F;whoever is seeking the likes (even you or I do a little of this every time you post something, right)?   And the dopamine hit, or doors that it opens to new, interesting things, which probably turn out to be less interesting after a while, or result in more stress after you see what it is you&#x27;re really pursuing.<p>Great for him to have reached this point in life -- although as I said, unsatisfying for his fans.  Maybe it is an aspect of the human condition that when you&#x27;ve reached satisfaction in life, you actually become a bit disappointing to others -- exactly because you no longer feel the need to engage in the behavior to be an excitement, inspiration, false role model to them.  I wonder if he at least plays that role for his friends or family, the ones who he does want to expend that mental energy on?')
