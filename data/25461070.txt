It&#x27;s not an unlimited license. The idea is that it counters prevailing culture, and is funny because of that. It&#x27;s almost self-deprecating.<p>But there isn&#x27;t much of a pop culture of Christian values today. All positive messges about Christians are supressed in pop culture. The elite are largely secular or keep their religion very quiet and personal (except for politicians from districts where Christianity is a political advantage).<p>I don&#x27;t think punching up really applies in this context. Laughs about Christians feel more exclusionary and negative... more like &quot;let&#x27;s laugh at that idiot&quot; than a positive &quot;I see some of that character in myself, haha&quot;.')
