For example, if I want to know if I should wear a raincoat, I check the weather.  I don&#x27;t worry about every storm around the globe.  Periodically, I&#x27;ll check for storms in the winter.  If a large system &#x2F; blizzard is coming, I&#x27;ll make provisions.<p>I would apply the same to Covid-19, but there is a catch.  Policymakers are making decisions in real time to respond to a crisis.  Its apparent they are being swayed by interest groups that want to protect their businesses and rationalize the impact to public health.  I am torn by this, because I don&#x27;t want to be glued to the news, however it is necessary to hold politicians accountable for the factions they are currying favor for.<p>This however, doesn&#x27;t require 24&#x2F;7 coverage.  I can at least research the news on a weekly basis and do what I can with that.  Stay informed for the next election, sign letters, etc.')
