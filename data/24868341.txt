Whether SSRIs are helpful or not, I&#x27;m always surprised by the lack of awareness of side effects and the fact that the medical system is simply not equipt to help you in dealing with discontinuation. ACT therapy, for instance, has been immensely beneficial in reframing my own mental health issues (Anxiety being primary), and I get the added bonus of not having to treat the side effects of my side effects&#x27; side effects, which is kind of a relief...having witnessed the fallout of this drug or that when taken chronically for years and the little help that can be given at that point; chemical imbalance indeed.')
