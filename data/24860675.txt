When extracted, everyone could impersonate the app. If you don&#x27;t understand the problem then don&#x27;t downvote<p>This isn&#x27;t correct. Native apps aren&#x27;t capable of holding a secret. There are two patterns here. Some providers omit the secret for native apps. Other providers define the concept of a &quot;public secret,&quot; a value that is &quot;not a secret,&quot; but is put in the client_secret field - rotating this value disables old clients. Either model is fine and secure.<p>The problems you refer to were mostly just developer error. Developers registered their native apps as having confidential secrets, even though this was not the case, and then shipped those secrets in the app source code.')
