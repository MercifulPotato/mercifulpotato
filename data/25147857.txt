You give me your data, you get nothing in return, thanks very much.<p>Besides, I&#x27;m still bewildered it&#x27;s legal to even collect contact data without that contact consenting to the exchange of that information.<p>If I give $person my $number, I do NOT consent to 50 $people getting that data (Google et al). I no longer even have a reachable phone number since it&#x27;s not worth the privacy trade offs as that data is no longer under my control. At least emails afford a bit better control.<p>We need to majorly rethink how data is exchanged between user and service, and if a smartphone has APIs to access contact information, they&#x27;re smart enough to let me know which person uploaded my PII (so I can cuss at them!).')
