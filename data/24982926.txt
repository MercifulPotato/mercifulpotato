I&#x27;ve had success with these kinds of tests, but only for very simple external services. For example, writing a fake elasticsearch backend for a few known inputs and outputs might be a good fit. But what about an RDBMS? You can&#x27;t realistically write a mock backend that can talk to a real client.')
