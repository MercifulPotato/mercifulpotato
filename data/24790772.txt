While the 50G is more powerful (newer), the 28S is my favorite.<p>For programming custom functions the full keyboard is a lot more convenient. The 50G is too cramped, so it was hard to get into programming it, just too inconvenient whereas the 28S was a joy.<p>Love the clamshell. When using it for programming I lay it flat on the desk fully open. When using it purely as a calculator, flip it backwards and use handheld.<p>The build quality (except the battery door of course) also feels better. The 50G keys don&#x27;t have the classic HP feel anymore.<p>The only real complaint I had of the 28S was not being able to save code between battery changes. I wish it had a backup battery to keep memory while changing the main batteries.<p>Still have my 28S and still use it most days, although sadly don&#x27;t find much reason to program it anymore.')
