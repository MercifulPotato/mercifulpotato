Some years ago, I used to throw up all day about three days out of the month for up to sixteen hours.<p>The last time fasting caused significant vomiting for me was around December 31st of last year. It was after two days of more extreme circumstances than usual in terms of being underfed and was on the heels of a longer period of having trouble getting enough to eat.<p>It was incredibly miserable and took a month to recover from, but as is typical for such incidents it also permanently improved my baseline functioning.<p>Years ago, I asked around and was able to determine that part of what I vomit up is likely bile. I end up bringing up a great deal of foul-tasting fluid. I sometimes throw up after lunch and sometimes my lunch stays down. It is common for me to only vomit foul fluids. (Edit: What I mean is that sometimes immediately after eating, I throw up foul fluids and the food I just ate stays down.)<p>The incident at the end of last December did not involve foul fluids. Instead, I threw up large quantities of thick gunk. It was torture and if I wasn&#x27;t absolutely certain that this was going to resolve soon and would lead to me being permanently improved because of it, I would have done my damnedest to kill myself that day because it was just so awful.<p>When I was too exhausted to stand up any longer and too dehydrated to keep throwing up, etc. I ran a bath. Laying in the bath helped take the edge off my misery enough for me to fall asleep for a while in the bath.<p>Since then, I mostly don&#x27;t throw up in reaction to being underfed for just a day. I used to routinely throw up at lunch time on semi-fasting days, which means after maybe half a day of mostly not eating. It now tends to take two days or longer before vomiting commences.')
