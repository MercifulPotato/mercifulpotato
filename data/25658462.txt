Why buy it online leaving a papertrail (ebay account, bank&#x2F;credit card transactions), when you can buy it anonymously in person using cash? The daily volume also isn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s a couple thousand dollars per day at most. You can easily get that amount in person without raising any suspicion by driving to different stores in your city.')
