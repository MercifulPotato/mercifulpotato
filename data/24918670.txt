Item(by='intellirogue', descendants=None, kids=[24918991], score=None, time=1603892843, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24918306, text='I don&#x27;t know about the US, but outside of it Apple Maps seems to be far more accurate than Google Maps.<p>A few examples from my own personal experience:<p>- A small beach town in New Zealand shows about 10 streets which have never existed, and tries to route you down them. I did some research, and they were paper roads for a planned development ~20 years ago, but were removed from government records ~15 years ago. Google still seem to be using 15+ year old data, and both myself and the local government have failed to get it corrected.<p>- Trying to get from the train station to my Airbnb in an Austrian city, Google&#x27;s walking directions tried to send me through somebody&#x27;s back yard. It wouldn&#x27;t offer any other option, so I switched to Apple Maps which correctly routed me.<p>- A bridge near my apartment in Germany right now is closed to cars for a few months. Bicycles and pedestrians can still use it. Google Maps&#x27; walking and cycling directions route around it, Apple correctly sends you over it in walking&#x2F;cycling modes, but routes around it in driving mode.<p>Entirely anecdotal of course, but I&#x27;m yet to experience an issue like this in the other direction, aside from the very early days of Apple Maps before they acquired TomTom&#x27;s data.<p>I get the impression that outside of the US (where they maintain their own data), Google just hoovers up whatever open data it can find on the web, without any regard to its age or accuracy.')
