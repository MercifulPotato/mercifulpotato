Threema provide a number of SDKs to help you, but you are under no obligation to use it, you can write your own API submission client from scratch.<p>P.S. Not saying Wire is bad here. Wire is good. I use it alongside Threema myself for $other_uses.  But I&#x27;m saying don&#x27;t write off Threema under a false understanding that their encryption protocols are closed source.')
