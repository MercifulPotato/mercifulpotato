I can&#x27;t speak to the pros and cons of other makers. The Nonomo was recommended to us by a friend.<p>The Nonomo has the mattress in an insert into the cloth hammock, so there&#x27;s no risk of the baby getting wedged between the mattress and the hammock - that was the cause of a US recall of one make of baby hammock.<p>Nonomo are also good about getting additional parts, practically everything is individually purchasable for e.g. having multiple ceiling mounts - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nonomo.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;store&#x2F;accessories" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nonomo.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;store&#x2F;accessories</a>')
