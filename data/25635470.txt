Sometimes it&#x27;s for creativity (limiting yourself to only using specific set of hardware for music production) and sometimes for better user experience (like in industrial design, Dieter Rams&#x27; (Braun) simpler radios with less functionality is a famous example, ~1960). Dieter Ram also had a large influence on design in general, and states one of the principles for &quot;Good design&quot; is &quot;Good design is minimal – Less is more. Simple as possible but not simpler. Good design elevates the essential functions of a product.&quot;')
