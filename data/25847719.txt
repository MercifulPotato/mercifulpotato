Item(by='gjm11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611157393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846696, text='Someone I knew at university, who prefers starting at 0 (for mathematical, rather than computational, reasons) made the following argument&#x2F;proposal.<p>&quot;First&quot; is an abbreviated form of &quot;foremost&quot;. So if you start counting at 0, &quot;first&quot; corresponds to index 0. There&#x27;s no real clash here yet; &quot;first&quot; and &quot;one&quot; are entirely separate terms.<p>&quot;Second&quot; is from Latin &quot;secundus&quot; meaning &quot;following&quot;; the second thing follows the first. So &quot;second&quot; corresponds to index 1. Again, no clash yet; &quot;second&quot; and &quot;two&quot; are basically unrelated.<p>&quot;Third&quot;, though, actually derives from &quot;three&quot;. So &quot;third&quot; has to correspond to index 3.<p>This leaves a gap, which might perhaps be filled by a new word &quot;twifth&quot;, corresponding to index 2.<p>So now we have the cardinal numbers: zero, one, two, three. And the corresponding ordinals: first, second, twifth, third.')
