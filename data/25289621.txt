Item(by='wazoox', descendants=None, kids=[25289657, 25292110, 25289717], score=None, time=1607008748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289519, text='I&#x27;ve replaced my aging and failing 2013 XPS with a Ryzen 5 IdeaPad S540, cheap and slightly bigger but has a second internal M.2 slot, SD card slot, RAM upgraded to 32GB, and full size HDMI and USB A connectors for less than 900â‚¬. I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade, even if this machine won&#x27;t last as long as the XPS (though its full metal case is sturdy enough).')
