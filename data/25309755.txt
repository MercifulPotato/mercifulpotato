He is a billionaire because he owns a lot of shares in Amazon, and Amazon is a trillion dollar company.<p>There are examples where a group of people came together and decided to share in the profit or loss of a venture, and worked on it as employees (REI is a popular US outdoor equipment company that was started this way).<p>Amazon seems to have chosen a path where instead of asking individual employees to take a loss or break even for 20 years, they paid their employees while the company absorbed those losses and scaled.<p>The &quot;billionaire&quot; bit here seems arbitrary. Bezos is a billionaire because he owns a lot of shares because he didn&#x27;t have a lot of cofounders. If he had started Amazon with 20 different cofounders then he (probably) wouldn&#x27;t be a billionaire. Either way, the concept of exploiting labor for profit doesn&#x27;t impact his billionaire status.<p>I&#x27;d be open to having a separate discussion around what it means to &quot;exploit&quot; labor, but on this topic I think moving the conversation from the concept of billionaire founders to how the system oppresses those that fall below a certain income would be more productive.<p>I don&#x27;t know why Paul funds or doesn&#x27;t fund certain founders, but if I were Paul I would be funding those founders that I believe can start companies that will eventually have stock collectively worth a lot of money. From the stories I&#x27;ve read - most of the founders that Paul funded DO plan on splitting their profits amongst all their employees - purely by virtue of when he invests in a company, the founders usually were the only employees. If I was Paul my dream would be that a company started by a small group of initial founders would be able to get big without having to &quot;exploit&quot; (or hire) any people at all.')
