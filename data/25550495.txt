I wonder if they can make a 4xGPU, or if the yield will become poor as the die size increases. Maybe they&#x27;ll have to do a discrete GPU, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to match their current trajectory.<p>And then there have been &quot;leaks&quot; (rumors, really) about an 32xcore M1-family CPU, but I imagine the yield of such a beast would be horrible, with all the other SOC components on the same die. Especially, if they put a 32xcore GPU on the same die.')
