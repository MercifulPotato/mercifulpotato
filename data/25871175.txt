With the former + using multiple app servers, server clock drift can become an issue. Which is why I still generate my ordered UUIDs on my Postgres server. It means writing some funky PL&#x2F;pgSQL (or however you decide to do it... I think you can run Python too), but it gets the job done.<p>I wish ordered UUIDs were built-in to more DBs natively. I remember seeing UUIDv6 being proposed, but I don&#x27;t know if&#x2F;when that will be standardised.')
