My Pixel 2 now has so many bugs I can&#x27;t even keep track of them. The UIs and menus for all of these Google services get more and more hidden, convoluted, and inaccessible with every update. Google Search at this point is a joke, to be avoided unless looking for PDFs.<p>Am I crazy, or has anyone else noticed this trend over the past few years?')
