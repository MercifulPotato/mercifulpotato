A planet with another km&#x2F;s extra required to get to orbit is quite likely still able to launch rockets.<p>Then, we launch probes with total speed well above 11 km&#x2F;s. While that speed is achieved over some time, which incurs gravitational losses, we can still assume that even higher low orbital speed can be achievable by chemical rockets.')
