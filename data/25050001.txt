That IDE is so bad it&#x27;s beyond believe<p>Eh? Although I prefer Rider, I don&#x27;t see how you can make that claim. Yes, it has perf issues, and at least in the past has had some stability issues too, but it&#x27;s absolutely <i>crammed</i> with features and offers a great dev UX for everything from source control to debugging.<p>&gt; Why the hell do Windows developers need to install an entire new IDE in order to use the latest version of the .NET runtime? It&#x27;s ridiculous beyond belief.<p>To be clear, this is only for <i>existing</i> Visual Studio users. Microsoft has done this for major versions of dotnet core too, and while it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience, I have believe there is a good reason for it. &quot;ridiculous beyond belief&quot; is a bit strong.<p>&gt; Really shows that Visual Studio Code is the future.<p>VS Code and VS are like chalk and cheese - I&#x27;m a big fan of VS Code, but for developing with C# I much prefer the features of a full IDE, Rider or VS. Like a debugger, and applying changes during a debug session.')
