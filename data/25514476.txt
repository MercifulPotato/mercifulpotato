When you pay for bandwidth, you&#x27;re paying the amortized costs of building and maintaining the infrastructure.<p>Rendering a SPA on a client device consumes CPU time, which definitely uses energy proportional to the number of client devices.<p>Assume the server uses less clock cycles to render than the client--e.g., because of optimized software, hot caches, or tuned hardware.<p>Therefore rendering on the server should always be more energy efficient than on the client.')
