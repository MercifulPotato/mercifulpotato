It&#x27;s not correct to ask if COVID shelter in place orders are worth it for &quot;200k&quot; deaths.<p>The correct question to ask is, &quot;What is the cost of not sheltering in place?&quot; The answer seems to be between two million and three million deaths in the US from COVID alone[0]. Of course, there would be even more deaths due to ICUs being full and even more acute shortages of PPE for medical personnel.<p>We would also experience profound second- and third-order effects of millions of additional deaths on the economy.<p>&gt; should we... force video taped gym sessions and cardio exercises? require wearable monitors? prohibit admittance to public transport without a gym validation stamp or a doctor note?<p>I hope you&#x27;ve taken the opportunity to read this again. To be charitable, it does not meet the high standards I think we hold ourselves to at HN. People suffering from heart disease don&#x27;t infect others with a potentially fatal virus.<p>Other countries have applied strict shelter in place and mask rules with great success. In the US, compliance with such rules has been made political, and questioning it--often with straw man arguments like those above--has become the mark of supposed contrarian rebels.<p>As a result we have something of the worst of both worlds. Sadly, as more Americans irresponsibly refuse to apply basic COVID safety measures, more people get infected, thus supplying rhetorical ammunition to critics like those in this thread.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;health&#x2F;coronavirus-herd-immunity-simulation-vaccine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;health&#x2F;coronavi...</a>')
