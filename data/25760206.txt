There are good arguments to be made for that. The problem is that the framework itself is just shitty and Apple should improve it.<p>This is one of the things I dislike most about Apple: even despite the high price I pay for their products and (subsequently) the astronomical profits they make, somehow they seem to be completely unable to simply address these kinds of problems as soon as they pop up and make everyone happy again. It&#x27;s also in Apple&#x27;s own interest to make sure VPN extensions can automatically update in case of potential security problems, no? So why they don&#x27;t just throw enough resources at it to make it work really is beyond me.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to like about Apple products but their culture towards addressing problems that affect their paying customers is becoming increasingly off-putting, <i>especially</i> since they have basically been printing money for over ~10 years now and have <i>no</i> excuses to not improve these kinds of things.')
