If you don&#x27;t mind a lot of extra planning ahead and hassle, it seems like a good approach to life. But if that stresses you out, then it&#x27;s an awful approach.<p>I was thinking about what this person would consider the worst offender on this front in my lifestyle: early in the summer, we bought a teardrop camper trailer. I calculated how many nights of hotels it would take to even out the price, and it was a lot. But it also unlocked a bunch of trips this summer that we would have never taken without it. We could have rented a similar trailer for each of those trips, and we did look into that before we bought the trailer, but again, it was a <i>hassle</i>. In practice, we simply wouldn&#x27;t have taken those trips. So a straight utilization comparison is not the right one.')
