Recalling what I read, they made a few tests in order to confirm their conclusion.<p>1: Did the leaked information exist publicly before the publication. It make no sense to continue demand legal protection for information which is already public.<p>2: Did the leaked information cause any harm by being leaked. If it can not be demonstrated to have caused harm then the information should not have been classified from the start and thus do not deserve legal protection.<p>3: Was publicizing the information in the public interests?<p>This has made prosecuting news papers for publicizing classified information almost impossible.')
