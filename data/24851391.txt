It&#x27;s a very conservative approach though, to stay far away from new technologies until they&#x27;re firmly established.  There&#x27;s a lot of money to be made by getting into things when they&#x27;re still on the bleeding edge though, and the entire startup community exists to take advantage of that fact.<p>The real question is, is it still early days for Bitcoin, in which case it would make sense to get into it now (albeit still risky)?  Or are the early days over and all those gains have already been realized?  You&#x27;d need a crystal ball to know for sure.')
