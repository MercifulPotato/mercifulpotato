Like I mentioned, I would gladly pay the annual fee right now, since NotePlan looks _very_ close to what I’m looking for.<p>But I’m pretty invested in using GitHub for my notes, and so I only need an editor to be an editor, not managing&#x2F;syncing my notes.<p>I’ll keep an eye on NotePlan in the future.
