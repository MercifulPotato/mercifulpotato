I&#x27;m certainly not a lawyer, but it&#x27;s not obvious to me whether or not removals of code would be copyrightable. If Dev A writes 1000 lines of code, and Dev B carefully removes 20 specific lines that are unnecessary or introduce bugs, the resulting codebase consists entirely of Dev A&#x27;s code, but Dev B might justifiably claim to deserve credit for their effort. I&#x27;d like someone more familiar with copyright law to chime in.')
