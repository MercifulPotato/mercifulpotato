This came up before recently.<p>So many people believe non-citizens don&#x27;t pay taxes.  So many people believe non-citizens are undocumented, not allowed to work legally, etc.<p>The vast majority of non-citizens who work pay taxes the same as citizens, everywhere in the world as far as I know.<p>They often pay the state <i>more</i> than citizens (because of various substantial fees, every year in some countries), while receiving less for it.<p>It breaks my heart, to think anti-immigrant sentiments may be helped along by such misguided beliefs.')
