It is a high-res version but not your original photo resolution. I always shoot at the highest available resolution where I can (along with RAW, when possible).<p>For those, worrying about Google banning your account and losing your photos, here is how I do mine. Still not the best but hope to inspire others.<p>1. Our family shoots mostly with iPhone, and DSLRs and the first point of consumption are Apple Photos.<p>2. I have Google Drive Backup to back up the &quot;original&quot; resolution photos to Google Photos. This helps to share with friends, families, and others who are pretty much not on the Apple Ecosystem. This also serves as my second backup and I like the cute things that the Google Photos team does to the photos. A lot of fun moments for the family.<p>3. Besides the digital house-keeping that I quickly do every Month, I do a checklist of Backups, trimming, minimizing, etc, every year (usually in JAN). Here the Photos from Apple Photos are exported to the yearly folder but I&#x27;m not happy that the exported photos pretty much have scrambled metadata. I&#x27;m fine for now, as this is my last resort if the above two sources kinda die.<p>This is not yet something that I&#x27;m happy about and will continue to look for something in the lines of every tool (such as Apple Photos, Google Photos, and others) being just clients to a primary source available on my local NAS and somewhere online (with backup replicas -- cloud such as AWS, Wasabi + elsewhere).<p>On a personal note, I do skip lunches once a while each month to cover up for the 2TB Google One and Apple One Family plans, which I&#x27;m fast running out too. That lunch-skipping is good for health and pays for the monthly plans.')
