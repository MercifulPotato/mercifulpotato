In my experience, if you see someone use the word &quot;whiteness&quot;, what follows is blatant bad-faith racism, often attacking the foundations of every productive institution in society. Somehow, it is granted academic legitimacy. See for example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ByronYork&#x2F;status&#x2F;1283372233730203651" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ByronYork&#x2F;status&#x2F;1283372233730203651</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RealPeerReview&#x2F;status&#x2F;1203784021148340224" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RealPeerReview&#x2F;status&#x2F;120378402114834022...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ConceptualJames&#x2F;status&#x2F;1290645039572496385" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ConceptualJames&#x2F;status&#x2F;12906450395724963...</a><p>Paul is painting with a broad-brush here. &quot;Hermeneutic&quot; for example is sometimes used in good faith inquiry. But academia has burned so much credibility with me as it has become more of an activist enterprise, that I understand the impulse to dismiss it. At this point, I put the burden on defenders of postmodern linguistics to convince me that a piece of writing isn&#x27;t dishonest, evil, or fluff.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent paper from Seattle Public Schools on adding social justice principles to Mathematics. It includes such topics as &quot;What is my mathematical identity?&quot;, &quot;Who holds power in a mathematics classroom?&quot;, &quot;Who gets to say if an answer is right?&quot; and &quot;Can we change mathematics from an individual to a collective enterprise?&quot;. The end of this line of thinking is to destroy mathematical education and leave children ignorant. But at least when they underperform in life, they will be left with the political tools to blame it on &quot;hegemony&quot; and &quot;whiteness&quot;. This is an ideological cancer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.k12.wa.us&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;public&#x2F;socialstudies&#x2F;pubdocs&#x2F;Math%20SDS%20ES%20Framework.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.k12.wa.us&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;public&#x2F;socialstudi...</a>')
