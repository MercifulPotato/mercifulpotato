If your view of TikTok is through the lens of media or the occasional repost, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s mostly teens dancing to catchy music, which there is a ton of on the platform.<p>But there&#x27;s so much more content under the surface that doesn&#x27;t get talked about. Travel TikTokers give me ideas of where to go in 2021, I stole an Oatmeal recipe from a bodybuilder on there that I still make every morning. I took some ideas about Lightroom from a number of Photography TikTokers, the rabbit holes are endless.<p>TikTok I think it in it&#x27;s &quot;pre-mainstream&quot; phase where you get the best of user content but it still hasn&#x27;t been muddied by promo deals, partnerships and big media. Sure big media is there but most of the content I see reminds me of YouTube in that magical time between when it went mainstream with users but not big brands and corporations.')
