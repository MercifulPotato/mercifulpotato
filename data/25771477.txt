Heck we could say <i>most</i> chips don&#x27;t need it.<p>Intel is still innovating, just because they currently lack behind doesn&#x27;t mean that will stay that way.<p>Even when lacking behind wrt. the production node Intel still manged to produce Chips which are often not much worse then the competition.<p>Intel is not just about CPU&#x27;s.<p>Etc.<p>So no Intel is not dying at all.<p>It&#x27;s taking damage, and lost dominance but it still has a fairly good shot at survival and might even take back dominance (in a 2-3 years). Or it might not but still stay competitive.<p>And if we look at the world situation TSMC might not be a think anymore in a view years. It would make me supper angry but thinks are heading in that direction (China Taiwan conflict).')
