Kludging up some YAML that you run directly in Prod from your laptop is not writing code, Im sorry to say. The problem is that SREs are tasked with solving these problems and they have horrible taste and sensibilities around dev experience because they are not devs.<p>All these remote dev Kubernetes solutions sound good in theory, but suck royally in practice. Remote debugging just isn&#x27;t as good and the idea that I have to be online to get <i>any</i> work done is such a step back that it&#x27;s baffling that anyone could even propose this.')
