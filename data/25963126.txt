Top of the line &quot;gaming&quot; networking is 802.11ax or 10GbE. 2x200Gb&#x2F;s NICs are available now.<p>Gaming parts are strictly single socket - software that can take advantage of &gt;64 cores will need server hardware - either one of the giant Ampere ARM CPUs or a 2+ socket system.<p>If something must run in RAM and needs TB of RAM, well then it&#x27;s not even a question of faster or slower. The capability only exists on server platforms.<p><i>Some</i> workloads will benefit from the performance characteristics of consumer hardware.')
