And I can&#x27;t help think how annoying it must be for people with disabilities.<p>I usually watch TV with subtitles on (it means I can have the volume a little lower), and I find that cases where pre-roll ads are inserted either don&#x27;t adjust the subtitle sync or don&#x27;t adjust it properly.  Amazon&#x27;s subtitles are generally 1-2s ahead of the video, which is just enough to let the air out of a big reveal or ruin a joke.')
