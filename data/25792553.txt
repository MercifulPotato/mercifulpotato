Apparently they were just logging so much stuff to disk that the flash storage would eventually wear out in a few years, due to the chips having a limited number of writes in their lifespan. this doesn’t affect the ability to drive but without the computer you can’t see your speedometer, many vehicle controls, etc. or even connect with your phone (which normally could replace the main display in a pinch).<p>they changed the software to log less a while ago, but the damage was done on many cars. Not 100% sure this recall is related to the same issue but it sounds like that’s what they’re saying<p>“ Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P&#x2F;E cycles would take only five to six years, the agency said”')
