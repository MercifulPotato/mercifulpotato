Item(by='krastanov', descendants=None, kids=[24957070], score=None, time=1604200121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956792, text='To an extent, but I think there is still a counter example that gets to why this is such a subtle distinction (computable vs &quot;reducible to a mathematical procedure&quot;).<p>Consider an &quot;analog&quot; computer that is in principle noise-free (i.e. elementary operations like addition on this hardware are performed by adding up two analog quantities, e.g. voltages or currents, and these quantities are infinitely smooth, not discreticized&#x2F;digital, and not disturbed by hardware imperfections and noise). I can create a model of such a device in theory and if I use only the axioms of classical physics (which we now know are wrong), then such a device will be capable of computing and representing numbers that can not be expressed by a Turing machine (i.e. it would be not just faster than a Turing machine or a quantum computer, it will be capable of things that a Turing machine can not ever do).<p>This is a device that one can imagine existing, and to quote you it is &quot;reducible to mathematical procedure with definite outcomes&quot;. It just happens to be a mathematical procedure we find to be rather unreasonable for our universe (because of unavoidable classical thermal noise and non-classical quantum effects that cause discretization).<p>Some physicists and computer scientists (me included) like to take this as a starting point, as a reason for why certain theories of physics are probably wrong. I personally find this to be a very elegant, powerful, and subtle approach, up there with Noether&#x27;s theorem or the second law of thermodynamics. &quot;A theory of physics can not be true if it permits the construction of a computing device that can solve the halting problem&quot; seems pretty much on par with &quot;A theory of physics can not be true if it disobeys conservation laws &#x2F; causality &#x2F; locality &#x2F; entropy considerations&quot;. All of this with the caveat that one should not be dogmatic about these vague statements, rather just take them as a general guideline.')
