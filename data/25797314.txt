A quick look on any job search site will show you that there are more positions asking for Elixir, and about 20x as many postings mentioning Scala. Of the positions I find on LinkedIn, even maybe half of the positions mentioning Clojure are mentioning it generally as in &quot;experience with FP languages like Haskell&#x2F;Elm&#x2F;Clojure&#x2F;Scala is a plus&quot; rather than directly seeking Clojure devs. It&#x27;s also lost about 80% of its search traffic in the last 3 years according to Google Trends (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F03yb8hb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0...</a>).<p>It looks like despite how awesome Clojure is, there is something keeping it from achieving growth in adoption and the community should look at how to address that rather than look the other way.')
