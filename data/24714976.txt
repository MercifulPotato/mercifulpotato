It&#x27;s not like the business that laid them off is going to do a good job of that, if it&#x27;s not compelled to, and retraining can be expensive and perhaps unaffordably so for someone who just lost their job.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Last year corridor crew did a video where niko broke down how much money he could save by moving to LED lights and cutting the mandatory crew requirement and run small films at affordable prices.<p>&gt;&gt; Bosses don&#x27;t like unions, and if you take the perspective of a boss, you probably won&#x27;t like them either. What else is new?<p>&gt; Saying bosses dont like unions therefore dismissal of discussion is missing the point.<p>No it isn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m sure there prosecutors that have plenty of complaints about defense attorneys.  Maybe some guilty people do get off free because of them, but we don&#x27;t oppose defense attorneys because they make things hard for prosecutors.  Unions serve opposing interests to bosses, so bosses&#x27; gripes should not be the main focus.<p>&gt; My view is too much of unionizing is underpinned by coveting other people&#x27;s success and wanting to feel good after being burned.<p>My view is that unionization is underpinned by the fundamental imbalance between <i>un</i>organized workers and organized business.')
