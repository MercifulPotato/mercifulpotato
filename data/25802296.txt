You can argue that it&#x27;s painful and clumsy, but not that it&#x27;s &quot;like a global variable&quot;. The _whole_ point of redux is to offer global state without the problems of global variables. Interacting with the global state through actions, selectors and subscribers prevents the problems of global variables.<p>Is it clumsy&#x2F;verbose&#x2F;confusing&#x2F;whatever? There&#x27;s definitely arguments for it. But people stop thinking when they see the word &quot;global&quot; and make terrible arguments against Redux.')
