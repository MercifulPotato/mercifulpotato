It shows it&#x27;s incorrect. Yet this nonsense also spilled over to the UK, leading to people yelling things like &quot;hands up don&#x27;t shoot&quot; at unarmed police officers.<p>Then the media tried to deny that these &quot;anti-racism&quot; protesters were hard-left activists, even as the BLM leadership referred to itself as &quot;trained Marxists&quot; and the BLM UK website talked about overthrowing capitalism. The New York Times tried to redefine basic facts about the founding dates of America. CNN described the protests as mostly peaceful in a report where their reporter was standing in front of burning cars and buildings. And so on.<p>BLM has been <i>nothing but</i> lies. You just can&#x27;t tell ... because the sort of people who are willing to point that out are being systematically erased from the internet.')
