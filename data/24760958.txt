I like debugging, but I just flat-out couldn&#x27;t make it work. Plus, constantly feeling stupid is a huge drain on one&#x27;s motivation to continue. Plus, the community was... not helpful. I mean, I get the whole &quot;Avoid success at all costs&quot;, to avoid the language becoming entangled with the desires of large corporate interests, but it did feel a little extreme. Mind, this was 7 years ago, and I assume  haskell stack and a few other tools make things a lot easier.<p>Actually, this is something I&#x27;ve always wondered: I know that any Haskell enthusiast would, upon hearing someone say, &quot;I like the ideas, but it&#x27;s just too hard to program in&quot;, respond, no, it&#x27;s not, you just didn&#x27;t learn it the right way, or this IDE with that extension makes it much easier, or you really should have started with Learn You A Haskell. But what I&#x27;m really curious about is this: Putting all that said, assume for the moment that Haskell really is too complicated for anyone without an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology to understand.<p>Do you care?')
