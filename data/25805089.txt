I really like the concept of (state) =&gt; ui, but had no interest in react’s former class-based API.  It was too complex.  With hooks, I can write code in a more functional style, and even though they’re a little weird I think it results in more maintainable code.<p>I really wanted to push for using Reagent in Clojurescript, or something like re-frame that uses it, since CLJS has much better enforcement of and support for immutability-by-default and function composition.  Everything that custom hooks do is handled by plain CLJS functions.  It feels closer to meeting the design goals of React than React itself does, even with hooks.<p>It’s a hard sell though when I’m the only one at the company who knows the language.  Maybe someday...')
