Fundamentally, the chatroom model pioneered by IRC is poor for asynchronous communication because you can&#x27;t sustain temporally overlapping conversations in a channel.<p>However, you can&#x27;t &quot;just use email&quot; -- Email&#x27;s threading model is great for asynchronous work, but it is poor for synchronous communication and also doesn&#x27;t support modern features that make it easier to communicate ideas efficiently (shared history, markdown formatting, image previews, emoji reactions, etc.). It&#x27;s essential to be able to have (semi)synchronous written conversations with people you&#x27;re working with, especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend your days burning out on video calls.<p>This is why we created Zulip -- it&#x27;s designed as a real-time communication tool with email&#x27;s threading model and all the nice features of modern chat apps that email lacks. And the reading user experience is actually a lot better than email, because Zulip provides is designed with the goal of saving time when prioritizing, skimming, reading, and replying to conversations. It&#x27;s also 100% open source software (not open core!).')
