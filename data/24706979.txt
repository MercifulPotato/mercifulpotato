First off, you lose shot power <i>(much more notable in Jorginho&#x27;s case)</i>. Second, the goalkeepers get familiar with it, and start waiting for the skip <i>(Bruno Fernandes changed his technique recently in the Europa League due to this, the goalkeeper almost saved it, only he couldn&#x27;t due to shot power. If BF skipped, the power would not have been enough)</i>.<p>It could be argued that the panenka is the same thing - if the goalkeeper waits, he saves. However, the panenka does not require the run to be changed, adding to the surprise factor.<p>All that being said, powerful shot to the side netting is still my go to.')
