I would be equally correct in saying that we do not yet posses the technology (time travel) to falsify this theory.<p>We have to rely on some sort of proxy for the simplicity or elegance of the theory in order to preclude hypotheses like the above. If we find an elegant solution to the BHIP that uses existing QM + GR (which are empirically verified), then that seems like a pretty good resolution even if it can&#x27;t be observationally verified directly at a black hole yet.')
