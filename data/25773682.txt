Having to click around a webpage and edit in a textbox was not ideal.<p>I&#x27;ve started using obsidian, and I&#x27;m happy. It saved markdown files locally, so you don&#x27;t have to learn TW&#x27;s own syntax.<p>Since it&#x27;s local, it&#x27;s also faster than notion. And you can put the files in a dropbox folder to sync with all the machines.')
