I use my own name for my channel: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;AndreasKling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;AndreasKling</a><p>It has worked well for me so far, since my channel has some amount of personal content as well, and using my personal identity harmonizes well with that.<p>I think it depends a bit on what kind of content you want to do in the future. A specialized name&#x2F;theme like “Barely Coding” can be good for building an audience interested in programming, but they might get turned off down the road if you suddenly start posting some new kind of content.<p>Either way, good luck with your channel! :)')
