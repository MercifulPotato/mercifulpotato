I&#x27;m seeing more and more electric vehicles on the roads, but I think some regular customers will be disappointed by how poor the infrastructure is.  Not only that electric chargers aren&#x27;t as prevalent as they need to be, but the number of high-speed chargers are tiny (think a couple of locations per large city), but an even bigger problem is the heterogeneity and complexity of coming across a charger and being able to use it on your car.  The requirement for registration, fobs&#x2F;cards etc is crazy.<p>This is a good opportunity for government to step in and mandate that all electric charging points also have the option to pay by contactless&#x2F;android&#x2F;apple pay, for example.  I don&#x27;t mind if I pay a few pence more, but I do mind having to find a website on my phone and sign up then wait for a fob to be posted to me.')
