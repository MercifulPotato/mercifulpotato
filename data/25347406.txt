The software is built. It&#x27;s not getting any benefit from future Qt improvements or bug fixes.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how many people in this thread are not only defending this, but talking about how great this licensing model is.<p>I&#x27;m guessing all these people have startups (or ideas for startups) that rely on gouging customers with never-ending subscription models.<p>I personally think subscription licensing models is the worst thing to happen to the software industry. I miss being able to purchase and own copies of software. I recently stopped using any Adobe apps and moved my entire workflow over to the Affinity suite. I prefer to support developers who don&#x27;t rip-off their consumers')
