It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s all of them, no matter what side they&#x27;re on or what point of view they&#x27;re advancing.<p>You can further reduce this to &quot;all humans will lie and manipulate when it suits them&quot;. As a statement it&#x27;s just as true, but it obfuscates the concept of scale : some people lie more, more deliberately and more frequently than others.<p>By declaring everyone an offender without further distinction, you are effectively excusing the behavior of the worst actors while minimizing the good faith efforts put forward by others.')
