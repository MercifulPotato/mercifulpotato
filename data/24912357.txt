Because it&#x27;s the most elegant way of putting a price on emissions.</i><p>I used to agree with this, and now I don&#x27;t.<p>A carbon tax has to be an approximation, and there are significant judgement calls on what the total carbon burden of a given product or service might be. This is a recipe for paperwork, loopholes, and a raft of unintended consequences.<p>Instead, I support an across-the-board carbon sales tax on everything. Use some of this to subsidize carbon-reducing technology at the point of sale. Put the rest of it toward everything else we use taxes for, and make sure that renewable research, nuclear energy, and so on, are adequately funded. UBI? sure, why not; but let&#x27;s not attach it directly to a climate tax, that only confuses both issues.<p>There are some exceptions: it&#x27;s practical to calculate the carbon burden of electricity, and handle the taxation-and-subsidy market directly in that field.')
