But when it comes to matters like these, when fighting deeply entrenched systems, I think they usually only fix themselves after a massive correction and that correction usually involves a lot of pain and misery. So I settle for education and generally passive resistance. I don&#x27;t think copyleft on its own is going to fix anything.<p>Otherwise, I just try to behave in a way that is consistent with my ethics, while balancing practical matters. In this case, that means opting out of monopoly copyright interest as much as I can.<p>And can I just say, I really wish it were possible to have discussions about why ought to be without getting dragged into a tangent about how to get there.
