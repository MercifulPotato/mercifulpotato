Predicting which vehicle is going to drive unsafely, or even with excessive caution is not just responding to the position (speed and acceleration) of a vehicle, but how it acts relative to predictions (and how well it is predicting your actions), and fits into a type of driver model. And then knowing that all of that will change when a traffic cop is visible or not, the start of a rain, sunset, kids&#x2F;pets acting up.<p>That&#x27;s why driving in different cities for an experienced driver can be so nerve wracking... it&#x27;s hard to predict what all those vehicles will do! Meanwhile they are also predicting what you will do so you&#x27;re dangerous as well (don&#x27;t stop in traffic just because a pedestrian walks into the middle of a busy street in Delhi or Naples, you&#x27;ll cause an accident).')
