Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603439031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866186, text='&gt;I have no idea what terms limits of 1 day would do; it&#x27;s not obvious to me. Please argue your point.<p>Not the GP, but I think the point is fairly simple to express.  If you took office tomorrow, and had a term of one day, and there was a vote on a legislative item, how much could you possibly learn about the issue in the time prior to that vote?  Short term limits mean that it&#x27;s harder for legislators to really understand the more complex issues since by the time they do, if they ever do, they are likely to be forced out by the term limit.  Additionally, they probably won&#x27;t be effective at getting any legislation passed until they understand how to work with the system.<p>Another way to look at it, is how long would it take you to become effective if you switched careers tomorrow?  What if you had a maximum time you could spend in that career?  How long would you spend being less effective because you are still learning how to do the job?  How long would you have to work at a professional or expert level?<p>If we assume legislators only need a few weeks or months to get up to speed, then term limits of 6-8 years don&#x27;t matter.  If we assume it takes a few years to become effective, then we&#x27;re hobbling our legislators for close to half the maximum time they can be on office.  It&#x27;s slightly ameliorated by the fact they can seek another office in a different branch, but that doesn&#x27;t eliminate the problem, they&#x27;re still going to have to learn a lot (assuming what you learn as a legislator is what interest groups are important at that level, who of your fellow legislators are good at what, etc).  Though the fact that everyone is in the same boat and there can&#x27;t be some institutionalized personnel that are very good at certain things for others to rely on makes it worse.<p>Having no term limits has problems too, but the short term limits in CA and it&#x27;s affect on institutionalized legislative knowledge and capability has been talked about for decades at this point.')
