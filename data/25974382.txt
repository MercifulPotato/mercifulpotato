There are systems already (like Wayland) where default access to input only gives you input when the app is active, and entire different process is required for global hotkeys or key logging.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what is commonly understood as access to the input system.<p>&gt; <i>There are no nice GUIs to manage that AFAIK, but this is not an impossible problem to solve anymore.</i><p>So long you be willing to live with a walled garden environment where one&#x27;s text editor either can&#x27;t edit the files on one&#x27;s system any more, or is given sufficient permissions to circumvent all of this regardless.<p>&gt; <i>uh, what? no. giving a browser access only to &quot;~&#x2F;Downloads&quot; will work great and will make it much more secure.</i><p>It would also mean that no modern browser works any more since they need access to far more to even start up.<p>You should `strace` a browser and be surprised that it constantly needs to read and write files from all over the system.<p>I would also be rather annoyed with a browser that can only save files in one folder rather than wherever it please me.<p>Finally, even if this browser only have access to `~&#x2F;Downloads`, it would still be capable of modifying any file that something else put there, thus allowing it to easily install malware into anything that anything els downloads, without the user&#x27;s knowledge.<p>&gt; <i>The modern Linux is much more than capabilities and user-based permissions. A mount namespace with selectively bind-mounted dirs can do wonders for security. And things like &quot;bindfs&quot; which can translate UIDs on the fly can give even more isolation.</i><p>There is a good reason that <i>SELinux</i> never truly penetrated: â€” it is capable of much of this, but it would also make most applications unworkable and users would complain about no longer being able to do as they will.<p>More or less what the situation is on <i>Android</i>, or <i>Windows</i>.')
