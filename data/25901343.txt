Most important it means to fear questioning &quot;god&#x27;s will&quot; or the authenticity of religion.<p>&gt;&gt; The most concrete example is understanding that attempting to break the laws of physics by “flying” off a cliff is unwise.<p>Religions like very much to enact &quot;laws&quot;&#x2F;opinions on things they don&#x27;t understand or don&#x27;t fit their model. The history is full of this. Usually people get hurt. Just look at what poor Isaac was about to get. The old book is full of such crap. Hate, war, and discrimination seem to get a respectable place as well. To make your example more religious you should put a punishment on that: i.e if you try to fly you will rot in hell and even if you escape the fall the good people of the church will burn you at the stake.<p>&gt;&gt; Not trying to change your mind or person<p>You can&#x27;t. I went full circle on it. Once you get rid of the fear you see the religions for what they truly are: a mix of old politics and some cheap philosophy.<p>&gt;&gt; but encourage you to continue discovering philosophy and religion<p>Philisophy: maybe<p>Religion: my stomach can&#x27;t handle it anymore.')
