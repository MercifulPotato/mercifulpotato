POST STORY, via NATASHA BERTRAND and KYLE CHENEY: “Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as ‘not legitimate’ and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing. Trump Administration officials have attested to these facts under oath.<p>“The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story. They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani - whose discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported - claimed to have such materials. Moreover, we have reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.”<p>idk, read for yourself<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;playbook-pm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;biden-blasts-back-at-nyp-490603" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;playbook-pm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;...</a>')
