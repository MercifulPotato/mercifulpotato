It was used entirely to phone taxis, order pizza, and as a pager-of-sorts for the office to let me know when it was Overtime time.<p>It didn&#x27;t &quot;click&quot; until I had to replace my ipod, and got the ipod touch.  It didn&#x27;t take very long for me to realise the one thing it was missing was connectivity.<p>Realistically I&#x27;m not even sure I was wrong.  Calls &amp; SMS are amongst the functions I use the least on my phone.  It&#x27;s still an ipod with connectivity.')
