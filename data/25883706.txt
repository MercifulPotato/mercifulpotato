By which I mean the networks of grown men who coordinate to target certain minors (even though the minors appear offline and block the stalkers) by fanning out across game servers. Microsoft knows about these players because they&#x27;ve been reported so many times and by so many different players that they have the worst Reputation Scores. This isn&#x27;t to speak of the &quot;ordinary&quot; sexual harassment, trolling, cheating, and &quot;unsporting behavior&quot;.')
