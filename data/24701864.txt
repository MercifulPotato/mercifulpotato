That&#x27;s not at all bad; you wouldn&#x27;t call that an upset.<p>The real problem was a lack of high-quality state-level polls, and in one or two cases major misses on what state polls there were; there wasn&#x27;t all that much visibility on many states.<p>And ultimately, the final result was so close that it was below the margin of error of any reasonable poll to detect. Even assuming the highest quality polls conducted in each state, every day, the best they&#x27;d have been able to say would have been, pretty much &quot;It&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50&quot;, in retrospect.')
