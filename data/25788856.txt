Yet that is the expectation we&#x27;ve set as professional web developers, when in fact we&#x27;re often over-engineering our projects. There&#x27;s no need for build tools in development when we can use module CDNs. There&#x27;s no need for frameworks in many use cases (unless you need state management but that&#x27;s not for beginners anyway).')
