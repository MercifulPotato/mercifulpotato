Did they simply slip up and briefly drop their cover?<p>I just don&#x27;t see it. I fully believe that, if there were aliens out there with such capabilities, and they came to earth, they would either conceal themselves fully or reveal themselves intentionally (and not just to a handful of people in a remote area).')
