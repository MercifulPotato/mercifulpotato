You define the logo in the manifest file.  The interpretation of the logo settings changed three times over those API versions, with features added and removed.  So a config that works in Android API 18 doesn&#x27;t work in 20-21, but may work on 23.  Support for SVG was dropped and added again.  And none of this is documented.  The logical way to implement API changes is to version the API file and use a compatibility library that can interpret all supported versions and make them work on the phone.  But Android is not built logically.  It is built for Google&#x27;s engineer promo process.<p>Nobody at Google gets promoted for making the thing easy to use, learn, or maintain.  That&#x27;s why Google puts out so many shiny dev tools that quickly rot.  Unfortunately, we are required to work with Android.')
