Your Samsung phone&#x27;s text messages will never be shared onto your Macbook Pro&#x27;s iMessage, and your iCloud backups will never be visible in your Google account. Standardized connectors don&#x27;t mean anything if the vendor controls all sides of the software stack and wants the pieces to only work with that vendor&#x27;s products.<p>Tesla for better or for worse pursues Apple-like vertical integration to control the UX of every part of owning the car, from sales to nav to charging. While standardized connectors would be nice, it would mostly be nice <i>for Tesla owners</i> in that they wouldn&#x27;t need a dongle to connect to public charging networks.<p>(Maybe you&#x27;re arguing that Tesla should be forced to provide Supercharger access at no additional cost to non-Tesla owners. I am not certain I agree with the &quot;no additional cost&quot; part, since Tesla had to shoulder the capital burden of building the network in the first place. But the connectors are the least important part of that anyway; non-Tesla owners could worst case use dongles, if Tesla were forced to provide access to the Supercharger network, just as Tesla owners use dongles to connect to public charging networks today. Dongles are stupid, yes, but they&#x27;re less important than Tesla just providing access in the first place.)<p>As far as home charging goes, personally I just use a standard 240V dryer outlet in my garage to charge; I plug the cord that came with my Model 3 into the outlet, and the other end of the cord (that has the proprietary connector) into the car. Any electric car would work with that setup, so the proprietary connector at the end of the cable doesn&#x27;t impact me much; if I got a different electric car, I&#x27;m sure it would come with its own charging cable anyway that could be plugged into the 240V outlet.')
