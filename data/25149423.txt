We generally understand from context whether we&#x27;re talking about something specific or general.<p>And only use those helpers when we need clarification. There are also other ways to differentiate. For example speaking in singular (cat&#x2F;kot) may mean &#x27;a specific cat&#x27;, but saying &#x27;cats&#x2F;koty&#x27; may mean &#x27;a cat&#x2F;cats&#x27;.<p>In other words, using &#x27;the&#x2F;a&#x27; is in majority of cases unnecessary from our point of view, because if we&#x27;re talking about &#x27;our cat&#x27; for an hour, we don&#x27;t need to stress that it&#x27;s &#x27;the cat&#x27; that I meant when I said &#x27;cat&#x27;, or when we say &#x27;Please feed cat&#x27; and we have a cat, it&#x27;s way more likely that it&#x27;s about our cat than some random cat on the street.<p>And this creates enormous problems for us when learning English or German (not sure about romance languages). We often ask ourselves, if we know whether we&#x27;re talking about something specific or in general should we always use &#x27;a&#x2F;the -&gt; ein&#x2F;die&#x27;. And the answer is &#x27;pretty much&#x27;. Unless you don&#x27;t use it :)<p>&#x27;Love is a powerful emotion&#x27;, and not &#x27;A&#x2F;The love is a powerful emotion&#x27;, and even more elusive cases where those articles are not used.')
