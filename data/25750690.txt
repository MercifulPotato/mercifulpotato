Immediately after the Capitol riots people were trying to create narratives that the FBI and Capitol Hill police intentionally didn&#x27;t do their job. That turned out not to be true, as the piece by Brian Stelter showed. This reasoning seems to be a further manipulated form of that. I would not expect the American government to be making public statements. Generally it&#x27;s the president that addresses the public and obviously in this case he didn&#x27;t.')
