There&#x27;s lots of things in a LV driven app where you&#x27;re still wondering what front-end library to use with it.<p>Typically you wouldn&#x27;t use LV to handle:<p>Menu dropdowns, tooltips, popovers, modals (in some cases), tabs (when you don&#x27;t want to load the content from the server) or things that change the client side state of something but don&#x27;t adjust server state. That could be things like a &quot;select all&quot; checkbox toggle where that doesn&#x27;t do anything on its own other than select or de-select client side check boxes or toggling the visibility of something. There&#x27;s also things like wanting to copy to the clipboard or initiating stuff to happen on drag &#x2F; drop (like animations).<p>Basically you&#x27;ll still find yourself wanting to use JS with LV. Whether that&#x27;s Stimulus, Alpine, Vue, jQuery, vanilla JS or something else that&#x27;s up to you. But I do find most of the above necessary in a lot of web apps I develop.')
