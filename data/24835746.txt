We got it wrong and we have apologised to the valued community member\nwho got the letter. We are undertaking a review of how we protect our trademark to make\nsure that this doesn’t happen again.<p>The letter was sent automatically to a small number of individuals responsible for social\nmedia accounts and websites that were identified by external legal advisers as possibly\ninfringing our trademarks. It should never have been sent.<p>It is important that we take action to protect the Raspberry Pi trademarks, not least to protect\nthe public from bad actors who deliberately misuse our brands to sell poor quality, rip off\nproducts.<p>We want to do that in a way that doesn’t undermine the use of the Raspberry Pi brands and\ntrademarks by members of the fantastic Raspberry Pi community who share our educational\nmission and who do so much to bring it to life everyday.<p>If you have a question or concern about your use of the Raspberry Pi brand or trademarks,\nplease get in touch with us at trademarks@raspberrypi.org.</i>')
