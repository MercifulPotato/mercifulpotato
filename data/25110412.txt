Item(by='Ensorceled', descendants=None, kids=[25110620], score=None, time=1605525357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109328, text='&gt; One of the hallmarks of Apple news and commentary is how whenever Apple merely announces it will do something, Apple is treated like it already did it, while exactly matching its own promises.<p>And yet, this thread and every other Apple thread is full of comments like yours assuming negative intent.  Check out other comments in this thread, you&#x27;ll see comments asserting that of COURSE this feature is for harvesting or that Apple doesn&#x27;t want you to own your devices any more.  You comment is another critique based entirely on what they might do: that are not going to do what they promised.')
