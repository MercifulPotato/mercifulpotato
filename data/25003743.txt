I care more about living in an equal society where the rich don’t constantly dunk on the less fortunate, where the rich don’t hold disproportionate power and are frequently causing issues that disproportional effect people like me.<p>I want to tax the hell out of the rich, not just to get money to manage our shared spaces, but also to take their money away from them. In my eyes they don’t deserve this money. Me and my fellow laborers worked for that money, but they get to keep it. For me this is unfair, and unjust. In my perfect world the rich would not only pay marginally higher taxes, but they would pay <i>most</i> of their income in taxes. A person making a million a month should receive less after taxes then a person that makes a thousand. That for me is a fair economy. And that is the reason why I—and many like me—want to see the tax rate of rich CEO raised to 100%.')
