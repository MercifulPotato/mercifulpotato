Every store, including the Google Play Store, has a right to choose what products it wants to carry, for pretty much any reason whatsoever, including for political reasons. It&#x27;s probably pretty difficult to find copies of <i>The Turner Diaries</i> in your local Barnes and Noble, and I&#x27;d be even more surprised to find a copy of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> in a Lifeway.<p>What makes this scary is not that stores are choosing what products to sell. What makes it scary is that, at least in this segment of the economy, there are exactly two stores, and picking at least one of them to shop at is very nearly a precondition for participating in modern society. This gives Google and Apple a degree of influence over peoples&#x27; lives that one could quite reasonably recognize as quasi-governmental, and that is worrisome.')
