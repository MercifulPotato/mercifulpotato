More than half the time I have to kill the app and relaunch it to get the cast button to show up.<p>- Occasionally flakey UI layout (random bugs which present when moving between screens or searching, or flickering due to layout engine doing multiple repaints over the same controls)<p>- Likes to plaster up things I don&#x27;t want.  They seem to prioritize &quot;discovery&quot; over &quot;user intent&quot;, which would work if only they surfaced articles I&#x27;m interested in (which is rare).  When I just want to find a &quot;comedy&quot; or get to the series I&#x27;m watching, it sometimes feels like I&#x27;m fighting against the UI<p>- Constantly moving my cheese - it&#x27;s like the UI designers have ADD and can&#x27;t commit<p>Amazon Prime is just as bad (maybe worse).  I wish these companies didn&#x27;t control the vertical - i.e. just provide content, and let other vendors make the client software.<p>&#x2F;rant')
