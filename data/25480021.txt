Once again another case of good intentions, bad outcomes.<p>I&#x27;m a lead for a company that sends engineering teams into CA for probably 3-4 months total spread out over a year.  Now we would have to totally reconsider how that will go.  God forbid one of the team got sick for an extended hospital stay.  Their travel costs are reimbursed, but what if they accidentally fall victim to the wealth tax (more like wealth trap), would the company be liable to cover it for a decade?  How absurd does that sound.<p>Anecdotal story:  I was born and raised in CA up to 2005 when I left for college, so was my father and mother.  My entire immediate family has since left for either CO, FL or TX, and more extended family are following.  We were all high net worth and have small business&#x27;s or well paid STEM jobs.  My uncle is about to move his entire business out of the state because the level of regulation and taxation is getting ridiculous.  The other week he visited my parents in TX and marveled at how well maintained the roads were and how cheap the gas was, with no shanty towns along the freeways.  The mismanagement of CA is out of control.  Everyone I know that has left is so glad to have left at this point and hasn&#x27;t looked back.  The exodus of high net worth individuals to other states who don&#x27;t think they are evil money hoarders will simply keep occurring until CA wakes with no money and a federal government refusing to bail them out.<p>You can&#x27;t vote NO on proposition bankruptcy.')
