Item(by='yudlejoza', descendants=None, kids=[25937511, 25936972, 25936967], score=None, time=1611797345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936803, text='Thanks. Great explanation.<p>I don&#x27;t get the over 100 percent part though. Is it required to squeeze the short (i.e., beat hedge-fund at this game)? Wouldn&#x27;t hedge-fund still need to purchase 100 cows even if they only borrowed once?<p>Because as I understand, the way it works is that:<p>- You borrow 100 cows.<p>- You sell them immediately.<p>- You wait for the cow price to drop.<p>- Now you buy 100 cows, netting a profit. (but they need to buy back those 100 cows here, and they only borrowed once).<p>- Now you return those 100 cows to the lender.')
