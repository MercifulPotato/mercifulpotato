Laptops do, sometimes. But they are not meant to take photos - would you carry your laptop around for that?<p>The article does not get the facts right. There is huge R&amp;D investment on the side of the big PC hardware manufacturers,  just look at the big ones, AMD, Intel and Nvidia. There are also really nice Windows&#x2F;Linux laptops. And great peripherals, with big changes over the years, just compare modern cases like a Lancool II 215 (which isn&#x27;t even expensive) to what was common a decade ago. And of course the PC market did not grow as much as the smartphone market in the last decade - smartphones started from zero (well, add a few years), while many people that need a laptop or a PC do have one already.<p>Nonetheless the available market numbers for PC components and systems are not as bad as articles like this make it seem - and that was true even before the pandemic. Writers like this just always forget that when they want to paint a negative picture of PCs in favour of smartphones&#x2F;tablets or when there is another round of &quot;consoles will end PC gaming&quot;, which was never true in the slightest. There is no need for a closed off hardware platform like the Mac to save the PC.')
