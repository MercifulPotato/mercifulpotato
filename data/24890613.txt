In my vision, it would be a small group of families that would meditate daily together, and collaborate on chores and child-raising, and (this part I haven&#x27;t figured out yet) work on the same project, or perhaps WFH on software-like things. Ideally there would be daycare, gardening, and some sort of exercise (yoga) involved. I mean, yeah its easy to imagine how such a thing could go horribly wrong - bad actors taking advantage, cult-like groupthink, etc - but its also easy to imagine what it would be like with the right mix of people being good to each other. Maybe call it a &quot;Sci Fi Kibbutz&quot; or something.')
