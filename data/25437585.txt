Employees are paid to add new features, regardless of how useless they are. The only situation when they stop adding features is when hardware or something else doesn&#x27;t allow it. Otherwise we&#x27;d see 1GB webapps. But when they reach this boundary, they start redoing existing stuff, because otherwise they&#x27;ll get fired for inactivity. This kind of bs is difficult to stop even when you&#x27;re paying their salaries and monitor the results. For example, a marketing person would keep adding useless bloat to justify his salary (he really needs his paycheck!) or a programmer would keep refactoring some bs to satisfy his purism (funded by your money, of course). Just think about it: if a competent programmer approaches you and explains how the product is mostly finished and the remaining microimprovements won&#x27;t add any value to your business, would you continue paying him for doing nothing?')
