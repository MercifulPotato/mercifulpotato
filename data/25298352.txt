Many &quot;REST&quot; URLs are just the names of the methods they call on the remote endpoint.<p>REST is good for things like downloading and uploading documents or media to a web server. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc. were designed for documents&#x2F;media. Because it&#x27;s available from a web browser, like JavaScript, people started using it even on native apps because it&#x27;s familiar. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best or most productive protocol.')
