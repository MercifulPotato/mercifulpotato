So far as i can tell, the only way i &quot;own my data&quot; is that i could.. i guess, record every single HTTP request i ever make, and replay it against some other version of an identical app?<p>Eg, lets say Facebook added Vapor; How would i move my data away from Facebook in the future? How has Vapor helped me own my data?<p><i>(honest question, Vapor has some really cool properties!)</i>')
