Its been a rough year with a lot of uncertainty and plenty of motivating examples for people of most political leanings to justify buying one, or two or some level 4 plates and Nods.<p>Ammunition has been difficult to get since April and its going to stay that way for some time I think. Lots of popular models of firearm have been non stop sold out. The tactical gear industry has seen a huge boom in sales. What used to be very small and niche is now massive. Before 2020 most people already in the hobby didn&#x27;t own plate carriers, battle belts, helmets etc. Now that stuff is just as scarce as anything else.')
