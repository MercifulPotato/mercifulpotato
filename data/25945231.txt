The car gets better every month. Literally faster acceleration, longer range, quicker braking, tighter suspension, fuller featured, more useful and overall more fun. Every month, just like magic.<p>Versus tradition auto which forgets you exist as soon as you make the down payment, and if you want something better you have to buy the latest model.<p>Free upgrades to your car and always having the latest model features is actually really freaking cool. Then they go further an even support 1st party hardware upgrades for late model vehicles to get the newest MCU or AP hardware, which is also unheard of in the industry.')
