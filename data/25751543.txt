I know that you&#x27;ve likely heard this from someone else -- perhaps even someone respected -- but it&#x27;s just not true. The law says no such thing. Again, I encourage you to read it. The law does distinguish between &quot;interactive computer services&quot; and &quot;information content providers,&quot; but that is not, as some imply, a fancy legalistic ways of saying &quot;platform&quot; or &quot;publisher.&quot; There is no &quot;certification&quot; or &quot;decision&quot; that a website needs to make to get 230 protections. It protects all websites and all users of websites when there is content posted on the sites by someone else.<p>&gt; To be a bit more explicit: at no point in any court case regarding Section 230 is there a need to determine whether or not a particular website is a &quot;platform&quot; or a &quot;publisher.&quot; What matters is solely the content in question. If that content is created by someone else, the website hosting it cannot be sued over it.<p>Edit:  BTW, I&#x27;d suggest reading that whole article.  Section 230 has been misrepresented by politicians and the media fairly regularly, and this piece does a nice job of laying out the current state of the law and its interpretation and application.')
