Some feedback:<p>It showed me a hotkey. I figured I could read it out of the config later, so I ignored it.<p>I run it. I have an open eye in my menubar. It has one option, &quot;activate license&quot;. This seems to imply I should buy a license, but that I didn&#x27;t get any popup when installing it telling me that I need a license to do anything, I&#x27;m not 100% sure.<p>Assuming it works as advertised, I&#x27;d probably pay $10 for it. I might pay $15 for it. But, I&#x27;d want to see it work first (it can have a 30 day trial, or one week trial), AND I feel tricked into downloading on unclear terms, AND after I installed it, it&#x27;s really not making anything clearer. It didn&#x27;t <i>say</i> it had a trial, but there&#x27;s usually not a big clear download button right on the front page for an app that you can <i>only</i> pay for without a trial. Usually, there&#x27;s an email to a download link, or a less prominent download button, because if you paid, you know you want to download it an will spend an extra second beyond expecting a giant button.<p>The touchbar leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I&#x27;d have been delighted to turn it off, but the whole experience of downloading this app and attempting to try it out and my mild confusion with the useless icon it leaves in my menubar without so much as properly explaining that it does nothing sort of wasted my time, confused me, and left a bad taste in my mouth so I&#x27;m going to uninstall the app and forget about it.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but just honest feedback that I don&#x27;t think most people would even bother to explain.')
