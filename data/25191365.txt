He claims he was getting paid through at least 2014 for the Star Wars novels, which would mean Disney was still paying him for 2 years after the Lucasfilm acquisition. That would have been about right for Disney to have had time to review all of the Lucasfilm contracts and stop payments on the ones where they weren&#x27;t actually required to pay. (This isn&#x27;t all that rare; at my former job we were paying $20k a year to a former employee and it wasn&#x27;t until one of the new general counsels asked <i>why</i> that we actually looked at the contract to see why were were still paying it. It wasn&#x27;t questioned until them because the company been making those payments for years, and in the scheme of things, was fairly immaterial. Ultimately, the former employee had been entitled to those payments for several years, but the contract term had long since run out. However, anyone with knowledge of the expiration date had since left the company, and their replacements just kept paying.)')
