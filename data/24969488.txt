Dan always found time to talk to you, whether it was at the local NYC meetup or one of the monster Kubecons. No matter how small your company, he tried to get everyone to be active in the community.<p>I have a quick Dan story. I saw him after a Kubecon keynote and I joked that he should have sent me the slides for review, because the numbers for diversity grants he showed on stage were great, but the total was wrong. Later that day, I saw him again at the evening party. I think it was in Austin, the crazy one where it snowed. He told me, still embarrassed, that he had checked and the numbers were wrong. Then, he handed me a couple of extra tickets for drinks. I think I&#x27;ll pour one for him now.')
