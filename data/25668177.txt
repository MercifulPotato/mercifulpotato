Most of these details are easily inferred from their online behavior, not to mention personal chats. Part of the problem is that no one is going to say &quot;I have something to hide&quot;. I&#x27;m not going to continue this rant because HN is not the audience that needs it but to summarize: defending privacy is an uphill battle and people are not right.')
