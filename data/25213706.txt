What you don&#x27;t know is this.<p>I disagree, at least in my experience there are significant differences between multiple regex engines I&#x27;m used to use regularly. In no particular order: are parens and other operators treated literally by default or do they need to be escaped? Are character class like &#x27;[:alpha:]&#x27; understood, or do I need to write them explicitly? Similarly, do I have access to \\w \\W \\s and friends? Can I use + to mean {1,} ? Can I use &#x27;?&#x27; to match 0 or 1 (common) or do I have to use = (vim)? Or maybe just {0,1}? But then should I escape the braces? Do I have recursion? Do I have named captures?<p>Those are not theoretical concerns, that&#x27;s stuff I routinely end up getting wrong because I forget that this one feature that works in pcre does not work in vim or works differently in sed etc...')
