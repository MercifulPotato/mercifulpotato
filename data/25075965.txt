The average user&#x27;s native binaries are mostly limited to said web browser, some work communication apps, maybe a notes app, maybe some dev tools or office tools or media tools depending on the person. Nothing remotely interesting to advertising companies. Maybe that will change with the new iOS app support, but I kind of doubt it.<p>And anyway, when we <i>are</i> talking about a phone, it would be literally impossible to run an app store without recording (and personally identifying!) that information. Maybe that&#x27;s one more argument to allow third-party app stores, which I&#x27;m not against (though who knows if they&#x27;re more trustworthy with that data?), but nevertheless.<p>My point is that in the grand scheme of privacy concerns, this is a very silly hill to die on. In the grand scheme of system reliability, on the other hand, it&#x27;s totally legitimate to be upset that this effectively took down thousands of expensive workstations across the world for a few minutes.')
