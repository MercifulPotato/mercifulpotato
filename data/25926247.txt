Item(by='badlucklottery', descendants=None, kids=[25928146], score=None, time=1611741379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925503, text='&gt; I have fairly small hands and I feel that my hands have to reach more using this keyboard than with other split keyboards Iâ€™ve used<p>The Moonlander has a lot of key rows for a &quot;flat&quot; keyboard so there&#x27;s going to be some reaching if you use them all. I have relatively large&#x2F;long hands and coming from a Kinesis Advantage (which has a similar number of rows) it was a <i>lot</i> of reaching for the top and bottom rows, especially the corner keys. I ended up putting a lot more keycodes on layers to get around it.<p>But I ended up building a Bastyl last month: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hidtech.ca&#x2F;?product=bastyl#tab-description" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hidtech.ca&#x2F;?product=bastyl#tab-description</a><p>I still get QMK and the true split design (which helps with my shoulders) but I also get the curved keywells back so I can hit everything on the keyboard pretty easily. I did lose that bottom row but I just pushed the useful keys to the thumb cluster.')
