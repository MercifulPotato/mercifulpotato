I use mate-terminal within EXWM, so at least my terminals appear in the buffers list.<p>EXWM does indeed block when emacs is busy. I haven&#x27;t found it a problem with my usage, but I imagine it could be annoying. Killing emacs ends the X session of course, as it&#x27;s the window manager, but I rarely need to restart emacs. Useful trick: If emacs really is stuck and Ctrl-G isn&#x27;t working, switching to a virtual terminal (eg. Ctrl-Alt-F2) and running `killall -SIGUSR2 emacs` will usually make it snap out of it. (I haven&#x27;t had to do that for months, though.)')
