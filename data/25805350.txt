And Algol allowed you to specify your own base, with &quot;LWB&quot; and &quot;UPB&quot; as a way to get the lower and upper bounds without needing to know the index.<p>Similarly, perl back when I used it let you set &#x27;$[&#x27; to change the array base index.<p>And there&#x27;s Dijkstra&#x27;s famous essay on the topic, at  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;users&#x2F;EWD&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;EWD08xx&#x2F;EWD831.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;users&#x2F;EWD&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;EWD08xx&#x2F;E...</a><p>I don&#x27;t know how to characterize all of those languages and people along the simple axis of &quot;borders&quot; and &quot;no-borders&quot;, and the author didn&#x27;t explain how that axis works.
