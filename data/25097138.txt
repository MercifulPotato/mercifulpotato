And luckily for techies in the valley, there are quite many great blow-out companies of much smaller size. In fact, I would cringe if a company&#x27;s goal is to grow from 300 engineers to thousands in a year, as Uber&#x27;s CTO used to boast. I would not join a big tech either because well, where is the 10X return?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, though. All I&#x27;m saying is that techies in the valley have a lot of amazing choices. Some people are definitely great at navigating big tech&#x27;s dynamics, and they should join big techs and enjoy phenomenal success. It&#x27;s just for even more people, joining a small company has a better chance of becoming successful, at least in terms of money and job satisfaction.')
