We visited the current tree (Son of...) as school kids and heard the story.<p>Imho, it&#x27;s persisted in Athens, GA lore because of the idea&#x27;s memetic virality rather than legal validity.<p>In other words, people find the idea of a beloved tree that owns itself just and right, and so do what they can legally and simply play along when legal possibilities are insufficient. Effectively, the tree wins a cultural victory.<p>The idea also resonates with two major themes in southern heritage and culture, now that I&#x27;m looking at this from an older pespective: quasi-religious responsibility to the land and an ethical struggle with slavery of intelligent beings.<p>The first is fairly self explanatory, in the Teddy Roosevelt-esque mold of being stewards of nature, while using its bounty.<p>The latter... post-Reconstruction southern culture has a complicated relationship with the idea of slavery in broader form, for obvious reasons, and manifesting in myriad ways (healthy and unhealthy).<p>So the idea of a living being (undeniably) beloved by its owner (undeniably) being granted freedom from ownership on the owner&#x27;s death... is about the only just and moral tale you can tell with respect to a tradition of slavery (leaving aside the inconvenient &quot;it took until the owner&#x27;s death&quot; timing). Note the legend sourcing back to ~40 years pre-Civil War (1820s), although obviously maintained post- as well.<p>I&#x27;m not one to pull current hot button topics into tortured historical analogies, but here I think it&#x27;s apt.<p>The concrete idea of a tree owning itself is dumb.<p>And yet, the people of Athens, GA and visitors want to believe in a world where that&#x27;s possible. And for ~200 years have acted to support that belief.<p>As a child, it instilled a belief in me that the legal system existed to codify <i>our desires</i>, not limit them, regardless of how odd they may be. Which probably wasn&#x27;t the worst lesson for a young child to take away.')
