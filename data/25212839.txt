Lean ticket trackers and productivity tools are perennially launched and invariably become as bloated as the incumbents.<p>This is because the information in these tools is business critical and needs to be consumed by almost everyone in the company. Moreover, different people need access to the same information in different forms of presentation, with aggregation and emphasis of different data. In contrast it&#x27;s easy to make a work tracker just for developers - GitHub and GitLab have pretty much solved that problem. Making a ticket tracker which works as a single source of truth for all members of an organization who need access to the tickets is much more difficult.<p>Developers, PMs, VPs, support staff, data scientists and designers all need access to overlapping information which is ideally stored in the form of tickets. But each of those roles needs something different from the tickets, both individually and in aggregate. You can&#x27;t just target a single group here, because then you&#x27;re trying to get the company to adopt separate repositories of work (it&#x27;s already an additional complexity that work is split between e.g. GitHub and Jira, for example).<p>So to obtain the critical mass of adoption they need for product market fit and growth, these tools organically evolve to become everything to everyone in an organization. And suddenly your tracking tool is stuffed with metrics, integrations, feeds, dashboards, reports, etc.<p>The other thing is that these tools become especially bloated by integrations and plugins. A brand new instance of any tracker or project manager feels clean and fast. A few years in, it feels slower and more crowded by all the custom&#x2F;third party additions rolled into it.')
