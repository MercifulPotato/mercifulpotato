It&#x27;s a bit of a cheat since they aren&#x27;t building a generic computer architecture, but a very very specialized one.<p>This is different with say Windows architecture. In windows vendors work on generic cpus&#x2F;gpus&#x2F;motherboards. Some hardware isn&#x27;t exactly available or uniformally accessible due to drivers and such. This is kind of the huge benefit Apple has by creating the hardware, OS, drivers, languages and libraries.')
