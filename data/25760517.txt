The way I try to live that, is setting up automatic $1&#x2F;month donations to all and every podcast&#x2F;blog&#x2F;oss project, etc I wish to support. They don’t track me, and I ensure more content to my liking will be produced. I wish ad based business models didn’t work so well - hopefully people will wise up to it and reject it.<p>The flip side of what you speak of is the force and coercion required to fund all these nice things.<p>I’ll use my country as an example: a family father may earn €4600&#x2F;month (a good salary indeed!) but after income tax and “employment fee” receive €2650. When they spend, they pay a 25% sales tax (VAT). This means he gets to spend about €1700 of the €4600 value he creates.

Their wives must often work too, and the obvious solution is to leave the kids in (government) daycare - which effectively is a daily abandonment trauma. The work I did for the government had a direct effect of children not seeing their fathers and mothers, but their upbringing being outsourced to the state. I think this is such a moral ugliness, I can have no part in it any more.')
