It doesn&#x27;t have to be fair. Google doesn&#x27;t have to decide to either let no lies through, or let all lies through.<p>It&#x27;s their platform, their property, they are allowed to do with it as they will. Just like a newspaper doesn&#x27;t have to print every letter sent in by a reader, or every ad someone wants printed. (This later example is something I have experience with: I was the editor of a college newspaper targeted by a white-supremacist holocaust-denying group that wanted me to print their anti-Semitic ads. I didn&#x27;t print them)<p>No one is entitled to the amplification of their views that these platforms make possible. They may be platforms that are publicly accessible, but they are privately owned &amp; operated, and I think it would be a serious blow to the concept of private property to essentially impose forced speech on them.<p>There are plenty of other platforms that will let someone run anything they want through them. Sure, they&#x27;re not as big and don&#x27;t have the audience that Google does, but again: <i>no one is entitled to that</i> Freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t require anyone to force others to repeat that speech.')
