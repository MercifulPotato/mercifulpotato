(Obvious being separate processes)<p>One has to also remember that even if your program would be memory safe it still does not guarantee its flawless nor secure. One very good recent personal experience I can give you is certain popular swift SQL library. It was written in swift which also boasts the &quot;memory safe by default&quot;. However, that library due to its design was subject to the very basic SQL injection attacks. Needless to say I ended up writing my own SQL bindings. I hope that library is now fixed or something replaced it, as since at the time I had to write swift (and no I didn&#x27;t like it), it was the only and most popular (scary) option on github.<p>I could also write long rant about threads and how the implementations and the threading primitives often have subtle bugs or are broken in different ways. And how using threads in general makes your application basically undefined unless you only absolutely know every piece of code that runs on that thread.')
