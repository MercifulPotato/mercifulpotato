The rate at which pitches get picked up for funding is not related to the rank of the engineers that the startup would hire. Startup engineers tend to be either younger and inexperienced or experienced, but average (i.e., not top-earners at big tech). In either case, they are risk-seekers who are willing to take lower salaries in exchange for equity with a slim chance at making it big. Startups are, generally speaking, under strict financial pressure. They usually can’t afford to pay market rate, let alone big tech (“We need the best people in the industry at any cost”) rates.')
