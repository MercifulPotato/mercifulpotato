It&#x27;s community feels a lot like how the Perl community did at the height of Perl&#x27;s popularity.<p>This is in contrast to Python&#x27;s (has a friendly community, but tends to have bikeshedding), Node&#x27;s (outright toxic npm-based warfare), or Java&#x27;s (corporations shit out awful code when they&#x27;re done with it, ie, everything donated to Eclipse or Apache, or all the dumpster fire code Google has released, and its up to you to judge how awful it really is).<p>Perl&#x27;s CPAN? Lots of really nice code that follows a pretty good UNIX &quot;does one thing, and does it well&quot; philosophy, with lots of friendly folks.<p>As long as Rust doesn&#x27;t have a Perl 6 moment, we&#x27;re good.')
