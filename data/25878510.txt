It is disappointing to see how quickly the climate of so much of the public commons has become so weaponized, so corrosive to participate in without some kind of a psychic jumpsuit. Maybe it was inevitable, anyways, with the rise of centralized social media.<p>When I think about centralized social media, I think about an ultra-fine grain subdivision and liquidation of human social interaction into a digitally mediated and transparently priced attention economy. I see an infinite screen pixelated by individual smartphones manned by individual human beings, being driven by a PageRank algorithm like a display controller. To visualize something like that is to visualize an incredible feat of human engineering. But it is also to visualize an intrinsically uncanny valley and a hellish cacophony of synthesized speech and high-strung puppets.<p>Do you get the sense that all the interaction is ginned up to seem more compelling than it really is, that it&#x27;s sort of an arms race. Well, maybe it is. Maybe it is the same cold war which never really ended, simply accelerated in a new era with new weapons, and of course horrific new ways to enact the same old brutalities.')
