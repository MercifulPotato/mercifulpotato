I looked at your post solely because it contrasted itself from your competitors claiming superiority, and was disappointed by all of the above AND that the fact that it couldn&#x27;t do the things it claimed to by making those contrasts.<p>All in all, disappointed to see a ycombinator funded project hoisted on HN with all the above going on, and one with a large number of investors behind it and no open source to back up their claims. This isn&#x27;t just a community built tool to improve developers&#x27; lives, this is a marketing push by a corporation with the intent to get a burst of customers with misleading&#x2F;questionable marketing.')
