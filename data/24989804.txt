Comment as much as possible, stating intention.<p>2. Don&#x27;t duplicate code. You need a function that does something similar to another one, but slightly differs? Do not duplicate it. Less code is less maintenance.<p>3. Don&#x27;t circlejerk over code quality, your goal as a programmer should be to write the best software you can. The end goal is the software, not the code. Stop circlejerking in pull requests, issue threads, wherever. Make the best software you can and move on to the next problem.')
