Hell, where I live there’s a law that can escalate to a 3rd degree felony if your dog <i>looks</i> like it can get out of its fence. What I suspect is an unsatisfying answer for you is that they aren’t enforced because they really aren’t a priority.<p>That’s unfortunately a part of living in a society. We can’t always agree on what priorities are worth our limited resources. We’ve generally agreed children are a priority and choose to enforce those laws more often. For every person annoyed by bad dog owners, there’s somebody who rails against noise pollution, poorly parked cars, yard maintenance etc etc')
