They spread themselves too thin, the game is less than the sum of its parts because half-finished subsystems weigh down what can be a very solid game when it focuses on its fundamentals.<p>OP says &quot;Some players expected this to be cyberpunk-themed RDR2&#x2F;GTA5&quot;. I think some higher ups at CDPR <i>wanted</i> for it to be that at the start, and they only corrected course very late into development when they realized that they&#x27;d never meet the deadline.<p>If they had cut off the driving completely for instance, and instead focusing on having things like taxis and public transportation, you&#x27;d get a much more immersive RPG setting and you wouldn&#x27;t have the immersion breaking, performance tanking, AI-stupidity-demonstrating driving and car chase sequences.<p>Then once the game is successful you can extend and improve it with expansions and sequels, building on top of a solid base.<p>Instead they managed to miss the deadline twice in a row <i>despite</i> making their devs crunch and despite all that they released a completely broken, unfinished game.')
