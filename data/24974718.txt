You interact with maintainers and their trees, but not necessarily always the same.<p>You clone a maintainers personal tree (which can be anywhere), make the change, and email them the patch with git send-email. They then apply it with git am -3. Trusted maintainers might tell another maintainer to pull their tree from wherever they put it, but they can place it wherever in the moment, including just on their own machine - it only needs to work for a single fetch as well, and could be a new location every time.')
