A few years later, they have the best phone on the market and… it didn&#x27;t change their dynamic much: it still sells very well, as before. On the laptop market, they have been selling subpar laptops for a few years without much issue, and I guess it won&#x27;t change much that they now have the best one.<p>Apple customers will get a much better deal for their bucks, which is good for their long term business, but I don&#x27;t think it will drive that many people out of the Windows world[1] just for that reason (especially with the migration&#x2F;compatibility issues which are even worse now than they where running on Intel).<p>Also, many people outside of HN just don&#x27;t listen to Apple “revolutionary” announcement, they have used that card too much, for no good reason most of the time, so people just stopped listening (even my friends who are actually Apple customers).<p>[1]: which is where most people are tbh, and I don&#x27;t think that many Linux people would switch either.')
