Getting grants 2.) Productive science 3.) Teaching. All the skills that the author has gained might help with #2, but he hasn&#x27;t actually published in the last years to prove that. And he has nothing to show for #1 and #3. All the while he is much older than other candidates, i.e. the university will get much less use (in particular of the service duties that are fulfilled later in the career) out of him. So why exactly should they hire him over somebody that has gotten a similar amount of experience while doing a postdoc or two and maybe a junior university position, while ALSO improving on grant writing experience and gaining teaching experience?')
