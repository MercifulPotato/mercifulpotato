Even my own if I can help it. HN is hard, it&#x27;s right in the corner there, but I really don&#x27;t tend to look at anyone else&#x27;s scores. Same with reddit or other sites I use with those systems.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I get the little dopamine rush and enjoy getting points and stuff, but I look at the whole thing the same way as a high score board on a video game or something.')
