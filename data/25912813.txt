Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, including a nuclear war, none of which came true. Subsequent closer examination of Titor&#x27;s assertions provoked widespread skepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator&#x27;s findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax.</i><p>Sounds more than a bit like QAnon, at least in design if not reach or effect.')
