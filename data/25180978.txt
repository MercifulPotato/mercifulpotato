Have you ever BOUGHT anything from Amazon and gotten screwed by them? Have you been given random stuff by third parties working (successfully!) to game the Amazon system so their garbage is full of fake testimonials and is #1 recommended Amazon product in their category?<p>Competitive businesses gotta start from somewhere or there will NEVER be any others. It will just be &#x27;what was competitive, once, and forever&#x27; because infrastructure and scale lock in and then you&#x27;re monopolized and it no longer matters.<p>Show me the alternative to Amazon. Show me the alternative to YouTube. There is by definition no competitive option to any of these things because they locked in controlling positions, and now it doesn&#x27;t matter what they do: they are NOT subject to any sort of competitive forces because it&#x27;s too late. It doesn&#x27;t matter what they do to consumers: there&#x27;s nowhere else to go.')
