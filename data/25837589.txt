BUT, to make a distinction between protesters in Washington and were arrested for entering the building unlawfully, and protesters from the same group who distributed bombs around seems...disingenuous. You can certainly make that distinction, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a useful one. A large group of protestors supporting Trump came to washington. Some broke into the capitol, others did other stuff. Many are under arrest for weapons violations and have been charged. That isn&#x27;t &quot;fake&quot;')
