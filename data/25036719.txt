Item(by='mumblemumble', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604940705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25036480, text='&gt; &quot;community areas&quot; is bureaucrat-speak for neighborhoods.<p>Not exactly. &quot;Community areas&quot;, in Chicago, represent a relatively stable division of the city, with the map drawn up by the government, in order to support city planning and suchlike. Many of them are named for the most prominent neighborhood that falls within their borders, but that&#x27;s not always the case.<p>Neighborhoods are a popular division, and is socially constructed by people as a whole. The boundaries are amorphous and constantly shifting. At my last apartment, my own neighbors described our block as falling within about 3 different neighborhoods. (This never resulted in any argument, because everyone understands that the definition of neighborhood is fuzzy at best.) Even where you have a community area and a neighborhood that share the same name, they don&#x27;t necessarily coincide all that well. For example, just about nobody who lives in the area would recognize the boundaries of &quot;Lincoln Square&quot; as being those of the Lincoln Square community area. To them &quot;Lincoln Square&quot; means the the Lincoln Square neighborhood, which, even by the most generous of standards, is still maybe 1&#x2F;5 the size of the community area by land mass.<p>Aldermanic wards are yet another thing, and their boundaries really don&#x27;t have much to do with neighborhoods or community areas. For starters, there are officially 50 aldermanic wards and 77 community areas.')
