They could verify I owned the actual account and I answered all security questions but they still wouldn&#x27;t fix whatever issue I had (this was at least 5 years ago so I forget particulars).<p>That experience forever turned me off to relying on digital-only.<p>To your points, having a PSN account is necessary but I can always create a new one if need be.<p>Whenever possible, I prioritize non-DRM media for purchase.')
