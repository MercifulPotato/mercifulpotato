I said that teachers will be wrong about things. That only means they&#x27;re fallible and don&#x27;t get things right all the time.<p>If any teacher, or <i>literally anyone else</i>, is offended by the suggestion that they&#x27;re human and could be wrong sometimes then I think I&#x27;m OK with offending them. If you think you&#x27;re perfect and will never be wrong then frankly you deserve to be offended as often as possible.')
