Oh they took this freedom away. Well I don’t mind, because it doesn’t affect me. Or just do this for a little while. Just go without it for a few weeks. Months. Half a year. Rules with barely any effect, implemented on the flimsiest of pretexts that seem to have no end in sight. Statistical half truths to sell the rules.<p>And the solution, vaccination? Delay after delay and every day there’s a new dramatic story about how 1 guy got an allergic reaction, or how someone really isn’t all that sure it’ll help against the scary new mutations.<p>It is incredibly frustrating yet I want to keep track of the news at least for a bit so I can do whatever little I can to change it.<p>At least the finger pointing has gone away a bit. In this thread I only saw a few of the ‘if only other people had kept to the rules’ blame game comments.')
