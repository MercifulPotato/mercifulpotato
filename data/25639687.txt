Many investment managers, who previously only flirted with cryptocurrencies, have started making rather high price predictions to their followers or investors. Most hold a 1% to 5% of their portfolio in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a hedge but not as a primary bet. If I remember correctly, a 1% position in Bitcoin in 2017 combined with a 99% position in the S&amp;P500 would’ve doubled the performance of a 100% S&amp;P500 portfolio. Something like a 14% return vs a 28% return. (Then in 2018 if you didn’t rebalance your portfolio, it would’ve dropped down quite a bit.)')
