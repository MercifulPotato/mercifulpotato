There&#x27;s a lot to be said for that.<p>The USSR&#x27;s later leadership didn&#x27;t want to give the Premier the authority to start WWIII. That authority belonged to the Politburo, and, having gotten rid of Stalin, those who had power after him didn&#x27;t want that much power in one person again.<p>Hence the Dead Hand system. The Premier could activate that in an emergency. All it really did was, if Moscow was destroyed, and the Premier&#x27;s bunker wasn&#x27;t communicating, and the General Staff bunker wasn&#x27;t communicating, was start a timer of several hours. If nobody in authority checked in during that time, it released the launch codes to regional commanders, who could then decide on their own what to do. So a lot of people could stop a retaliatory strike, and no one person could start it.<p>The USAF&#x27;s SAC had the actual info needed to launch missiles in the hands of SAC commanders, a much weaker system. While General Power was head of SAC, the arming codes for the missiles themselves were set to all zeros. This was not known by the civilians supposedly overseeing the US military.')
