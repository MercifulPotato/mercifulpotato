In that regard, if you purposely (or naively) misuse Comic Sans, then yes, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the font&quot;.<p>&gt; (which IIRC was taken from Ruby or something).<p>Bingo. Ruby&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s favorite language, so please be ready that people will send you rays of some hard love in that regard. Did you consider using C syntax for C-replacement-wannabe?
