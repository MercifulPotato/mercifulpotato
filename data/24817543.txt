But it&#x27;s not even remotely in the same league as AWS&#x2F;GC&#x2F;Azure.<p>All you get is DNS, private networks, load balancers VMs and storage volumes.  That&#x27;s it.<p>Sure, you can self-host Kubernetes, and they even have a CSI driver for mounting volumes and an official Terraform provider. Which is great.<p>But you miss out on the  incredibly rich service offerings you get from the others.<p>It&#x27;s a great start though, and I hope they keep expanding their offerings.')
