I would consider you utterly ignorant if you didn&#x27;t know anyone known by several billion people.<p>There was this concept of general knowledge you used to aspire to which is becoming quickly replaced by the atomization of information among tiny communities which go unaware of each other, this might end up as some postmodern version of the Middle Ages. As I&#x27;m old-fashioned I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea, but folks don&#x27;t tend to care about general good ideas if they find them personally unpleasant in some way, that&#x27;s another recent trend.<p>Oh, I had to become familiar with Emmy Noether BTW, when you do Particle Physics it&#x27;s hard not to. I can write down the two versions of her most famous theorem we referred to. I think the less useful one was nicely left for you to learn about from a review by Hill from 1951, but I&#x27;d have to look it up.<p>The great thing about having seen grown the Internet when gopher was awe inspiring as a teenager is that you know how to work with books, paper and your memory plus you know all the tricks after having been googling for 22 years. You&#x27;re also aware of lots of stuff that isn&#x27;t online yet and where to find it physically. Pretty cool huh? Too bad that&#x27;s dying.<p>Do you know anything interesting about say Artin&#x27;s algebra books now that we&#x27;ve been talking about Emmy? For instance why I&#x27;m mentioning Artin? What about that famous Hilbert&#x27;s actually feminist quip involving Emmy&#x27;s application? That would have been nice upper level general knowledge for instance, not limited to STEM people.')
