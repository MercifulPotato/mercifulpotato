It works in many cases, but sometimes it does not fit naturally the problem at hand.<p>Modules relax this single-type requirement, and let you define multiple types in it, which makes certain things more natural to express, without a need to create multiple shallow classes or manager-like classes.<p>Also, functors (i.e. &quot;module functions&quot;) in the OCaml module system allows generics, when a module is essentially parameterized by one or more other modules.')
