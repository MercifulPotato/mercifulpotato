Everything else, including a^b, is syntactic sugar. (If you define exp on C, even sin and cos...)<p>Why do you think this? It doesn&#x27;t seem to fit historically or formally. 3^2 is a more elementary object than anything built with exp, and there&#x27;s often no natural notion of exp(A) of a function A even when finite powers like A^3 are defined. exp(A) is defined with a power series that may not converge.')
