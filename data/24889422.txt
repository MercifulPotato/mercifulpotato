Item(by='HOOVERDAM', descendants=3, kids=[24889465], score=3, time=1603656110, title='Looking for a Mentor', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Is there some type of service outside of higher learning that can put me together with a mentor of some kind to guide me in further developing my skills? I believe am hitting a ceiling with what I can do on my own just from ambition&#x2F;work ethic&#x2F;&quot;talent&quot;. I feel I am at the point where it would be more cost effective for some external force like a professor or the pursuit of another piece of paper to push me where I want to be in my craft rather than to continue being self taught and take more time to reach this point on my own. Cost of paying for school&#x2F;hiring a mentor isn&#x27;t really the concern here, rather the return on time invested seems to be diminishing the more I go on my own. I purposely left this generic to see what people in any field have done if they have reached this point in their career, but to provide some context, my ultimate goal is to reach a master level in CS coming from an unrelated engineering background&#x2F;undergrad studies.')
