In France, you would get this feedback more often than in, say, the Dutch or Swedish language areas.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s not just <i>getting</i> feedback that counts, it&#x27;s also <i>being open to</i> feedback. Relative to an adult, a child doesn&#x27;t mind getting embarrassed as much. Adults often don&#x27;t want to lose face, and are then less likely to learn the language with full abandon. Natural language learning ability aside, I made quicker advances than other people because I didn&#x27;t care about making silly&#x2F;stupid mistakes but others did.')
