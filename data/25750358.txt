They&#x27;re clearly in the minority. There&#x27;s growing interest in garden variety fascism. Some of the hallmarks of that are nationalism, militarism, submission to authority, anti-intellectualism, fomenting fear of &quot;the other&quot; and outsiders. Umberto Eco has a list [1] that encapsulates and explains these. And, I&#x27;m sorry, but a lot of these describe the trajectory of the current Republican Party, especially under Trump&#x27;s rule. (note: I think the GOP has largely abandoned what we would call &quot;conservatism&quot;. Even though many of those left in the party might self-identify as conservative, they have veered into fascist ideology, they just won&#x27;t admit it)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openculture.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openculture.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;umberto-eco-makes-a-list...</a>')
