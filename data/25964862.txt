There&#x27;s an ocean of difference between &quot;we finished the year down 98% but we met all of our obligations&quot; and &quot;we finished the year down 100%, and we also failed to meet our obligations&quot;. Those obligations include the repurchase and repayment of short-sold stocks sold by the brokerage.<p>WSB wants a short squeeze. They got that. But, their theory is that it isn&#x27;t over, and if they get the 10x+ returns in the coming weeks (I don&#x27;t think they will, but lets say they do), then these funds are potentially looking at commitments that approach their AUM, and a nasty margin call. That&#x27;s a real recipe for shutting down, and if that happens, there is no more short to squeeze. Everyone loses.')
