I think the NextLogic centralized barge scheduling initiative started back in 2012 or so (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextlogic.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextlogic.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>) and is only running in production for a handful of terminals and barge operators since the start of this year. Centralized planning is a bitch of a problem, not for technical reasons, but for political ones. I could go on and on about the various reasons parties did not want to participate, even though in principle everybody agrees that a centralized planning will be more efficient than every terminal doing it on their own.')
