If there&#x27;s something wrong with the PR (say, code style issues or mistakes) then you need to run through the cycle all over again.<p>The project is open source in that you&#x27;re free to use it, sell it and go through its code. Open source does not, however, imply that someone must put in the work for you if you want to apply changes to the code yourself.<p>If you&#x27;d like a version of the project that takes pull requests, then you can always create a fork that accepts pull requests and comments. This puts the burden go testing, merging and quality control on you, but most of the work you&#x27;ll be doing is what you&#x27;re expecting the developers of a product to do for you anyway. If your energy pays off and your fork has less bugs, more features and becomes more popular, the original developers may turn around and cooperate with you instead.')
