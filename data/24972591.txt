I love\nlearning about operating systems, compilers, and databases. In my free time, I&#x27;m\nwriting my own C compiler in Rust, which you can find on my GitHub.<p>I currently work full time as a backend software engineer at a SaaS start up.\nI&#x27;m looking for opportunities that inspire my passions, so internal\ninfrastructure that handles big data sets, high throughput, or low latency are\nareas I&#x27;m super interested in. I&#x27;m mostly looking for work in either C++, Go, or\nRust. Other than those areas, I&#x27;m also deeply interested in open source\nsoftware.<p>I am also finishing my degree in Computer Science at MIT this December. Looking for full time\nwork starting in early 2021. Only interested in positions that are remote or in Boston or the Manhattan area of NYC.')
