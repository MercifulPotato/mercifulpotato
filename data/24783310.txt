I&#x27;d say the &quot;file-based web&quot; is still very much alive. A lot of those files I&#x27;ve come across (usually old software and docs) are unlikely to be found anywhere else, as I&#x27;m not even sure if archive.org archives FTP sites. IMHO this is a significant part of the Internet that must be kept alive, because it holds invaluable amounts of irreplaceable data.')
