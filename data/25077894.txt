The Connecticut Compromise is a great example.  You&#x27;re taught that the large states wanted representation in proportion to population, and the small states wanted states to be represented identically (regardless of population), for obvious reasons.  So, they decided to split the difference, making one house proportional and the other population-independent.  While they did this because it was the only thing they could get agreement on, it was <i>also</i> the greatest civic invention since democracy itself... by coincidence, I guess?<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty weird.')
