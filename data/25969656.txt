Probably not.<p>But this isn&#x27;t Robinhood &quot;manipulating the market to support Hedge Funds (or whoever the new enemy is today[0]); this is Robinhood having a gold-plated pile of dog-shit that they&#x27;ve been selling as solid gold for the last couple of years, and now the cracks are showing.<p>[0] I heard this morning that the new enemy who is trying to manipulate the market is the DTCC.
