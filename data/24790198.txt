Though related, they are distinct issues that can exist independently.<p>That said a world wide safety net would be a good thing to advocate for on moral grounds, no?<p>The EU has open borders for all EU citizens, and for the most part it&#x27;s faring ok.  There has not been a Europe-wide social safety net crisis as a result of this freedom, and crucially for this argument: <i>there isn&#x27;t an EU wide social safety net</i>.  It has freedom of movement without a universal safety net.<p>The USA&#x27;s states are effectively countries.  All USA citizens have open borders to travel between states in the USA.  For the most part, it&#x27;s faring ok and there has not been a USA-wide social safety net crisis caused by this freedom either.<p>Iceland and cheese for everyone: That sounds like what&#x27;s called the slippery slope fallacy.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slippery_slope" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slippery_slope</a>')
