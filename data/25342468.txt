What&#x27;s more flexible than being able to write the code that does the thing you want it to do, rather than creating, then mixing and matching objects&#x2F;abstractions that you very likely have a surface level understanding of?<p>There&#x27;s a huge misunderstanding of &#x27;flexibility&#x27; within codebases. You can achieve &#x27;flexibility&#x27; via the lack of programming rules. Yet objects&#x2F;abstractions&#x2F;encapsulations are literal rules applied onto code to achieve some benefit (less code, increased surface understandability, etc), it&#x27;s less about flexibility. And the quoted systems feel like they have little benefit to one&#x27;s codebase.')
