On one hand, as someone else said, it&#x27;s not the building a SaaS app that entrepreneurs are proud of -- it&#x27;s building the business and building the company. That in and of itself is a lot more impressive to me than building just an app.<p>Is it as impressive and historically significant as the great scientific discoveries of Newton? Maybe, but probably not. Or maybe they are apples and oranges. Suppose Newton had a collaborator who built a giant manufacturing empire with his discoveries. Would those two be comparable in terms of &quot;who was more important&quot;, or would comparison simply cease to be meaningful at this point?<p>To your point, maybe that&#x27;s what makes the Newton comparison somewhat of a non-sequitor -- it&#x27;s at best a reach.')
