But if you took someone who wasn&#x27;t being hit on the head with a baseball bat, and you asked them if they wanted it, they would say no.  I think that if you took someone who was immortal, and asked them if they wanted to die for benefit X, they would say no.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;aSQy7yHj6nPD44RNo&#x2F;how-to-seem-and-be-deep" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;aSQy7yHj6nPD44RNo&#x2F;how-to-see...</a>')
