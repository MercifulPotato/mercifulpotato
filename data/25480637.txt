It even fits the pithy little saying in the article:<p><pre><code>    Classes are awesome. What if we made a PL where everything was a class?\n</code></pre>\nI mean, you can use lambdas, but last time I used C# you could still only use them inside a class definition.*<p>*Note: I haven&#x27;t used C# in a while, do you guys have free functions yet?
