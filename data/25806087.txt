But a lot of the time people express feelings indirectly, and it&#x27;s pointless to try to change everyone&#x27;s communication style. So people sometimes use praise if they&#x27;re happy about something, or whatever, and I interpret that in a way that suits my well being.<p>It&#x27;s just part of the communication style of someone, or even part of a culture of a country. If it bothers me, and it is the relationship I care about or looks to be long term, I may ask the person to communicate differently with me.<p>But most of the time I get praise from random people on the internet, and I just interpret it that they are grateful for my contributions, regardless of what they say.<p>Sometimes they want something from me, and are probably not comfortable with just asking for it, so they pad the communication with some praise about the software or me. Some state that they&#x27;re uncomfortable asking for help more directly, some just add praise at the beginning&#x2F;end of each reply. (which gets kinda strange after 3-4 interactions :))<p>It&#x27;s nice if someone communicates more directly, but I can try to understand the other people, too, regardless of communication style.')
