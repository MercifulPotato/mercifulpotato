Replaced my rear pads at the weekend, maybe 0.2mm remaining after around 800 miles or so of riding.<p>Getting oil on pads is also fairly easy to (accidentally) do.  Learnt to be less liberal with the spray oil the hard way!<p>Unfortunately for bike shops replacing disk brake pads is trivial.  Bleeding the Hydraulic system not so much, if it wasn&#x27;t for the stopping power I&#x27;d trade back to brake cables any day.')
