The design is simple and usable to an almost miraculous degree. The distributed sourcing of information with mind-blowing moderation is pioneering and of upmost respectability.<p>Its ability to endure through the onslaught of addictive capitalist pressures and sheer ethical reasonableness is something very special, resisting ads for the sake and benefit of humanity, I almost want to cry just writing about it.<p>I could say so much more, but what I want to get to is - Thank you Wikipedia. You have changed countless lives and spread unthinkable knowledge to unfathomable futures. Hard to believe it&#x27;s only been 20 years, I can&#x27;t imagine a universe without you.<p>Please donate if you use Wikipedia. The world needs it.')
