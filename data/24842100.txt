If you have the start of a 3byte character you can just read the next two bytes and don&#x27;t need to check if any of the two trailing bytes is actually a nullchar instead (in case of null-terminated strings) or whether pos+2&lt;len. Because otherwise you&#x27;d do an oob read. Also you don&#x27;t need to check if the trailing bytes of your char actually start with 10xxxxxx, you can just mask off the first two bits right away.')
