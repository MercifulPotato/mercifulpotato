Google had no legal obligation to build Content ID and preemptively take things down (and, as it turns out, way more aggressively than they legally need to be).<p>In the same way, it seems GitHub is preemptively telling people that if they re-post youtube-dl on GH, they&#x27;ll be banned, even though GH has no legal responsibility to do so.  It&#x27;s really sad that they&#x27;re siding with big business in all this, rather than their users, without whom they&#x27;d be nothing.')
