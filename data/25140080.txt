I am okay with that, so I will focus on leaving a record for anyone who stumbles on this unfortunate thread.<p>You do not have even the fundamental facts of the situation. &quot;Lavonia County&quot; is not a real place. Livonia is a city in Wayne County. There are some precincts where there are small gaps between the expected number of ballots and the actual number cast. This is typical, and its ubiquity reflected in the fact that statewide recounts reliably produce shifts in ballot counts on the order of ~100. The relative sizes and frequency of these gaps is actually larger in Livonia than in Detroit. These gaps do not demonstrate partisan lean, nor do they evidence voter fraud. Voter fraud is extremely uncommon, it does not shift the outcome of state-wide elections, and it does not demonstrate reliable partisan lean: there are dishonest people of all political stripes.<p>In spite of these facts, the commissioners asked to certify the results of Livonia and the rest of Wayne County, excluding Detroit. My position is that disenfranchising Detroit is immoral, racist, and a brazen attempt to subvert our electoral system.')
