When the general public raises the important question of how much extractive behavior there is in HFT and asks whether the benefits outweigh the value lost by disadvantaged parties, they get brushed off and told that they’re ignorant. Your response focuses on one specific technical allegation while casually admitting that yeah, maybe there’s another type of extractive behavior that happens but “don’t you know the difference between one technical definition of extractive behavior and another?” At the same time no actual answer is given to the core question — presumably the assumption being that unless you are in the HFT world you’re not qualified to have the question answered, even if it affects you and you’re paying for it.')
