They are single developers or start-ups not used to match what they intended to develop with the LGPL license terms. Their primary mistake was to trust the sales guys. I had personal contact with some of them, and in no case was a commercial licence objectively necessary. Sure, it&#x27;s not the only way inexperienced people get ripped off, but it doesn&#x27;t help confidence and clarity, which is what this thread is about.')
