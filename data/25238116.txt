It&#x27;s used by pretty much every foundational AWS service. There&#x27;s a separate internal service for consensus that uses paxos.<p>The thread per frontend member definitely sounds like a problematic early design choice. It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time  I heard of an AWS issue due to &quot;too many threads&quot;. Unlike gRPC, the internal RPC framework defaults to a thread per request rather than an async model. The async way was pretty painful and error prone.')
