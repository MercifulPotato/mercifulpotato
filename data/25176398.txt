They charge heaftily (more than $2000) to teach app development (using Scratch, Firebase etc.). Their staff is poorly paid and just reads off scripts. Their staff doesn&#x27;t know even the basics of CS (as evidenced in this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1Y21eSn_zSM?t=64" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1Y21eSn_zSM?t=64</a>, when the student asks how files are stored in Cloud Storage, she says the files are stored in real clouds. There&#x27;s another where the teacher can&#x27;t tell the difference between Java and Javascript)<p>Their ads are highly misleading and straight up false with made up names of students who earned millions of dollars in salary while their fellow peers are playing Cricket.

You can imagine the effect this will have parents (especially in India where parents are known be super competitive).<p>This guy, Pradeep Poonia, has been actively campaigning against them. His youtube channels were taken down, Quora account was taken down, Twitter, even Reddit (if i&#x27;m not wrong). His current youtube (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCdv4_YNXrIQtGHSVXnY-1mg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCdv4_YNXrIQtGHSVXnY-1mg</a>) has lot of videos on this.<p>He especially has a video (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lN1DOE7GoYw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lN1DOE7GoYw</a>) where he accessed their internal slack (shady I know, but even Whitehat Jr is also not playing fair) and showed their organized effort into suppressing online dissent by fake twitter accounts, trolling etc.<p>WhiteHatJr was recently acquired by another firm Byju&#x27;s (whose CEO is the plaintiff in this lawsuit) that also does the same thing, but for entire school curriculum.<p>In a world, where there is Khan Academy, they sell their subpar product at a very high price, exploiting Indian parents&#x27; ignorance and willingness to do anything for their kids education.')
