The lie is the point.<p>You saw this when Russia invaded Ukraine: Vladimir Putin and other Russian propaganda efforts spout easily disprovable lies about what&#x27;s happening, about what was plainly visible in the news (Russian soliders and vehicles crossing the border).<p>Russia wasn&#x27;t trying to hide the lie, the point of the lie was to make you waste time fact-checking it, and then do the thing they needed anyway - which was you had to repeat the lie and then expend disproportionate rhetorical resources disputing it. And then they can simply turn around and tell another lie.<p>The idea that better fact-checking somehow will solve any problem is ignoring what the point of modern propaganda is - it&#x27;s about dominance and power.')
