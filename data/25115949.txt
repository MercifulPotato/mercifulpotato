Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25116249], score=None, time=1605555084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115267, text='&gt; Why isn&#x27;t it valid to acknowledge all the data&#x2F;risks, and still feel like we should just let the virus run its course?<p>It&#x27;s technically valid, but tiresome to rehash the same broadly rejected viewpoints over an over.  What you called &quot;toeing the covid line&quot; above is basically agreeing with the consensus of experts who actually know what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>&gt; But people who believe all the numbers and still think we are overreacting are still being censored&#x2F;ignored to oblivion. Not only that, but my (highly reliable ;-) anecdata tells me that most of these people are busy raising kids and growing the food you eat. Just because they don&#x27;t have the time to spray their opinions all over the internet and petition their govt officials to freak out doesn&#x27;t mean that their viewpoints are less valid.<p>Oh, I know some of those people, and they&#x27;re part of the reason the state my parents still live in has been a covid shitshow for several months and only <i>just</i> came around to imposing a mask mandate and occupancy limits.  Their viewpoints are definitely less valid, being either wishful thinking or lack of concern for others.')
