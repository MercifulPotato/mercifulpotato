I play regularly with a group of friends, and found out this week that several of my colleagues play it too. DE really is AOE2 in its finest form: Fixed netcode, responsiveness, matchmaking, and continuous patches and balance tweaks.<p>It&#x27;s a 20-year old game that gets monthly patches, and is active enough to match you to opponent[s] in minutes.<p>Compared to SC2, I miss the asymmetry among Civs, and ability to pull off surprising strategies effectively. (eg Thor rushes, and going straight planetary fortress+Raven etc). AOE is more predictable by comparison.<p>Thoughts on if AOE2 DE players are mostly people who played the original, or if there are newer players? The pros seem to be a mix.')
