No &quot;what are the last 10 places on the web&quot;, or anything of the sort.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a very conversational approach, so there is nothing specifically structured there. I knew I was trying to create a customer persona, and there are a few specific questions I knew I wanted answers to, but not a survey, a conversation.<p>I&#x27;ll lead the conversation along the lines of &quot;what have you tried to help you sleep&quot;, then based on that &quot;how did you hear about that&quot;, &quot;how did you decide what eye mask to buy&quot;, &quot;I haven&#x27;t heard of that solution before, where did you find it?&quot;, &quot;who do you talk to about your sleep issues, why them, do they have sleep trouble as well?&quot;<p>I was looking to understand the customer, not specifically looking for a channel, but in those discussions we found some very surprising consistencies which made us go...what?...that&#x27;s the stupidest thing I&#x27;ve ever heard! but then...yeah, it&#x27;s a thing I guess :)<p>I see a few issues with the &quot;What sleep related sites...&quot; questions, which I think many people would likely ask.<p>1) If you&#x27;re in the market, you should know those sites without them telling you. So you&#x27;re kinda wasting your time and theirs. Specific to sleep, most people don&#x27;t even speak to their doctors about sleep, so their isn&#x27;t a &quot;place they go&quot;, it&#x27;s more a &quot;what do you do&quot;, and then pulling on that string.<p>2) Competitors are likely at any site related to your community, so you&#x27;re just adding to the noise (same as being the noise in a facebook advertisement, etc).<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean about a &quot;gamified experience&quot;, your customers are people, treat them that way. I don&#x27;t think you need 1000 answers. Speak to a few people a day, and in a few months you&#x27;ve got more than 100 people, and you should be able to spot the necessary threads.')
