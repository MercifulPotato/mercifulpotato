Really? Do you understand how that sounds?<p>Please do explain how someone makes a message appear in your browser when you visit a particular website, without having access to a highly privileged browser extension? That can at minimum monitor the URLs you&#x27;re visiting?<p>I honestly really hope you aren&#x27;t on the Google security team, because you seem to be missing the issue here. Someone who had a high level of access was fired for violating  basic trust, apparently with the collaboration of her coworkers. What other things could this person have done to advance her political goals by subverting her access for things it wasn&#x27;t meant for? Outsiders can&#x27;t know. All they can see is that the company doesn&#x27;t have a grip on its own workforce. That is <i>not</i> confidence inspiring.')
