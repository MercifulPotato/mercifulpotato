There’s a strong social need for people—especially those who are public figures or soliciting job offers—to be reachable by “never before seen” contacts.<p>There’s also a strong social need to allow people to send emails from self-provided (I.e. unverified) names or identities, given the currently burdensome process of getting “verified”.<p>I think you could argue that there’s an opportunity to move business email to “real ID”-verified identities (e.g. with SMIME), but I struggle to see how that’s a problem with SMTP or how replacing the protocol will help there.')
