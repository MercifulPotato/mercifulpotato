Over time or if you do not print continuously, the printhead can become damaged and&#x2F;or clogged. HP&#x2F;Canon keeps the printhead on the cartridge itself so the printheads are replaced continuously.<p>2) There is an infamous problem &quot;Epson Ink pad is at the end of its service life error&quot;. The Ink pad absorbs excess ink during printing and needs to be replaced after a while. Unfortunately to reset the error you need to send it back to Epson for servicing (even if you replace the inkpad itself). Epson claims that this error is also tied to the service lifetime of other parts in the system and they would need to be replaced as well (AKA: planned obsolescence).<p>The cost of shipping + servicing + parts replacement is more than just replacing the printer all together.<p>Even though the EcoTank fixes the ink refill issue it forces you to buy a whole new printer after a certain amount of use.')
