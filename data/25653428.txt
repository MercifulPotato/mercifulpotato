The author says that money they have when they die is of zero value to them. It’s the polar opposite of my perspective, as a person with a special needs child who must plan to support that child beyond my death.<p>So I’m surprised that I am getting chastised for this comment.<p>A quote from the article that stood out to me: “For me, though, a billion dollars after either I’m too old to enjoy it or after I’m dead is worth nothing. I’d literally rather have one dollar in my hand today.“')
