I had the &quot;opportunity&quot; to watch how fighting and being rough played out in class where my daughter was. There were like two boys who attacked other boys, verbally or physically.<p>Majority of boys were unhappy about the situation, did not liked being insulted or pushed or being attacked. Their parents complained about issue, because their boys stopped liking going to school for that reason.<p>I really don&#x27;t think the solution should be &quot;boys are boys and therefore more aggressive one should be allowed to attack other boys&quot;. That literally harms boys that done nothing wrong. The thing about &quot;boys fighting among themselves&quot; is that pretty often, it is not consensual, it is one boy attacking another.')
