The way U.S. and state gov&#x27;ts create and pass legislation is a playground of perverse incentives, opaque procedure, and the worst aspects of gamesmanship.<p>One immediate fix would be for strict party line votes being the norm.  It would remove horse trading from the equation: a majority party would pass the legislation it wants to, without adding extreme elements to negotiate away, or riders to buy critical swing votes.  The result would be more coherent legislation that can be judged on its merits.')
