Elixir documentation feels like it&#x27;s written in a way that wants you to be successful and enjoy the process, while Erlang documentation feels very perfunctory. Where Elixir documentation is rife with examples and hints, Erlang documentation almost makes you feel like an idiot for wanting to see similar examples.<p>I wonder how much of that vibe is more due to priming because of community perception more than anything else. There&#x27;s a distinct stereotype of Erlangers having a strong &quot;I am very smart&quot; vibe. That&#x27;s not fair to a lot of the wonderful Erlang fans I&#x27;ve met that are extremely welcoming, but the wider Erlang community has a strong perception of gatekeeping where they almost don&#x27;t seem like they <i>want</i> the language to be more accessible.')
