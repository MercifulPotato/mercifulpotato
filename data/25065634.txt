The e-ink screen makes it look like a proper piece of paper since it’s illuminated by outside light. I think that really changes the concept. If I want a TV hanging on the wall, that’s easy enough (as you say). If I want a daily newspaper hanging on the wall looking like the real thing, I bet e-ink looks a lot better.')
