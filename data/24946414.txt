Took about 3 hours to make the full transition.<p>Build times went from 10 seconds to 0.2s.<p>I don&#x27;t love the template language but once we&#x27;ve coded blog post pagination, head tags, image optimisation etc. it&#x27;s rare you need much more.<p>The speed up feels amazing when you&#x27;re developing, I love that it&#x27;s a single binary as you know it&#x27;ll build without issues when you return to it in a few months, and it has enough built in (Sass, minifying, JavaScript bundler, image optimisation) that you just focus on site content rather than procrastinating with your build chain.')
