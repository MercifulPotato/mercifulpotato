It seems to be claiming 20% efficient panel can be made into a 45% efficient panel with just a surface treatment, which would be obvious BS.<p>Comments toward the end suggest that it would not improve an existing panel (much?) but would enable a much thinner panel to extract as much energy as the ones now fielded. That might mean, what? Lighter panels, roll-up panels, ink-jet sprayed panels?')
