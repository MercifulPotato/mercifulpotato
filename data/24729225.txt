You may pay for the reduction in interactive latency with an upfront loading cost, but when comparing to desktop applications that is often not too bad anyway (Excel doesn&#x27;t load immediately on most PCs, games of any modern design generally don&#x27;t either). People are more willing to wait a second or few initially than they are to wait half a second when getting more data from an app that they consider to already be loaded.<p>The problem is that many are not properly designed. In fact often the patten is often used when it is not really appropriate and a fairly static site would (again with that caveat: if properly designed) be much more efficient and just as user-friendly.')
