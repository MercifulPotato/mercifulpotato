When it happens but you aren&#x27;t aware of it, you start to degrade in various ways and if you pile the unknownness (what is happening? why do I feel this way? why am I not getting done what I want to get done?) on top of it, it&#x27;s not a fun time. At least, that&#x27;s a factor I&#x27;ve read about recently; plenty more factors and angles. That&#x27;s not to say that changing patterns is inherently bad, but changing too much at once or a change that must be synchronous and immediate vs. gradually and asynchronous are very different processes for us humans.<p>By the way, it might also be a misspelling (work politics vs woke politics); but coincidentally this applies there as well but to a lesser degree.')
