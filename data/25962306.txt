It argues that the best explanation for that observed difference is differences in clinical culture between the clinics; and, that despite this substantial variation in diagnosis rates, the clinics took an unusually rigorous approach to diagnosis, suggesting that in a broader set of clinics (most of whom would approach diagnosis with less rigour) the variation is likely to be even higher.<p>Although we have diagnostic instruments, such as the ADOS-2 (which along with the ADI-R is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot;), they have problems. One problem is that the standards for using these instruments clinically are a lot weaker than the standards for research use. [1] is a study which attempts to measure the accuracy of ADOS(-2) coding by clinicians, by comparing it to the consensus coding of experienced researchers – it found a high variability in the accuracy of the clinical codings – some clinicians were quite close to the research standard, others were a fair way off.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;90070" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;90070</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;29560529&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;29560529&#x2F;</a>')
