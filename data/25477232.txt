I also have a great 16&quot; and I&#x27;m experiencing similar issues with it.\nThe new M1 MacBook Air is already as fast as my machine and costs less than half. It&#x27;s bonkers.\nI use two external monitors however and the Air doesn&#x27;t support that, so that&#x27;s one thing keeping me away from the new M1. \nI imagine the new 16&quot; MacBook Pros will support more than one external monitor, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to stop myself from getting one.')
