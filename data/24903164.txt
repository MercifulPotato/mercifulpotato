I was initially skeptical of your correction, because 99.9% of programmers have no idea how this stuff works (and I clearly don&#x27;t either, in detail). But clearly you&#x27;ve got bona fides here.<p>So thank you for taking the time to explain this all to me. I&#x27;ve never been able to find out much published on this online by Intel.I assume you had to figure most of this out on your own through reverse engineering techniques?<p>Do you have any other good links on how trust is bootstrapped in modern Intel CPUs, other than your Blackhat presentation (which is very helpful, already 1&#x2F;2 through)?<p>Have people&#x2F;you figured out as much about trust is bootstrapped in AMD CPUs? I&#x27;m reading that the ME equivalent is an embedded ARM core using TrustZone? Is that right?<p>Thank you, again.<p>Edit: Knowing all that you know about what comes before TPM, and the associated vulnerabilities, do you still think hardware TPM modules are worth it for securing the OS boot process?')
