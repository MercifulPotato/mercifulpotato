Yes, that means making more money, but that is also how a sovereign funds labor to pay down debts without putting it&#x27;s people through generational austerity, if that is even an option, and for us it really isn&#x27;t one.<p>Literally, there is nothing stopping the USA from laboring itself right out of debt, except the politics.<p>When we do these things, general appetite for risk will improve, there will be a lot more money in the hands of people who spend it, and the returns, both in terms of how much the nation is worth as well as from the result of the projects will pay down past financial folly nicely.  Tons of opportunity will be a part of an effort like this too.  Opportunity for everyone from self employed mom n pop through to the major firms.  Think Interstate Highway Project, and all that brought to the table.<p>We need that kind of thing right now.  Covid has only amplified that need.<p>Difficult as it seems, we aren&#x27;t going to cut our way out of that debt, and it is very unlikely we could secure resources and treasure for it either. (Military action, and the costs and risks associated with all that are unwise, in my view)<p>We have a ton of labor potential out there, and that is how new wealth is created, so...  let us get to creating!<p>Sadly, reluctance on stuff like this appears to be bipartisan.  Sure wish it wasn&#x27;t.')
