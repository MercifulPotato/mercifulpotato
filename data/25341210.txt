For comparison, the Yayoi incursion not only predates not only the entire traceable history of the Inuit people, but also that of the (unrelated) Dorset culture that they&#x27;re believed to have driven out. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a principled metric by which Canada&#x27;s whalers are &quot;Indigenous peoples following their traditional ways&quot; and <i>nearly all Japanese people</i> aren&#x27;t.')
