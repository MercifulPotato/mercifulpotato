Very curious what the HN crowd thinks.<p>I&#x27;m Dutch and in The Netherlands WhatsApp is ubiquitous, it&#x27;s hard to live without it. I live in Switzerland, and here it&#x27;s similar (although not as bad).<p>It disgusts me how FB&#x2F;WA seem to keep pushing the limit on what they collect on us, but until now I didn&#x27;t think it was viable to convince my friends and family to move to another platform.<p>Now I think there are many platforms that offer better guarantees and that work according to healthier incentives than WhatsApp. This essay was to help convince my friends of this.')
