I vouched for it because I think it&#x27;s worth discussing a very important distinction here.<p>What&#x27;s important isn&#x27;t that you tilt at windmills or beat a dead horse. Notice that nowhere in the story does either her or her daughter suggest the other do the work to fix it.<p>The importance is in recognizing what you truly want. Sometimes people don&#x27;t have the self reflection, perception, or foresight to realize the joy they might get out of some damn hard work.<p>Also this comment has an interesting vibe in the classical &quot;pride is bad&quot; sense. I think it can be bad in the sense that it usually describes like a narcissist kind of pride when it&#x27;s used negatively. But this is clearly a justified pride in oneself-- pride in not only overcoming adversity, but enjoying it immensely.')
