I pretty much figured out I had consistent packet loss with a simple ping test. I was on the phone with Time Warner every other day for months. They kept sending the regular technicians, at one point ripping out all of my cable wires in the house to see if it fixed the problem. Nothing worked, I kept calling, at this point I had the direct number to level 3 support. They saw the packet loss too. Finally, after two or three months they send out a Chief Engineer. Guy says I’ll look at the ‘box’ on one of the cable poles down the block. He confirmed something was wrong at that source for the whole area. Then it finally got fixed.<p>Took forever dealing with level 1 support, and lots of karenesque ‘can I talk to your supervisor please’, but that’s literally what it took.<p>So yeah, if you want stuff like this fixed, stay professional, never ever curse, consistently ask to speak to the supervisor, keep records, and keep calling.<p>Small shout out to the old <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dslreports.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dslreports.com&#x2F;</a> for being a great support community during the early days of broadband for consumer activism in terms of making sure you got legit good broadband.')
