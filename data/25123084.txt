When one clicks &quot;Book&quot; and then suddenly get an Internal Server Error in network logs (while UI shows in-progress icon) or gets logged out - where is Fair Access?<p>Inept as it is, the official website still intends to provides fair access. Just because it is buggy does not make it OK to circumvent it, especially when such circumvention only reduces access for users who are not using this developer&#x27;s software.<p>I say this as someone who has used the IRCTC website to book tickets. Tatkal tickets especially are nightmarishly hard to book.')
