X11 clients are eternal, there&#x27;s just way too many of them out there that are line-of-business and will never be ported to anything else. So I&#x27;m always going to need some solution to make those apps work, and since for the foreseeable future that probably means &quot;run a nested X server that translates things to the native display server&#x27;s API&quot;, that means Xwayland isn&#x27;t going away any time soon, and if&#x2F;when it does it&#x27;ll be replaced by some other translation layer I&#x27;ll need to support.')
