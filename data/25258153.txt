A simple protein would require a hybrid quantum mechanic&#x2F;molecular mechanics simulation to even approximate the vibrational energy required to validate equilibrium.<p>These proteins are so massive that we often use Daltons  [1] as an averaged measure of molecular weight.<p>Conceptually one of the most promising applications of quantum computing is theoretical chemistry, and we are only now starting to make progress in this avenue [2]. I anticipate it would require quantum computing to explicitly optimise large folded proteins.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dalton_(unit)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dalton_(unit)</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2004.04174" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2004.04174</a>')
