I had to pay the money just to find out that absolutely nobody in my contacts uses Threema.<p>Was it a waste of money? Maybe, but I&#x27;m ok with being the first, most people would not be ok with that and I have a very real concern I&#x27;ll never see a friend join me there, then it would be money wasted.<p>WhatsApp charged its users to continue using it after a year, I wish Threema took this approach. I paid that money without issue because I already saw the value, so did a lot of people I know. So it&#x27;s clearly not that people won&#x27;t pay, but they need to show their customers it&#x27;s worth it first.')
