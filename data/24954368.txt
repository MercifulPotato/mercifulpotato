Of course that would raise the standard of living.<p>Does the market have any sense of what needs to be done to preserve our goals as a species. (What are those exactly, anyway?)<p>Attribution of moral goodness to something that has circumstantially caused some good but lacks any moral compass doesn’t seem to be a solid rock to found your religion on.<p>And there are certain things that we disallow (and in fact revile) that strictly speaking would be more efficient market wise. (Buying and selling people, child labor, stuff like that).<p>Although capitalism deserves its due (which is a fair bit), attributing all of recent human progress to it seems a bit much.')
