It&#x27;s set by the house.<p>For example, horse race betting, roulette, or blackjack, is gambling, not speculating. Betting on commodities futures is speculating, not gambling - commodities futures is one way a producer can offload future price fluctuations&#x2F;risk to somebody else (who &quot;wins&quot;&#x2F;&quot;loses&quot; if the prices rise&#x2F;falls).')
