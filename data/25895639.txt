Venture capital, entrepreneurship, the startup culture, etc, are all fundamentally profit driven.<p>Open source is a movement which is ultimately driven by ideology. Even open source advocates need to put food on the table.<p>While there are business models that can support open source projects, these will always be the exception when humans are involved. There is always an entrepreneur willing to ignore ideologies (and sometimes laws and&#x2F;or morals) to make a buck.<p>I believe that there is a need and important place for open source and free software, but the fact is that this needs to be funded by philanthropy and dedication to ideology, at the exception of profit in most (almost every) case.<p>In this context, I think the article is correct.
