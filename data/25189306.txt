I think it favors too much &quot;more of the stuff you recently viewed&quot;. Sometimes I watch 4-5 videos on a subject, then I move on but my feed keeps contaminated suggesting more about those things over and over again.<p>Youtube should really trying recommending stuff that&#x27;s not &quot;exactly the same as you saw, but from a different channel&quot;.<p>Also, for some weird reason (and partially contradicting what I said above) Youtube has been insisting in suggesting Jiu Jitsu videos to me for a very long time. Sometimes I watch MMA-related or Muay Thai-related stuff, but never Jiu Jitsu stuff. And it insists on always showing me Jiu Jitsu stuff.')
