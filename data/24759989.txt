Cars are expensive to operate, park, and maintain here, meanwhile we have 3 carshare options that are way more pleasant than owning a car. For excursions outside the city, I&#x27;ve decided to rent a car for every situation that I need to, and then consider a car purchase if the math works out better. So far, even after having rented a car 5 times this year, I haven&#x27;t surpassed just the cost of insurance for the year, or the tax, or the annual maintenance cost, and I&#x27;ve increased my time spent at parks, in the mountains, and elsewhere.<p>So far there&#x27;s been one exception to this, which is super early morning and multi-day hikes that I can&#x27;t get to without a rented car. That&#x27;s it.<p>Likewise, I&#x27;m visiting the prairies where I&#x27;m from, and spent an hour today raking away all that leaf falling and dog poop action the yards have been getting.<p>I do enjoy long distance drives, so my partner and I rented a car for a month and split the cost. At about $400 each not including gas, it&#x27;s in the range of the same car plus insurance monthly, but we don&#x27;t pay for what we&#x27;re not using.')
