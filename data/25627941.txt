I used to build my own machines (before laptops really became commonplace, of course) and then install Linux.  I loved the learning experience and the almost total control over my system that such an exercise provided.<p>After awhile I realized I just wanted to write code and not have maintaining my system take time away from that.  The fact that the Mac provided easy access to Unix was a major plus.  Also, at the time, none of the Linux desktop environments could match the polish that the OS X GUI provided.<p>I&#x27;ve been saddened and frustrated by the state of macOS of late (hopefully Big Sur is better) but I&#x27;m still not ready to go back to the old days.  As you say; it just sounds exhausting.')
