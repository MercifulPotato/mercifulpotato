Why don&#x27;t we have it today? Could we recreate it? Do we have it today in another form? Have they been mythologised? Is it an example of the September effect?<p>It&#x27;s talked about as being a place where relative strangers socialised and had substantive conversations on politics and philosophy that changed the history of ideas whereas today they are places to be &quot;alone together&quot;.<p>My best guess is that clientele were so filtered by opportunity&#x2F;access such that they resembled a business cafeteria or a private members club more than a public venue. I guess the closest thing today might be a subject specific meetup. I suppose that if trying to recreate one, you might want to base it around the service of a novel stimulant that can&#x27;t be found elsewhere that encourages frenzied socialisation. MDMA cafe anyone?')
