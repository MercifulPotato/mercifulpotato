The leaders of each country claim success in anything they had a role into, they don&#x27;t attribute it to Europe. However it&#x27;s very convenient to attribute the cause of any given problem to Europe or to some other specific European country.<p>They must behave like that because they must win their local elections. Who cares about the European elections, anything can happen there. By the way, instant poll: who&#x27;s the president of the EU Parliament (the Parliamentiis directly elected, the Commission is not) and &#x2F; or which country s&#x2F;he&#x27;s from? Don&#x27;t google it.')
