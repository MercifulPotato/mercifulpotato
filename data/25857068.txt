The good thing is that iOS app store  basically forces you to use WebKit for websites so it won&#x27;t die. Bad news is that Apple does not really like the new web standards and in the name of privacy simply doesn&#x27;t implement standards that can give web apps an edge over native iOS apps. And Gnome Web currently has licencing issues with webrtc and media support is poor(gstreamer). Also Chromium is a WebKit fork pre 2013 so it shares several quirks with Safari(prob some of the old standards) which is a prob in itself')
