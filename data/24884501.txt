Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603611393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880910, text='&gt;- Person A goes into doctor&#x27;s office for something pretty common<p>&gt;- Doctor requests cat scan or MRI (I forgot which one is which) based on symptoms<p>&gt;- Person A gets the scan<p>&gt;- Doctor evaluates results and says to book surgery in a hospital ASAP as it&#x27;s probably cancerous<p>&gt;- Person A books surgery<p>&gt;- Surgeon comes in and looks at the scan in the operating room<p>&gt;- Surgeon says this scan is nothing to worry about and surely doesn&#x27;t warrant surgery and it&#x27;s not a tumor or cancer<p>This seems really unusual.  I&#x27;d also say that (as someone who lives in NYC), I can&#x27;t imagine things going this way.<p>I have <i>never</i> heard of a surgeon not reviewing the radiology reports, preparing a surgical plan and consulting with the patient pre-surgery.<p>If this is true, it&#x27;s flat-out malpractice.<p>Given the sheer number of people, resources and precious operating room time involved in ordering, prepping and performing surgery, your story stretches credulity well past the breaking point.  To put a fine point on it, I call bullshit.<p>I had surgery a couple years ago.  I had specific symptoms and went to my doctor.<p>He referred me to an actual surgeon who ordered an MRI.  The MRI showed what we expected it to show and then the surgeon ordered an additional scan to cover more area to make sure he understood <i>exactly</i> what was necessary.  He then recommended surgery.<p>Not taking the surgeon&#x27;s word for it, I sought a second opinion.  Fortunately, my ex&#x27;s brother was a surgeon in the same specialty and he offered to look at the MRI (I would have gone to another surgeon myself had he not been available to me).<p>He completely concurred with the surgeon and I had a successful surgery.<p>However, the normal process for surgical procedures, especially since there are significant pre-surgery protocols including medical history workups, blood work, discussions about what the surgery entails and risk factors, as well as a pre-surgery consult with the surgeon and&#x2F;or his scrub nurse.<p>What&#x27;s more, the surgical team (not with the patient) will meet <i>at least once</i> pre-surgery to review the surgical plan (which includes reviewing any imaging), and this may result in additional testing if there&#x27;s any ambiguity.<p>And none of that is optional.  What&#x27;s more, on the day of the surgery during prep they will mark the location to be operated upon and confirm, multiple times, via existing imaging, discussions with the patient to confirm, specifically, what the surgery is for and what procedure is to be performed.<p>All of that is done <i>before</i> any sedation or anaesthesia is administered.<p>So no.  That&#x27;s not a credible story.')
