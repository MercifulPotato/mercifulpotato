I would say it&#x27;s about the same, but it somehow feels a bit more... honest, shall I say?  The feedback loop for being extremely tired and course correcting is much shorter.  As opposed to just varying your caffeine dose for a week or so, and then realising you&#x27;re super tired, now you will find out about it within a day or so.  One big upside for me has been that if I now have a cup of coffee, it actually works like it was meant to, and I&#x27;m far more energetic for a short while.  This can be used strategically for rare, but important events.  In the past, this would have required large amounts of caffeine over an already high baseline.')
