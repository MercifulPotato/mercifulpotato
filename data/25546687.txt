I&#x27;m a huge fan of CodePen&#x2F;JSFiddle&#x2F;etc., but wanted to have an experience that let me take advantage of my existing editor setup, in order to experiment with ideas or learn new things. I built CodeSwing to &quot;scratch my own itch&quot;, and I&#x27;m keen to hear if it&#x27;s useful for others as well :D<p>Regarding the Golang playground: is this what you&#x27;re thinking about? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;</a>. CodeSwing is a general-purpose &quot;interactive coding environment&quot;, and therefore, I&#x27;d love to expand it over time to include more languages. Right now, it&#x27;s limited to web scenarios, but that&#x27;s simply where I started.<p>Would it be useful to be able to create a new Go&#x2F;Rust swing inside VS Code, and have it automatically run your code, and display stdout in a console window as you type? Or did you have something else in mind?')
