But the problem is that they don&#x27;t have time and leave a lot of equipment behind.\nNow there are finished buildings with cranes still assembled, cement trucks parked in the middle of the road, piles of dirt on the ground, and scaffolding everywhere.<p>Luckily space is unlimited so the developers build cat walks, helicopter pads, and bridges over obstructions. If city planners have a lot on their plate without random construction equipment laying around, imagine how hard it would be if they worked knowing construction a lot gets left behind.')
