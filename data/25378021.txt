I&#x27;m part of that &quot;secondary consulting market&quot; FWIW, so I&#x27;d like to think I know a thing or two about it.<p>Could amazon simplify some of their pricing?  Yes, probably. There&#x27;s always room for optimization. Personally for example I&#x27;d like to see their pricing be global rather than different by region (with understandable exceptions for govcloud and china).<p>Does AWS have high-margin prices? In aggregate, somewhat, but this is mostly driven by the big ticket managed enterprise items: Aurora, Redshift, Quicksight, probably Fargate, etc. A lot of their more popular stuff (S3, Lambda, â€¦) offer incredible value for very little money. EC2 is the exception I believe, because I understand it to be high margin for how popular it is. But EC2 pricing is one of their simplest ones.<p>AWS pricing absolutely is not simple. It&#x27;s a part of the AWS stack. You need to study AWS&#x27;s events&#x2F;signals system to be able to write apps that make the best use of AWS&#x27;s interconnected stack. You need to study their APIs &#x2F; SDKs to really understand what you&#x27;re able to implement. And you need to study their billing systems to understand how to implement apps that run cheaply, and be able to predict potential runaway costs.<p>It has to be a part of the design. That&#x27;s why you may want to hire consultants for it: People who understand it better than you do, and will be able to assist you in reducing your costs.<p>It&#x27;s just another kind of optimization. Maybe some software engineers don&#x27;t like it because it hits them where it hurts (the wallet) when they don&#x27;t do it right, rather than be able to brush it off as they usually do.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to ignore the waste produced by, say for example, the 3000 javascript dependencies shipped with the fat, unoptimized electron app they ship on their users&#x27; desktops, that do a ton of unnecessary expensive computing; when all that crap is client-side and it&#x27;s the <i>downstream user</i>&#x27;s electricity bills and CPU time that&#x27;s being used.')
