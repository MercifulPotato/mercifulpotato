I mostly work in enterprise development and, if the systems are critical, there are dedicated teams who&#x27;re doing the 24&#x2F;7 support. Furthermore, in the finance sector the developers are not allowed by law to even touch production (to prevent fraud). You could still be theoretically brought into a call to help-troubleshoot, but I&#x27;ve never worked on a system critical enough for that to ever be requested.')
