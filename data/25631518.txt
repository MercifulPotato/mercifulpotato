This company would be making &quot;billions per employee&quot;, but it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to pay that employee billions for that job.<p>Why not?<p>Why should it go into the shareholder&#x27;s pockets instead of the people who actually do the work and create the value? What if the people actually working were to, I dunno, seize the means of production or something?<p>To be clear while I understand that there are many reasonable objections to socialism it bothers me that your comment presents capitalism as self-evident. Even if you believe that it&#x27;s the best (or at least least worst) system, you should always question it.<p>If a company generates billions in profit the question of how this profit is divided among the owners and the workers should forever remain an open question I think.')
