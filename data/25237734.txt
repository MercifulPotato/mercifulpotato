Same in the example with the white&#x2F;black balls - if they weren&#x27;t 5 white and 5 black but 6 white and 4 black, the probability you would assign to the top one would be different. Again, the probability is a way to describe the balls themselves, not just our knowledge.<p>I get the general idea of representing probability as uncertainty and partial knowledge but your statements strike me as just straight up incorrect.')
