There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that but it&#x27;s not exactly revalatory knowledge that will be shared by right-leaning individuals such as myself.<p>Indeed I have taken hallucinogens and have had no such feelings, to the contrary I have leaned even more to the right after having taking them (although I attribute no causal role).
