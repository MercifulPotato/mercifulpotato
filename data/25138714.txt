During that time running the Geforce, I had no issues in or out of gaming.<p>Running the 5600 XT with the latest WHQL drivers, I have had one very recent game crash (StarCraft 2) but otherwise, just some issues with booting - instead of the Windows loading icon, I&#x27;d just get a white cursor in the corner of the screen indefinitely. I would have to hard reboot using the power button. Once it kept doing it and I caved and did a reset of Windows, having to reinstall programs. I&#x27;ve had the boot problem once since then, and the above game crash. I think it&#x27;s very reasonable to believe these are driver issues.<p>If you&#x27;re wondering, I didn&#x27;t do a clean install, but used Guru3D drive cleaner between the Geforce and Radeon. And then I did do a Windows reset, and have had problems since, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to blame the driver issues on the switch.')
