There are tons of videos online showing mass vandalism, property destruction, and violence promulgated by those participating in the farmer protests. These include violent disruptions of political events, breaking police barriers to occupy and vandalize historical monuments, setting vehicles on fire, injuring hundreds, and more. Surely the participants and those inciting violence need to be brought under control to restore order. There are peaceful ways to assemble and effect political change. Isn’t this just like American tech companies deplatforming people to curb mass criminality?')
