Based on their experimental set-up, the researchers calculated the efficiencies for different starting pressures and numbers of cylinders. They found that 57 interconnected cylinders of 10 litre each, operating at 5 bar, could fulfill the job of four 24V batteries for 20 consecutive hours, all while having a surprisingly small footprint of just 0.6 m3.<p>Interestingly, the storage capacity is 410 Wh, which is comparable to the 360 Wh rural system noted earlier, which requires an 18 m3 storage vessel – that’s thirty times larger than the modular storage system.\n&quot;<p>Also you missed the points of higher pressure vessels and using the residual heat&#x2F;cold for things like hot water. Basically you trade off lower electricity efficiencies, space, and heat. Excess heat is not necessarily a bad thing in a domestic situation.<p>My take aways from this article:<p>- there are a few scenarios where stuff like this makes sense.<p>- there&#x27;s lots of room for innovation and component improvement (e.g. more efficient dynamos are hinted at). This is currently a niche market and people have not put much R&amp;D into this so far (i.e. I&#x27;d expect some improvements are entirely feasible).<p>- sequential vs. monolithic setups have different properties.<p>It boils down to cost &#x2F; kwh and whether the requirements make sense. In an industrial setup, having a cheap but enormous vessel might not be the end of the world. In an apartment, you&#x27;d want maybe a smaller but higher pressure one.')
