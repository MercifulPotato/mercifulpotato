That isn&#x27;t how people are persuaded, that isn&#x27;t how people ever were persuaded, and that isn&#x27;t how people ever will be persuaded. It also isn&#x27;t how people have ever been able to access any sort of truth. Western philosophy has been incredibly effective at tearing apart everything that exists, but utterly ineffective in building anything back up from the ashes.<p>It&#x27;s only after you&#x27;ve tried, many times over, in futility, to build a coherent &amp; effective belief system from first principles that you&#x27;ll realize this approach is a dead end.

In this framework it is actually very useful to illustrate how your ideological opponent came to their beliefs. Then people can determine whether they find that story relatable.')
