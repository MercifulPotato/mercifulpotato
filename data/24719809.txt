Where releases together and atomic commits are very useful.  Every other time, you&#x27;re probably better off splitting early and taking a little time to build the coordination facilities needed for handling dependency versioning across your different repos.<p>Note: I used to really prefer monorepos, but I&#x27;ve had some time away now to take a better look at it.  Now they feel like megaclasses where small things are easier (because everything is in one place) but large things are way harder (because there&#x27;s no good split point).')
