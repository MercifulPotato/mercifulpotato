Their is no personal risk to them under lockdown, so they are more than happy to sacrifice the education of children for their own sense of safety.<p>Bars and restaurants are private businesses which must provide service which people are willing to pay for. If they don&#x27;t provide the service, they don&#x27;t get paid. The owners and the employees are naturally more inclined to continue working and not be gaslighted by coronahysteria.<p>Remember, public sector workers contribute zero to the public purse, and if they are not working, they are contributing zero value whatsoever, yet expect the people who are contributing to continue paying their wages.')
