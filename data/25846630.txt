In that case, it&#x27;s normally pretty rapid. For instance, Ireland held a general election on the 8th of Feb 2020, the 32nd Dail was dissolved on the 14th of Feb 2020, and the 33rd Dail convened on the 20th. In that particular case, the cabinet (the executive) stayed in power as a caretaker government for months afterwards (and took major decisions over covid) because the new Dail struggled to either appoint a new prime minister or call a new election (covid was unhelpful there), but that&#x27;s very abnormal.<p>In presidential and quasi-presidential systems, it typically takes a week or so. The US really is an anomaly here.')
