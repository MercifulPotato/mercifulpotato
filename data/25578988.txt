Considering WA doesn&#x27;t have a state income tax, and CA has a high one, it was a nice gesture.  Not sure if they are still doing this.  But I think the future will be standard pay no matter where you work.  At least, I hope so.  I can&#x27;t stand to go to an office that is louder and more annoying, with a network that frequently has problems and firewalls that get in the way of my work.')
