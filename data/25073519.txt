Epic is arguing that Apple&#x27;s terms themselves (taking a cut of the revenue that&#x27;s a direct result of Epic&#x27;s team&#x27;s efforts with zero options to do anything else) are not fair and should be unenforceable given its market position.  Basically, breach of contract is only a valid legal basis when the contract itself is deemed legally acceptable.  Ex. you can&#x27;t force someone to sign a ridiculous contract at gunpoint and then sue them for breach later.<p>Where you come down on this issue should really be based on whether you think a marketplace cut of revenue with extremely onerous conditions that prevent even minor bypasses should be legal or not when distribution on said marketplace constitutes 50% of the consumer market in the sector (mobile gaming in this case).  Whether or not someone previously agreed to the terms is not the issue.')
