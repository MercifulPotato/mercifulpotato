Are there any languages that target the JVM and are designed for higher speed? If it enforced the &quot;C-like style&quot; at the language level, perhaps it would be easier to follow?<p>Of course at this point the usual answer is just use Rust, but is there a language that meets in the middle? Sometimes I just want the GC to do the work and I&#x27;m okay with that.')
