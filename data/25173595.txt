It&#x27;s not a big deal, usually because businesses, that hire .1x engineers, rewrite their entire products every 5 years or so. And when you start fresh from scratch, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are a 10x or a .1x: business only cares about pushing something to production as fast as possible. Technical debt will be fixed in the next batch in 5 years... by rewriting.<p>In more serious&#x2F;long-term companies, since the interview process is more difficult, you don&#x27;t usually encounter .1x engineers and what I&#x27;ve described doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>All in all, there&#x27;s room for everyone (.1x and 10x)')
