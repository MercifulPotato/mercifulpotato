While the basics of TCP haven&#x27;t, some details have. So unless you are very deep in TCP (I am not) reading this is pretty pointless because you don&#x27;t know where you learn about historical mistakes and where about current issues. Both are useful, but not without the classification.<p>That said every time I use Wireshark other than in a small LAN I see horrible retransmission errors. So probably some issues haven&#x27;t been solved since 1986.')
