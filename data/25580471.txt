Item(by='Chazprime', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609324122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577799, text='&gt; The only way that free speech works is that people feel free to vociferously disagree. Given the volume of, say, Domingos&#x27; tweets, he certainly feels free to disagree. At this point the same can be said of Gebru and Anandkumar. Great! What&#x27;s the problem here? Can&#x27;t we just all just argue and get along?<p>Well, given that Anandkumar tried to publicly shame a number of people over these discussions, clearly we <i>can&#x27;t</i> all argue and get along if this is what it devolves into.<p>And that&#x27;s kind of the point. Why can&#x27;t we have innocuous discussions that end in &quot;let&#x27;s agree to disagree&quot; without someone deciding that public humiliation and threats to people&#x27;s careers are now okay? Why are the stakes suddenly inflated to &quot;the future of female involvement in STEM&quot; in these squabbles?<p>We can go around and around over who said what, but clearly Anandkumar crossed an ethical boundary here, and it&#x27;s important to call that out. Creating a more diverse and inclusive community does not involve public threats. I wish that didn&#x27;t need to be said, but apparently it does.')
