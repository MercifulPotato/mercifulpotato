Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607623725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25374322, text='Tesla is a divisive topic with passionate feelings on both sides, and a swipe like &quot;they [can&#x27;t] build cars in the first place&quot; is tossing a Molotov cocktail into the thread. Would you mind taking the spirit of the site more to heart? We&#x27;d appreciate it greatly. Note this, from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>:<p>&quot;<i>Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.</i>&quot;<p>Re the other person: I&#x27;d don&#x27;t know which specific comment you&#x27;re referring to, but generally it&#x27;s not against the site guidelines to miss someone&#x27;s point, or to be wrong, or to make a non sequitur. Such rules would be impossible to impose and would wipe out half the discussion anyhow (I&#x27;m being generous with &quot;half&quot;).<p>If they broke the guidelines then we probably should have moderated it too, but that runs up against a different issueâ€”we can&#x27;t see everything that gets posted here, or even come close. We often don&#x27;t read the threads in linear (depth-first?) order either, so a comment that appears adjacent to a normal reader might escape our attention.<p>If you see a post that ought to have been moderated but hasn&#x27;t been, the likeliest explanation is that we didn&#x27;t see it.
