If such a round hit the robot <i>anywhere</i>, it would almost certainly disable it.<p>Detecting an approaching robot would be trivial with radar, IR (these things have to make heat), tripwires, etc.<p>Not sure what you mean about &quot;setting up&quot; a 50 cal gun; a Barrett 50 is handheld. Setting it up takes about a second. Although in practice a  perimeter would probably be established in advance with robotic guns using closed loop feedback.<p>My point is that it would be a significant engineering challenge and at least an order of magnitude cost increase to design a BD-style robot to deal with even the most prosaic threats of a hostile battlefield. And the power supply would probably need to be a gasoline engine rather than batteries just for reasons of weight and endurance.')
