All Microsoft employees are issued a RFID card with a chip that functions as a door access card, visual ID (it has your photo&#x2F;name&#x2F;employee number on it), smartcard for 2FA (this is being phased out in favor of TPM-based device registration), and cafeteria payment system. You can elect to have some percentage of your paycheck automatically loaded on the card. I used it for a bit early on in my employment, but then switched to paying with credit card (like almost everyone else I know).')
