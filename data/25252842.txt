I&#x27;m a Londoner, and I can generally pick out who is or isn&#x27;t a native speaker, but I don&#x27;t remark on it. Lots of people here aren&#x27;t native English speakers, and all I&#x27;d accomplish by pointing that out would be alienating them. I imagine you get a similar feeling in New York or San Francisco, not that I&#x27;ve been to those places.<p>Conversely, if you go to some parts of the North, people absolutely _will_ remark on it.')
