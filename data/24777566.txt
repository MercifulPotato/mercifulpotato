So a simpler query would be &quot;sort by date and hide all the hits which have below 100 votes&quot;.<p>The real &quot;have never been shown in the top 30&quot; would need an actual event tag added to each post when they reach top 30. Then Algolia can search that I guess. Hidden tag search is a common practice.')
