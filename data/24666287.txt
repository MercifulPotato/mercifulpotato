They hired someone else. I kept showing up at public meetings and serving as a volunteer.<p>I was openly attacked, dismissed and criticized. Later, they would implement my suggestions (badly -- they couldn&#x27;t actually get it right) and take credit and pretend I hadn&#x27;t been the person who originally suggested it.<p>I finally quit all my volunteer work because everyone in town knows I am dirt poor and they are stealing my ideas and not helping me establish an earned income of my own while pretending they are doing economic development.<p>The guy they hired for the job I applied to finally put up a website like a couple of weeks ago after having the job for 2.5 years. I dragged it on one my blogs and within hours of me saying &quot;He should do X on his website&quot; he would make edits in line with that. This happened three days in row. I finally took all the posts down.<p>So he is cyberstalking me to continue stealing ideas from me.<p>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to establish my own company. I can&#x27;t believe this guy still has this job, he&#x27;s so incompetent. But, I mean, he has the right bits between his legs and I guess that&#x27;s all that really matters.<p>It&#x27;s infuriating.<p>I really appreciate your comment.')
