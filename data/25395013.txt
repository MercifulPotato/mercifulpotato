At least you can easily investigate both of them via preserved documentation and emulators, if you don’t have access to hardware on which to run them: There’s an x86-64 build of OpenGenera floating around you can run on Linux, and you can run VMS in SIMH. And Kalman Reti did a great demo of Genera on YouTube.')
