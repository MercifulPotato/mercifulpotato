Engineers produced those bugs.<p>I always thought that bugs are the programmers&#x27; fault, and not to blame the language. It&#x27;s like blaming the English language because it allows you to misuse it and manufacture very offensive racial slurs, or to be rude and cruel, and thus we should replace it with another language that doesn&#x27;t allow to exploit these weaknesses. We won&#x27;t be able to express ourselves with beautifully (low-level) crafted poems anymore, but that&#x27;s the price to pay.')
