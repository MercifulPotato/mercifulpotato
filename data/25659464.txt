He was in charge of some software that drove tape drives.<p>Every outside new manager would come in and in some form or another look down on this guy in some form due to his age and generally not doing &quot;a lot&quot; of tasks and new products.<p>It took the local VP to come down and regularly high five him after his product git rave reviews from customers (regularly) and make the point every time some manager didn&#x27;t get it.<p>That guy&#x27;s code, documentation, everything was rock solid, and the number of support cases for everything he did was so low that the dude was without a doubt the most productive person as far as income goes.  You could sell the product that he worked on and just rake in money with almost no costs after that.   Almost everything else had a lot of support costs and etc.<p>Meanwhile the guys who were doing all the new stuff, sucked at trying to juggle 12 things because it looked good on a resume.')
