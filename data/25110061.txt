Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=[25111353, 25112193], score=None, time=1605521308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109702, text='Honestly having attended some of these fundraisers, having donated to some fundraisers, and having donated a piece of artwork (and my only piece of art tbh) to a well-renowned museum in London, my honest opinion is that most of these places spend far more on organizing the fundraisers rather than paying for artwork and preservation. In most cases, the collectors themselves take on the costs of general preservation (we have to sign a contract explicitly stating the cases where the institutions are responsible for damage, idk how it works with larger donors), and the museums are just charged a one-time cost for the hosting infra, and then there are the recurring costs of maintaining the museum.<p>One issue I&#x27;ve noticed is that there are far too many scattered museums in a lot of places, mostly converted homes, churches and the like. Some of it might be ripe for consolidation.')
