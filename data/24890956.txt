We aren&#x27;t willing to sacrifice, even temporarily, the local insects. You have to be willing to do that if you expect to stop this invasive species, because you can not possibly find all the nests fast enough.<p>If we were to think long-term, we could stop this invasive species. Crop duster planes spray everything within at least several generations or years of insect migration. That might mean 10,000 square miles gets completely soaked in a mix of Sevin, Malathion, and neonicotinoids.<p>Compared to the roughly 16,300,000 square miles at risk of being irrevocably harmed by an invasive species, that local and temporary ecosystem damage would be practically nothing.<p>We&#x27;ll argue a bit and do nothing. The wasps are here to stay. Say goodbye to bees.')
