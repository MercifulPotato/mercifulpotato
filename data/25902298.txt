Item(by='0xy', descendants=None, kids=[25904208], score=None, time=1611577043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901373, text='Aviation is like software. &quot;Safe&quot; just means redundancies and failsafes. No plane is 100% safe because no plane has experienced all possible edge cases. Usually when a plane encounters a mechanical failure or experiences an incident (whether that be a crash or something less serious), it&#x27;s because the plane was operating in a case that had never been considered or encountered before.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think every conceivable problem has been worked out because that&#x27;s an impossibility. Unknown unknowns of aviation prevent that from ever occurring.<p>However, this plane in particular has had multiple independent regulators and thousands of independent pilots involved in the process to clear it. Additionally, pilots will receive new Max-specific training on the MCAS software so they&#x27;ll be more aware of it and its operating modes from now on.<p>I would fly on a 737 Max and I&#x27;d have no problem taking family with me. You&#x27;re more likely to be in a car accident by a substantial margin.')
