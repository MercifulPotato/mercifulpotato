I&#x27;m most familiar with FPSes, but as I understand it, the cod games, the battlefield games, destiny, the halo games, cs-go, valorant, cyberpunk etc. are all on &quot;custom&quot; engines -- i.e. engines that are not provided commercially by third parties. I&#x27;m actually having trouble thinking of a big name fps that is on unreal or unity.<p>(I don&#x27;t know how big these games are compared to mobile games, but I can say for sure that they are big enough that studios seem to be investing more and more on them, rather than less as you would expect if they were economically insignificant.)')
