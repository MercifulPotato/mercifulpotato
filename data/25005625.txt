During recent decade laws got changed and grocery stores can be open now 24&#x2F;7. Some of the stores do this. It’s not limited to convenience store sized stores so even some of the largest ones are open if you enjoy strolling alone food isles at 4am.<p>Other stores close 9pm. Bars are open till 2am, night clubs 4 or 5am. Some places stay open but they can’t serve alcohol in the morning hours. Getting food after 12am is trickier but there are restaurants that are open until 4am.<p>And it’s dark. And people on average go to work early and clock out early. And definitely not new york or berlin nightlife wise.<p>Talking about helsinki here pre covid regulations.<p>Edit: reading other comment, it’s true most speciality stores which only have one set of employees close 6-8pm. Larger chains are open till 9pm')
