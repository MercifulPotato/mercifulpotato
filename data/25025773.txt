I hadn&#x27;t considered this in previous comments until u&#x2F;kgermino pointed it out in [1]. I see your point better now.<p>I still stand by that &quot;more listens resulting in more money&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but that the way of counting who gets actively listened to might need revising. Another solution to the problem is the (let&#x27;s call it) Bandcamp model. I&#x27;m not opposed to that, I&#x27;m just wondering if that will solve any issues, given that I perceive the problem not as &quot;we should pay per subscriber listening to an artist instead of per number of plays&quot; but instead &quot;we should not pay for illegitimate plays.&quot;<p>It does also make me wonder if Spotify considered this and, if yes, why they rejected it. I guess more popular artists are more important to Spotify&#x27;s survival and therefore they can demand more money under the guise of it being all fair? It&#x27;s quite an allegation but that&#x27;s the only thing I can think of. But then, I&#x27;ve been wrong before :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25025522" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25025522</a>')
