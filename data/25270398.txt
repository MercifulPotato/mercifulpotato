Just unnecessary operational overhead. While I&#x27;d probably go with a monolith if I was building for scratch, in this case we&#x27;ve stuck with ~5 microservices (we did have over 10) as it works well enough.<p>Firebase is fundamentally limited though. You simply cannot do things like joins and even filtering and updating is very limited compared to a SQL database. Of course you can implement these things in code, and precompute them and store them denormalised. But at that point you&#x27;re implementing your own database and it&#x27;s much less work to move the data to a different database platform. We did a gradual migration which made it relatively painless, although it was still a lot of work. And we&#x27;re able to move much faster on new features now we have the flexibility of a fully-featured database.')
