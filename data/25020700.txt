So much for rooting for ineffectual.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree, but I also see how its easy to see how other voters don&#x27;t agree:  E.g. look at the performance of other nations.  You can make comparisons where the US doesn&#x27;t look bad (or even looks good) depending on what comparisons you make and what time windows you choose.<p>Similarly, if you emphasize the importance of the errors of science-driven bodies, the amount of flip-flopping in expert advice (e.g. over masks), or the specific state responses in states that have local administrations more like what we would have hoped for, you could make an argument that it would not have made that much difference. Maybe not a <i>correct</i> argument, but at least one where reasonable and informed people could have a debate over it.<p>There is a lot of noise in pandemic impact, a lot of noise in how people perceive pandemic impact, and there hasn&#x27;t been much time to reach robust scientific conclusions on the impact of different policies.  I wouldn&#x27;t argue that differences between policies aren&#x27;t real, but just that they&#x27;re (currently) easily spun or discounted.<p>There is, also, I think a good argument to be made to cautious about science based leadership in general.  The tremendous power of science is that it gives you the power to defy tradition, popular will, and even common sense and make the world dramatically better, because its predictions were right.  But when science is wrong, it can also be used to defy reason and common sense and bring tremendously bad results.  E.g. there has been more than one genocide carried out in the name of &quot;science&quot;.  Rejecting science is not the answer, but nor is blindly following whatever is passing for science in your civilization at any moment. :)')
