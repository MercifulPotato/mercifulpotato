This has eliminated kernel memory leaks, which became quite an issue with the previous memory manager<p>Hang on, I thought the whole point of writing in Rust was that this didn&#x27;t happen. Is there something about a memory manager that requires unsafe? (Keeping in mind that I neither know Rust nor kernel design, so there&#x27;s a very good chance that I&#x27;m just missing something here)')
