It&#x27;s been an almost 8mo journey learning C to get to this point. Ultimately it was the people that I interacted with and the user contributions that propelled me to make xwm.<p>I intentionally omitted a screenshot in the README as xwm, by itself, is not attractive. Also, really I wanted to leave ricing&#x2F;tweak&#x2F;patching to be entirely user contribution driven. I may consider, though, adding a directory in the patches (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpcpc&#x2F;xwm-patches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpcpc&#x2F;xwm-patches</a>) repo for user contributed screenshots though.')
