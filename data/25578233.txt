Science is just a label and when anything turns out to be wrong, we just say, &quot;well that&#x27;s part of the scientific process&quot;. In this way science can never be really wrong, because it is always open to being proved wrong and if so, it just incorporates that new fix&#x2F;criticism as a new part of science. (Similarly philosophy seems to be impossible to criticize well without the criticism becoming labeled as philosophy itself)<p>I think it&#x27;s rather that we have had a bunch of great curious people who worked on interesting stuff and found out a lot about nature. But we can&#x27;t equate that with institutional credentialed authoritative &quot;Science&quot;.<p>I guess there <i>is</i> some underlying scientific ethos, that can be learned between the lines, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a clear <i>method</i> (as in the intro textbook definition).')
