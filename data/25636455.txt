As evidence you don&#x27;t need to look any further than the massively upvoted subthread that you replied to. It&#x27;s at the top of this page because a large slice of the community obviously supports this view. That many others don&#x27;t agree is evidence that the community is divided, not that it&#x27;s lined up against you; it&#x27;s basically a variation of sample bias that makes things feel that way [1].<p>Would you please review the site guidelines [2]? They include this: <i>&quot;Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.&quot;</i> One common kind of sneering is this sort of supercilious dismissal of everybody-else-in-the-community and their dumbass &quot;hilarious&quot; opinion—this is an internet genre we need to avoid in order to have real conversation. \nIf you&#x27;re posting here, you&#x27;re as much the community as anyone else is.<p>I understand what it&#x27;s like to feel surrounded by enemies when you constantly run into comments that express something you strongly disagree with. But it&#x27;s important to understand that this effect is largely a consequence of the fact that everyone is crammed into one big room here—there&#x27;s no self-selecting into silos the way other sites do it (follow lists, subscriptions, social graphs, and so on). If you don&#x27;t understand that, this place will feel much more fractious than it actually is [3], and the consequences of that are pretty stark: one ends up feeling surrounded by demons [4], and tends to retreat to things like defensive sarcasm, putdowns of others, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=demons%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=demons%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all...</a>')
