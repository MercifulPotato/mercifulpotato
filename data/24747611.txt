It is a greenwashed policy proposal that includes essentially the entire far left’s agenda - it uses the word “justice” affixed to many different causes and the cause of environmental protection (rebranded as “environmental justice”) and a dose of mental gymnastics to drag in many unrelated policy proposals that are part of either the social justice or socialist agenda.<p>If we want to expedite environmental protection, what we need is an unbundling of individual policy proposals from GND, which will speed up adoption of the pieces that matter (like supporting nuclear energy) without all the controversial social justice or socialist cruft riding on it.')
