Plenty of small churches spend almost all of their revenue on pastoral salary and workship space. It&#x27;s fine, to each their own, but treating that sort of tithing the same way we treat donations to actual charities seems weird. Both Ikea and non-charitable $ spent by churches should be taxes.<p>TBH though, it&#x27;s not 1800. we should stop (not) taxing based on <i>institution type</i> and start (not) taxing based on <i>where the dollars are going</i>. This would solve lots of problems in the non-profit world (including IKEA and churches).')
