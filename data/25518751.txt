The updated window&#x2F;toolbar designs look fantastic to me, though the lower contrast between foreground&#x2F;background windows is a disappointment. The dialog boxes do often look that bad, but some look much more like their pre-11 counterparts. The rounded corner main menus look super weird but I suspect that’s one that will feel normal after some use. Many of the icons look great (and better than their iOS counterparts), some look just awful.<p>That said, every large visual overhaul in macOS&#x2F;OS X has been followed by several iterations of refinement, and I don’t doubt this one will too. I expect by 13 or so the design will be more mature. Lately I’ve tended to skip an OS upgrade and this one doesn’t offer me much to compel me to change that, so I’m looking forward to seeing what they refine in 12.')
