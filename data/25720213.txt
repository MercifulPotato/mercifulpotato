It means at an understood point in the future, not during some undefined and indeterminate timeframe.<p>If everyone else is talking about violent action January 18th, and then you talk about people you&#x27;d like killed in the same general conversation, you don&#x27;t walk just because you never specified the specific time yourself.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re also contradicting Volokh, a well-known and well-respected liberal first amendment lawyer&#x27;s analysis by vaguely gesturing at one of the cases discussed in that very article.<p>Argument by authority.  We have constitutional lawyers on the other side arguing the bar set in Brandenburg is met by Trump&#x27;s comments alone.  e.g. Niehoff, Somin (who writes on Volokh Conspiracy, too).  Let alone after the additional context of a violent outbreak and more outright threats.')
