The first usage names the current (moving definition) state, which moves toward the second which is a singular (theoretical) point in development.<p>Finally, is this just a PSA? We already know this. If it doesn&#x27;t say ML, deep learning, CNN, or other specific term it&#x27;s a fluff piece, or just trying to get eyeballs on research (which is rational).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dataversity.net&#x2F;ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dataversity.net&#x2F;ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-l...</a>')
