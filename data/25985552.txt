To the point that anyone trying to use the damn thing could point out problems within 10 seconds. I was shopping for a replacement bathroom fan on home depot website. I just want to find one that will fit in the old hole. You would think I would be able to filter by the actual size of the box. But no, its not apparent at all what their listed measurements refer to. Just give me a drawing with the dimension of the box. Thats all. Better yet, take the fan out of the box and showing me some pictures with measurements. But nope. Every fan has different included information. And this is after a year of Corona. And everyone needing to shop online.')
