There are many thousands of other hosting companies worldwide, they didn&#x27;t have to use one of the big three IaaS providers.<p>It seems more like poor planning on their part: over-reliance on specific services of a single provider, and no disaster recovery plan for if this is made unavailable. Particularly considering the business they&#x27;re in - publishing controversial content that gets its users banned on more mainstream social media sites. They would have been wise to have a backup plan for hosting.<p>On the other hand, if you were also passing reference to the app store duopoly (as the report mentions this), I agree with you on that. At least on Android a banned app can be fairly easily side-loaded; iOS users are entirely subject to Apple&#x27;s whims on what their device is permitted to run.')
