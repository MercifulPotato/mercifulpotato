It&#x27;s a lot cheaper in the long run than not painting at all.<p>For those that don&#x27;t know, paint should be considered a non-optional component of most iron or steel objects, since paint serves the important role of preventing rust formation. It&#x27;s less important in most uses of aluminum, since aluminum oxide tends to form a protective layer instead of flaking away.')
