Item(by='cytzol', descendants=None, kids=[24864811], score=None, time=1603411533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864051, text='&gt; Your tools seem to be bizzarely obsessed with colors, though<p>Y&#x27;know, for some reason, I get that a lot.<p>The point you seem to have missed, though, is that <i>I&#x27;m a user too</i>. I want a user-agent to view the things that I, a user, want to see, and those things are colours and bold and italics. I don&#x27;t want to have the flashiest site around to wow everyone; I want to see <i>more</i> sites like mine. My content has colours and formatting and images, where they&#x27;re a part of the content, not merely its presentation; and one of my tools is doing very well, so even if you don&#x27;t agree with it, there are enough people that do to make it worth my while.<p>And if Gemini ever gains the requisite capabilities, I won&#x27;t be offended if you turn the colours off. It&#x27;s your right as a user, too.<p>I know that one of the goals of Gemini is not just to have a protocol with no tracking, but to have a protocol <i>where no tracking can sneak in</i>. Looking at the state of the Web right now, that&#x27;s a laudable goal. The same goes for having a simple easy-to-implement protocol, which formatting would throw a wrench right in the middle of.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case — if not being able to have my preferred Gemini experience is considered &quot;collateral damage&quot; because Gemini prioritises other features than my favourite ones — then please just <i>say</i> that, rather than insinuating that I don&#x27;t count, or don&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;m trying to engage with you as a &quot;netizen&quot; (I haven&#x27;t used that word for a decade), and you reply with &quot;this time <i>we</i> actually mean it&quot;, as though there are sides in a fight. I don&#x27;t want to be stuck with the Web any more than you do.')
