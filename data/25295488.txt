Item(by='GuB-42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607031587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294888, text='30 degrees vertical is actually a recommendation for work[1], not for movies. If you look around for guide about ergonomics, you will often see that 30 degrees figure, or &quot;top of the screen at eye level, center 15 degrees down&quot;, which mean the same thing.<p>For movies, THX recommends a 36 degrees <i>horizontal</i> viewing angle[2], which is about 20 degrees vertical. Recommendations vary, sometimes it is 30 degrees, sometimes it is 40, but always horizontal.<p>Now, no one will force you. If you prefer to have a very large screen right up your nose, that&#x27;s your choice, and maybe your work environment calls for it. But it is just not what it is generally recommended and I would put it into the &quot;exception&quot; category. And sure, in that case, increased resolution is good.<p>As for antialiasing, it will not make the image sharper, quite the opposite in fact. However, if your resolution is so that it is over your visual acuity (you can&#x27;t distinguish between 2 thin parallel lines and 1 thicker line), antialiasing will take care of superaccuity. That&#x27;s the ability of your brain to use image processing techniques to detect jaggies that are finer than what you eye can see. If you have good vision and a 4k monitor closer to you than the recommended distance, it is normal to see the difference even with anti-aliasing turned on.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewsonic.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;business&#x2F;best-computer-screen-positioning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewsonic.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;business&#x2F;best-computer-scr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thx.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;thx-certified-screen-placement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thx.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;thx-certified-screen-placement...</a>')
