Or the way crimes carry vast sentences and prosecutors often later them on so that of anything sticks its still decades in prison. Then you either take a plea or face a 400 year jail sentence with a lawyer who has 100 other clients and can&#x27;t actually remember your name or what you were charged with.<p>The whole criminal &quot;justice&quot; system in the states looks crazy to me. Bail reform won&#x27;t really fix that.')
