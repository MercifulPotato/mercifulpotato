In general any conversation about such stuff should start out with stating clearly what your assumptions are. Since the GGGP started out with interstellar travel as assumed I felt no need to fix that (and technically, voyager qualifies as an interstellar spacecraft at this point in time, even if it is an unmanned one). But you are 100% right, interstellar travel by intelligent beings should definitely not be assumed until there is proof of it actually happening and&#x2F;or being done.<p>Even Musk&#x27;s &#x27;Starship&#x27; is incorrectly named.')
