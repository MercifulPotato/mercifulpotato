You&#x27;re just moving cash flows not only across time but based on probability. You start by trying to create a business that moves the most cash possible to generate float. Now you might say, that this doesn&#x27;t work because if you sell $1 for $.80 you&#x27;ll run out of money. But that&#x27;s not true, you just have a drag on your timeline that pulls you to zero without further capital inflows, or until you sort out your margins. In a world with very low interest rates (now, and past few years), capital doesn&#x27;t have many useful places to go. And as we&#x27;ve seen, it has flown a lot into equities and a lot into private funding. That is the inflow of capital that keeps extending Uber and DoorDash&#x27;s timeline, such that even with a 20% drag, you still have another fool to pull in and keep the party going. If the music stops everyone cries, but if it keeps going long enough, you actually increase your chances of remaining alive. For one you might outlive your competition, but there&#x27;s many more things that can happen. You can improve your margins (Uber&#x27;s pipe dream with self driving), you can can have a shift in consumer demands in your favor, or a pandemic that shifts consumer spend super fast, etc. You basically keep growing and extending the timeline and you may get a big pay out.<p>Or as some would call it, growth investing.')
