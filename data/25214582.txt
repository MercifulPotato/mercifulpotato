To aid with this when setting the difficulty for your website it shows you an estimate for various device types. This is indeed a downside of PoW approaches.<p>There is one factor that helps: you can start solving as soon as the form loads, so as the user enters their details&#x2F;comment it can start solving - I have a hunch that people on mobile devices are inherently slower at entering their data which should help a bit..<p>Anyway - if you set the difficulty quite high and the solving takes 30 seconds, it takes the user 15 seconds to enter the form - the user would still have to wait 15 seconds. That&#x27;s not very different from the time to solve image captchas (it&#x27;s actually lower and doesn&#x27;t come with a 2MB payload download which isn&#x27;t great on phones either, and they can keep their privacy + sanity). You could give the user something to do that makes sense for your website (ask them for feedback?).')
