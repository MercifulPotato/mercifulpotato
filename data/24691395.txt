Or, do you say &#x27;masks limit transmission of ARIs&#x27; and risk leaving medical need of masks unfulfilled because mass panic has decimated the supplies?<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily wrong to lie there (akin to people who say &quot;vaccines are perfectly safe&quot; - the info leaflet disproves that), but it does mean if you&#x27;re searching for a source of ground truth that you can&#x27;t rely on them.<p>No conspiracy, other than that needed to protect global populations, is required. I think you&#x27;d agree with me that WHO are conspiring to protect the health of global populations. That they would hold this goal above the goal of providing information that is absolutely true is not especially surprising, I think.<p>FWIW: WHO updated the information later such that they offered different mask advice per country (to my recollection), which seems anomalous unless one considers that the advice is tailored according to whether countries had secured supplies. The advice for UK went from &quot;masks do nothing&quot; to &quot;you should wear a mask&quot;.')
