Item(by='kristopolous', descendants=None, kids=[25901869, 25901672, 25905979, 25902149], score=None, time=1611568574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898391, text='The &quot;iphone&quot; of the electric car still isn&#x27;t here.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying it&#x27;s coming soon for a while, cars that are so vastly superior to gas cars that it re-frames the gas car as being legacy technology just as the smartphone from apple finally got the consumer interested in smartphones and view flip-phones as inferior.<p>I think however, it&#x27;s going to come from left-field (not from Tesla) and for the first time I&#x27;m tossing a date on it, 24-36 months:<p>The key is the bizarre three-wheeled electric cars from micro-manufacturers like aptera, ampere, nobe, elio, arcimoto, electra meccanica, malcolm bricklin, sondors, and vanderhall.<p>They are offering low priced commuter vehicles with really low drag coefficients, easy parking, and when combined with solar panels embedded in the body (which I know of 3 manufacturers that are releasing cars this year that will do this) you&#x27;ll get effectively a &quot;worry free&quot; vehicle; it charges more than you usually drive it, needs very little maintenance and repair, and is easy to maneuver.<p>I think Geoffrey Moore&#x27;s diagram on this one is starting this year and if the next gen of these funky cars are as &quot;practical&quot; as I think them to be, I think the chasm will be jumped around 2023&#x2F;2024.<p>Right, this sounds unrealistic now. Obviously cars like this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptera.us&#x2F;product-page&#x2F;250-miles-per-charge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aptera.us&#x2F;product-page&#x2F;250-miles-per-charge</a> aren&#x27;t going to see mainstream pickup right this second.<p>But this is like if we were in 2003, and I used the bulky, nerdy clunky HP iPAQ 4150 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;51BH3PKCZ7L._AC_.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;51BH3PKCZ7L...</a>) and argued that these computer-phones would eventually be a mainstream device and be a complete replacement of desktops and laptops for many people.  Obviously unrealistic then. You have to iterate in your head.<p>For instance, take the solar e-trike, make a modular design like how ebussy has (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebussy.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebussy.de&#x2F;</a>), inductive charging like what bmw and witricity are working on or what&#x27;s been deployed in sweden (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartroadgotland.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartroadgotland.com&#x2F;</a>) you know, the next steps that everything gets crossing the chasm, you have to do the act of mentally imagining putting these things together, I can see this future coming together.<p>Also you add the cost trajectories of batteries and solar on to it, and you&#x27;ll realize this is like anything else in the innovators dilemma: the capacity is moving up, the price is moving down, steadily, year on year and you&#x27;re maybe looking at say, a honda-civic level rated e-trike car at say $4,000 in 2030 that can get modular addons and be inductively recharged while driving.<p>I know this sounds as wacky as bill gates home of the future from the 1990s where he talked to a special &quot;assistant computer&quot; in his living room to do things like order a cab or the carputer project MS ran to have an in-dash navigation system with location and map info in the early 90s ... it all looks crazy until it happens.')
