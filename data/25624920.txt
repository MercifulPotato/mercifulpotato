Item(by='dtran', descendants=None, kids=[25625242], score=None, time=1609705696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623773, text='I think &quot;being productive&quot; vs. &quot;time well spent&quot; and &quot;doing things that really matter&quot; is a false dichotomy. It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. I know that&#x27;s a statement from a position of privilege— not every has a job where they can feel like they are in a flow state while working, but do you have any side projects or hobbies where you feel both productive <i>and</i> feel like it&#x27;s time well spent?<p>Coming to this pretty late, but I&#x27;ve been fascinated with the concept of <i>flow</i> recently, which researcher Mihaly Csikszentmihaly described as:<p><pre><code>  “The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times . . . The best moments usually occur if a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile”\n</code></pre>\nAgain, not everyone is in a position to do this, but I think we should de-emphasize number of hours spent in &quot;work mode&quot; albeit inefficiently or without great focus or working on things that aren&#x27;t super important and more time seeking deep focus and then time completely off to relax, recharge and let ideas background process&#x2F;percolate.')
