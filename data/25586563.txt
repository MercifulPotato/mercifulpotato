A government is only legitimate because the people believe it is.  The appearance of fraud challenges that belief.  Challenge that belief enough and people die.  The system needs to be sufficiently robust that the result cannot be disputed with any sort of credibility.<p>If I need to pay a hundred bucks to get permission to buy a gun, DHS can search people with no reason within a hundred miles of the border, cops can seize your cash without evidence of a crime (I can go on) and the and all that&#x27;s compatible with the constitution, then everyone dragging their ass to the DMV and forking over $30 for an ID should be perfectly fine.')
