Then we have sponsored news outlets. We have websites sponsored by different groups. What about an average person? he is not equipped with money and technology to publish his opinion in a very meaningful and informative way. We can solve this problem. I am looking to have something like a WordPress for news, where we can use open source technology to curate news, do news analytics and publish. If you believe the majority of people are kind and trustworthy, and if they are able to express themselves to compete with sponsored outlets, we may be able to do it.')
