Then one day I was in a sandwich shop, and someone ordered a type of ham sandwich that I’d never get, but clearly a lot of people do. It made me think, “wow there’s a lot of people who do like it, so maybe there’s something to it. And I should want to like it too, because if I did, then I would have more things to enjoy in life.”<p>That principal has taken me quite far. If your default view is that you want to like things, it’s amazing how much your previous objections can crumble. Usually it’s not just about exposure (to the “right 10%”), but also your mindset.')
