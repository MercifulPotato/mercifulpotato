Human nature is to wield power. The more power the person has, in whatever form it is, the more inventive ways he will come up with to use it for his goals, be they selfish or otherwise.<p>JR would shut his mouth if his audience chided him to being conspiratorial.<p>The society has lost the ability to think critically. And the focus on individuality has exacerbated the problem. I don&#x27;t mind individuality in matters such as personal growth, morality, religion, etc, but there are some aspects of social life where collective expert decisions must hold higher weight than individual opinions, such as in public health, defense, etc.')
