Then once people take it, I would pressure them for something of value in return.<p>If I give out a gift and it makes someone want to give me a gift in return, then that&#x27;s nice.  But they aren&#x27;t required to give me a gift.  That&#x27;s the whole point of giving a gift in the first place.  It doesn&#x27;t setup a compulsory need to reciprocate.')
