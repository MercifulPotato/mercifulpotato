My co-founder and I are thinking about incorporating a startup in the US. I&#x27;m American but my co-founder is Canadian. We&#x27;ve looked at options under NAFTA &#x2F; TN visa and others, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to apply to startup founders. We&#x27;re also flexible on structure, and leaning on an LLC taxed as S-Corp to make it easy for us for filing. We are a research-based startup and are planning to apply for NSF SBIRs (so we need to be 51% US-owned) and not necessarily raise money at the start. Do you have any thoughts on our case? Or do we need to go the H1-B route for her as a co-founder?<p>Thank you in advance!')
