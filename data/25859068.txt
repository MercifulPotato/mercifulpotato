Regardless, I still filled out the form and look forward to speaking to someone from your team.<p>The reality is that hiring is hard. It is doubly hard when you don&#x27;t have a name brand company, and doubly hard again when you are not VC-backed and can&#x27;t pay salaries competitive to those companies.<p>We&#x27;re a tech company on our way to becoming independently owned again (after a small angel round many years ago), and bootstrap our growth according to revenue. This fact leads us to be very fiscally conservative (especially for a startup). A consistent pain point for us has been the fact that we need engineers to take on larger (or more) projects, but we can&#x27;t afford them (they&#x27;d cost more than a project would bring), but we also can&#x27;t take on these projects without more engineers, so we&#x27;ve been in a holding pattern unwilling to pull the trigger for quite awhile.<p>I presume this is not a new story to you. This situation is the only reason we cannot hire locally, we literally cannot afford it.')
