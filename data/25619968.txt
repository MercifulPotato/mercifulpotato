The program has requirements for formal V&amp;V that they haven&#x27;t met yet. In theory, you could start production by accepting the risk that you might need to do some rework, but I don&#x27;t know if that was even an option.<p>&gt; step through iterations with very quickly<p>The argument for doing a simulation is to get higher fidelity. It doesn&#x27;t really make the process any faster on its own. The simulations themselves take a trivial amount of time compared to the preparation and analysis.<p>&gt; nothing like this has been done before<p>There&#x27;s a lot of simulation in aerospace and defense. I don&#x27;t know exactly how JSE compares in terms of extent and reliance on it, but it&#x27;s not a completely new idea.')
