Item(by='rewq4321', descendants=None, kids=[24679712, 24679871], score=None, time=1601824867, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679437, text='Affects similar to the &quot;relative age effect&quot;[0] are really important. Kids that just so happen to get ahead early (whether by a slight age advantage, or any other) often end up being put into some sort of &quot;gifted&quot; track where they have access to better teachers&#x2F;resources, which compounds until they are well ahead of the others. Even without any sort of gifted program, the self-confidence that gets built around being &quot;the smart kid&quot; is a powerful motivator. The fight for self-confidence in school classrooms is zero-sum.<p>What surprises me is that, from what I&#x27;ve read, the IQ literature doesn&#x27;t seem to take this basic compounding affect into account. So it seems like some skepticism should be held for the idea that IQ is ~50% genetics and ~50% environment. It could be 5% genetics that compounds into 50%. That would seem to be in line with the observation that the measured heritability of intelligence increases with age.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Relative_age_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Relative_age_effect</a>')
