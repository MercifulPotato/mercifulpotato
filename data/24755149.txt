I went to Vang Vieng, did the tubing, left the food area half a hour before the cops rolled ~80 euros for $200usd. I could go on, that was a very strange first 24hrs. Best bit was riding out to some hill, having lunch and looking at a cave.\nI met some sketchy characters there though and I can&#x27;t blame them for shutting it down, free local booze+ cheap booze+ river+ high rope jumps definitely led to some injuries.')
