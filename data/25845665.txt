I&#x27;m even wondering if i should go wider than that for the next monitor. Taskbar autohidden and&#x2F;or to the side of the screen (even on Linux its great with KDE). For productivity the wider the better. Even our vision is panoramic so it just makes sense to model our display according to that. Not to mention that cinema movies use that ratio.<p>If i will ever use a laptop for work, it definitely won&#x27;t be standalone - it will be connected to such a monitor. For on-the-go tasks - whatever really. Just remove the hideous bezels and screen logos already and simply copy what Dell is doing with its XPS line,  gang beat them up if they sue.')
