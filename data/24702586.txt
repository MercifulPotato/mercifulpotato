Unless I&#x27;m really missing something, the language in the new child pornography section is the same as the current language in section 230e covering sex trafficking. That existing sex trafficking clause hasn&#x27;t done any of the things that the EFF says this new one will do.<p>The original Earn It Act was bad. But that bad stuff has been massively ripped out. Plus real protections for privacy added in. It&#x27;s not the same as it was - look up the text and compare what&#x27;s been struck through with what is left.<p>I think in the current form it&#x27;s a definite win for privacy and common sense.')
