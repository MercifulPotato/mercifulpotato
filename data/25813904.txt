If you focus on certificates, you won&#x27;t gain the rounded knowledge you&#x27;ll need.<p>You don&#x27;t need certifications at all to do well in the sector - people are still judged on their merits (and previous gigs), as there&#x27;s a broad recognition, by those who are any good at least, that certifications are very prescriptive and don&#x27;t signal quality. I have none, nobody has ever asked about them.<p>The recent scandal around some large security companies sharing cheat-sheets and answers to certification exams [0] shows one reason people don&#x27;t trust certifications.<p>Some &quot;customers&quot; will want certifications, generally those that have no clue about cyber security, and who therefore have no clue what they want. You might find it hard to break into those kinds of roles in the first instance without some kind of certification, however once you&#x27;ve got some experience and track record, you tend to find they go away.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;crest_investigates_ncc_group&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;crest_investigates_nc...</a>')
