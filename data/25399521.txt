Could it perhaps be used to tell us something about the solar system?<p>I remember my astronomy and maths teacher, Franck W. Pettersen, rest his soul, teaching us how to build a telescope from scratch. We got a long cardboard tube, and some other pieces that we put together quite cheaply. The most expensive part was the lens, which we put at the end of the tube.<p>Earlier he worked as the director of the Northeren Lights Planetarium in Troms√∏, but he quit the job, citing that it was much more rewarding to teach astronomy and physics to pupils rather than showing tourists around.<p>It is perhaps unseremonious, but the first use the telescope saw, was us boys trying to peek at the girls at the neighbouring high school, three kilometres away at Kongsbakken (King&#x27;s Hill) accross the sound. It was a success. We could even read what the teachers there wrote on the blackboards with it.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve always liked night photography, and I&#x27;ve spent many hours making time lapse photography of the Aurora Borealis phenomena that is so common in the North of Norway. However I think this image is a testament to how also daylight photography of certain phenomena might also be very beautiful, and even moving.')
