When I commented how Material Design was so bad when it came out, many got offended. So I thought it must be a subjective personal thing. Now it&#x27;s relief knowing I&#x27;m not the only one who think it&#x27;s bad and full of UX anti-patterns. Flat design should be a thing of the past. It&#x27;s unintutive e.g. hyperlink and button can be indistinguishable,  no clear navigation UI. If any company should lead industry with a design framework, it should be Apple.')
