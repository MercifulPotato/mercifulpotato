I mean, I guess the profession does get its fair share of introverts, but I would have expected enough teamwork that everyone knows what everyone else is doing, at least roughly. At my last gig I remember we had three backenders and four frontenders on a game we were building and the stand-ups seemed superfluous, Ryan on the frontend knew all of the frontend tasks and their exact states, I on the backend knew all of the backend tasks and all of their states, stand-ups were more of a means to celebrate what folks had done and coordinate that info with our QA team.<p>My silver rule of meetings is “to make a meeting matter, make a decision.” If we were assigning new tickets and&#x2F;or backlog, deciding who would own each of them, <i>that</i> meeting is valuable. Progress updates can be delivered asynchronously and consumed asynchronously, unless, say, one wants group applause.<p>Of course now covid exists and I changed jobs to a team that barely talks with me and daily stand-ups are kind of my only social contact with them, so that&#x27;s less fun. But yeah, 100% the original vision of agile with the “developers should be meeting daily with the product users to clarify the underlying model and mold the software to their hands” should cause people to work together so much that stand-ups become something of an afterthought.')
