She&#x27;ll get care at home. When the time comes, she&#x27;ll die at home, too.<p>Myself, our adult daughter, and close friends have all banded together to make sure that she <i>never</i> ends up in a home. We reaffirmed this after Covid hit. If she goes into a hospice care facility, I&#x27;ll never see her again, and she&#x27;ll suffer even more from lack of care.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen healthy but less able older folks put in homes so that their kids could collect their inheritances and sell off everything else. In one case, the older woman was forced out of her home into a nursing home. Her quality of life was erased. She went from thriving at at home to dead in just a few months.<p>These greedy nursing homes are profiting from greedy adults who don&#x27;t care about their parents and from a system that makes money by warehousing people.')
