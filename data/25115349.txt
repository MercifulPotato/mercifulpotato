But we should never make generalized&#x2F;universal policies to the detriment of the masses motivated by long-tail extremes.  Just because we don&#x27;t know how to reliably measure the (real and large) impact of mitigations, doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x2F;should pretent that impact doesn&#x27;t exist.  It&#x27;s all about tradeoffs.  And I&#x27;m tired of emotional heart-strings cases that are &quot;easy&quot; to measure stamping out all the real effects of mitigations that are &quot;hard&quot; to measure.  And I&#x27;ve also heard way too much about, &quot;but if we could have responded effectively&#x2F;quickly like China&#x2F;Vietnam&#x2F;New Zealand then we wouldn&#x27;t have been _forced_ to do these other damaging mitigations&quot; - that is a theoretical idea&#x2F;world that we don&#x27;t live in.  Given the actual situation - that we live in a country with free-spirited&#x2F;selfish people with pretty significant individual liberties, how should we address the virus?  That is the real question.')
