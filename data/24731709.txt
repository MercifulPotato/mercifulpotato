For systems, this arguably <i>is</i> &quot;something you always want to explicitly handle&quot;, whereas for applications it&#x27;s almost always &quot;something where you just want to abort&quot;. The level of abstraction is very different, but a single language is spanning both. Or, more precisely, a single standard library.<p>Just spitballing: maybe one solution could be an alternate set of standard primitives, specifically for low-level work, that <i>do</i> return a Result for everything that might trigger OOM? Maybe those could be abstracted out of the current standard library, and the existing (&quot;application-level&quot;) APIs could wrap them with a panic?')
