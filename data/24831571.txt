Bit of a tangent: in my experience even the times table isn&#x27;t inherently a grind, though at a higher level maybe arithmetic might have to be. When I was in school faced with memorizing the times table conventionally, I decided &quot;this is silly and boring, what I&#x27;m gonna do instead is keep the table visible while I do arithmetic problems, and it&#x27;ll get memorized automatically along the way&quot;, and that worked <i>fine</i>.<p>It&#x27;s the same principle as learning touch-typing with the keyboard layout visible on a card in your field of view (<i>not</i> the same as looking down at the keyboard, which I agree is a bad habit that slows you down).')
