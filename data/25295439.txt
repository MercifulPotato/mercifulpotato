Other sources, such as more &#x27;mainstream&#x27; ones I follow (NYT, WaPo, WSJ, etc.) did not cover this story seemingly, which may be either a simple omission or a product of their own bias. The fact that the link is from Breitbart shouldn&#x27;t be a reason for you to disregard my argument. Evaluate the content in there describing the particular incident - it&#x27;s easy to corroborate.')
