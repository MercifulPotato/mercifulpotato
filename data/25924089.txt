Solaris and HPUX and AIX and Ultrix and Irix are all, in a word, deprecated. The 2000+ line long shell script that’s used to figure out which args to pass to the compiler, determined on the fly for each source file, can still be used on those deprecated systems, but it should also probably be deprecated itself when all you need is “-fPIC” in your CFLAGS (an oversimplification but not by much).')
