You don&#x27;t like a particular project? Start spamming child porn and other problematic posts until the moderators just decide they&#x27;re spending too much time moderating that repo and need to shut it down, even if the developer has done nothing wrong.<p>I get your philosophical stance, and in some ways, I think it&#x27;s healthy to question the fundamental assumptions about whether certain services <i>should</i> exist. But I also think you are willfully ignoring second and third order effects to continue this thought experiment where people are routinely showing that these secondary and* tertiary effects will be crippling to more than just social media companies. And again, <i>social media companies will not go away with 230 repeal; they are some of the only entities with enough capital to handle increased litigation costs as a result of 230 repeal.</i>')
