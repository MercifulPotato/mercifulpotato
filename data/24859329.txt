They&#x27;re not going to stock vehicles that don&#x27;t sell. So naturally there aren&#x27;t a lot of small cars on the lots because those cars just sit there losing money and depreciating in value.<p>Same reason it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find a rear-wheel drive car in areas where it snows regularly. You can go further south and find plenty of RWD cars, but few northern dealerships will stock cars that can&#x27;t be driven half of the year.<p>CRVs sell in large numbers so dealerships stock them. Fits don&#x27;t sell in large numbers so dealers don&#x27;t stock as many. It&#x27;s not a conspiracy.')
