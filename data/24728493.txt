What&#x27;s the argument here?<p>&gt; the omnipresent ‘Dock’ (never used it once)<p>I hide mine. In 12 years on a Mac this hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me since I turned Dock hiding on 5 minutes in.<p>&gt; the omnipresent ‘Finder’<p>Finder isn&#x27;t great, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the graphical file managers on Linux are particularly stellar either.<p>&gt; black magic in the ‘Terminal.app’<p>What &quot;black magic&quot; is this? Also iTerm2 is a wonderful piece of software.<p>&gt; Notifications (and its omnipresent menu hamburger icon)<p>Users do typically need to be notified about things. Is the problem that you want these somewhere else? Is it that you want to disable notifications?

This article has no substance to it, it&#x27;s essentially clickbait.<p>There are many reasons to dislike macOS, there are many legitimate reasons to move to another OS on other hardware.<p>We make better decisions when we are more honest like this.')
