Cleaning the office is important else the whole thing stops working; deciding go&#x2F;no go on a new product is also important else the cleaners lose their job.<p>I am not sure how to fix this.  The fact that we conceive of hives of bees as having a &quot;queen&quot; (who is in fact the weakest member of the entire colony with precisely zero decision making ability) shows how deeply entrenched this model is.')
