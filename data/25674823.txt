They should not be peer pressured into giving up those views.<p>I for one avoid Google products for personal communications. A lot of long term friends decided they only want to socialize online with Google products fully knowing it excludes me, in spite of easily accessible alternatives like Matrix and Jitsi.<p>They are not using Google products because it makes the world better, they are using it because they don&#x27;t like change, and changing to maintain a friendship with me was not worth trying to use less privacy hostile communication mediums.<p>Fair enough.<p>I for one would not exclusively socialize at a Brazilian steakhouse if I had a vegan friend in a given social circle.<p>I will go to great lengths to accommodate people that are acting on authentic ethical convictions but if someone is only doing something that conflicts with my ethical convictions because they can&#x27;t be bothered to try something new, then they obviously don&#x27;t value me, and I&#x27;ll invest more time with people who do.<p>You should live your convictions and find people that either share them, or at least respect you enough to accommodate them.<p>I don&#x27;t expect others to think or act like me, but I would expect that my legitimate desire to maintain privacy in personal communication to be respected by anyone worth my time.<p>Plenty of friends that don&#x27;t share my views put up with using some open tools to keep in touch with me.
