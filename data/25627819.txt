A lot of trans people have a lot of disliking for cis gay men and call their own poor practices&quot;homonormativity&quot;. As a result, they balk at being included as &quot;queer&quot; or even at the existence of terms like &quot;LGBT&quot; as they don&#x27;t feel solidarity with CIS gay or bisexual men. Many of these queers embrace and demand recognition of their unique pronouns. If they prefer xe&#x2F;xem, you may get an earful for saying &quot;they&#x2F;them&quot;.')
