Finding real white hat hackers is hard, but they are out there.<p>Most &#x27;security guys&#x27; are not hackers. They do not have CS degrees and are not curious at all. Rather, they are 8 to 5 office workers that are compliance and risk oriented. They run automated vulnerability scanners (that are largely useless and filled with false positives based on the version string of Apache). They submit reports to management where they discuss how to make the &#x27;red&#x27; things &#x27;green&#x27; to impress the Board.<p>Real hackers are very curious about technology and like to see how they can break things or make things do something that they were not intended to do. That&#x27;s how they find bugs.<p>Two totally different worlds. One is focused on &#x27;compliance and risk and loss prevention insurance policies&#x27; (basically CYA) while the other is focused on actually being technically secure by trying to break things before the bad hacker comes along and does so.')
