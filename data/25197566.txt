In fact, you don&#x27;t need to like rms or believe in Free Software to become a GNU maintainer. This wasn&#x27;t about that.<p>&gt; but it is disrespectful to the child victims<p>Yeah, no. When Nadine Strossen, former president of the ACLU, takes the time to weigh in on a personal title on the matter, that means Stallman has been vindicated. One can no longer pin their lack of reading comprehension on him. If someone only gets &quot;the facts&quot; from twitter, that is their own problem, not GNU&#x27;s, not Stallman&#x27;s.<p>&gt; accuse the signatories of the statement of acting unethically or underhandedly.<p>They spammed all GNU maintainers addresses.<p>Not all the advocacy for their cause was transparent and above board. It&#x27;s all there in the mailing list for anyone to see and make up their own minds.')
