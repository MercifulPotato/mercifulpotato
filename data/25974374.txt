The problem was deception, not AI itself.<p>Unfortunately the companies would probably make a wrong conclusion here: don’t offer people opportunities to opt out of specific things, instead force them to accept blanket statements like “your photos will be anonymously used for the product development and enhancement by this and affiliated companies”. It’s not like people read EULAs very carefully.')
