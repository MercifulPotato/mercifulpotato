Everything installed without a hitch, including wifi, bluetooth, and a usb webcam. Incredibly, just turning on a paired wireless speaker instantly connects and selects it for output. The volume control on my keyboard also worked as expected without any configuration.<p>Pressing &quot;Super&quot; (I mapped it to Caps Lock) floats all the active windows in my workspace and allows me to start typing for a search, and unlike Spotlight it actually works. &quot;Alt + Tab&quot; and &quot;Alt + ~&quot; cycle through open apps and windows within apps just like on OS X.<p>No more fussing with homebrew, macports, or Apple weirdness when working with CLI programs. Everything is blazingly fast. The IntelliJ ecosystem works without a hitch. Zoom, Spotify, Slack, even Teamwork Chat have native clients. I have a Win10 VM in case I need it, but I haven&#x27;t yet.<p>The only thing I miss is Spark for email (Evolution is pretty good) and Carbon Copy Cloner for bootable backups. I have CloneZilla for that, but would be great to run a bootable diff without that hassle.<p>Definitely worth the ~$4000 I saved for a comparable iMac Pro or Mac Pro.')
