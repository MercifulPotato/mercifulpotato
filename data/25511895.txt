It’s elitist at best, outright evil at worst. I’m not really sure what goal it serves.<p>If your point is that we should just “take all the warning labels off of everything and let the situation resolve itself,” no thanks. I don’t have the time to research the exact origin of everything I put in my mouth. I have to trust that when I buy food, someone out there has at least made an attempt to minimize the chances that it contains loads of mercury.<p>Are you running extensive tests on everything you eat and drink? The air you breathe? Sure, companies might not want to ruin their reputation by selling such goods, but, then again, we have Ripple. So which is it?<p>Or maybe I just need to be more selective about which companies I choose, right? Despite seeing exit scam after exit scam, incompetent blunder after blunder, that will surely protect me better than the SEC et al doing their damn jobs.<p>No. I want oversight. Sure, that doesn’t mean I can let my guard down; I still have to be selective. But at least there’s a pretty low chance that the brand-name toothpaste I use tonight—or the &lt;insert snake oil here&gt; I use instead—is slowly killing me.')
