AI<p>it&#x27;s always 5 years away because mainstream AI researches are stuck with yak shaving their gradient descents.<p>I mean you can&#x27;t just throw things at the wall and hope they  stick, but it&#x27;s literally the state of the art, if you follow ML conferences and their world-beating toy benchmarks results, with a lot of pseudo-rigorous handwaving for theory.<p>The reason physics has been so successful is that their theory closely followed empirical data and constraints imposed by nature.<p>I think the only hope to achieve common sense in AI is to align it with hard constraints living organisms have, using those constraints as a guide.<p>A few terms I mentioned are coming from that POV, if you dig a bit deeper they all have direct physical manifestation in natural learning systems.')
