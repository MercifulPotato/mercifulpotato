And a quick win is motivating.<p>For more senior developers, assigning a simple feature addition is another option. Eg, having a front end developer add a filter option to some search panel in an application. It may require some UI work, which has the added benefit of getting one involved with people on the UX side — helping to onboard in a team sense. It also may involve some server communication components. Either way, like Muir said — tug on one tiny leaf and you’ll find it is connected to all of nature. (Or something like that.) Similarly, investigate a bug or new feature and you’ll find it brings you through a large portion of the app’s infrastructure.')
