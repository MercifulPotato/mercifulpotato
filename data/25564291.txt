You can write all your pure code in IO if that is what you&#x27;d prefer.  I look at types as more of a way to communicate to others using my code as &quot;here be dragons, this has side effects&quot; or vice versa. The developer using your code doesn&#x27;t just have to trust a comment block, they can see it directly in the types.<p>I agree monad composition isn&#x27;t amazing.  When I was writing a lot of Haskell (I was working on real time 3d reconstruction algorithms from video feeds using camera input and OpenGL output) it wasn&#x27;t a very large roadblock though.  But effect type systems seemed like they might be cleaner.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to read through that article right away but I saved it for future reference - thank you for sharing.')
