They have a number of &quot;problems&quot; of varying difficulties. Depending on the competition, the easier ones start out with simple stack buffer overflows, SQL injection, etc., and many competitors will post writeups after the competition.<p>Ctftime.org is a good place for a list of competitions (note: some are more difficult, in that an unexperienced person won&#x27;t be able to do the intro problems). I&#x27;d recommend checking out picoctf as a good intro one.')
