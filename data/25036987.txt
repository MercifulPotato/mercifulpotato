The reflex of many embedded devs is <i>not</i> to use big processors running standard software speaking standard protocols. IoT represents people realizing that there are many applications where it&#x27;s a good idea to use a $20 board and standard software to do something that could technically be accomplished by a $0.02 chip and 100 different serial protocols.')
