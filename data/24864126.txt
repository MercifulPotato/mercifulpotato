Unless you send only one resource, pipelining is probably a huge win.<p>And it definitely, from the server side, makes things way easier. As you can get a bunch of requests &amp; start satisfying them in whatever order works for you. This isn&#x27;t like HTTP 1.1 Pipelining, which was in order: now connected systems can out of order send whatever data they have, without having to buffer it &amp; wait for the first asked for data to clear the pipe.<p>This is massively massively helpful tech we are creating. Attaching it to &quot;very bloated webpages&quot;, &amp; implying this is something &quot;we should move away from&quot; is a high level of shade that is not at all in any way deserved nor fair nor accurate.')
