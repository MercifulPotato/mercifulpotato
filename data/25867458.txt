Item(by='jehb', descendants=None, kids=[25872555, 25867871], score=None, time=1611281987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867102, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t for the life of me find a job that pays to write a new framework or some piece of interesting software because opensource completely devalues code.<p>Could you put some more color around this part? I don&#x27;t understand the argument you&#x27;re making here. It sounds like you&#x27;re arguing that there&#x27;s not market demand for the thing you&#x27;d like to be paid to make because it already exists and that the version that exists is open source. How is that any different than if the thing you&#x27;d like to make is under a proprietary license but at a price point you are unable to compete with?<p>Disclosure: My entire career in the software industry has been at companies who pay people to write software that is made available under open source licenses. Whether or not there is demand for a new thing to be created has proven independent of the license on that thing. We create and support software that meets our customer&#x27;s needs, give them a path to easily extending functionality with hiring a whole development team, and indemnify them from the risk of consuming potentially insecure, unsupported software in critical production environments. Open source is a software development model, not a business model. Providing customer value is a business model, and it&#x27;s rather independent of the license underneath.')
