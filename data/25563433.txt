I&#x27;ve been getting emails from some bank I am not a member of because an Aaron Bernoulli registered an account with my email address, and the physical address he listed is, as best as I can tell, some abandoned lot. I&#x27;ve just been autofiltering all the emails to spam because my one attempt to notify the bank about it got nowhere, and they don&#x27;t provide an unsubscribe button. Do I have any other responsibility here?')
