We constantly filter out unimportant information based on our experiences.<p>If you are using Emacs and encounter a new problem you will first try to solve it with the tools you are used to (if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail).<p>Finding new sources of information to change our filters is hard. Think back to the last time you came to a completely new technology and how lost you feel until you get a good grasp about it and how much of an uphill battle this can be.<p>The sunk cost fallacy runs deep there as well.
