I stopped eating gluten for a while then slowly reintroducing it after couple of month in a non refined form (muesli). Now I can handle it much better than before but I suspect that could have been IBS and not only a gluten intolerance. Check out if lactose isn&#x27;t the culprit, they put it in too many things that you wouldn&#x27;t expect. Also having a good microbiota is really important, so you could give a try to Probiotics and PrEbiotics.')
