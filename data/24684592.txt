Nowadays, http server extensions and cloud services easily match FastCGI performance, while providing many scaling and logging and denial of service protections and features built in.  It&#x27;s hard to argue for FastCGI anymore, but everyone wants to reinvent the wheel, and some of those wheels are nice.  Who needs EDI when we have SOAP?  Who needs either when we have REST.')
