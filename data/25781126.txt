I was responding to several disjointed, self-righteous platitudes strung together.<p>Not to single out the commenter above, as it&#x27;s a common phenomenon.<p>There was nothing muddying about my comment. If someone has an issue to take up with a particular writer and their treatment of a subject in an opinion column that is one thing, but that&#x27;s not what was happening. What I was pointing out and opposing is the treatment of &quot;MSM&quot; as &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;[0] as a whole. So, unless recipes, arts columns, news reporting, and travel writing are also all &quot;fake news&quot;, the NYT is not &quot;fake news&quot;.<p>Media literacy always has been of severe importance, and it really begins with a base level literacy and handling of the language and context the writing comes from. Picking out a couple of opinion columns and using them to brand an entire field of work and study as &quot;fake news&quot; is problematic.<p>Frankly, the problem seems to stem with many people misreading Orwell (or not at all before raising his name as a moral objection), and not even taking a moment to read that they&#x27;re browsing the opinion section before they&#x27;ve decided to take off with outrage.<p>I never argued with their opinions. I countered their understanding of the functioning of North American media with illustrations.<p>[0] When this word is pegged in next to &quot;fake news&quot;, one tends to understand, given the context, that the meaning was idiomatic in the anti-journalism sense and not the larger meaning of the word.')
