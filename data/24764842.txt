Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602591445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764526, text='Click-through licensing is absolutely not required nor recommended for their other licenses, like the GPL.<p>The FSF&#x27;s oficial position is that the AGPL is a Free Software license, which means it meets all Free Software requirements. This is understandable, as it is their license. I disagree. Freedom 0 is the ability to run the software however you want, and the AGPL imposes requirements here (if you modify it <i>without distributing it</i> then you are required to offer source when you use it, which is a requirement that goes beyond traditional copyright licensing).<p>So while they are correct in saying that click-through licensing is silly for typical permissive&#x2F;copyleft licenses, I strongly disagree that the AGPL is such a license. It&#x27;s fundamentally different, and I&#x27;ve already given an example of how being unaware of it has potentially put me in noncompliance. The whole point of click-through not being necessary for users is that for all those other licenses, <i>no</i> restrictions are imposed on end-users as long as direct distribution of the code does not occur. The AGPL imposes such restrictions.')
