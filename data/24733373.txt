I miss knowing exactly what I need to be doing every day.<p>But I certainly don&#x27;t miss with dealing with the general public, where a very vocal minority has decided that it is socially acceptable to yell at service workers.  It&#x27;s even worse when it&#x27;s their own mistake, like they ask for mustard when they meant honey mustard, and somehow I&#x27;M the idiot for not knowing which one they meant.<p>Or they ask for &quot;light mayo&quot; and I ask them to clarify if they meant a small amount of mayo, or the low-fat mayo, and they snap an answer back at me as if I was being a smart-ass.  The answers were close to 50&#x2F;50 by the way.<p>Damn maybe I don&#x27;t miss it after all.  I could go on for hours about how shitty some customers can be.')
