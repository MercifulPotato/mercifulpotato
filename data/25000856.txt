If you accept that’s reasonable it explains some of how things have happened with dep and generics.<p>If I remember right dep was becoming a de-facto standard without ever submitting to the proposal process where the Go team could address their technical differences.  Obviously there was a messaging failure here and they could have emphasized that it was not formally accepted, but it’s tough to tell people not to use a major improvement to the status quo when there is no alternative to point to and hasn’t been for years.<p>For language changes so far there’s been almost zero changes approved, by anyone, including the core team, so it’s hard to make a comparison.  But if you look at the current generics proposal it’s an enormous amount of work to completely specify.  As far as I know, there have been zero actual proposals by the community and several by the core team (most of which were rejected).  I think the community sentiment has been more that we should <i>have</i> generics, or “wouldn’t this feature be useful” on the issue tracker without fully fleshing it out, not actually making formal proposals and getting shot down.')
