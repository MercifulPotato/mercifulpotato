They do this pretty much on every account creation after a couple of hours, I guess so that you&#x27;d have some time to get on the hook.<p>I&#x27;m kinda used to that and accepted that, apparently, I will never use Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Google account because of that. Whatever, I don&#x27;t care. What was really infuriating, though, is when PayPal asked me to enter my phone &quot;to make my account even safer&quot;. Fuck them, but having problems with PayPal is quite a bit more annoying than being unable to use some social media bullshit.')
