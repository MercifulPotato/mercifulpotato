What about really nefarious stuff like CP? Do we know who is responsible and is it possible to report and take down links? Also does running a node involve you in anything unknowingly?<p>Or does it have nothing to do with anonymity&#x2F;bullet-proof links and is merely just a very cheap storage?<p>P.S.
