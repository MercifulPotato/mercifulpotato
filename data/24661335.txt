Are we talking about people who know what O(n) means? Parent comment explained it very well - &quot;n&quot; is typically your input size (or if it&#x27;s not, you need to clearly define what it is). &quot;n&quot; is unlikely to ever be &quot;number of vowels in the English alphabet&quot; because that&#x27;s a constant, that doesn&#x27;t change at all when input changes.<p>O(n) is meaningless if we don&#x27;t say anything about &quot;n&quot;, so no, &#x27;iterating an array&quot; is not necessarily O(n) - it&#x27;s only so when the array has a size proportional with the input.<p>Or, to put it differently: yes &quot;array.includes&quot; is not O(1) in common discussions, because typically we discuss the complexity of method `includes` as relative to the size of the array; but a program&#x2F;algorithm that contains an invocation of `array.includes` does not automatically have complexity that is linear or worse - it can very well be logarithmic or constant. For example, looking up a value in a hashtable where the keys are strings is considered to be constant time, even though you need to iterate over the key in order to obtain its hashcode (i.e. the algorithm that takes a string and produces a hashcode is O(n) where n is the length of the string).')
