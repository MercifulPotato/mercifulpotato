Can you explain why choosing to not work for or dine at a racist lunch counter, instead of work there and then complain to management about their racism, is ignoring the problem?<p>It isn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s strictly better to boycott than to abide.<p>The observations are as follows:<p>* Boycotting is, for a multitude of reasons, not always a reasonable option for individuals<p>* Companies are aware that some of their best potential talent won&#x27;t work for them unless they emphasize at least <i>some</i> social good<p>* It&#x27;s not especially surprising that people who are attracted by the promise of <i>some</i> social good want more, and are upset or angry when they realize that their company&#x27;s ethical stances are superficial or self-serving<p>* Conversely, it&#x27;s not especially surprising that companies that aggressively pursue &quot;apolitical&quot; positions are the ones that are perhaps the most objectionable: defense contractors, financial companies that benefit from organized crime, &amp;c, and find themselves in the company of employees who <i>actively</i> favor the company&#x27;s unethical positions<p>To be clear: it&#x27;s a double bind for companies, and it&#x27;s always been one. I wouldn&#x27;t want it any other way!')
