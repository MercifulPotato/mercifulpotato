I wish there was a write-up on what it improves over its old version.<p>OTR was great, until Signal&#x2F;Axolotl&#x2F;OMEMO came about that allowed for multiple endpoints. OTR you had to establish sessions and if messages were received out of order or an end closed the session, you&#x27;d have to handshake again. I used it with GTalk before Google staked it dead, then on AIM for a bit until Verizon (I think?) finally staked that dead. It worked pretty well unless I had multiple computers up with OTR support in the clients. In this situation I&#x27;d have clients fighting each other to handshake and invalidating their old sessions.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, OTR is great because you can run it over most anything that doesn&#x27;t mangle the text being sent whether that&#x27;s IRC or whatever your text protocol of the day is.<p>Textsecure, which later became Signal was originally based on a stripped-down version of this... but SMS sucks for sending longer messages and verifying delivery order so that was abandoned.')
