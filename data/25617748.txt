But that is a very non-standard delineation of political leanings, and making claims based on said boundaries will understandably generate friction with the overwhelming majority that recognize Democrats as a liberal party.<p>In other words, the claim that tech workers are not liberal says a lot more about the perspective of the person making the claim than it does about tech workers. Tech workers are much more liberal than the general population. How many <i>would</i> qualify as liberal under this political delineation? Probably a single digit percentage.')
