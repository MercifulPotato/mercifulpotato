Not really, as long as they do neither sell grapes&#x2F;plants nor give away new plants and as long as they either destroy the plant before selling the home or alert the next homeowners that the grapes have restricted use. (grape plants live more than a year). No one will check, either, so long as use is restrained, and you aren&#x27;t telling other folks how to do it with those particular grapes.<p>But on a larger scale than home use? Selling? Making jams or juices? It isn&#x27;t really a tragedy, but someone did the work to develop the grapes, and I do think they should be rewarded for their labor.')
