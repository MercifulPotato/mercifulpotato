The AdS&#x2F;CFT correspondence alone is worth the effort that was put in, not to mention mirror symmetry in algebraic geometry and everything that was discovered about Calabi-Yau manifolds.<p>String theory research isn&#x27;t directly useful, but other fields of physics and mathematics reap the benefits.')
