Found the bug report: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.launchpad.net&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;+source&#x2F;accountsservice&#x2F;+bug&#x2F;1900255" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.launchpad.net&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;+source&#x2F;accountsservice&#x2F;+b...</a><p>Accountservice is actually changing its user ID rather than dropping capabilities which is where my confusion came from. It looks like there’s magic in the kernel to allow a process to switch back to the original user &amp; some nuance about some ways of switching allowing you to send signals while other ways make your process act like a semi-hybrid of two user accounts (I.e. it technically looks owned by your user but you still don’t have permissions to do things with it). Security issues always lie in these kind of weird nuances.')
