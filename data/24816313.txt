I bought a specialized plastic cutter from a Japanese company a couple years ago. It was expensive, but I couldn&#x27;t find another that took less than 4 weeks to ship.<p>It&#x27;s built more like a smartphone than a cheap hand tool. Fully machined, no parting lines, very tight tolerances. The plastic is quite strong, maybe nylon. The steel cutter is definitely hardened and non magnetic so possibly stainless.<p>And in Japanese fashion, as far as I can tell this company only makes plastic cutters')
