And without consistency you can&#x27;t have a memory.<p>In other words in cellular automata context aren&#x27;t the concepts of &#x27;memory&#x27; and &#x27;measurement&#x27; isomorphic. I.e. a cell pattern {c} can be copied from region 1 to region 2, and from there any number of times.<p>Or have I misunderstood something?')
