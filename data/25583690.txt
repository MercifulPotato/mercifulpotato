Normally whenever I want to cross the street (as a pedestrian, but even more as a cyclist) and a car approaches I (unconsciously) examine its speed, and if it&#x27;s higher than acceptable I try to make eye contact with the driver to make sure they see me and it&#x27;s safe for me to go. How do I make contact with the AI of the car? More importantly, how do I get the cue I&#x27;ve been noticed?')
