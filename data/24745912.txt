Many philosophers stake their entire career on a mistake.<p>Being the expert in your field, even having 30+ years of experience, does not make you a philosopher. A beginner in philosophy has at least an undergraduate degree and 5-10 additional years of moderate study.<p>Stick to what you know, and you will always be able to translate your experience into valuable insights for others.')
