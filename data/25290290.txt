I am in France but have many friends and family in the US and hearing the stories from them is both saddening and infuriating.<p>Sadly my own friends and family that I used to respect and look up to have shown themselves as fools this year. People I used to think of as very intelligent falling for the most insane conspiracy theories and other such nonsense. It has been really eye opening in an increasingly depressing way.<p>And on top of that as someone from the UK (but now living in France) I also have the stupidness of Brexit to deal with.<p>People talk about the impact of lockdowns on mental health but honestly that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, the biggest impact to me this year has been the stupidity and selfishness of so many people. It is draining having to listen to people talk about 5G spreading the virus or Bill Gates wants to microchip you with the vaccine or going on rants that surgical masks lead to a dangerous build up of CO2.<p>There is something seriously wrong with the human race. A shocking lack of education and rational rather than emotional thinking for starters.<p>Sorry I guess my comment doesn&#x27;t really add to the discourse. Guess I just needed to just put something &#x27;out there&#x27; rather than it just rattle around in my head right now.')
