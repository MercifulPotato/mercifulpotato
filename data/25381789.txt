It’s composed of a number of modules that each check one thing and report a message and a “severity”. The glue code then orders them and send the email. Currently it checks:<p>Twitter follows&#x2F;unfollows for me, my wife, and my Twitter bot<p>Stock movements for the few stocks (RSUs) I have<p>Confirmation that several daily backups (db dumps etc) were successful<p>Upcoming SSL cert and domain expirations<p>New GitHub stars<p>Disk space left on my personal server (running out tends to make it crash)<p>I know that looks like a lot of stuff, but the goal is for the script to programmatically determine which ones cross the threshold into being actionable&#x2F;important and to hide&#x2F;de-prioritize the unimportant ones for me so I can confidently ignore them and focus on any important ones.')
