I don&#x27;t think I ever played AD&amp;D, but I did read the 2nd edition rulebook, and it struck me as a patchwork where every ability had its own custom system that didn&#x27;t look like any of the many other patches of system in there. One thing 3rd did was clean it up and reduce it to one simple, big over-arching system that handled everything.<p>It&#x27;s just that that one system had a lot of moving parts. Every point of AC had to come from somewhere, everything had to be typed, and there&#x27;s absolutely a lot of logic behind it, but instead of just AC, you&#x27;ve got touch AC (without the armor bonus), flat-footed AC (without the Dex bonus), etc.<p>They have different kinds of complexity. One is a patchwork of countless little subsystems that you can never all remember, and the other has one really big system that does everything.<p>Though the real complexity in D&amp;D 3 is in the builds. A whole industry sprung up around figuring out new broken builds, what classes to dip for what bonus, etc. I think the easy multiclassing was a mistake.<p>(Despite having played RPGs since 1984, D&amp;D 5 was the first D&amp;D that I ever bought. I was mostly playing other systems.)')
