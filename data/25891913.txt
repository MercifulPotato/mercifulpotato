Plastic is a big case in point. They are going for useless plastic bag bans, and plastic straw bans instead of the real issues.<p>Clothes made from recycled plastic bottles (yay recycling(?) are shedding fibers into our waters as they are washed. How is that ok?<p>Now just to be clear, one thing I saw in the US which I found pretty disturbing, was those small plastic bags used for fruits. Sometimes they were so low quality that they visibly shed little chunks of plastic. I&#x27;m fully behind banning those.<p>But as flawed as government is, I guess it&#x27;s still better than nothing.')
