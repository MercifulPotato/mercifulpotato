It doesn&#x27;t matter whether that bias is due to deletion, banning, shadow-banning, algorithmic&#x2F;statistical manipulation, editorial notes, etc. All of these things are forms of bias that the powerful can use in an attempt to control the speech of others.<p>The thing is, most of us aren&#x27;t purists at all. Many agree that there should be some limits to free speech, and that certain things like calls to violence, dehumanisation of people, disinformation that doesn&#x27;t get corrected until too late, and so on, are big issues for democratic society. However, it would be better if we could discuss this, rather than having our position straw-manned into something contrary to its inner morality&#x2F;logic, and then getting treated as if we are all strict adherents to this as opposed to practical people that try to balance it with other things.')
