All because the execs at these companies wanted to maintain total control of the workforce and suppress wages.<p>This is ridiculous. It was a non-recruitment pact that led to lower pay (for already wealthy people, just not as wealthy ad that execs), not wage-fixing nor non-hiring nor control over where people live or went to school or who they marry.<p>And the insulation that the wealthiest 1% of people are entitled to send their child to a better school than their non-tech-star neighbors is horrific. It exposes a worldview that extreme inequality is only bad if you aren&#x27;t on top<p>&gt; NPCs<p>What does this even mean? Being poorly paid and not having healthcare is bad, but being an &quot;NPC&quot; has nothing to do with it. How is being employed as a driver&#x2F;cook&#x2F;whatever more of a &quot;PC&quot;?')
