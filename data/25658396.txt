Item(by='bogomipz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609945898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656493, text='From your link:<p>&gt;&quot;According to Kelly and Laycock’s book, the United States has invaded or fought in 84 of the 193 countries recognized by the United Nations and has been militarily involved with 191 of 193 – a staggering 98 percent.&quot;<p>&quot;Invaded or fought in&quot; - that&#x27;s a pretty big &quot;or&quot; there no? The theater of operations for the US Military in World War II was easily 84 countries in itself [1]. Also 84 countries is not all but 3 is it? Nor would it be considered &quot;most&quot; as you stated.<p>Further that&#x27;s not really a citation that supports your assertion. It&#x27;s a post with a single reference to a book entitled &quot;America Invades: How We&#x27;ve Invaded or been Militarily Involved with almost Every Country on Earth.&quot; The phrase &quot;or been Militarily Involved with&quot; is casting a pretty wide net no? That&#x27;s quite a nebulous clause. If you sell someone a tank you are &quot;militarily involved&quot; with them. By that dubious measure much of the globe is &quot;militarily involved&quot; with each other.<p>Have you read this book? What&#x27;s seems to be notable about this book is the absence of any footnotes or bibliographic information. This is quite odd for a history book. I think this book could be accurately described as &quot;entertainment reading&quot; as it seems to lack any academic rigor.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_theaters_of_operations_in_World_War_II" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_theaters_of_oper...</a>')
