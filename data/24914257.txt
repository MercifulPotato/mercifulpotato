I&#x27;m not really a Java programmer, but I&#x27;ve helped more than one Java developer (usually junior ones, to be fair) with build issues. This is because when I use Java, I write it using vim and either `javac`and a Makefile, or else the command line interface of a Java build tool (ant, maven, gradle, etc). That has given me a good understanding of the Java build process, that I&#x27;ve found many users of Eclipse or IntelliJ do not have.<p>As such, I think your proposal may have legs, because it could allow less technical users access to the programming environment, while retaining a text-based interface for more expert users.')
