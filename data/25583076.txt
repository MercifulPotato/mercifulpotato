There are so many conditions in which an automatic pilot hasn&#x27;t been tested. We don&#x27;t even know the factors involved in estimating the risk: e.g., is it dependent on the human co-pilot? And self-driving cars may change the car usage patterns, exerting a contextual influence on the risk.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of responsibility. Who will be held responsible when the automatic pilot is driving? If it&#x27;s the human, then a high risk of causing an accident will be unacceptable to many drivers.')
