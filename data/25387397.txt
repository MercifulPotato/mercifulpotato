Metal is a lot easier to disinfect than plastic, and each user could have their own personal set of earcups, swapped often, without that wearing down any latching hardware. And the weight isn’t a problem if you’re just using them at a desk. High-impedance studio monitors are always heavy!<p>No current Mac can actually work with these headphones, but I don’t think the idea is that everyone is supposed to DAW on their iPads; rather, I presume that these headphones are meant to presage that the next Apple Silicon pro-level Macs <i>will</i> have the right features to support working in regular desktop DAW software with these headphones. (It&#x27;s curious, though, that they released them well ahead of announcing those new Macs. They could have just put the announcements together.)')
