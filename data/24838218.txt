I have a service that uses pylibmc and pycurl, and it works with PyPy. Those extensions didn&#x27;t rewrite with cffi or anything like that, PyPy added a compatibility layer, it&#x27;s impressive.<p>But, you don&#x27;t get the JIT performance if you use the C extensions a lot, it&#x27;s better for PyPy performance if you find a pure-python alternative for extensions used in &quot;hot paths&quot;.')
