Big Pharma should get this recognition anyway because as you said: &quot;Pharma refined it, applied it to covid and creating the distribution infrastructure&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t worry though. Time would never give this award to Big Pharma, as evidenced by the fact they gave it to Biden&#x2F;Harris, one of the most milquetoast tickets in recent history, in a year where the first big pandemic in a century is ravaging the world. I&#x27;m also surprised they didn&#x27;t go down the feel-good route of giving it to frontline healthcare workers, but Trump is a bigger deal, apparently.')
