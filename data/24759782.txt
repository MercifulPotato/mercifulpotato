Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=[24765417], score=None, time=1602539084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759243, text='The people for whom the advice of &quot;buy a 2-4 year old certified pre-owned car&quot; makes economic sense are the ones who are otherwise buying a new car. There are a ton of people who seem to default to &quot;I&#x27;m buying new&quot; for whatever reason.<p>I&#x27;ve had excellent savings (and frankly, minimal hassle) from buying an 8-year old Mercedes diesel with 180K on it, a 7-year old Honda CR-V with 165K on it, and a 7-year old Alfa Spider with 24k on it in my younger days. The Mercedes was bullet-proof but painted with an eco-friendly paint system that ensured they prematurely rusted (oh, the irony of taking a perfectly functional car off the road to save the pla). The Alfa I sold running well with 125K on it a few years back as we were planning to have kids. The Honda is still my SO&#x27;s daily driver with around 215K on it.<p>I do my own wrenching on the cars, which also keeps the costs down, but even if I paid an independent (non-dealer) mechanic to do everything, decent cars just don&#x27;t break that much any more. (The Alfa was extremely reliable. From 1993-2009, it broke exactly once and that was the failure of a Bosch distributor, nothing to do with the Italian heritage. The Mercedes took no major work over that time. The Honda did need a clutch which was $750 in parts and would have been around $1000 in labor.)<p>Not feeling the need to carry collision insurance is another big money saver.')
