Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610057854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676839, text='&gt;Pipe bombs were in the DNC&#x2F;RNC headquarters and not done by this group.<p>Unless you want to claim it&#x27;s sheer coincidence, I&#x27;m pretty sure those were planted by extremist Trump supporters with the same goals as the group that broke into the Capital. That they were not <i>literally</i> planted by any of those specific people isn&#x27;t really relevant to the greater point.<p>Of course, you know that, you&#x27;re just being pedantic.<p>&gt;They didn&#x27;t have &quot;guns, knifes and zip-ties&quot; .. I think there were 4 charged with guns? None of them used them.<p>So they didn&#x27;t use them, but they did have them. I guess they just wore them to the insurrection for the cool factor?<p>And as far as the zip ties go, here&#x27;s a photo of them[0]. Also Molotov cocktails, forgot to mention those.<p>&gt;I saw people who supported Tump. I didn&#x27;t see any neo nazis. There was one man with a communist tattoo, and some fucking QAnon idiot with a racoon on his head who should go to federal prison.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet the guy parading the Confederate flag through the Capital[1], the guy with the Camp Auschwitz shirt[2] and the 6MWE shirt[3] (it stands for &quot;Six Million (Jews) Weren&#x27;t Enough&quot;, by the way) likely have some neo-nazi sympathies.<p>And just speaking generally, if you&#x27;re not aware of the strong white supremacist&#x2F;antisemitic contingent within the MAGA and QAnon communities, and Trump&#x27;s populist movement in general, I have to assume you&#x27;ve been living under a rock for the last four years, that maybe you just don&#x27;t know who the Proud Boys actually are, have never been on any social media where Trump supporters hang out, or something.<p>&gt;If you really think this was some kind of insurrection, I feel sorry for you. It was nothing of the sort. It was pittance compared to the burning down of a fucking police station by BLM rioters.<p>Dismiss the right wing, implicate BLM as the greater threat.. if I had to take a shot every time someone did that on HN since yesterday, I would have been dead in two hours.<p>It was an insurrection. A piss-poor attempt at one, but that&#x27;s still what it was. The Gunpowder Plot was a failure as well, but no one says Guy Fawkes and his cohort weren&#x27;t trying to blow up Parliament just because they didn&#x27;t succeed. Nobody says Richard Reid wasn&#x27;t a terrorist because he didn&#x27;t actually manage to set off his shoe bombs.<p>&gt;&quot;oh I&#x27;m so scared. The peasants in the village have made their way into the royal court and sat at our golden seats and found our candy desk!&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t even know what this is supposed to be, but it makes you seem infantile.<p>&gt;Anyone who broke or stole anything will face federal charges and will go away (and should). But classifying that entire group the way you have is disingenuous. Especially compared to the rioting and looting that&#x27;s been endorsed and encourages as being good and righteous by the left wing media.<p>BLM again....<p>&gt;The media has told us setting things on fire by BLM is fine for months and now they&#x27;re acting like 1&#x2F;10th of that is the end of democracy.<p>BLM again, and the media. That&#x27;s a double shot.<p>&gt;“But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.” -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr<p>And wow. You actually have the gall to invoke MLK in defense of a political ideology which has been primarily fueled by xenophobia, racism and intolerance, to use the voice of the oppressed to champion the oppressor?<p>That degree of callous evil is actually impressive. Slow clap for you.<p>Also I just want to point out that you&#x27;ve implicitly undermined your entire comment prior by essentially admitting here that what happened yesterday <i>was</i> a violent rebellion after all.<p>I&#x27;m so done here.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;keith_rosson&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346993989057093634" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;keith_rosson&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346993989057093634</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piersmorgan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347092214753726465" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piersmorgan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347092214753726465</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DrEricDing&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347136597934944257&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DrEricDing&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347136597934944257&#x2F;ph...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Jfh33&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347214428043935745&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Jfh33&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347214428043935745&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1</a>')
