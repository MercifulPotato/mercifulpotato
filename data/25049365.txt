It is very business&#x2F;corporate focused. Everything is all about Kubernetes&#x2F;cloud. I apply for conferences&#x2F;meetups non-stop, but never have any luck. It is always the same company reps. I am envious of the Rust community here, but maybe grass is always greener on the other side?<p>As someone who&#x27;s been writing Go full-time for over eight years, and has also done some Rust as well, I&#x27;ll say that the business&#x2F;corporate focus that you&#x27;re noticing is a fairly recent development. My impression is that it&#x27;s mostly a function of the size and the market demand for the language - ie, as the language has grown and is being used for more mission-critical stuff, a wider range of businesses have a vested interest in it.<p>Rust is a bit younger than Go. If we&#x27;re judging by the first stable release, it&#x27;s about half the age (5 years vs. 8). It&#x27;s not as far along the adoption curve in many ways <i>yet</i>, although it&#x27;s growing fast. Rust is being used for more things today than it was, say, three years ago, but it&#x27;s still a narrower range (and number) of companies that are interested in Rust. Given Rust&#x27;s trajectory, I think that&#x27;s just a matter of time, so what you see today in Go will probably be more visible in Rust in a year or two. It&#x27;s already drawing a wider range of corporate interest than it was even one year ago, and if it continues to be successful, that&#x27;s inevitable.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing, though. The communities get wider, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the stuff you&#x27;re looking for isn&#x27;t there; you just have to look a little harder for it. That&#x27;s definitely true for Go, and I would bet it will be true for Rust as well.<p>I also think that Rust and Go are not really comparable, and it&#x27;s a shame that they often come up together so often in discussions, because they&#x27;re compared more often than is really warranted IMO. But that&#x27;s a separate matter.')
