It could have been a non-conforming micro-USB charging port.<p>Either way, it would have nothing to do with “the mess that is USB-C” (i.e. the inability to identify <i>which of the various wire protocols that work over USB-C cables</i> that a USB-C port follows&#x2F;supports), because such a port isn’t following <i>any</i> of the USB-C-cable compatible standards.<p>It’d be like saying Nintendo hurt the mini-DVD format when they used non-compatible mini-DVDs in the GameCube. Those discs have nothing to do with the mini-DVD standard; they just happen to share a physical substrate and so a physical appearance. They’re not <i>claiming</i> to be mini-DVDs.<p>And nor does Nintendo <i>claim</i> the Switch’s charging port to be a USB-C port. In all the docs, it specifically says that it’s just a port for the Dock or the Switch AC charger to plug into. It just happens to share a form-factor.<p>Do you remember the days when every connector looked like a DB9 connector with only some of the pins populated? (E.g. the various game-controller ports on the Atari, Commodore, Amiga, etc.) Or later, when every connector looked like a PS&#x2F;2 port, with only some of the pins populated (e.g. Apple Desktop Bus)? None of these were <i>claiming</i> to be the same type of cable or jack or socket. None of them were <i>claiming</i> cross-compatibility. They all just happened to share the same physical connector—because it was a cheap and plentiful, easy-to-source part to build your own proprietary cables and jacks and sockets in terms of.<p>Heck, do you know how many random different types of cables are terminated with TRS or RCA connectors? Would you blame your hairdryer for “destroying the audio ecosystem” because its wall-charger is terminated in an RCA jack, and you could theoretically plug said RCA jack into an iPod (probably frying it in the process)?<p>The outlier in all this isn’t USB-C, but rather the previous USB physical-connector standards. Pretty much nobody used those for anything <i>other than</i> USB devices. Probably because the connectors were 1. <i>expensive</i> as parts, and therefore not really worth using in your own project unless you specifically were trying to be a part of the USB ecosystem; and 2. weren’t designed to be physically capable of meeting the current-draw requirements that proprietary cabling standards would want to place on them.<p>In being both cheap and capable of high current delivery, USB-C connectors are just bringing us back from the temporary reprieve of USB-A&#x2F;B, to the world of the 100 years before that, where a physical connector tells you nothing about what type of cable you’ve got, because every fly-by-night company uses any random connector for whatever they like.<p>You know how USB jacks and sockets had the USB icon on them? That was <i>because</i> the USB Consortium assumed people would do random things with the USB connector standard; and so the icon was meant to distinguish the USB connector <i>as applied to a USB use-case</i>. It never really became relevant in USB-A&#x2F;B, but it’s actually relevant now in USB-C. That icon is what tells; not the shape of the socket.')
