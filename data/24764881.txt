Plus it&#x27;s clocked faster which would account for almost all of the increase in performance from the A13. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a solid new chip - as always - but I see no evidence of a particularly massive revolution this year, in the iPhone or iPad Air.<p>Of course the rumoured 16 core version for MacBook (maybe iPad Pro too?) is a different matter! That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m excited.')
