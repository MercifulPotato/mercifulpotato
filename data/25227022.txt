Hyperlinks, images, and structured text go a long way for things that do matter.<p>I can&#x27;t remember the times I&#x27;ve spent evenings and nights reading a huge website, with dozens if not hundreds of long pages of information, and all laid in this 90&#x27;s hypertext style format that was heavily interlinked so you could jump around and find more and more to read all the time until you fell asleep. Today, Wikipedia comes to mind (and I&#x27;m grateful they&#x27;re still like that), but back then a lot of dedicated resources of information were maintained like that. And with minimal style, with no animated bells and whistles.')
