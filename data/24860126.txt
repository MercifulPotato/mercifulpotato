Anything excess of that amount will be taxed (edit: import duty applied) on entry at around 35% (IIRC). People may avoid declaring items or may bribe customs officials to get away with this, but the numbers put forth by the author are incorrect.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbic.gov.in&#x2F;resources&#x2F;htdocs-cbec&#x2F;guide_for_travellers&#x2F;guide-to-travellers.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbic.gov.in&#x2F;resources&#x2F;htdocs-cbec&#x2F;guide_for_trav...</a>')
