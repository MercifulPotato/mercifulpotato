On that front the score is clear,  the effect of prohibition to peoples lives  is FAR FAR FAR FAR more damaging to the general public than the use of the drug is.<p>Prohibition creates criminal gangs, street violence, increased overdose, increases load on health systems, erodes personal liberty as the government clamps down harder and harder on drug use, rips apart families with life line consequences of criminal charges, and 100&#x27;s of other negative effects on general society far and beyond someone personally wrecking their own life by using drugs.')
