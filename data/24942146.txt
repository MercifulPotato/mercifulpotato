I guess because that&#x27;s what the sensor returns?<p>Though it might be smart to convert  it to another format. Four nibbles of BCD would be ideal and the MCS-48 looks to have native support for it.<p>Thought you would need a custom version of shift by 4 that handles BCD.<p>Or simplify the equation to just adds:<p><pre><code>    C2 = C + C\n    C4 = C2 + C2\n    C8 = C4 + C4\n    C16 = C8 + C8\n    Res = C16 + C2</code></pre>')
