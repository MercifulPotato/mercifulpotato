Item(by='whack', descendants=None, kids=[25567576], score=None, time=1609217386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566683, text='&gt; <i>The problem is that the kinds of jobs they often work in — customer services, food service and other forms of low-skilled labour — are now becoming increasingly susceptible to automation. This lays the foundations for a potential ‘cycle of immiseration’: machines increasingly substitute for young unskilled labour, which limits the ability of young people to invest in their own skill acquisition (education) and physical capital (housing etc.). This means they face a double disadvantage: increased susceptibility to automation and decreased capacity to upskill and uplift themselves.</i><p>&gt; <i>This needs to be stopped. The economic progress of the past 200 years has brought many unquestioned benefits. But we should question whether compelling humans to work is essential to the continuation of that progress.</i><p>The article doesn&#x27;t say it clearly, but it seems to be recommending a Universal Basic Income, on a large scale. Or at least enough to allow for students to continue studying without having to work.<p>A common response I&#x27;ve heard about the above proposal, is some variant of work-valorization. <i>&quot;People these days are just lazy and expect a handout. People should have to earn their keep. Working a job builds character, and is essential to a meaningful life.&quot;</i> Presumably the author is responding to such statements.')
