Apparently qualcom doesn’t have that, so x86 on Arm Windows is slow, being littered with memory barriers.<p>Couldn’t one just use userthreads in an emulator and ignore all these memory issues? Sure that would mean every emulated process is running on one core, but as long as blocking io is implemented properly, how bad can that be? (It would be like having a single core for the emulated process)')
