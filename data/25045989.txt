By marketplace, what people mean here is that Amazon is taking zero risk on the inventory.  They are merely providing a place to list it.  (Along with maybe some other <i>paid</i> services such as fulfillment and inventory management.)  Retailers sometimes operate under this model.<p>But retails also sometimes operate under the model where the inventory on their shelves was purchased by them from the manufacturer or distributor.  They are taking the risk on the inventory, and not selling means they are losing money.  The manufacturers and distributors were already paid.<p>So, I reflect a question back to you:  If it&#x27;s all your owned inventory, what does it matter what name is on the box?  No matter what, you the retailer are getting your sale and making the profit.  This is not true of the marketplace model.  There, whitelabels are directly competing for every sale, and no sales means no money to the manufacturers of those other products.<p>All this is also heavily discounting the fact that Amazon also owns the search.  Some people equate this to product placement on shelves, but it&#x27;s really more like there&#x27;s two stores.  The first store is all Amazon stuff, and you have to walk through that store to get to the second store, where other sellers are.')
