After all, Rob Pike authored both golang and utf-8.<p>That&#x27;s a terrible reason. HTTP header values are not necessarily UTF-8, and an implementation that blindly assumes they are is broken.<p>&gt; Now, what are the security implications of this? (beside the chunk thingy)<p>Many variations of the &quot;chunk thingy&quot; where values considered safe in one context may be unsafe in another context.<p>Like so many parts of Golang, this is a good example of how &quot;good enough&quot; engineering often really isn&#x27;t good enough.
