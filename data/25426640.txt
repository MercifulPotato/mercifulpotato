This is a prod, a reminder, it reminds people &quot;Do the thing we trained you to do&quot; but it&#x27;s a mistake to rely on it without the accompanying policy about what they ought to do.<p>These types of hook are brittle. If you already knew you were supposed to do it the way I wrote, you get a hook failure, you say &quot;D&#x27;oh&quot; and you do it properly. But if you aren&#x27;t trained to do anything in particular, this type of hook is a behavioural branch. Maybe it&#x27;s 0845, your mentor just arrived, the perfect time to ask what the diagnostic means. &quot;You need to use a dedicated key store, let me show you&quot; she says and you just learned an important thing.<p>But maybe it&#x27;s 1845, you&#x27;re the last one in the office. You promised to raise a PR for tomorrow, but the hook fails. You try some things, and eventually discover that it hides well enough if split into four strings. You commit, click to raise the PR and go home.<p>And the person who reads that PR will see immediately tomorrow it&#x27;s unacceptable because it has an obfuscated API key, but alas if it&#x27;s a real working key that&#x27;s too late.')
