They must have all got together and talked. Because on my YT subscriptions list I counted no less than eight photography vloggers who somehow, coincidentally, managed to get the EXACT same configuration:<p>The 24 core, 384GB, 4TB, Vega Pro II Duo, with a Pro Display XDR, nano coated.<p>Now, not only is this an overkill for ANY photography editing, even 100mp medium format, it&#x27;s also a $25,000 (33 when you count the display).<p>I&#x27;m willing to guarantee that these were all Apple loaner units and that at some point they bought their own with the specs they really wanted, and &quot;subbed it in&quot; to their setup, later.')
