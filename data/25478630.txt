I have noticed 6 stages:<p>1) Fear that something is wrong with their memory and incredible efforts to hide it (this is usually before they live in a nursing home).<p>2) Anger, shame and desperation.<p>3) Internalization, they then either make melancholy jokes (&quot;My head&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s used to be&quot;), or they completely give themselves up. Often they refuse to eat. We did not have such a case, but I assume that some patients in this stage commit suicide.<p>4) Total confusion (that happens when the internalization is also forgotten), patients still have enough memory capacity to realize that something is terribly wrong (they usually try to return &quot;home&quot; or are searching for their children&#x2F;spouses&#x2F;parents), but they don&#x27;t understand that they are ill anymore. The nursing home where I worked had codes on every door, but in this stage some patients were still able to trick the staff and wander off.<p>In stage 5), many patients fell into a child-like trance where they just consumed food and watched the world in complete wonder. I never had the feeling that they were  unhappy, in fact they often laughed (e.g. when they saw children, when we played songs or when you just sat with them for a while). We had one old lady who happily recited poems she had learned in elementary school all day.<p>I never want to end in stage 6, but I am quite certain that the patients in that state had no mental capacity left to experience it.')
