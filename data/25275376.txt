Broken NPM installs, cryptic error messages (ok get this one on Python too tbf), lingering version lock files, global vs local package issues, broken nodejs installs, node_modules being committed, node_modules being un-deletable, etc. Anecdotally, I&#x27;d say my experience on Python packaging and management has been worlds-better than for other languages.<p>Python has it&#x27;s issues sure, but from my point of view, packaging is not a big one in comparison to other langs.')
