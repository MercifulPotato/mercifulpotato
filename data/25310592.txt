While Alpine itself has no concept of components, you can define a template fragment that consists solely of the “component” for basically the same effect. Because the x-data directive is freshly evaluated each time it appears, you can include a fragment multiple times and get isolated “instances”.<p>YMMV though, I eventually found that because templating is much more simplistic than a real tree of components as you would get with Vue or React, things started getting hard to follow, especially when my “components” were nested, or involved approximating slots.<p>Ultimately I converted to Inertia.js, which is a very small glue library that lets me write the whole front end in Vue (or React, or Svelte) while keeping a more traditional Laravel (or Rails) backend.')
