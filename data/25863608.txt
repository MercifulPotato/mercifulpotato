They are comparing a RF approach and a NN approach - there isn&#x27;t much detail in the paper but it&#x27;s  most likely the analysis is problematic.  I suspect this was done because the group is a collection of hardware and clinical folks, not statisticians, and the paper would have benefited by review by a biostats person.<p>You are quite right generally that for some models and some effects, a relatively small verification set can be effective.')
