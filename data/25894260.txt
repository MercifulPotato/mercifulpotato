I wasn&#x27;t specifically talking about the linked article either, I have seen a lot of articles in recent years in the UK taking an anti-suburban line.<p>What I&#x27;m drawing attention to is that the bien pensant class in the UK seem to have started to tell us it&#x27;s wrong to want the life that people have aspired to before. And that this is something we saw some decades before with brutalism, pushing people into spaces that designers and architects wanted them, not places they wanted to be themselves. There seems to be a desire amongst some architects and planners to push people towards their ideals of higher density housing, in particular, trading out much in the way of private space to much more social living.<p>Not everyone wants that. It&#x27;s not wrong to want to live in smaller urban spaces with that trade-off, but it&#x27;s not wrong not to buy into it either.')
