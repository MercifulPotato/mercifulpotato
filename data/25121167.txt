You don&#x27;t need to know how a class structures its properties and directly coupling to a representation can burden future maintenance. This very rarely comes up, but when it does it is nice to change a getter instead of tracking down all the locations where it was directly coupled to the representation. It isn&#x27;t at all obvious when you are writing a class whether future maintenance will need to change the representation or not.<p>This isn&#x27;t as much a big deal in python, for example, where you can @property your getter and setter. In that way you can easily migrate existing code from direct data structure coupling to indirect&#x2F;computed access.')
