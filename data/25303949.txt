Item(by='colechristensen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607098391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303672, text='Well you get more out of books when you do something to interact with them more than a linear stream of text.  These sort of &quot;self-improvement-hack&quot; BS systems are good for the kind of people they appeal to, but you don&#x27;t need a form to fill out or some regiment. Likewise not every piece of text deserves the same attention.  Some things don&#x27;t need to be read at all, some things skimmed, some read through once, some with a bit of reflection, some with extreme studying over years.<p>Just the exercise of doing something regarding the text.  Keeping notes in the margin, discussing it with someone, writing a review of the material in long form or in bullet points, keeping track of questions you have, etc.  all enhances what you get out of a book.  You might resent it as a chore, so you just figure out what works best for you, maybe it&#x27;s nothing, but trying something different from time to time can&#x27;t hurt.<p>My advice is to keep a pencil at hand when you&#x27;re reading to take a note, underline a passage, or if you don&#x27;t like writing in the margins, a notebook to the side to highlight things you think are important, things you think are questionable, questions it raises in you, etc.<p>After that, share it.  When you read a section, explain it to your partner, your cat, an internet stranger, to yourself in your notebook, etc.')
