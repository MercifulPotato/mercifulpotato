Let&#x27;s do a Fermi &quot;how many piano tuners&quot; and say subtracting the small private jets and Airbus, there are 5 million flights on Boeing hardware, in the USA alone. Let&#x27;s say maybe 20 million worldwide (probably way too low a number). There were 20 million successful flights with Boeing hardware per year, year after year. 1 of them crashes, and you say &quot;Never flying a Boeing again?&quot;.<p>Anyway, why should I take some random Internet outburst seriously. How about I make a $1000 bet that you&#x27;ll find yourself on a Boeing flight between now and Jan 1, 2026? Would you be willing to do that?')
