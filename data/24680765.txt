It might have been that in his sub-field, that seemed to be the main way to make impact.<p>I think the point is, if you want to be successful in academia, you need to be producing <i>something</i> theoretical or practical that others can consume and find useful.   The medium need not be papers.  It could be:<p>-- standards<p>-- methodologies<p>-- prototypes<p>-- libraries of code, manuals of protocols<p>even more practical things:<p>-- convening people on a topic with authority<p>-- writing popular works to publicize the field<p>-- building a scientific facility<p>-- even TV shows or blog posts<p>You will find professors at universities who do a whole variety of these kinds of things, not just publish research papers.  \n (and as they get more senior, they often find more interesting outlets for their work, if they&#x27;re innovative)<p>But you have to make <i>something</i> that others (in the scientific or industrial or popular community) can consume.  All the paper counts in the world will not help, or make you satisfied, if they&#x27;re just churned out for the goal of increasing your H-index but don&#x27;t actually contain something wanted by others.  It usually doesn&#x27;t work as an approach.<p>If you can&#x27;t do any of these, then you are probably better off taking a normal job.  The incentives of academia will not align with your talents.<p>Personally, for example, I found that the things I was good at publishing or sharing with others wasn&#x27;t groundbreaking novel research.  So I went where that was valued, and have been happier since.')
