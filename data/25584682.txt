If you&#x27;re going to do that, you might as well go full-bore and just adopt a calendar that counts days, 8-day weeks, and years and forgo months entirely.<p>If you&#x27;re going to keep months, but have an 8-day week, I&#x27;d rather see something like: 9 months of 5 weeks each (40 days) with an extra 4 days at the end or beginning of the year. Leap days could be appended to the extra week. This has the added benefit that the 8th is always Blernsday in any month.<p>In any case, I think there are advantages to only working 4-days in a row; and 4&#x2F;3 is a better ratio for workers than 5&#x2F;3; and I think you&#x27;re just moving the goal posts, really. People 50 years from now would be arguing about going to a 4&#x2F;4 week...')
