Sometimes they&#x27;re just cosmetic changes or improvements to the head unit&#x27;s user interface. Sometimes they&#x27;re bug fixes for convenience features that are not a risk to the operation of the vehicle. Sometimes they&#x27;re compliance related (ex. Volvo updated my headunit so that the 360 surround camera view couldn&#x27;t be the default view when shifting into reverse (a US law requires that the backup camera is seen when shifting into reverse).')
