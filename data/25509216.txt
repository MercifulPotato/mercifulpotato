It&#x27;s focused on churning out data driven applications quickly. Add something like Bootsfaces or Primefaces and you can produce these things in very little time. Thats not to say you couldn&#x27;t use JSF to make a &quot;Web Scale&quot; project, but you would have to dive into your server pretty far to carefully watch state management and session creation. Not impossible, but just probably not its primary purpose.<p>For external facing applications that need to withstand a &quot;web scale&quot; load, Eclipse Krazo (aka MVC spec 1.2) and JSP are what you&#x27;re looking for. These things are lightning fast and give you a lot of control over session creation by default. Render times are usually under a few ms. This is probably the fastest and least resource intensive stack available (no benchmark provided, take it for what you paid for the comment).')
