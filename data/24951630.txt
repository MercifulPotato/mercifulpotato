It&#x27;s not a magic bullet, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons TLA+ was invented, it helps with complexity on the specification side. However a method like the one Dijkstra shows in the referenced paper can be used to faithfully implement the TLA+ checked specification.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~crary&#x2F;819-f09&#x2F;Dijkstra75.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~crary&#x2F;819-f09&#x2F;Dijkstra75.pdf</a>')
