Because, again, they are your customers and that was the deal they signed on to.<p>My understanding is this is exactly what they&#x27;re doing. Another poster in these comments reached out to YouTube support who confirmed ads will not be placed on partnered videos who have declined to show ads. The policy is effective for non-partnered videos.<p>Admittedly this is second hand information.')
