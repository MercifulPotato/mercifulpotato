Also reasonable is a basic &quot;cooling off&quot; period of &quot;we&#x27;re not letting you post anymore for a bit, until people calm down&quot;.<p>And I fully agree that there is a long job of getting people to talk to each other, much less be on the same page ahead of us.  I hope we succeed at it.  Facebook and the like are not going to be helping much with it, unfortunately, because outrage is just so monetizable..')
