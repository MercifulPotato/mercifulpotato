It&#x27;s often cheaper, faster, and more environmentally friendly to pay industrial customers to cut their demand by x MW than to fire up x MW of ancillary generation. And as far as grid frequency&#x2F;balance is concerned, has exactly the same effect.<p>Often such customers will have flexible demand in the form of non-critical heating or cooling, pumps that only need to run some of the time, etc, which they are very happy to turn off temporarily in return for extra income.<p>This is indeed an automatic process, triggered in near-real time in response to signals from the grid.')
