Since there is no understanding, they can&#x27;t learn in the same way humans or other living creatures do (in general terms, by extrapolation).<p>The ironic thing is that ML became popular because we didn&#x27;t have the technology back then to properly model actual neuronal activity. Now we do, but ML is so established that modeling &quot;true&quot; intelligence is no longer de jure.')
