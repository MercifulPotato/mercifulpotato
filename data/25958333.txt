Tying the activity to the riots and suggesting similar organization is also beyond the pale. You have cited neither of those positions throughout your ranting here and they’re harmful speculation.<p>Your commentary in this thread is over the top. I’d use a term you already have (edit: and deleted, looks like) which definitely applies, but I’m not stooping there, and you’re probably on your way to a flag for it anyway. I suggest you step back from HN for a few minutes, at least.')
