The example given (Youtube censoring perspectives that contradict the WHO, despite the WHO itself having disseminated falsehoods) leads directly to the questions: should Youtube <i>not</i> have been allowed to make that decision? And if not, how should they have been prevented?<p>As to the third point - revisiting the example just discussed, surely the WHO&#x27;s communications (of which Thompson seems critical) could be seen as an example of an organization hewing to the very default he asserts as valuable?  Move fast with your communications, value early release over perfect certainty, etc.')
