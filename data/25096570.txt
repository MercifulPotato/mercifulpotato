Item(by='rcoveson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605395570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096047, text='Your statement has a nice ring to it only because it takes advantage of the very confusing English word &quot;free&quot;. In the &quot;free speech&quot; context, it&#x27;s free as in liberty. In the &quot;universal, free education&quot; context, it&#x27;s free as in beer; the implication being government funded and managed (and mandatory, implied by &quot;universal&quot;). So while your statement seems to be all about freedom, it&#x27;s really about predicating one freedom on the restriction of another.<p>Here&#x27;s how I would rephrase your statement:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a mistake for the government to let people speak freely before they have been educated by the government.&quot;<p>Which I think is significantly less compelling.')
