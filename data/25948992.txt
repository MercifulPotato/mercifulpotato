That previously quoted answer was in response to me asking &quot;Does a broker have a legal obligation to allow you to purchase any stock?&quot;  Someone answered that with a broad response without referring to any laws. I&#x27;m not sure how that leaves me with a responsibility to do a full legal breakdown of the issue.')
