Google killed the service because no one really uses it<p>that&#x27;s why they proposed to (and i did) move my 35k songs to ytmusic?<p>in any case, this all downgraded my experience so significantly (due to no background playing, shitty interface etc) that i even considered starting paying for it. maybe that was actually their point.<p>but thanks, google, not today - since i work from home due to covid anyway, i have no need for it anymore')
