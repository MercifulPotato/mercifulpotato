I have a Wanhao Duplicator i3, but it&#x27;s a few years old now. The good thing about 3D printers is that they&#x27;re so simple they just won&#x27;t get obsolete, since they&#x27;re 99% software.<p>I think the current recommendation is either an Ender 3 (for a budget one) or an Ender 5 Pro (if you can afford something a bit better). I would recommend the 5, it looks much sturdier. You might want to eventually add a BLTouch so it automatically levels, and you definitely definitely want to get the &quot;silent&quot; package (it really is entirely silent), the normal one makes way too much noise.')
