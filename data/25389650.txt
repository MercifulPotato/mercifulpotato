The cost is high compared to burning fossil fuels, but we could do it as a society (have an excess of solar to meet household winter electrical needs and synthesize methane in the summer to use as household heat fuel in the winter).<p>Just pulling numbers out of the darkness, the upfront cost here in a cold region would be ~¼ to ½ the cost of a house.
