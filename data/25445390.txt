Arrest information is already logged somewhere, and even if it was logged in an immutable public ledger that doesn&#x27;t mean that people wouldn&#x27;t immediately distrust arrests depending on the circumstances regardless of a blockchain being involved. It really seems like this post is just another example of vaunting the all-powerful all-knowing blockchain without it being clear and specific as to what the blockchain actually DOES for us in this situation.')
