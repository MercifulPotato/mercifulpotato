Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=[24749691], score=None, time=1602449831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747668, text='Good, we have a consensus then; now as for your original cherry picking comment, let&#x27;s look at something more substantive[1]:<p>&quot;In Germany, for example, police recruits are required to spend two and a half to four years in basic training to become an officer, with the option to pursue the equivalent of a bachelor’s or master’s degree in policing. Basic training in the U.S., by comparison, can take as little as 21 weeks (or 33.5 weeks, with field training). The less time recruits have to train, the less time is afforded for guidance on crisis intervention or de-escalation.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t a single cherry picked event; it is the minimum required standard. I think that perhaps our police are just poorly trained thugs compared to the Germans; the British police force has a more comparable training to ours (36 weeks I believe), but they ARE NOT ARMED. In order to carry a firearm, they need higher rank, more years of experience, and additional training in order to carry a firearm.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;america-police-violence-germany-georgia-britain&#x2F;612820&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;am...</a>')
