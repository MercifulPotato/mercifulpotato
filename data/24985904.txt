Item(by='Valkhyr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604453375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24984770, text='It all depends on your personal definitions of &#x27;shiny&#x27; and &#x27;work&#x27; I suppose. Current GNU&#x2F;Linux phones unfortunately don’t even clear the ‘work’ threshold for me, and are far from it.<p>If current GNU&#x2F;Linux phones work for your needs, that’s great - but sorry to say that you are not representative of all users (neither am I - that&#x27;s the point, kind of - Android&#x2F;iOS are mature enough to cover <i>most</i> users&#x27; needs). I don’t want to go into too much detail of my specific needs, but let’s just say the deficiencies boil down to (a) vastly inferior power management&#x2F;battery life, (b) vastly inferior processing power in the current crop of hardware and (c) specific apps&#x2F;services not being available on the platform (and likely impossible to run via Anbox because of (b)).<p>I would actually love to jump to a GNU&#x2F;Linux phone. Less so because of freedom or privacy concerns (they are a factor, but not the dominating factor). More because I prefer the traditional desktop&#x2F;general-purpose-computing OS way of doing things (file-centric vs app-centric, root access to the entire file system, development directly on the device). I would honestly be fairly happy with Android if it was pre-rooted, imposed fewer restrictions on what apps can do, and was based on a mainline kernel ideally.<p>I have previously used Ubuntu Touch for about a year on a secondary device, I have a Librem 5 on pre-order, and I follow development for the Pinephone somewhat closely and am tempted to get one. But for the foreseeable future I can&#x27;t see a GNU&#x2F;Linux smartphone replacing my Android - I&#x27;d see it as a complement to it (a tiny portable laptop).')
