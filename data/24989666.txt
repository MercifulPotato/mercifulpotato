If you&#x27;re doing integration tests for a bunch of microsevices, you might have some 20 upstream images that you need to pull. Those can stay in your cache until they are updated (which is rare and predictable, because you&#x27;re pinning versions, right?). You do your building and testing and all that entirely on your &quot;own&quot; infrastructure and then you push once test succeds.')
