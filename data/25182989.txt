They were intended for generating on-off-keying of carrier modulated wave forms to blink an IR LED for a remote control.<p>If you leave off the carrier modulation you end up just specifying a list of on and off times and get absolutely rock solid waveforms in hardware.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of them, I forget, maybe 8? So you can drive a bunch of chains at once.<p>You can also use these for rock solid reading of input signals too. Say you have a weather station that sends some god awful protocol up a wire at youâ€¦ you just collect a list of the high and low times and get notified when it stops wiggling the signal. Then you sort out the data from the transmission. The timing might be way off because it&#x27;s cold and the sender&#x27;s electronics are really cheap, but you can analyze the signal and see what they meant.')
