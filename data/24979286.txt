Item(by='bellweather49', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604409079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973405, text='I&#x27;ve been considering getting my own domain for email for some time -- the benefits are obvious. But I have one concern. If I use the address `mail@my-real-name.com`, does this pose a privacy threat? If someone wants to try and track my activities online, they can take that address, which is clearly tied to me (especially if, say, I use that domain for a blog too), and then go to ashleymadison.com (does that still exist?) and try a password reset for that address; many sites poduce differing responses to password reset requests depending on whether or not you have an account there. If the response is &quot;We&#x27;ve sent a password reset link to that address&quot;, rather than &quot;There is no account with that address&quot;, then people now know I&#x27;m a philanderer.<p>I&#x27;ve even heard of people writing a bot to do this across hundreds of sites; it&#x27;s very interesting to see which C-level executives have been using their work accounts to access sites they shouldn&#x27;t have.<p>The obvious advantage of having a GMail or Outlook address is that only Google or Outlook have to know who you really are; the address could be anything you want and doesn&#x27;t have to be related to your real name. In addition, you can do as I do and have multiple addresses -- not the &quot;throwaways&quot; which people often speak of, but simply different addresses for different online activities -- so that if an account ever got compromised, there would be no way to link it to any other account.<p>Email security and privacy is a hard problem to solve.')
