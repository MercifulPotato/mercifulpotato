But we never had a democratic system the CIA is breaking.<p>True<p>&gt; The video is presented in a way that if you don&#x27;t know all of that you will assume the CIA is making the world bad.<p>Maybe true, but this is an unintended consequence. In no point does the uploader make such a claim or presents evidence to make you think of that. It&#x27;s only by absence of mentions one can derrive to this false conclusion (that cia is the only such player)<p>Final thought, although I get your criticism of the uploader, let&#x27;s say &quot;forgeting&quot; other players as CIA, I would argue they are the biggest and most impactful contemporary agency. Thus, although not the only one, sure the one to be most concerned about. Thus his lack of mentioning other players isn&#x27;t that of a con to me. My argument is based on what we publicly know of these agencies.')
