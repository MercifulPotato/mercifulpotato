Beyond that, there is nothing more the police can do for victims.<p>What about taking criminals out of the community and locking them away in prison? Would that not help? Because that&#x27;s what this surveillance program would do. It allows the police to view footage after the crime occurred and track down the perp. It wouldn&#x27;t help that victim, but it would prevent the next one.<p>&gt;Lo and behold, police departments take a lot of tax money that could be used to help victims in ways beyond deterrence and so that is why we talk about defunding police.<p>False choice. You don&#x27;t need to defund the police to fund whatever program you want. And you make it seem like there is some magic social program just waiting to be funded that would solve criminality but the evil police budget is what prevents it from being implemented. As if!')
