That helps because I&#x27;m at least more likely to get <i>something</i> done if there&#x27;s a list of things I can weigh the terribleness of. As the GP comment said that they&#x27;d clean their apartment rather than get work done, I&#x27;ll do the tasks with more clarity to procrastinate doing the tasks with more ambiguity. Eventually, doing the tasks with clarity help clear up the ambiguity in the others.')
