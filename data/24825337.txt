For years I shaved using a Philips 3-head shaver and had my skin red from irritation. It&#x27;s much better since using wet (soap) shaving with a disposable cartridge razor.<p>I tried DE razors, which didn&#x27;t create irritation but even after years I couldn&#x27;t consistently shave without cuts. I just use Mach 3 cartridges now.')
