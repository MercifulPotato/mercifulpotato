Item(by='Majromax', descendants=None, kids=[25972195], score=None, time=1612033098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970849, text='&gt; Where things get interesting<p>And when a lawyer says &quot;interesting,&quot; they mean &quot;expensive.&quot;<p>&gt; Where things get interesting (and fuzzy) here that Iâ€™m not quite sure where the line is between a group working together to influence the market and just... the market.<p>I think it&#x27;s also noteworthy here that the short interest was at least initially over 100%.  That&#x27;s a powder keg; you don&#x27;t &quot;create&quot; a short squeeze in that environment so much as just wait for any random spark to cause one.<p>If it comes down to the SEC prosecuting individual members of WSB (where they can&#x27;t prove misrepresentation), I think there will also be substantial first amendment arguments at play.  One recent rallying call of the bubble has been to buy and hold GME stock as a protest against hedge funds &#x2F; the stock market as a whole, and on the face of things that&#x27;s political protest.  The SEC isn&#x27;t in the business of investigating other politically motivated stock boycotts, so a politically-motivated stock purchase should also be treated with kid gloves.<p>&gt; That said, there are definitely a handful of individuals on WSB who got the ball rolling and have profited heavily.<p>From what I can tell, RoaringKitty&#x2F;DFV is less likely to be a target of a market manipulation charge because their arguments were made well over a year ago and were ultimately ones of value; the profit did not depend on causing a short squeeze, and DFV in fact took profit from a large portion of their initial stake by the end of 2020 (before the squeeze).<p>The linked post is more direct in &quot;these purchases will <i>cause</i> a short squeeze,&quot; so it could more credibly be called manipulation.  But again, the powder keg makes the analysis weirder.')
