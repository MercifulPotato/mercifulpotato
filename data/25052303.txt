Or only the in-persons?  I know in my area of Texas, the mail-in returns were more Dem than the polls, but the in-persons were much more Rep.  Could it be that one side focused on in-person voting and self selected into in person votes.... perhaps.  Could it be hacking or other fraud, not very likely.  Such accusations need a lot of support of proof, because faith in democracy depends on faith in elections.  I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re seeing enough proof anywhere.  (I would look to any place that has a mandatory recount where ballots are hand counted).  I don&#x27;t think any Texas races were that close though.')
