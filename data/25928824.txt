Those sites just get blocked. This is a definite paywall. If I open it in a private tab, I get no paywall - but yet, find a page seemingly compliant with GDPR, complete with options to opt out of some cookies.<p>Most major websites comply with GDPR, by the way - the more local they are, the more likely it is that I can&#x27;t see them. So if my sister sends me an article from her local news site, I probably can&#x27;t see it. Food Network is the biggest site that doesn&#x27;t <i>exactly</i> work with GDPR: I can&#x27;t see anything from the American site whatsoever, but can see the british one, who of course, doesn&#x27;t show the recipe from the American site.')
