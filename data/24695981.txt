Attempting to date events in the Bible was pretty popular at one time, but it required a lot of special pleading and ignoring discrepancies (it&#x27;s not like the Bible just says in the intro &quot;this covers events from 4000BC to 22AD&quot; or whatever; attempts at doing this mostly involve trying to infer it from ancestry and quasi-historical events mentioned), and isn&#x27;t generally taken seriously by modern theologians.')
