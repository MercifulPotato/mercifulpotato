It might be convenient for the developer or a maintainer to somehow be able to change it without recompiling the whole thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t include security parameters in regular config files that users change. In the 90s this made sense with encryption considered equivalent to ammunition (it still is, but laws have been relaxed) and needing to be changed on the fly, not-so-battle-tested algorithms that you want to quickly switch between, updates coming on CDs, etc. These days, we have security updates coming automatically and we know that some algorithms are pretty much rock solid for the foreseeable future. If one person reads up on it properly and then sets good values, a user (even if that user is a knowledgeable sysadmin) should really not have to tweak it.<p>SHA2 sounds like a good choice, I would just stick with that. Do think about upgrade paths, but assume that you (or a future maintainer) will just provide an update when (if) SHA2 starts to be weakened in similar ways to SHA1.<p>&gt; a number of hosts to one repository<p>Oh that sounds cool, especially with deduplication between them. Restic would be able to do that as well, but they couldn&#x27;t run concurrently at all and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be meant for that sort of thing even if it does store the hostname with each backup (&quot;snapshot&quot;). This would certainly be an interesting feature to a lot of people, I had never even considered using the same repo for multiple systems!<p>&gt; [the sqlite database] should be backed up independently (at the end of the backup script I use sqlite3 commands to do a dump of it once a week [...]<p>Oh, that is a very important gotcha. I would expect that when I made a backup, it contains whatever is needed for it to be restored.<p>Glancing through the results when searching the page for &#x27;database&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be mentioned. Am I overlooking the backup script you mentioned, or is that just your own backup script and not on the page?<p>&gt; Other features unique to Snebu -- you can have the server &quot;pull&quot; backups without installing an agent on the clients (the &quot;tarcrypt&quot; will still need to be on the client if encryption is needed). You can have the clients &quot;push&quot; data to the server using a restricted user account that allows backups but not deletes or restores, and have a separate restore ID for example. You can give different administrators IDs on the the backup server access to different groups of hosts in a look-but-don&#x27;t-touch, etc.<p>Ooh that is really fancy! Especially the second one; how is that enforced, I assume with filesystem permissions? Something like allowing to create files but not change existing ones (chmod +w on the directory and chmod -rwx on the files iirc)?')
