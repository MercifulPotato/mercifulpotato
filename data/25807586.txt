It’s possible for the former to be zero, but lenders are losing money if they set the latter to zero.<p>Basically if you put $1000 of capital into the pot for making flash loans, then you are foregoing the X% &#x2F; year that you could earn on interest, i.e. you are losing money.<p>It’s entirely possible that platforms are running these flash loans as a loss leader to drive adoption, but in a mature market and at scale, you’d expect there to be a small fee.<p>(Or just that the success-case fee covers the loss in the failure case, but that would break if the % of failed txns increased, so might not be a stable equilibrium. )')
