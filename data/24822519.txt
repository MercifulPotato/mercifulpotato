The last few times I listened to NPR they seemed to be pretty deep into the horse race style reporting, distracted &quot;Breaking News!&quot;-style reporting, and lots of speculation. Print media as well.<p>What the other poster suggested is something I also highly recommend - read old news, and see how many of the stories the news media was obsessed with and treated as a huge deal turned out to be nothing in the end. Putting a custom time range in searches is a great way to do this. Often there&#x27;s little to no followup to stories, or new narratives get created that completely rewrite what happened. News junkies get left with a highly skewed version of reality.')
