Its area is too small to have a notable effect - the 8.5x9.2x1mm sensor bump sinks into the wrists skin and raises the watch by a lot less than the nominal 1mm. It probably is measurable, maybe calculate the space of the bump (~80mmÂ³) and virtually redistribute the displacement across the whole 42x35 base plate and assume a calculated\n effective thickness of less than a tenth of a millimeter (80&#x2F;42&#x2F;35=0,054mm)')
