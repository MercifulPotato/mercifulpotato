A place to post your nearly finished or ideally submitted journal or conference manuscript so you can reference it while it is being reviewed.<p>The purpose of Arxiv is in itself a patch for a too common, too long in duration publication process. Now it is often the first place to publish ML research and an obligatory source of literature in ML. No peer-review or any quality assurance makes for dubious work appearing there that can waste a lot of research time.<p>Hosting your elementary course there because that&#x27;s where the researchers are, muddies the quality of work on Arxiv further.')
