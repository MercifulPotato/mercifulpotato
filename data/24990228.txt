More recently, the company even said that users who continue to republish the code risk being banned.<p>Mates, just put the youtube-dl code up on IPFS[1] or SourceHut[2], which is a platform much more sympathetic to and defensive for the open source cause. No need to put it back up on GitHub and risk banishment there. There are lots of options here. The RIAA can&#x27;t sensor <i>open source software</i>. At least, I&#x27;d like to see them try.<p>I wanted also to say that I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with jacking videos off of youtube. But who knows? What if you have the permission of the youtuber? What if the youtuber is just posting stuff that&#x27;s in the public domain anyway? What if you&#x27;re downloading the whole video so that you can get clips of the video you intend to put in your own video in an attempt to criticize the video, thus invoking fair use? The RIAA does not and should not have the power to take down open source software just because it could be used for nefarious purposes. There are also plenty of innocent uses out there.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipfs.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipfs.io&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;</a>')
