Just don’t use the included cable.<p>I’m overflowing with USB-A to lightning cables. Apple bundled USB-A to lightning cables with their wireless trackpad and keyboard even after they dropped USB-A ports on their laptops. And if you don’t have any, they cost like $3 from the supermarket or drug store.<p>I’m going the other way. I think my phone charger is one of the last USB-A chargers in my house, and it’s days are numbered. I love being able to throw my laptop charger in my bag when I travel and charge all my devices with the same brick.')
