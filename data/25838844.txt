But here&#x27;s my thought about the trademarks claims from Elastic. The only info I have is the blog post they shared.<p>Elasticsearch is a name of an open source project. Why is calling something &quot;Amazon Elasticsearch Service&quot; a trademark issue? It&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault they called their company after the name of an open source software (the OSS came first btw). Also, IMHO calling it &quot;Amazon Elasticsearch Service&quot; is fair since it represents exactly what it is. Would it better if they instead took the code, made some closed modifications and then released a service around it with a new name? My thought is no.')
