Regarding the dynamic blocks, it gets weirder. If you have a dynamic block inside of a resource that is using for_each, you can still reference the &#x27;each&#x27; value alongside the value that the &#x27;dynamic&#x27; block is looking at.<p>resource &quot;example_resource&quot; {\n  for_each = example_map<p><pre><code>  dynamic &quot;foo&quot; {\n    for_each = bar\n    content {\n      example_setting = each.value.setting\n      new_baz = foo.baz\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\n}<p>The original for_each is referencing its object as &#x27;each&#x27;, while the for_each inside the dynamic is referencing the iteration as &#x27;foo&#x27;. Why not just name the for_each inside the dynamic block as something else?<p>With that said, I absolutely love Terraform, and it is IMO the most powerful tool I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to work with. I also am a fan of DSLs if they are thoughtfully done. I think with some improvements, like some of the ones the author suggests, HCL could be a great language to work with.')
