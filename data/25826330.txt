The talk&#x27;s main goal was to explore the question <i>&quot;Does cognitive linguistics offer a way forward for second-language teaching?&quot;</i><p>During the Q&amp;A, Turner explicitly mentions GPT-3 (that&#x27;s when I first heard of it) as a &quot;futuristic (but possible) language-learning environment&quot; that is likely to be a great boon for second-language learners.  One of the appealing points seems to be &quot;conversation [with GPT-3] is not scripted; it keeps going on any subject you like&quot;.  Thus allowing you to simulate some bits of the gold standard (immersive language learning in the real world).<p>As an advanced Dutch learner (as my fourth language), I&#x27;m curios of these approaches.  And glad to see this open source model.  (It is beyond ironic that the so-called &quot;Open AI&quot; turned out to have dubious ethics.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=A4Q977p8PfQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=A4Q977p8PfQ</a><p>[2] Check out the <i>excellent</i> book he co-authored, <i>&quot;Clear and simple as the truth&quot;</i>â€”it has valuable insights on improving writing based on some robust research.')
