People have never been entitled to me, they&#x27;ve always been helpful, and I&#x27;ve gotten people co-maintaining projects and submitting lots of PRs to me as well.<p>It was perhaps that optimism that led me to create <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codeshelter.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codeshelter.co&#x2F;</a>, which didn&#x27;t really do very well. Turns out not as many people want to maintain projects as I thought.')
