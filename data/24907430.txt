Maybe you can securely isolate a bus that has the insecure-&gt;secure side reduced to super trivial communication. But I won&#x27;t trust anything that runs multi-layer software stack and a complex communications protocol; from what I&#x27;ve learned about software security, there&#x27;s always a bug or a backdoor that can be exploited to elevate access or just break the secure-side components.<p>(This is, of course, entirely my opinion. I haven&#x27;t seen the code of these systems, but looking from the outside, nothing I&#x27;ve learned makes me feel like I can trust their security.)')
