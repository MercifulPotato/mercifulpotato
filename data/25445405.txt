He used to do astrophysics and there were things he didn&#x27;t like about that. He&#x27;s now doing data science and there are things he doesn&#x27;t like about this, and looking back (with a bit of rose tinted glasses) at his life 7 years ago, he has regrets.<p>Newsflash: the vast majority of jobs out there are not that fun. That&#x27;s why you get paid. If they were a lot of fun, you&#x27;d be the one who pays, just like you pay when you go to a concert. Some jobs are meaningful. Working for Moderna and making a vaccine that&#x27;s going to save millions of lives, that&#x27;s meaningful. Finding a cure for a certain type of cancer, it&#x27;s meaningful. But saying that astrophysics is meaningful because some internet surveys find it to be &quot;the sexiest job in the world&quot;, that&#x27;s quite shallow. 99.9999% of the jobs out there don&#x27;t end up with you saving the world. You just do some stuff, get paid for it, and then go home and live your life with your family and friends.')
