Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=[24671792], score=None, time=1601702451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668661, text='There&#x27;s a difference between circumvention for region-free playback (which is not necessary any more, as this generation of consoles is region free) and format-shifting (which makes sense for audiovisual media, but not games, at least not until emulators catch up, since you need to play games on the original hardware) and circumvention for piracy, or, as it is most commonly euphemized, &quot;backups&quot;.<p>While backing up your games is a legitimate use case, it&#x27;s not terribly useful with cartridge-based consoles like the Switch (cartridges don&#x27;t get scratched), and it&#x27;s much harder to argue for that usage. The reality is that the vast, <i></i>vast<i></i> majority of people claiming they&#x27;re &quot;backing up games&quot; are just pirating games. I&#x27;ve seen this first hand as a major public face in the Wii homebrew community, trying to steer the community away from piracy.<p>Game modding is often brought up as another use case, but straight piracy often requires additional effort over just modding games for technical reasons (you need to bypass game authentication and&#x2F;or redirect all file access, not just the modded bits), so I don&#x27;t buy that argument. Typical piracy tools are very obviously targeted at such, not at modding, and legitimate modding teams who do not support piracy have in the past developed approaches that are a lot less intrusive to doing so (see: Project M).<p>So it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder to argue before a court for mechanisms that allow you to copy games, because legitimate uses are much fewer and far in between, and the tools are all, realistically, aimed at piracy, whether they drape a thin veil over it or not. The courts are not stupid, they can see through thin veils.')
