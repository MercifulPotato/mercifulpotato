At Netflix, we serve a large percentage of the internet&#x27;s traffic using our Open Connect CDN, which runs FreeBSD-current.<p>WRT to the C10K problem mentioned below... We find FreeBSD scales quite well to at least several hundred thousand connections.  Our largest experimental machines can serve nearly 400Gb&#x2F;s of real customer traffic across hundreds of thousands of TCP conns from a single-socket AMD Rome.  This is all with a &quot;traditional&quot; kernel-based workflow, serving media files with sendfile, and doing encryption of HTTPS traffic via kTLS (with NIC-based hardware TLS offload in this case). There is no DPDK  or other userspace networking or storage.')
