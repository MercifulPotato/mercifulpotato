Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25644083], score=None, time=1609841826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643956, text='&gt; taxes are generally spent by government officials<p>By politicians I meant to include government officials; I&#x27;ve edited my comment to reflect that.<p>&gt; Very few low-tax countries are pleasant to live in for the average human being<p>I agree, but I don&#x27;t see the current situation being great either; I think the countries where high taxes are demonstrably increasing quality of life are outliers, and similarly you can increase QOL without a significant (or any?) raise in taxes.<p>My point is that in my opinion taxes break the typical market dynamics (that private companies are subjected to) that incentivise the entity (the company, or in this case the government) to spend their money in the most efficient way possible. Instead, taxes are seen as a near-infinite pool of money you can afford to burn with no ill effects because it&#x27;ll just keep replenishing itself forever.<p>A recent example in the US another scam going around is the &quot;Solar Roadways&quot; which the electronics engineering community has debunked years ago and yet they recently secured <i>yet another</i> grant from the DOT to burn public funds on something that is known to not work (give this fact, the only reason it was chosen is because someone in power wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to show their support for sustainability&#x2F;renewable energy&#x2F;eco-friendliness to gain more political support).')
