Item(by='barnacled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609269720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573012, text='Absolutely it would be very costly, absolutely the expertise might not even exist at scale in an alternative country, absolutely it would take effort and pain and a long time.<p>But apple appear to, in the decades since the iPhone made them richer than many countries, have made zero effort whatsoever to address these issues.<p>Having worked at an apple supplier that they bankrupted in order to make the process entirely in-house (one of many they&#x27;ve done that to) I just do not buy that they could not have taken steps to divest. Some. Any.<p>Of course the issues are true of many other companies, but as I said in my original comment, the fact they portray some woke mentality (under which every single microscopic thing somebody does can be considered &#x27;problematic&#x27;) while continuing to take little to no action in divesting from a literally genocidal state which harvest organs says something about them.<p>The combination of their outrageous markups (which _could_ permit a more costly but more ethical supply chain) due to which they&#x27;d not have to increase prices (and thus making them one of the most able to actually divest like that), their utterly ruthless business practices and their woke and patronising pandering makes them a particularly egregious case, so in my opinion far worse than the likes of amazon, etc. (not discounting bad things they do, just a matter of perspective).')
