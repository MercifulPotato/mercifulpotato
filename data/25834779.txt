You can be guilty of violating the spirit of a law. See for example Wickard v Filburn that forced Filburn to pay a fine for violating limits on wheat.<p>Luckily most of these go the other way.. like in Jacobellis v Ohio where the judge says &quot;I&#x27;ll know it when I see it&quot; to describe his threshold for obscenity... overturning his conviction. [Edit: On the other hand, obscenity is only illegal because it was ruled it&#x27;s not covered by the first amendment (even though the exception isn&#x27;t listed in the first amendment)... allowing the legislature to pass laws restricting it.]<p>The Constitution is filled with more examples: Point to where in the Constitution it says you have a right to privacy, which is the basis for Row v Wade. Or point to where it says &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, a standard set in Winship.')
