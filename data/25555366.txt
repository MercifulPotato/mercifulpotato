Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25555786], score=None, time=1609114147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555163, text='&gt; California isn’t an independent country, so it can’t just adopt arbitrary solutions from other countries.<p>Strawman. No country can adopt arbitrary solutions from other countries - they are always modified to fit.<p>&gt; Even if it could, there is an assumption you are making that you can identify what ‘solutions’ led to particular results and can simply adopt them.<p>Strawman. I am arguing comparisons should be made, not blindly discarded because of &lt;insert meme&gt;. Look at what works in other countries, and see what can help your own. Don’t just blindly discard everything as irrelevant because the country is different (for example, a different size.)<p>&gt; Also ‘California’ isn’t a person. ‘It’ can’t compare itself to anything.<p>Nitpicking.<p>&gt; Do you even have an understanding of the problems? It seems like not everyone would agree on what they are. Otherwise it just seems like your position is essentially just a claim that because there is another country that you think is run better, there are some ideas that you don’t actually understand yourself, that could help.<p>Those are starting to smell like personal attacks. Nobody understands much, but we all have some understanding. Yes, I have specific beliefs about what could help, but I have epsilon interest in beginning that particular conversation with you.<p>Edits as follows:<p>&gt; Edit 2: oh - I see you have changed a whole bunch of things about your earlier comments to make it look as though you made points that I failed to respond to.<p>Ummmmm, nope. I didn’t read your child comment first. I did add an edit against the most obvious attack, I should have marked the edit, sorry. I made the edit within a short time, so I didn’t expect your immediate response. The edit (last para) merely reiterates the theme, it doesn’t add anything of substance.<p>&gt; You are completely intellectually dishonest and as such have nothing to offer to political discourse about corruption.<p>If you get flagged, it wasn’t me.')
