It wasn&#x27;t hard (because I&#x27;m a dev and it was easy to troubleshoot&#x2F;fix), but it was more than 0 effort and a person that wasn&#x27;t a dev might not be able to do it.<p>Prior to that, I had an issue with bluetooth drivers that, IIRC, required finding a custom driver online or some C source file? I don&#x27;t really remember the specifics, but it was another &quot;I am a dev and this isn&#x27;t really difficult but is more than 0 effort and my mom couldn&#x27;t do it.&quot;<p>Prior to that, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop for college and the display drivers were an absolute mess. The screen brightness flickered from 10% to 80% over and over, regardless of what I was pressing or they were set at. I didn&#x27;t find a fix and ultimately reformatted and went back to windows.<p>&gt; I mean linux is the backbone of the internet.<p>Linux containers are great, I use them all the time. Linux as a desktop environment where I use an array of UI applications to develop software, make and observe video files, make games, etc, I have never once had a good experience with. The most recent try, when I encountered the Auto Login issue, I was also totally unable to get Unity to compile&#x2F;run my company&#x27;s game. It was yet another thing that I probably could have fixed, but the value-add vs. the effort of constantly having to manually fix each individual piece of software I intended to use, just didn&#x27;t seem worth it to me. And, what&#x27;s probably worse (to me), is the general response I found online was &quot;Those issues aren&#x27;t that big of a deal&quot;, which totally ignores my entire point. Death by a thousand paper cuts is a problem, even if each individual paper cut isn&#x27;t that bad.<p>Again, I am happy to be told that my experience isn&#x27;t indicative of the landscape of the env, and that I myself just have terrible luck, but if we&#x27;re asking what _I_ think, that is my experience which makes me think it&#x27;s not yet ready for legitimate non-developer use.')
