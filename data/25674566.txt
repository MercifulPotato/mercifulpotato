Microsoft has shown they can culture a good developer ecosystem, Nintendo is awful for third party developers. Nintendo also struggles with new technology, their systems are always a step behind and they were critically late to having games on the app stores (the extreme success of Pokemon Go after a decade of thinking smartphones weren&#x27;t worth it is an egg on the face of the Nintendo leadership).<p>They really just have a strong brand, that&#x27;s about all Nintendo has going for it. Microsoft can steward the brand like they did for Minecraft and it wouldn&#x27;t lose any value, we&#x27;d just get higher quality games and hardware.')
