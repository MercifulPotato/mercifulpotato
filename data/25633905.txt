I do question your conclusion though. I&#x27;ve seen no indications that Facebook has any standards and if anything they seem to promote crap content not bury it. If it drives engagement and doesn&#x27;t bring legal trouble to their doorstep, Facebook seems to be all over it.<p>Which makes me think there is something else going on here.')
