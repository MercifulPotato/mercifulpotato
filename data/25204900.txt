By that logic, we&#x27;ve reduced the statement I&#x27;m replying to into the tautology &quot;cool products with no monetization strategy aren&#x27;t monetized&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t have quite the same ring to it.<p>Edit: I guess if we want to limit it to cool technologies that are directly monetizable, the ford motor company of the early 20th century (or maybe Tesla) is a better example? It&#x27;s just as silly a statement either way.')
