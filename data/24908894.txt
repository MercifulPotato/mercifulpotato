Item(by='fallous', descendants=None, kids=[24910006], score=None, time=1603815529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24908410, text='I&#x27;m not sure that you can assert that language is tightly coupled to reality, unless you&#x27;re using the term &quot;reality&quot; to mean something akin to &quot;as one perceives the world&quot; (regardless of whether that perception is correct or not).<p>Most expressions of language that survived from a few thousand years ago are centered around myths, and while those myths may have contained certain moral or ethical lessons (that were and are subject to interpretation) they certainly weren&#x27;t tightly coupled to reality in an objective sense.<p>Training on expressions of language (I separate the concept of language itself from its expression in the form of writing, speaking, etc) certainly has use cases but can GPT-3 recognize a previously unknown analogy and correlate it with the proper piece of applicable &quot;knowledge&quot; it has?  If not then it really has no understanding.')
