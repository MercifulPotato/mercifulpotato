Big spikes in price that last a couple of months, then back to the trend-line. That line <i>is</i> growing with time, even a bit more than linear - a very slow exponential growth.<p>From the people I speak with in the BTC camp, you seem to have two parties:<p>1) Those that believe crypto will replace fiat, and sincerely believe that there&#x27;s no point in trading crypto for fiat - so they only purchase, and never sell.<p>2) The vast majority: Those that wait for some magic number, and will sell as soon as it&#x27;s been crossed.<p>edit: with that said, I think fundamentally a lot of institutional investors are getting in on the game because of zero interest rates, uncertainty around COVID, and in general trying crypto out for alternative risky  &#x2F; high-yield investments.')
