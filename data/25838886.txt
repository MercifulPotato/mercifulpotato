Also it&#x27;s one of those things where it&#x27;s not officially an option there&#x27;s just no punishment available to prevent it.<p>It does mean something you can say yes or no to &#x27;will you rule based on the law and the evidence presented in the case&#x27; you don&#x27;t have to know the law to agree to do that. It&#x27;s not phrased exactly like that either it&#x27;s a series.
