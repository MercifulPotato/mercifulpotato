This is derived from the fact that WHATWG is the standards body for HTML. (W3C is just a rubber stamp per the agreement between the two last year.)

Microsoft&#x27;s browser is based on Chromium. And Chrome already owns the majority of the market.<p>What Google wants from HTML, Google can get. Even if there is push back from others, they only need to release &quot;beta&quot; versions of their changes for the standard, wait for developers to take advantage of them, and then reintroduce the suggestions. At that point, Apple and the others will have little resource.<p>Google is simply too powerful and a threat to the open Web.')
