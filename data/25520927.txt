Did the Phoronix Test Suite ever find its way into widespread use?<p>Back when I was building kernels for embedded hardware (Sheevaplug) in the 2.6.33 timeframe, I found a USB audio regression between 2.6.33.7 and later versions.  If there were a semi-turnkey way to set up a testbench that could automatically reboot hardware in every new kernel, run through some basic tests, and report any deviation, I probably would have been more likely to do so.  At the time I was working solo trying to release a polished consumer product (sadly though the product was released the business didn&#x27;t work out) and didn&#x27;t have time to dig into and report bugs.')
