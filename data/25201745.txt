In concordance with my point about TS being fundamentally unsuitable, the AssemblyScript docs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.assemblyscript.org&#x2F;basics.html#strictness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.assemblyscript.org&#x2F;basics.html#strictness</a>) say:<p>&gt; WebAssembly is fundamentally different from JavaScript, ultimately enabling entirely new use cases not only on the web. Consequently, AssemblyScript is much more similar to a static compiler than it is to a JavaScript VM. One can think of it as if TypeScript and C had a somewhat special child.<p>&gt; Unlike TypeScript, which targets a JavaScript environment with all of its dynamic features, AssemblyScript targets WebAssembly with all of its static guarantees, hence <i></i>intentionally avoids the dynamicness of JavaScript<i></i> where it cannot be compiled ahead of time <i>efficiently</i>.')
