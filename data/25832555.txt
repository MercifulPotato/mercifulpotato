That way theorems are clearer and the student&#x27;s understanding is deeper, but for applications it&#x27;s better to study from the matrix point of view and with lots of examples. Kuttler&#x27;s book was refreshing in that sense. His other books are excellent, too. If you have been studying pure math (or french-style applied math which is just pure math with a concentration in Analysis) they are a light and fun complementary read.')
