Because of this, he just feels like his goal of getting a degree and then a career is becoming unobtainable. He’s always said he just wants a mentor or something who could appreciate his work and help him along with being a better developer.<p>I guess what I’d like to know is: are there any non-untraditional avenues for getting a degree and getting into the industry?')
