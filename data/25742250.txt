Item(by='jeswin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610425389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733060, text='&gt; Few people care to repair Android phones because you can&#x27;t upgrade the OS after 2 years regardless.<p>This is a mistruth (add: unintentional I&#x27;m sure) - and I hope people stop repeating this. I&#x27;ll explain in detail.<p>1. Older versions of Android aren&#x27;t crippled in the way an older iOS version is. On iOS for instance, Safari is tied to the iOS, while on Android none of the apps are tied to the OS version. Any phone running Android 7 (or maybe even 6) would run the most Google and non-Google services without any problems.<p>2. Most good Android phones such as those from Samsung or Google get 3 years of updates. If you have a Galaxy S8 from Apr 2017, you&#x27;re still receiving updates in 2021.<p>3. Finally you have LineageOS. If you choose the phone correctly, you can potentially have very long term support with the excellent LineageOS. Now this isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, but for most people on HN it&#x27;s fairly trivial to do.')
