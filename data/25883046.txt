I think the discrepancy is mostly explained by cameras being a feature which phone buyers pay a LOT of attention to, whereas it was an afterthought for most laptop users prior to 2020 while thinness was a marketing goal, and don&#x27;t forget that laptop buyers pay the full price up front while a LOT of people pay for their “free” phones monthly.<p>I&#x27;m not in any way excusing the crappy hardware — my iPhone 6S should <i>not</i> be a better webcam than anything built-in or on the normal market now — but I think this is a pretty expected outcome of market forces reflecting buyers&#x27; priorities.')
