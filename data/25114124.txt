No need for hatred and personal attacks..<p>Lets do some real mathematics.<p>1) Get good data (e.g. death by date).<p>2) Take a look at the Logarithm of the growthrate ln(f&#x27;&#x2F;f)<p>3) Spot all those straight lines - those are the curves of outbreaks<p>4) Turn those lines into a working formula for an outbreak<p>5) Calculate predictions - evaluate trend-changes - look when new outbreaks happened.<p>It&#x27;s just that simple. Results won&#x27;t give you insight about the mainstream, but it will give some insights about reality.<p>Some countries are easier (Mexico, Germany, ...).. Some have more outbreaks and complications. But the basic principles of the mathematics of COVID-19 outbreaks around the globe are the same.<p>Calculating the new outbreaks of Sweden is more advanced because the start of the new curve is hidden behind another outbreak. But now there&#x27;s at least enough visible to give good estimates.')
