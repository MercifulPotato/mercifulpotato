Store-bought defog is expensive and doesn&#x27;t really work any better.<p>However, when diving you leave your defog wet (hence the baby shampoo so your eyes don&#x27;t get irritated) after a quick dunk in water to rise off the excess.  A coating that dries will be very different, although I am sure they sell it somewhere!<p>I&#x27;ve heard of people using Rain-X on their masks, but never tried that before.  Maybe it&#x27;ll work on glasses too!')
