Look at youtube channels like 3Blue1Brown - 3 million subscribers, 160 million views, or Numberphile with 3.4 million subscribers and 511 million views. Millions of people of their own free will go out of their way to at least get an introduction to math concepts. Most of this isn&#x27;t practical knowledge that they need, but rather abstract concepts they learn purely for fun. Think of what fraction of the population who would rather do puzzles instead of what they actually are supposed to be doing at the time. Strip away the tedium of rote arithmetic drills and people can&#x27;t get enough of real math.<p>Saying people simply don&#x27;t like math because their eyes glaze over in math class is like saying people don&#x27;t like stories because they&#x27;re bored by Great Expectations.')
