It&#x27;ll just force them to acknowledge that by forcing them to use a convention. As a library writer, I&#x27;m free to change or remove anything that starts with an underscore because, if someone else is depending on it, frankly, they had it coming. I can assume everyone who uses my library is a responsible adult and I can treat them as that.<p>&gt; And why are some classes (int, str, float) allowed to be lower case<p>Because they are part of the language like `else` or `def`. Only Guido can do that. ;-)')
