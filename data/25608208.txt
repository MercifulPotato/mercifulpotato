I liked this one the most, mostly because:<p>- salary and perks are nice\n- people are smart\n- people are understanding<p>I don&#x27;t solve interesting problems, mostly just run of the mill internal tools web app.<p>The only downside is that I can&#x27;t do it remotely (this will be an onsite job, after this pandemic ends, said the management), or from another country. I&#x27;d love to just go to another country (my country of origin, or my wife&#x27;s country of origin) and work there, but with US salary.<p>I&#x27;d love to have financial independence, spending time with my families which live apart from me. Thinking of starting my own, but SaaS software is extremely competitive and risky, and probably won&#x27;t be making money.<p>Btw I see a lot of hostility among the comments. I myself actually appreciate the post, thank you for the author. I do think a lot about ethical concerns when applying to companies, and I&#x27;m happy to have found one that I have no problem with.')
