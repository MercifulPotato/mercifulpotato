I work in a big company so maybe I am biased but 1) every app eventually has to integrate with some other app; 2) every app eventually is used by more than 1 person; in both 1 and 2 desktop pretty much breaks (unless you use version control for 2). In fact we are still dealing with desktop issues as we port this amazing 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s MS era workflow into the cloud and still train users to &quot;save&quot; files.')
