Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609223796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565587, text='<i>So then what should this code produce?</i><p><pre><code>    i = -0\n    return arr[i]\n</code></pre>\nThat code would (assuming an integer value; the question is interesting without reference to the implementation of JavaScript) return arr[0], the first element. Don&#x27;t think of arr[-1] as indexing the array with a negative number that might have been a positive number. Think of array access from the front, arr[ ], and array access from the back, arr[- ], as separate operations with separate syntax, each of which can accept only nonnegative numbers. arr[i] is of the first type, so you get the first element counted from the front.')
