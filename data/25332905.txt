I know NUMA has many significant challenges but so does adding more cpu&#x2F;gpu cores and on package memory to compete with current desktop&#x2F;workstation levels on the ram and gpu sides.<p>Just seems elegant to do 4 M1&#x27;s and get 64gb total memory and 4x gpu&#x2F;cpu and seems hard to scale up a single chip to match current multi chip &#x2F; discrete gpu systems.<p>Maybe even dimms for main memory and current on package memory acting just as a very large level of cache.')
