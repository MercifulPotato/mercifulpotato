Chipmakers and especially high-performance chipmakers have always been focused on high-volume and&#x2F;or high-margin customers, but the Intel acquisition has made Altera worse in that regard. Their sales and support teams were integrated into Intel and now you can&#x27;t get any support from them whatsoever even if you spend $MM&#x2F;yr. You need to funnel even basic questions and bug reports through a distributor contact to have any chance. I forget the specifics but they made tooling even more restrictive&#x2F;expensive. The only new products out of it are a few Xeons with built-in FPGA ($$$$$), good for HFT guys I guess.')
