Tonal language speakers (e.g. Mandarin) have absolute pitch with higher frequency, possibly because their ears have needed to train to distinguish tones in this critical period.<p>As someone with absolute pitch, I should say I have not found it musically useful, and I would hesitate recommending people train for it even if it was possible. When I was learning to play jazz, it was actually a major crutch for me. For jazz especially, the modes, chords, progressions, and relationships between tones are really important and are what determines the &#x27;color&#x27; of what you&#x27;re playing. Harmony in general is determined by the relationships between tones, not the absolute tones themselves (mostly - there are of course differences in sound playing three octaves up or down), and an ear for absolute pitch doesn&#x27;t help much there at all.<p>I could use absolute pitch to identify chords and modes, but it didn&#x27;t help me &#x27;think&#x27; about and play within them the way relative pitch does. A good ear for relative pitch, and an understanding of harmony go much farther.')
