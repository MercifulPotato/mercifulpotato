Any small startup owners would see jail time. Similar case in recent History is Trump non-profit (please no flamewars). There are tens of thousands of business-owners rotting in jail today because they embezzled half a million bucks or more - here with Trump charity you have case of at least $2 million stolen plus self-dealing and basically living your whole life&#x2F;paying personal bills out of charity and what does the judge do? - &quot;Here Mr. Trump is a $99 training seminar on &quot;How not to steal&quot; from your own charity. Go get you and your children watch this online class and report back when you done&quot;.<p>Unbelievable.')
