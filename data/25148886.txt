Multiple disks would offer redundancy but would be more expensive. Since this is a backup service, the outcome of having that drive fail is less severe (ie you can put a new disk in and repopulate the backup) than if that was your primary storage device. For home users this might be an acceptable risk given there isn&#x27;t much else out there in the same cost point ($&#x2F;TB) and which also support ZFS.<p>Businesses and enterprise users would likely prefer an organisation with a proven track record (eg rsync.net) anyway -- even data replication aside.')
