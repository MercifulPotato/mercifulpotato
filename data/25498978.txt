I don&#x27;t tend to buy new camera bodies though; my most recent purchase was a 1Ds MKIII from ~10 years ago, as I want the build quality&#x2F;weather-resistance you get from those pro models. I&#x27;m really excited to see what a pro mirrorless camera might look like in a few years (Canon only just released the 1Dx MkIII so it&#x27;s not arriving just yet).<p>The switch is quite obvious from the Canon release schedule - I don&#x27;t think they have a single non-RF (mirrorless mount) lens being released this year.')
