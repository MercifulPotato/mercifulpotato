Item(by='djaychela', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604423488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979685, text='I originally bought it to use with a loop pedal, so I could play bass, then chords, then solo on top. I&#x27;ve done a tiny bit of that and it&#x27;s been useful, but I&#x27;ve not really explored it enough to be fully confident all over the neck.<p>I&#x27;ve played a few gigs with it where I&#x27;ve been swapping between bass and guitar and for that it&#x27;s been great - tbh the first time I did it I was just doing it to wind up the guitarist I was playing with as he was rather conservative  about gear selection, and this was the embodiment of everything he despised!<p>I bought a stick years ago, but could never get to grips with it (I did a year on it, but was still very basic), and I guess the 9 string filled the gap for that sort of thing, without being unplayable for me... Plus I got it for a steal on gumtree here in the UK as the seller had got so annoyed with no shows he sold it dirt cheap.')
