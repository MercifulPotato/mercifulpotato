Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=[25962068], score=None, time=1611951064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960666, text='I get the high-level picture, I&#x27;m somewhat unclear about the details, and I&#x27;m not sure iff this even applies to Robin Hood, because they didn&#x27;t confirm any of this. That&#x27;s all irrelevant, though.<p>The top-level question here was, why people are angry at Robin Hood. My explanation is simple: they cut a lot of people off buying at the moment they wanted to buy, and provided no explanation. Any theory as to why they did that comes from taking explanations of other traders and the mechanics, not from anything RH said.<p>If you think what they published was sufficient explanation (and remember, the target audience is mostly regular folks with even less clue about stock market than I have), then why did RH&#x27;s CEO get drilled by the news on the same questions I&#x27;m listing? Apparently the newscasters and their audiences also don&#x27;t believe he answered anything.')
