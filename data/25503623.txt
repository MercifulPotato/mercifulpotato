But there is more to it than that. Most people in elected office aren&#x27;t robots just following the biggest diner checks. A lot of times they believe in what these amendments. The lobbying and whatnot actually works. Because just like you and me, they are susceptible to the environment in which they dwell.<p>A lobbyist can&#x27;t buy a legislator&#x27;s vote but they can buy you a legislator&#x27;s time. That time let&#x27;s you create the information environment that can influence any person. Which is of course why these lobbying relationships become so long and so entangling.<p>Mark my words, the people behind this amendment believe pirates are cheating honest companies out of something.')
