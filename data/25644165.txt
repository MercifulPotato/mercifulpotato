Sounds like an interesting point of view.<p>But would that not also imply that we should be able to measure the quantum world with quantum devices? Say we have a quantum property that is extremely close to p=0.5. If we could invent a device to replicate that property perfectly and measure it repetitively we could then estimate ever more accurate boundaries for the &quot;true&quot; value of p, no?')
