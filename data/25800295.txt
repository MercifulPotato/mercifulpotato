There&#x27;s even apocryphal story that when 1-click purchase was implemented, developer actually couldn&#x27;t resist of adding &quot;are you sure&quot; message box, because just click and buy is so against typical patterns.<p>I can give another example - socket wrench. Ratcheting wrench was patented on 1863. It took 110 years to invent quick change socket for it, although if you look at it you will say - well, everybody could create that invention.')
