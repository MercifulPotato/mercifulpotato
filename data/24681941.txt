Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601842497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681809, text='&gt; Why would anything different happen to a &quot;resold&quot; than a &quot;sold&quot; device?<p>Did you miss the other possible scenarios I offered, or are you certain they cannot happen? (If so, then why?) Did you not understand the point that recycling 100% of the devices <i>might</i> outweigh some reuse plus some portion ending up as landfill? Do you believe that devices ending up in landfill is worse than devices being recycled?<p>Why are you assuming the same thing would happen to a device on resale, compared to first sale? Do you know who GEEP was selling them to, and what for? I would guess that statistically the second life is much shorter, especially for devices that Apple decided couldn&#x27;t be resold by their refurb program. I don&#x27;t know that for certain, and I won&#x27;t insist on it because I don&#x27;t like to make wild assumptions, but if you believe otherwise, I&#x27;d love to hear what evidence you&#x27;ve got.<p>&gt; for the sole reason that money changed hands without Apple getting their cut.<p>This speculation doesn&#x27;t stand up to a reality check. Apple already re-uses devices: they sell refurbs! The second life you&#x27;re advocating already happens to all the devices they can, and they already make money doing that <i>and</i> it&#x27;s better for the environment. Why are you assuming that Apple is recycling devices for financial reasons, when it costs them money to recycle, and it would net them more money to resell these devices if they could? Why are you assuming these devices even have a second life in them, when Apple already sells used devices?<p>&gt;  I am beyond tired of dealing with the pretzel-like contortions of reasoning you twist yourself into to believe continued use of a device is somehow more harmful than stripping it for parts<p>This makes it pretty clear that you haven&#x27;t understood my questions. I have not claimed that recycling is better than re-use. In fact I believe re-use is better than recycling, environmentally speaking. So I think we agree on that. What I&#x27;m asking is why you&#x27;re so certain that this specific case is one where Apple is doing the wrong thing environmentally. That&#x27;s not clear to me at all. It seems very possible that recycling here is much more environmentally responsible than re-selling. It really depends on more specifics than we have at hand; it matters what the condition of the devices is, it matters who they&#x27;re being sold to, it matters what they&#x27;ll get used for, how long they&#x27;ll last, and what happens after that. What do you know that I don&#x27;t know? I haven&#x27;t seen anything yet to convince me that your certainty is backed by any evidence.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll take their environmentalism with a massive grain of salt.<p>Could you please identify computer brands that are better, and link to their environmental records? What are the actionable alternatives that are more environmentally friendly?')
