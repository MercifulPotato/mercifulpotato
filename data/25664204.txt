The walled garden here has big open gates.</i><p>Gates are not incompatible with walled gardens. Most walled gardens have those.<p>Plus, I mentioned the walled garden as a good thing. It&#x27;s part of the Apple proposition (even if not alll get it), and part of what it enables it to move at the speed it does (whether in the right or wrong direction).<p>But one can susbstitute &quot;walled garden&quot; with &quot;tight control of the OS, hardware and imposed requirements on most of third party software, and willingness to enforce hard schedules (e.g. regarding removing 32-bit, OpenGL, etc) to all (or tons) of its developers at once.')
