Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.<p>&gt; Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.<p>Twitter&#x2F;reddit-style accusations of &#x27;blind passion for [x]&#x27; doesn&#x27;t come across as substantive discussion. If you want to persuade people of your vision for the EU, begin by not casting aspersions on those who disagree with you, the very thing you complain others do to you.<p>I believe that if you have something worth saying, it&#x27;s beholden upon you to say it the right way, not beholden upon others to tolerate trolling in order to eventually come around to your point of view. It makes for better quality conversation, something the HN community as a whole takes a certain amount of pride in.<p>Instead of martyring yourself by welcoming a shadow ban, state your case, back it up, show data, give examples, post news links from verifiable sources, cite relevant reports. You&#x27;ll convince more people that way. It&#x27;s easy to throw accusations but harder to make people take them seriously â€” this is true of any matter, not just the EU.<p>If your goal is not to convince anybody then feel most free to ignore this olive branch.')
