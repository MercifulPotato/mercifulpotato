However, if you look at the origins of words and phrases in English, it is also full of odd expressions. It is just that you are used to them.<p>Take &quot;welcome.&quot;[1] Well come. You&#x27;ve arrived well. You make a good entrance? Not a ridiculous thing to say when someone arrives.<p>What about in response to &quot;Thank you?&quot; You are welcome.[2] Huh? What does that mean?<p>Or, &quot;you are welcome to take a second cookie.&quot; How does that translate into &quot;I do not mind if you take a second cookie?&quot;<p>[1] Welcome translates quite literally in other European languages. For example, in French, it is <i>bienvenue</i> - <i>bien</i>: well - <i>venu</i>: came.<p>[2] On the other hand, it is much more common to say <i>de rien</i> (in French) or <i>de nada</i> (in Spanish): literally, &quot;it&#x27;s nothing.&quot;')
