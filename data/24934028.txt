The things it&#x27;s bringing in don&#x27;t seem like &quot;types&quot;, they seem like &quot;rich structured data objects, usually imported from the web, that live in cells on sheets so you can refer to in formulas&quot;.<p>I wanted cells to have types -- not just dimensions like meters and volts but arbitrary composeable tags with a tag arithmetic, so that you can make it impossible to (or at least easy to notice when you) add &quot;daily active users&quot; and &quot;monthly active users&quot;.<p>I read a thread here on HN just a couple days ago about people whose job it is to pore through spreadsheets that drive trillions of dollars for companies and find logical errors (like the above nonsensical addition of two numbers that don&#x27;t make sense), and that they save companies hundreds of millions by preventing mistakes in planning etc.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing the point, but compared to real types, who cares about bringing a rich structured data object describing hydrogen into a spreadsheet?')
