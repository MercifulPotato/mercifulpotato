Per your link, nominative determinism is the theory that influence occurs after the name is coined. Palantir was very intentional in picking the name before they even started, because it aligned with what they were trying to produce. Additionally, nominative determinism is typically reserved for human names, not business entities.<p>I&#x27;d argue this is more a case of an aptronym, mentioned in the second paragraph of the wiki entry you referenced. &quot;Nominative determinism differs from the related concept aptronym, and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name (captured by the Latin phrase nomen est omen &#x27;the name is a sign&#x27;), in that it focuses on causality. Aptronym merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.&quot;')
