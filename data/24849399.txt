Most cases resolve spontaneously. Part of it is that my nerve dislocates when I bend my elbow, and this mobility causes a bunch of additional friction &#x2F; inflammation. This happens naturally to about 13% of the population, and mine is particularly pronounced.<p>All this to say, if you ever do start to get a burning or tingling in your elbows or wrists, or get numbness in the hands, it&#x27;ll likely go away on its own, or with conservative treatment (a physical therapist is a great first step!).<p>And, for those who also fall into my unlucky percentile, hopefully it helps to know that there are tools and a community that exist to let you keep working without needing to use your hands at all!')
