I wish the display were more &quot;actual&quot; paper size of course (it&#x27;s 10.3&quot; diagonal (no margins) rather than US Letter&#x27;s more typical 13.8&quot; diagonal (no margins), or even a moleskin&#x27;s 11&quot; diagonal (no margins))<p>That said, sketching&#x2F;writing are just as good as they are on the iPad Pro or Surface Pro. The pen&#x2F;glass &quot;feel&quot; is no worse than those other two solutions either (but no better either). Very low latency, easy page switching. The iPad&#x27;s rapid zoom in &#x2F; zoom out is helpful in sketchpad for drawing details which epaper clearly has challenges with. But In terms of taking notes or writing down things as I&#x27;m coding and need to get back to? It&#x27;s super awesome.<p>I&#x27;ve also put PDFs of data sheets on it which are easy to read (if a bit shrunk). The PDF reader is functional, same with the EPub viewer, would like to have the click the page to turn pages that the kindle and other apps on touch screens do.<p>Syncing with the computer is pretty seamless.<p>I don&#x27;t like that it clears the screen and puts &quot;reMarkable is sleeping&quot; on the screen when I&#x27;ve had it sitting open with a PDF. There may be an option to change that but I haven&#x27;t found it yet.<p>All in all I&#x27;m glad I got it and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much every other day or so.')
