You&#x27;re not going to loan someone a few million, knowing you might lose it all, and having no expected gain.<p>If you don&#x27;t have loans of any kind, you basically don&#x27;t have a market. You can&#x27;t form most kinds of businesses, you can&#x27;t invest in equipment, etc etc. Even in strict communism where the government owns the things that allows businesses to run you need capital to buy materials and perform research before you can sell products.<p>If you can&#x27;t buy and you can&#x27;t sell, you don&#x27;t have any modern conception of a market.<p>[1]: It can also mean to charge exorbitant interest')
