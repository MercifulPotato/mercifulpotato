It&#x27;s going to be at least an order of magnitude more.  (To confirm, did a LinkedIn search for Product Designers at Uber.  521 results.  Pretty close!)<p>I work at tech company you&#x27;ve probably heard of (consumer-focused, international, relatively large scale, though probably a couple orders of magnitude smaller than Uber).  We have ~200 engineers (client, backend, ops&#x2F;infra, data eng, ML, etc).  We have ~15-20 designers.  We&#x27;re international but we do very little feature and&#x2F;or design customization per market, beyond localization, unlike Uber, which does customization even for different cities in the same state, let alone separate countries!')
