In fact, this is the seventh time we&#x27;ve seen Betacoronavirus cross from bats, through another animal, and then into humans. SARS came via palm civets. MERS came via camels. Four more types cause a mild cold only and so they don&#x27;t get sexy names or a deep investigation as to how humans became hosts.<p>So why would Covid-19 even need to come from a lab? We (humans) had wet markets filled with animals, including the very bats that carry the base virus. It&#x27;s the perfect breeding ground to create a pandemic-level virus and probably a few thousand more viruses of lesser impact.<p>&gt; A lab accident — a dropped flask, a needle prick, a mouse bite, an illegibly labeled bottle — is apolitical.<p>Oh, I disagree. If the root cause is Big Government meddling where they ought not to, that tells us one story. If the root cause is unregulated wet markets with viruses crossing species freely, that tells a very different story.<p>Smaller government solves one problem, and more regulations solves the other. There are a lot of people who want each story to be the truth.')
