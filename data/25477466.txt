That way there&#x27;s no reliable control group to compare outcomes, and no one can blame the vaccine, and it&#x27;s easier to blame other external factors or say we don&#x27;t know.<p>This is (systemically) the general approach taken with many environmental toxins. It&#x27;s only when unfortunate, acute &quot;cancer clusters&quot; etc appear that some really nasty chemicals which are prevalent everywhere - like PFAS, etc - come to attention.')
