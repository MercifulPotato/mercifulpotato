Having blanket lockdowns with no timeline for lifting them, while also wrecking the economy because people don&#x27;t want their 80+ grandma to die of covid isn&#x27;t necessarily good for the country, even if it makes people feel better in the short term.<p>To where, <i>specifically</i> are you referring?  I&#x27;m not incredibly well informed about policies outside where I live, but I&#x27;m not aware of any place <i>in the US</i> where <i>every</i> business is closed, everyone is <i>required to stay indoors</i>, all economic activity has ceased and police are using <i>criminal</i> penalties to enforce such behaviors.<p>The above is what you mean by a &quot;blanket&quot; lockdown, yes?<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re talking about.  I live in one of the most densely populated (27,000&#x2F;sq mile) areas in the world (NYC), and we don&#x27;t have (and haven&#x27;t since June) had anything that could plausibly considered a &quot;blanket lockdown.&quot;<p>Actually, even when NYC was experiencing the worst, and a &quot;lockdown&quot; was in place, some businesses were open and people were absolutely <i>not</i> required to stay in their homes.<p>Even so, the restrictions put in place were effective in reducing the <i>exponential</i> spread of COVID and allowed us to relax those restrictions.<p>In fact, except in a few areas with infection rates that are 5-8x surrounding areas, schools and almost all businesses are open (with some restrictions like indoor mask wearing&#x2F;limiting the size of indoor gatherings).<p>There were pretty strong lockdown measures in the Mid March-early June timeframe, but those are long gone.<p>We are able to do this because we do a huge amount of testing and surveillance and have <i>data-driven</i> rules (&gt;3% positive test results for seven consecutive days, for example) for addressing case clusters.<p>Lockdowns (like social distancing, wearing face coverings and improved hygiene) are just one facet of an appropriate response.<p>Large-scale testing, tracing and surveillance are <i>required</i> to ensure that infection clusters don&#x27;t spread into larger populations.<p>No one wants lockdowns, but unless we utilize the <i>other</i> tools available to us, we will likely see R0 growing beyond our ability to control it.<p>And if infection rates skyrocket, lockdowns become the <i>only</i> way to minimize the spread of infection.<p>But making all that happen <i>requires</i> the cooperation of the vast majority of us.  Where there are lockdowns, that&#x27;s evidence of failure to execute on all the other mechanisms we have to combat this virus.')
