Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[25040820], score=None, time=1604960862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039579, text='PS1 can support 256x256 truecolor (or 4bpp&#x2F;8bpp paletted) textures, dithering and gouraud shading! It also has a very weird graphic pipeline that I don&#x27;t think would be very friendly to a novice: the 3D projections are done on the CPU and the depth buffering is handled by... the DMA. The GPU is purely 2D, hence the lack of perspective correction in the texture mapping.')
