My intent to keep things minimal is often criticized, but when you visit a graveyard you don&#x27;t often go looking for the names of successors, the reason they died, or if someone &#x27;Frankensteined&#x27; them into an alternate existence. Graveyards are for everyone, and the story they tell is very subjective to the visitor.<p>CEOs may find a sense of caution about adopting a new, non-core Google product, or they may feel emboldened to make a decision to cut a large product in order to focus on something else. Entrepreneurs may find inspiration for a brand new product, or inspiration to build a similar-but-better product. Academics and journalists may use it to track the history of products. Users? Users will go, scroll down the list, find a product they haven&#x27;t thought about in years, and have fond memories of all the cool stuff they did with it.<p>As far as rebrands and cherry-picked feature migrations? An organ donor whose heart is harvested and placed in another person&#x27;s body doesn&#x27;t keep living.

Why shouldn&#x27;t they have a place to mourn that?<p>Finally, you link to a comment that attempts to provide reason for why things are killed, but that information is really proprietary. Google&#x27;s usual move is a vague excuse like &quot;focusing our resources&quot; which is PR speak for not enough users...or maybe it means we couldn&#x27;t monetize it...or maybe it means that the market didn&#x27;t respond as we expected...or maybe it means...there was some internal politics afloat. --- I feel that speculating--even incorrectly--would be more dishonest than not speculating on the reasoning at all.<p>So, I don&#x27;t feel the site is dishonest. Providing enough context in that &quot;these things before you are dead products&quot; is its entire point, and the user&#x27;s perspective and takeaway is left up to them to discover.')
