It&#x27;s great for when you have a well-specified project that can be coded in a top-down fashion, and correctness is a paramount concern. It enforces correctness through a very strong type system and a pointer model that forbids aliasing by default (pointers must be declared as &#x27;aliased&#x27; to alias them), and the SPARK extensions provide even more guarantees, allowing you to formally specify contracts which the compiler will ensure are fulfilled.')
