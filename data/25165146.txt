I would not mention the startup in any immigration context. I&#x27;m not a lawyer but I worry that your F1 OPT is not a blanket license to work anywhere or for a second entity even if it is related to your field.<p>Word of advice, get an immigration lawyer, particularly if you want to do startup stuff.<p>My gut tells me no shot at an O-1 and unless your are well published or worked on multi-million dollar grants during your masters little shot at an EB-1 visa. Again, your immigration lawyer is the real authority on how best to proceed though.<p>Canada is an option to be sure, I would again recommend a Canadian immigration lawyer but I have been told it is easier than the US system:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;immigration-refugees-citizenship&#x2F;services&#x2F;work-canada&#x2F;permit&#x2F;temporary&#x2F;eligibility.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;immigration-refugees-citizenship&#x2F;se...</a>')
