My reason to argue for a &quot;pure&quot; HTML structure is not just out of some idealist out-of-touch mentality.<p>No, but it&#x27;s based on a use-case that is very specific and considering that it&#x27;s a relative uncommon one, I don&#x27;t see the point of trotting it out. Okay, so in this particular situation maybe something like Tailwind isn&#x27;t ideal. Nobody is arguing that it is.<p>&gt; Honest question: would you pay for funding this? I think this haven&#x27;t come to be is because it&#x27;s much easier to sell a &quot;turn-key&quot; system than something that is flexible enough to get other developers to say &quot;I could&#x27;ve done that as well.&quot;<p>Sure. I mean, I&#x27;m close to paying for Tailwind UI, so paying for good stuff is definitely something I&#x27;m willing to do.<p>But I think what you propose doesn&#x27;t exist not for lack of payment, but because it&#x27;s just not that easy to do. In lieu of perfection, stuff like Tailwind can be a pretty good improvement over other things. No need to whine about it or compare it to some hypothetical ideal that you deem good enough for your edge-case needs.')
