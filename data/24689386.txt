Together with a few other people we decided to &quot;test&quot; some smart assistants and phones+app combinations to see if any of the data they might collect leaks. We came up with some random but easily identifiable keywords that we&#x27;d normally never use in day to day conversation and consistently dropped them in fake conversations. I tested an Echo Dot with &quot;Whirlpool washing machine&quot;. Others tested Google home, or the Android Facebook app.<p>Bottom line is that Amazon and Facebook somehow decided to show exactly the random stuff we fed them. None of the stuff fed to Google, Microsoft, or Apple ever made it out in an obvious enough way for us to notice it.<p>It&#x27;s not something to draw a solid conclusion on, I&#x27;m sure the experiment had plenty of flaws but the degree of suspicion it raised was way above the noise floor and it was enough for me personally.')
