I&#x27;m curious about his mention of server costs in the sponsor request - it looks like he&#x27;s serving downloads of the icon pack from github, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a big bandwidth cost.  It appears that he&#x27;s using vercel serverless; the free tier appears quite generous, and the $20 paid tier should be affordable.  I understand asking for donations, more just curious why it is expensive to run this.<p>Edit: never mind; seems he&#x27;s using firebase storage, which could get pricey.  Maybe it would make sense to serve over github pages or similar to keep costs down.  Or even an el cheapo VPS, which should have more than enough space to store the images and plenty of bandwidth to serve them.  Cache the number of icons and run a cronjob every ten minutes that scans the directory and updates the number.')
