It takes years of practice, but even if you miss half the &quot;hints&quot; given to you, you&#x27;re still doing really well once you get a couple years worth of notes together.<p>Even those &quot;iffy&quot; gifts the first time you hear them turn into huge winners years later because you remembered and happened across it somewhere.<p>Also one other rule I learned from a friend I&#x27;ve lived by now for around 5 years is that whenever I see something I think someone would like - I simply buy it and gift it right then for no reason in particular.<p>Gift-giving holidays used to be a severe anxiety ridden period for me because I never &quot;got&quot; why we had to exchange these silly things and would panic at the last minute, but now that I&#x27;ve started the above practices my loved ones know even if I miss a birthday or Christmas here and there I&#x27;m still thinking of them.  When I reframed it into &quot;I saw this thing I thought you&#x27;d really enjoy&quot; vs. &quot;I went to Target on xmas eve and panic bought something after 2hrs of looking&quot; it got a lot more fun.')
