They&#x27;re definitely not an organisation looking for fairness in the world, I&#x27;ve only ever heard of central banks implement policies for the general benefit or taxation, and then only with great reluctance, usually after their hand got forced.<p>On the other hand they have a huge real estate portfolio (and mortgage portfolio) that I&#x27;m sure is now no longer looking like such a smart investment.
