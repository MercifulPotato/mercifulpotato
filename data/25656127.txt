Understanding what they want to get done and  removing enough friction that they’d rather pay to your product than go to a competitor or do it themselves.<p>Surely docs and meetings are necessary but you have to ask yourself “how does this add value to the customer? Can we have avoided this and still achieved the same outcome?” Ask that week over week.<p>I spent 2 years of my life working insanely hard but at the end, customers didn’t really get value out of it and it was a dud. Then I spent another 6 months deprecating and killing the feature. It was a very hard lesson.')
