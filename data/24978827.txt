I haven&#x27;t touched it in months&#x2F;years tbh.<p>My daily grind is Java. And I&#x27;ve seen enough idiots opening the plastic and licking the glow-in-the-dark knife in Java.\nIt always leads to fun and interesting problems.<p>By fun I mean &quot;Get me out of this hell&quot; and by interesting I mean &quot;I obviously need more drugs to understand this code&quot;.<p>&gt; Ah, so that&#x27;s what happened to the Actix developer. What a welcoming community!<p>No. He realized his mistake and isolated himself.<p>Here is the approximate recollection of events regarding his  work on Actix:<p>-------<p>Have a safe function that does the same thing as your garbled mess of unholy unsafe abomination.<p>Use unsafe.<p>Gotta go fast!<p>-------<p>People submit PR to fix your unsafe hell spawns.<p>Reject!<p>Gotta go fast.<p>-------<p>People call you out on it.<p>Delete all the code.<p>No code = fast.<p>-------<p>In the end, he had a change of heart set new maintainers and restored the project. Then went off to write code to benchmark in C.<p>All&#x27;s well that ends well.')
