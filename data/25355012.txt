Multiply your estimates by 4.  That way you&#x27;re a miracle worker!  Or if you&#x27;re like me, you might finish it on time.<p>I think there&#x27;s some ego stuff going on though in planning sessions, and it seems bad estimates are rarely punished.  And you can&#x27;t really learn from it, since you always think &quot;this time it&#x27;s different.&quot;')
