They will need to gather personal identity information to determine if you are a US citizen which is scary. Will certainly enable AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure to curtail all my free trial accounts I imagine.<p>On the other hand, they do not define US IaaS very well, so I am curious if GCP&#x2F;AWS will be exempt since I think they are technically shell companies registered in Jersey or Isle of Man or offshored on paper.')
