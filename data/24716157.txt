Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=[24716487], score=None, time=1602135143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715533, text='&gt; It sequesters carbon, isn&#x27;t too terrible for the environment (it just sits there in the ground), and it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going to run out of landfill space any time soon[1].<p>I could care less about the space personally, I think that’s a non-issue, but let’s not romanticize plastic as being harmless or somehow good for us. The danger of this argument is that, like recycling, it encourages more plastic use and more plastic waste, rather than committing to doing what we most need, which is to stop using so much of it, especially for single-serving, single-use convenience, where viable alternatives don’t just exist but have been widely used.<p>We can sequester carbon best by not pulling it out of the ground, plastic production and distribution uses a lot, and putting it in the landfill doesn’t exactly make up for it.<p>Plastic production has toxic byproducts, and leeches toxic waste into the ground &amp; water. By “isn’t too terrible for the environment”, what are we comparing to? It’s pretty bad compared to a lot of the actionable alternatives we have.')
