Technically string theory has no free dimensionless parameters (by the formal definition, values which need to be determined experimentally).<p>edit: to expand, the landscape problem is more about finding the right parameters for compactification (folding up the geometry) that produce the universe we all know and love, or at least a realistic one. This makes them similar to free parameters.')
