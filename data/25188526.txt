If your pseudonym gets reported it will definitely get banned.<p>How does FB doing a bad thing currently justify demanding the government to even one-up them and make it legally mandatory to do that bad thing?<p>- I was aware of them doing this, and if that were the subject of the discussion I would have in fact demanded that they&#x27;re legally forced to stop doing it.<p>&gt; Yes that&#x27;s true for literally every transaction on the internet when done with a credit card. Not sure why that&#x27;s a problem.<p>Did you have to use your credit card to write this post?<p>To post on any other forum for the past few decades?<p>Would you be happy to give me your credit card data in real life before I start listening to anything you say there?<p>&gt; Facebook is a company selling a product. You do not and definitely should not have any &quot;rights&quot; on their private platform. Just like you do not and should not have the right to force a local business to trade with you if they do not want to.<p>FB has taken possession of a now essentially public space of which the participation therein is a central component of having a social life. Try finding a party or any other kind of event to attend without FB access.<p>If you take possession of a part of the commons along with that possession comes the duty to provide proper access to the citizens which are reliant upon it.<p>E.g. if you own a piece of land below which there is an aquifer, the government will force you to provide access to the water so the public can drink.<p>There is no reason why this should be any different in cyberspace.')
