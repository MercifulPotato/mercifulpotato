More average learners require more time and resources and the nonspecial sauce will NOT get them a dream job in less than a year which is the opposite of what all of the marketing leads u to beleive for all the bootcamps.<p>Lambda seems to have been trying to branch out to more normal learners.<p>Students that dont share those bright&#x2F;already qualified credentials, do benifit a little bit of a &quot;rub&quot; effect by being associated with those bright&#x2F;qualified students, and get to study&#x2F;work with them during the course of the bootcamp so everyone wins in the short term. For average learners without significant backround IT knowledge or a prestigious degree, realistically they are going to need more than 3-6 months or a year to get a cushy programming job in the US (which seems to be what all of the bootcamps advertise they can offer students).<p>I consider myself an average&#x2F;below average speed learner, took a bootcamp, i was surprised to learn the guy i was pair programming with had a CS degree from MIT lol. Some devs already had work programming experience, but most of us normies benifited by pairing with them and talking to them about problems&#x2F;code&#x2F;computers&#x2F;study habits.')
