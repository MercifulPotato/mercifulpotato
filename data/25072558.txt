Item(by='aggieben', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605203776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069998, text='ASP.NET is pretty bare bones, all by itself.  It&#x27;s pretty much just a simple pipeline of request handlers with DI support (which is also optional).  MVC, routing, Razor - all unnecessary if you don&#x27;t want to use them.<p>I agree that the ASP.NET documentation is lacking in F# code samples (although the example you picked is a bad one as Razor doesn&#x27;t support F#, and so naturally wouldn&#x27;t have F# code samples).  You might find that Giraffe is a more comfortable framework, as it&#x27;s essentially an F#-ified shim on top of ASP.NET.')
