We include &quot;target&quot; seniority designations in the job post titles, so if it doesn&#x27;t say &quot;senior&quot;, &quot;principal&quot;, etc, then it isn&#x27;t a senior position. We also don&#x27;t (for the most part) have requirements around years of experience, though in practice there&#x27;s an obvious correlation.<p>That said, at this very moment we happen to have a boatload of more senior positions available. There are a couple less senior ones though.')
