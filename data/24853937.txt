It comments on the unlikely optimism and perhaps naïveté people sometimes display. The boy is completely lost and seems hopelessly alone, without any plan or control of the situation. Yet, rather than afraid or worried, he is instead quietly curious: &quot;I wonder where I&#x27;ll float next?&quot; Although not necessarily the situation in this comic, this is a behavior people often exhibit when there is nothing they can do about a problematic situation for a long time; they may have given up hope or developed a cavalier attitude as a coping mechanism.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.explainxkcd.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;1:_Barrel_-_Part_1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.explainxkcd.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;1:_Barrel_-_Part_...</a>')
