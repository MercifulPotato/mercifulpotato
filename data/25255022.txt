Belgian-style French fries can be good, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re better than the rest, it&#x27;s a matter of taste. I personally prefer McDonalds-style fries which are smaller and more homogeneous. And no I&#x27;m not ashamed of that, it&#x27;s fried potatoes, not some kind of fancy technical delicacy.<p>There&#x27;s no wrong target. Some people enjoy deep-dish pizza. It kinda baffles me but I wouldn&#x27;t be telling them that they&#x27;re &quot;shooting for the wrong target&quot; if they tried to replicate this particular recipe because that&#x27;s what they like.')
