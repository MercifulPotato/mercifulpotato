It&#x27;s not an antagonistic relationship. It&#x27;s only antagonistic when they decide that &quot;Unlimited&quot; needs some asterisks behind it.<p>If the business sells unlimited because it does not want the general consumer to feel constricted with online storage, then it is a benefit for the general consumer.  When abusers of business products test the business&#x27; abilities, they ruin the business&#x27; chance of offering a great product that the consumer can find convenience with.<p>All-you-can eat buffet should be treated as such.  But when a bunch of big college guys decide to hang out at an all-you-can eat from 8 am to 8 pm studying and eating, it defeats the product.  It defeats the offering for others.  And it takes away the experience of going to a place never having to worry about ordering more food than you can eat.<p>This ain&#x27;t about feeling sorry for the business. This is about feeling sorry for the consumer.  It is one abuser that hurts consumer.  And that is bad economics for all people.')
