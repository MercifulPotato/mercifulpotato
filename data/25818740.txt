Going Swift-only or even just reducing the surface between Objective-C and Swift to the absolute bare minimum can speed things up a lot.<p>As for writing style, there&#x27;s a few things that can trip SourceKit up but I&#x27;ve found that the main things to avoid are chaining optionals too deeply and nesting closures too deeply (recommend keeping both to 2-3 tops) as well as casting to&#x2F;from Any too often.')
