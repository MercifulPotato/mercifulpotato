Moreover, the people who are quickest to point out that &quot;you&#x27;re not really vegetarian&quot; are the ones who eat meat regularly :(<p>Especially for someone who is vegetarian to reduce carbon emissions, 90%, 95%, and 100% aren&#x27;t that different, and hell even 50% is a tremendous reduction especially if it means that it&#x27;s easier to convince 5 people to do 50% than 1 person to do 100%.<p>Occasional indulgence was never the problem for the environment, and people should know that&#x27;s okay to occasionally indulge, it doesn&#x27;t need to be black and white.')
