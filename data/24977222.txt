Item(by='OskarS', descendants=None, kids=[24977328, 24979059, 24977615, 24979100], score=None, time=1604387682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976905, text='One thing about this particular benchmark is that the file it produces is a little bit unusual even for large text files, because it is only contains one (massive) line. Most huge text files you open in text editors are things like multi-gigabyte logs and database dumps, which are composed of many relatively short lines. Text editors often bake that assumption into their data structures. A more representative test would probably be to use hexdump instead of base64 there.<p>Though I take the point: if a text editor advertises itself as being &quot;fast&quot;, this is the kind of stuff you expect it to handle.<p>EDIT: ok, so i just tried the hexdump version. Vim and Emacs took a couple of seconds each (Emacs being slightly slower and chunkier when you navigate, Vim handles it without issue and is perfectly repsonsive). less opened it instantly (obviously, it&#x27;s less!). ox has been going for a few minutes now, nothing happening.<p>It&#x27;s not the benchmark&#x27;s fault, ox is just slow for large files.')
