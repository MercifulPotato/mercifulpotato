A DVD is like a Blu Ray but can&#x27;t hold as much. A Blu Ray is what your PlayStation&#x2F;Xbox games come on. Given the popularity of game consoles and that most of them still use optical media, I don&#x27;t think CD&#x2F;DVDs are things that a young person would be unfamiliar with. Unlike floppy disks which have no equivalent or use for average people these days.')
