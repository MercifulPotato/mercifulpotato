Why would you throw an exception when you know you&#x27;re dealing with the file system and a file might not be there?<p>If you treat all &quot;tainted&quot; contexts are error-prone and implement proper error handling and relevant logging, you might never need to throw an exception because those situations aren&#x27;t really <i>exceptional</i> to begin with.<p>Another you might ask yourself is whether your language of choice has stack traces that are easily parsable, because you might not be allowed to expose all app internals in all contexts.<p>A third is whether it pays to have that high a verbosity in your logs. In other words, do you <i>really need</i> a stack trace? Is it worth the performance overhead? Is it worth the code clutter of having try&#x2F;catch&#x2F;finally&#x27;s everywhere?<p>A lot of this comes down to preference, but I think there&#x27;s a valid case to be made for the approach that Exceptions are only for truly exceptional cases. Like nulls, god objects or deep inheritance hierarchies, they are vastly overused in my opinion.')
