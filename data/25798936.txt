My point was that your comment didn&#x27;t use any features specific to Java, so if you replaced &quot;Java&quot; with literally any other language you&#x27;d have the exact same argument. The details you added here like that it was &quot;perfectly dominant and acceptable&quot; help in that regard (not that I agree with where you&#x27;re going), but your original comment would have been equally valid with literally any programming language.')
