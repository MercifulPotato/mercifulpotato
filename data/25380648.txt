Item(by='pinchhit', descendants=None, kids=[25382064, 25383047, 25381146, 25382279, 25405239], score=None, time=1607645664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373831, text='As a person who has and currently does work professionally in clojure (at multiple all-clojure shops):  The smart engineer effect is extremely overblown.<p>You will hire smarter-than-average engineers, but with a caveat that no one talks about: they are all self-selected for being people who enjoy tinkering on computer science problems to a fault, and not necessarily your business.  So the breakdown is that you get 10 super-smart people, but 9 of them are focused on myopic bits of code plumbing or reinventing APIs or something, and in practice you only have 1 smart person focused on your business.<p>As the other 9 continue to reinvent wheels, the nature of clojure being small relative to other open-source communities means that eventually your shiny new clojure tools get replaced by better community offerings, except you don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to switch over and start using them.<p>Overall, velocity would be improved if you had hired 1 super smart engineer and 9 mediocre ones.<p>It&#x27;s important to note here that while technically clojure can interoperate with java or javascript, in practice everyone expects you to use poorly-maintained clojure-ish libraries to paper over the java&#x2F;javascript bits, which get out of date quickly.  This effect is 10 times worse for clojurescript in the browser, although it&#x27;s pretty bad for clojure targeting the JVM as well.')
