Alacrity and konsole do this, at least.<p>I can paste newlines just fine in both alacritty and konsole, so I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. With support for Bracketed Paste Mode, all that needs to be stripped from the pasted content is the end-paste escape sequence.<p>Perhaps they stripped newlines before adding Bracketed Paste Mode. That must&#x27;ve been quite some time ago, though.')
