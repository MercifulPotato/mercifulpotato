Wikipedia cites a school shooting in Stockton in 1989 and an office shooting in San Francisco in 1993.  Outside of the state, Wikipedia also cites a mass shooting in Killeen, TX.<p>&gt; LA in the 80s was also Ground Zero for Gang warfare in the US<p>Might be true, but also: the 1980s was near the peak of violent crime certainly nation-wide, maybe worldwide.  Lots written and studied on this topic.  Theories about lead poisoning and all that.  Probably multiple factors.  But a lot of the discussion then was on <i>urban</i> crime.  People thought that cities were dangerous.  I&#x27;m glad that the last 20 years or so has largely seen a reversal of that.<p>Lately there has been a resurgence, especially in the political right, of the <i>cities are dangerous</i> mantra.  It seems pretty odd to me.')
