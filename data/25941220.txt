And some people like to point out these exceptions as &quot;see, billionaires CAN be good&quot; and draw the conclusion that &quot;it&#x27;s ok to have billionaires&quot;.<p>But if you take a step back and look at a society-level structure, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that wealth inequality is a NET NEGATIVE.<p>Smaller middle-class = unhealthy economy, and power concentration into the largest mega-corps that abuse anyone and everyone they can abuse to increase their quarterly results by another buck.<p>That&#x27;s not good for the consumer nor employees.

Large corps are a net negative in a society.<p>&quot;But if Apple and Google make a ton of money, so will their employees!&quot; Except we have PROOF that these companies made deals with each other to not compete for their own employees and keep salaries from increasing too much.<p>It&#x27;s not just me saying this.
