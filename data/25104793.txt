I felt that I had wasted one year of my life and was very bitter about the failure and the personal sacrifices that came with it.<p>In time my thinking came around. I better understood my limits, knew my preferences, and developed some new capabilities. I was also better able to navigate startup #2 which is still going great as a bootstrapped company. My cofounder ended up on a corporate software dev team, and is also doing well.<p>Bottom line: things will get better. Regard this as a learning experience that helped determine a more rewarding future path (probably not doing your own startup, but that&#x27;s OK, too)')
