Had an in-ground one growing up and almost never used it. I had to do the chemicals, skim leaves, roll the solar cover, and change the diatomaceous earth. Everyone on the block had one too, and they were rarely used either.<p>Humidity kills me. For example, I had a Colombian gf but the weather in Barranquilla is mass murder.<p>Around the south Bay Area, I biked around the hills of the Almaden Valley and Mt. Umunhum incessantly, and skateboarded around the neighborhood until my knees had divots and layers of scars. Went to UC Davis where biking was de rigueur. Did some biking in Netherlands and Belgium, the former being a biking paradise.<p>The cis females in Austin are just my speed. Sadly, they don&#x27;t have a chance. And, being a big city, the open-minded types I prefer are more abundant. One area I miss is SF&#x27;s Castro where mixed gender bars facilitate hooking-up with cis females, but I&#x27;ll be back. I don&#x27;t miss SF&#x27;s parking situation and am looking for cheaper ways to park near downtown Austin.<p>Folks seem friendlier in Austin than CA where almost everyone has a chip on their shoulder, is seething with dissatisfaction, and doesn&#x27;t want to be sociable. Heck, I don&#x27;t even mind chatting with the saner homeless people that aren&#x27;t panhandling me. I met some very cool homeless people with interesting lives in Palo Alto, CA when Happy Donuts was the hangout.')
