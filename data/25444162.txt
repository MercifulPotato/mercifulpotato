Right now, everyone agrees I should have 50k quatloos to do something with.  (That&#x27;s not the game; that&#x27;s a fact and the premise going into the game.)  The game is this: I&#x27;ll write a note, and let&#x27;s all agree that ultimately I will no longer have 50k quatloos after I publish the note, okay?&quot;  In fact, it&#x27;s so much <i>like</i> that, that that&#x27;s pretty much what it <i>is</i>.<p>(Getting it &quot;back&quot; is a matter of getting everyone to agree that &quot;okay, now you have the 50k quatloos again&quot;.)')
