Also class is just a token list.<p>&gt; We had same problem in JavaScript until classList<p>1. it&#x27;s much less common to <i>select</i> using javascript than it would be using an xpath <i>select</i>or, hence the issue.<p>2. because JS is a full-blown programming language, splitting the class into a list is not difficult, and can furthermore be trivially factored into a helper function, or a set thereof (as class modification would really be what you&#x27;d want to do)<p>&gt; It is side effect of one attribute name per element<p>It&#x27;s a side-effect of token lists not being much of a use-case at the time <i>for XPath</i>, despite having been a CSS use-case for 3 years at that point.<p>As my comment notes, XPath 3.1 literally has a contains-token function, that function is compatible with XPath 1.0. If you have an XML processor which allows extension (which would be the case for more or less all of them outside browsers), you can trivially implement your own, or an even more specialised `has-class` function.<p>But contains-token was added in 2017, not in 1999, to say nothing of 1996.')
