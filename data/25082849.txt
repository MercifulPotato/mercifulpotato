Item(by='8GUQyfqKYy', descendants=None, kids=[25083079, 25083001], score=None, time=1605279442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082426, text='&gt; food + 1 dollar + tip to the driver (which I&#x27;m perfectly OK with!).<p>In many cases there&#x27;s a markup on the food over the restaurant&#x27;s prices. There&#x27;s delivery fee that&#x27;s generally $2-$3, a service fee that&#x27;s hidden in the &quot;taxes and fees line item&quot;, not to mention a small order fee etc on some orders. \nAnd, of course the tip. This I do not understand. It went from tipping the waiter a bit more because you were well taken care of at the restaurant dining experience, to pre-paying a tip to the driver before knowing if the food&#x27;s good or if the delivery is late etc. The restaurant doesn&#x27;t get any of the tip. Anyway, a subsided food delivery that you got is not sustainable.<p>To be honest I do not understand the tipping culture at all.  Its expected to tip a restaurant staff if you eat at the restaurant, but not if you get the food delivered. But, expected to pre-pay a tip the driver who delivered the food (irrespective of quality of food or delivery) but not the USPS&#x2F;UPS&#x2F;fedex driver who delivered anything else even if he&#x2F;she carries a heavy package over a flight of stairs. Its expected to tip a uber&#x2F;lyft driver even on a shared ride with other folks but not a bus&#x2F;metro&#x2F;train driver. None of it makes sense to me :)')
