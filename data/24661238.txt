The latencies can be orders of magnitude lower, hiding performance issues that would be obvious even with only a millisecond of additional latency.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many vendors claim that they only &quot;support&quot; monolithic single-machine setups (sometimes even virtualization has &quot;unacceptable overhead&quot;) when it&#x27;s blatantly obvious that the application is just written with the assumption that database latency is approximately zero.')
