Item(by='gfxgirl', descendants=None, kids=[25455457], score=None, time=1608205795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25454248, text='I watched it recently because it was some podcasters favorite movie. I like good romcoms but sadly I personally found Love Actually to be horrible and was surprised by the high ratings. There is no &quot;love&quot; in &quot;Love Actually&quot; there is only lust except maybe the old rock star. Every pictured relationship is extremely superficial.  I&#x27;m also surprised the sexual harassment issues in two of the stories are not called out more. Then again, 400k people rated it 7.6 which is high so clearly they all see something I don&#x27;t. There are plenty of romcoms I like though.  ... though if you go read the user reviews on IMDB, after the first page or so they get pretty negative, so I&#x27;m not alone in not getting it.')
