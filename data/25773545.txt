I think Blackberry lost primarily because of their locked-in&#x2F;niche OS at a time when the app scene was exploding. The keyboard if anything was a compelling reason to stay with them, especially in the exec&#x2F;professionals sector of the market.<p>If blackberry had successfully executed a full iteration of their build&#x2F;design quality with Android OS at a point where they could have retained their enterprise dominance, I think they would still be a major player today.<p>But it didn&#x27;t go that way (a major cause for which was the scale of change that would have been needed to pivot BES&#x2F;BIS early enough). I don&#x27;t think the keyboard contributed to Blackberry&#x27;s demise.<p>That weird scroll nubbin, on the other hand.... and let&#x27;s not forget the &#x27;haptic&#x27; touch on the Storm.')
