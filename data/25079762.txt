Because since your theory is based on grouping tracks, it is easy to test, by simply grouping all tracks in a Set with 20 or so tracks that use a decent chunk of CPU. Then all their CPU should shift from several cores into one single core&#x2F;thread (according to your theory). Of course, being easy I already tested this with a Set that used Live&#x27;s native devices (no CPU usage change), but I can&#x27;t test with VSTs right now (none installed). Maybe VST hosting has that problem, but processing of audio summing, Live&#x27;s own devices and M4L doesn&#x27;t have any major problem with multi-core.')
