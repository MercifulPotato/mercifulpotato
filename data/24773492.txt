I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, and I&#x27;m not attacking you or anything. I just want to play this out, because if there&#x27;s a good solution, god knows I&#x27;d love to discuss it.<p>Is it constitutional to arrest mentally ill people for being mentally ill?<p>That&#x27;s a complex question.<p>I don&#x27;t think homeless advocacy groups have any interest in obstructing homeless people&#x27;s access to municipally-administered mental health and substance-abuse programs?
