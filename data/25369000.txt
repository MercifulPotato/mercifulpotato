It&#x27;s the job of a paper in its reporting to report things, not to influence opinion. Implicit in &quot;Bothsidesism&quot; is the notion that a paper should have an interest in the direction of influence it provides. That&#x27;s against the interest of &quot;news&quot; (in the literal sense of the word) and the general proliferation of reported facts. I suppose I&#x27;m several decades too late with this take.')
