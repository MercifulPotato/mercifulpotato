Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606581824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234572, text='&gt; Do you regularly record interactions with your coworkers, on the chance they may say something incriminating?<p>That&#x27;s a silly response and you know it. If there was systematic racism, as the article seems to be implying, then yes, I would record it. I would record it even if it wasn&#x27;t directed at me but someone else. If more than 50% of the black employees are leaving due to &quot;racism&quot; then of course I would record it. Wouldn&#x27;t you? If a manager was being racist towards your co-worker, wouldn&#x27;t you record it? Or are you a racist?<p>&gt; This sounds awfully similar to the argument made against women: qualified women just don&#x27;t apply!<p>No. I&#x27;m saying there is not a lot of black students getting CS degrees&#x2F;etc. Hence the lack of qualified employees. It&#x27;s a supply problem, not a demand problem.<p>&gt; You seem to accept Coinbase&#x2F;Brian Armstrong&#x27;s words without question.<p>No. I specifically said I didn&#x27;t in the comment you replied to. I said I am open to the idea of racism but I find it very unlikely.<p>&gt; Why do you feel that the Black employees&#x27; words must be critiqued to hell and back?<p>The difference between you and me is that I just want the truth and you want to push an agenda. I think everyone&#x27;s words should be critiqued &quot;to hell and back&quot;. Including the ceo, black employees and most definitely the political activists at the nytimes. How else are you going to get to the truth?')
