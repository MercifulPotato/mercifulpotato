There are many, many ways that sci-fi has conceived of this working.  Any patent has to articulate a method for achieving it, and the patent only covers that particular method.<p>That said, if a sci-fi novel were to go into great technical detail about how to train a chatbot to emulate the way a dead loved one communicates, and Microsoft were to copy that method exactly, it&#x27;s possible that the novel could be treated as prior art.')
