I&#x27;ve got to ask, what was all the buzz about then, and why was it necessary to &quot;improve&quot; a simple text protocol into a giant ball of binary protocols replacing and circumventing regular TCP&#x2F;IP. In combination with subverting web standardization, I can only assume it was a deliberate effort to deprive the web of its open nature, by making it so fscking complicated that only Google is capable to implement it. Same with Kubernetes, which turns out just as the one ring to bind them all, and enslave humanity into &quot;the cloud&quot;. I have a suspicion a coming generation will not look favorably to Google tech in a post-SV era, who managed to subvert RFC and just about every other org we had to keep the net sane.')
