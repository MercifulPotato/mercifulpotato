Indeed one can use LXC&#x2F;LXD combination or use Proxmox, OpenStack, Opennebula cloud management platform all of them suppor LXC&#x2F;LXD now. All these communities using LXC&#x2F;LXD contribute to it.<p>Funny enough indeed Debian, RedHat, Suse and Canonical contribute to LXC project as well.<p>If you had issues with LXD try asking your questions on LXD forum and community will support you with your issues. It will not need Canonical’s blessings to support you. It’s unlike if you had issues with anthos k8s from google, you need to be a paid subscriber to get support.')
