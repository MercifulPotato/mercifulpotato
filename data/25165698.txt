Be it inter-cores or intra-core.<p>I think the logical design space is so vast now that there is largely enough freedom to compete even when addressing vast corpus of existing software, even if said software is tuned for previous&#x2F;competitor chips. It was already at the time of the PPro, with thousands times more transistors it is even more. And that makes it even more sad that Intel has been stuck on basically Skylake on their 14nm for so long.')
