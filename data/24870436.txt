Steve Ballmer put all of Microsoft eggs in the Office Basket that let mobile die on the vine. He pushed licensing and marketing and left developers and new tech to languish.    It&#x27;s why to this day, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have a place in the mobile space, it&#x27;s iOS or Android.  I also aggree that pushing MS in a more Open source direction has helped make them more palatable to developers.')
