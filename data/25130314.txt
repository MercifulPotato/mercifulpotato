Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=[25131162], score=None, time=1605649440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128214, text='&gt; New Zealand is an island that, for all intents and purposes, closed their ports to human travel.<p>Firstly, New Zealand is not closed to human travel. It has mandatory quarantine for inbound travelers.<p>The US can do the same. It is in an even better situation to do so than New Zealand, because its economy is less dependant on tourism and imports.<p>It would be utterly pointless, of course, because nearly anywhere in the world has less COVID-per-capita than the US. A random traveler from Kentucky, or New Jersey is just as likely to be a COVID carrier as someone flying in from Paris. Keeping Parisians out isn&#x27;t doing anything to stop spread, at this point. [1]<p>As for the legality of locking people in their own homes, the US is no stranger to blanket curfews during a state of emergency... Or for imprisoning symptomatic, or asymptomatic carriers of a disease.<p>[1] In a stroke of brilliance, travel from China to the US is still banned. Can anyone puzzle out how this policy is currently helping improve American health outcomes?')
