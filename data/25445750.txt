Astronomers are a great little community out there, and they really need help writing code.  A lot of them aren&#x27;t familiar or have experience with best industry practices that could save them so much time&#x2F;money&#x2F;heartache.<p>Bunches of projects are hiring, and if you have creds, and industry experience, that will only increase your value.  I&#x27;m sure you could find a job at any of the wonderful facilities wherever you want to be around the world!<p>Sometimes you have to look at the grass from the other side to realize it&#x27;s greener, and that&#x27;s fine.  Some day I may go back to industry and get paid again.  But it&#x27;s all good fun anyway.')
