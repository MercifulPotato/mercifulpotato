If they were satisfied that 16GB was sufficient, I would&#x27;ve expected them to also refresh the 16&quot; MBP with M1. I think the fact that they didn&#x27;t is a good indicator that something about M1 isn&#x27;t ready for the big boy league, and my guess is RAM will factor into that.<p>My guess is that the second generation (M2?) will improve performance with little efficiency gain and will include up to 32GB &quot;Unified Memory&quot;. And then binning will be used to produce the 16GB and 8GB variants.<p>&gt; I wonder if they are going to do dual (or more) socket configurations.<p>Whoa, that&#x27;s something I hadn&#x27;t thought of! I wonder if M1 is amenable to that kind of configuration. That would be pretty neat!')
