TAOSU is useful for the first part of the book, as it explains concepts around friendship. For example, if a friend is going through a tough time ask “How can I best support you?” rather than making assumptions or giving advice.<p>The second part is more about specific situations like your friend is very ill or you have to decline being a bridesmaid. I recommend it as the concepts explanation might be helpful.<p>I’ve not yet read “Frientimacy”, and it seems to be a similar book.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Art-Showing-Up-Yourself-People&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1615196617" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Art-Showing-Up-Yourself-People&#x2F;dp&#x2F;161...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;-&#x2F;Shasta-Nelson&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1580056075" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;-&#x2F;Shasta-Nelson&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1580056075</a>')
