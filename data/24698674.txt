I would not consider selecting a dependency with the intent of doing things that way to be a sound policy, because infrequent big-bang updates like that have a tendency to be expensive and risky. There aren&#x27;t a lot of development ethics that I find less palatable than &quot;move fast and break things,&quot; but &quot;move slow and break things&quot; is definitely one of them.')
