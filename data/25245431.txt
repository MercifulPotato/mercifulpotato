I find it strange that many people don&#x27;t understand it and instead compare languages is. &quot;Just use Julia&quot; is not really an option in enterprise world either, when you already have hundreds of kloc, hundreds&#x2F;thousands of packages and hundreds of people (not all of them professional developers, e.g. various analysts and quants) working on &#x2F; using that on daily basis in production, plus all that code almost certainly depends on external packages (eg machine learning libraries) that are simply not available in Julia.<p>For personal projects - sure, go use Julia or ditch it and go straight for Rust.')
