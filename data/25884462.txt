Item(by='globular-toast', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611424175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881800, text='The rule normally stated on IRC is &quot;don&#x27;t ask to ask&quot;. You&#x27;ll find that in IRC channel topics everywhere (although I have noticed many geeks going soft and trying to be more &quot;approachable&quot; these days).<p>People asking to ask really pisses geeks off (me included). This was one of the first things that made me realise that I&#x27;m very similar to a very small number of other fellow geeks, and very different from most people. Most people think they&#x27;re being polite by asking to ask. We think they&#x27;re being rude by wasting our time on such pointless pleasantries.<p>I like that this page uses <i>The Office</i> for its examples. I don&#x27;t think it will do any good, though. People either get why you don&#x27;t ask to ask, or they don&#x27;t. And some people don&#x27;t value their time (let alone <i>your</i> time) as highly as you value yours.')
