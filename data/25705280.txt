NPR comes to mind. Or encourage people to read a leftish and a rightish source?  And encourage people to think for themselves?<p>It would also be nice, albeit maybe very hard, to encourage even the less balanced media to try to speak to everyone and to write critically and honestly. For example, I personally lean left, but I find the New York Times to be increasingly vapid and unthinking.<p>In general, if you’re reading news (or Twitter!) just to find people who agree with you, you’re doing it wrong. This is true regardless of political party.')
