It costs 3x as much to DIY fix your own can there as it does here due to needing &quot;approved parts&quot; and an inspection of every repair. Things that are easy, safe and affordable DIY fixes in the US are impossible there.<p>Your laws are not EU-wide, by the way. Most of the EU doesn&#x27;t require the approved parts to pass inspection, and only requires the inspection at regular intervals, not after every repair.')
