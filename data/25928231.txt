He&#x27;s mostly just an arrogant asshole.<p>The left&#x27;s response to him however...  And I&#x27;ve spoken with many many other centrists online who agree with me so it&#x27;s not clear to me why you think the centrists are anything but just silent so they don&#x27;t get swept up in the hysteria (which is where I&#x27;ve been at for years now, which is why I&#x27;ve never been on Twitter, instagram, etc.  Was on FB briefly and promptly left it long before it got popular to do so).')
