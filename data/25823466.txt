With that being said, I feel like it&#x27;s grown well beyond it&#x27;s useful value proposition for me.<p>The biggest value was I could share a lot of components between my app and marketing site. Even though most of the marketing site was static content, Gatsby made it incredibly easy to introduce well integrated custom features.<p>I never hit of the point of needing a full CMS (the site wasn&#x27;t large enough), so it was great for my needs. Not sure why anyone would use it if they&#x27;re going full CMS, though.')
