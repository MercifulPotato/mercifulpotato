It&#x27;s not part of the m1 die. M1 still have traditional memory controllers. It&#x27;s just they built the logic die and the memory die in a single package for lower memory power. Increase package size is simple or if you really need big memory, do the traditional memory connection on a pcb.<p>As for gaming, I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s a hardware issue. It&#x27;s software support. Microsoft now also owns a lot of gaming studio for xbox exclusivesz those will never come to the Mac. Also big gaming companies are now working with likes of microsoft, amazon, Google on cloud gaming. That seems like the way forward for making AAA games run everywhere. I doubt these companies will spin up another team to support these games on the Mac platform. It sucks that m1 is actually really good gaming processor.')
