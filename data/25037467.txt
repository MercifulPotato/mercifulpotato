My gold standard is fair surely!  I don&#x27;t eat like that often, but I can dream!<p>Agriculture is absolutely a boon to humanity.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that I need to go along with big agra, does it?  I don&#x27;t agree with oil based fertilisers being used.  And monocrops.<p>It is absolutely the system we have, but its not a good one.  Smaller farming, locally sourced food would be a better way to go.  I am a fan of permaculture - I&#x27;m itching to try this when circumstances permit.  This is a way of densely growing food.')
