It seems like they are used to another workplace culture than the secretive and strict culture of Apple, and they might have committed some social faux pas which tainted their reputation, leading to sabotage from their teammates. Of course that doesn&#x27;t excuse their behavior.<p>Additionally, I really hope that they now have learnt to separate themselves emotionally from their workplace. I know that it might&#x27;ve been a stressful (e.g. visa issues), but one should never let themselves get to a point where they cry about a workplace issue in their Christmas&#x2F;NYE break. It&#x27;s just a job, after all.')
