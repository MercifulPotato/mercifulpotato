Facebook doesn&#x27;t expect this ad will get individuals to opt in to tracking or to buy an Android phone instead of an iPhone.  They don&#x27;t try and make the case at all that Apple&#x27;s privacy protections are actually bad for the end user.  So really, this ad is targeted at politicians, and what Facebook wants to achieve is shift antitrust interest on Apple, either to saddle the company with regulations that effectively prevent it from limiting what Facebook can do on iPhones, breaking Apple up so that there is more competition in the phone OS market, or most likely, just to divert the attention of politicians and regulators from Facebook&#x27;s antitrust issues.')
