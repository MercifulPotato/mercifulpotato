You&#x27;re supposed to go in there, do the work, and if you didn&#x27;t do any scandals you get reelected. You&#x27;re not supposed to be in the spotlight every day. You&#x27;re not supposed to juice the economy or any of that. Nobody in a democratic government should have any power over a free-market system. If anyone in the government including president is messing around picking winners and losers, that&#x27;s not free-market or capitalism. That&#x27;s cronyism. We should be picking the president based on his qualifications, not on his false promises to juice this or that economic sector.')
