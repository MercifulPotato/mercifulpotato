Item(by='ALittleLight', descendants=None, kids=[25184419], score=None, time=1606102900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182662, text='I disagree with the characterization of sexism against women as &quot;systemic&quot;.  That seems like exactly the wrong word to use.  Systemic sexism would imply there is an organized system to disadvantage women.  I think the organized system - going from the public education system (largely administrated by women) which favors girls (better grades, less punishment, better graduation rate for girls), to college (where girls are a majority of students and graduates) to employment (where there are organized systems to benefit women in terms of hiring and promotion) exhibits a preference based on gender for women rather than against women.<p>The kind of sexism that women encounter is not an organized system of oppression (e.g. being directed to hire fewer women) but rather it is the latent sexism of individuals not acting in an organized fashion.  Individuals not taking a woman seriously, or being harassing, or not wanting to hire women etc.  &quot;Systemic&quot; does not seem like an apt word for this kind of sexism.<p>Regarding your question over how I know I don&#x27;t benefit from gender bias - clearly I can&#x27;t know.  Just like my female colleagues can&#x27;t know if they benefit from gender bias.  Maybe if I were a woman I would&#x27;ve got better grades in school, gone to a better college, retained my interest in programming, and been preferentially hired in an even better role.  It&#x27;s impossible to know.')
