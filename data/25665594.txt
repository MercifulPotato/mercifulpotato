Most of our actions are with a mobile phone near us, meaning that the social sphere is directly with us and only a twitter&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;HN glance away.<p>Doesn&#x27;t even help that the sites are designed to be competitively addictive on <i>top</i> of it.<p>IF that is the case - no matter how much you listen to someone, a few seconds after they return to their phone they are part of the new outrage cycle.<p>Do note that the whole thing above is doable with cable television as well. IF your uncle goes back home to listen to X TV channel day in and day out, your one on one interaction is going to only have a tiny impact.<p>The saddest part of what tech has created is a faster pace of communication that is orienting itself inimically to slower one on one human interaction.<p>Even this para above is built with the idea that parts of it will be broken off by people who read it and then reused later on.
