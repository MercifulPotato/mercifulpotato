It&#x27;s how I played from 1999-2015.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that rushing isn&#x27;t a flaw or a problem, rather it&#x27;s a matter of perspective. Players who want to build up for a while nearly always want to do that because they haven&#x27;t learned any other way to play. And they&#x27;re not under any obligation to do so, either-- but it&#x27;s not fair to say the game is flawed on that basis.')
