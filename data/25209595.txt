I subsist on oatmeal, eggs, milk, fruits &amp; veggies, peanut butter, cheese in moderation, TONS OF BLACK BEANS AND LENTILS, rice, bread and pasta. Boring stuff.<p>No meat. No soda. No fast food. Sweets and booze only on rare occasions.<p>Black beans are good for your brain and leave you full &amp; satiated for longer than most food. Their notorious side-effects -- to those around you -- are somewhat exaggerated. Fats and sweets make me feel lazy. I like to stay active (weights, hoops, doing things outside) but can slack for weeks at a time w&#x2F;out consequence.<p>I don&#x27;t give myself credit for being disciplined -- just have good habits and decent genes. What I am proud of is that in spite of not being the most <i>mentally</i> healthy person, instead of turning to food or drugs to comfort myself, I use exercise, good food and a sense of humor to lift my spirits.')
