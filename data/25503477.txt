I leave my passwords at 12 characters max (and 8 for less important sites)<p>Reason: You still have to type it sometimes. Like on a device you don&#x27;t have the password manager on. That makes it really annoying. And because it&#x27;s only used on one site it doesn&#x27;t really matter how long it is. If a hacker gets hold of the password file they already own that site anyway. Doesn&#x27;t really matter whether they can bruteforce the hash. It won&#x27;t give them more access than they already have.<p>I do agree with the horcrux thing though.. Really important passwords I only store on paper and I already add a memorised thing to them. But be aware it&#x27;s not perfect either. A compromised endpoint could have a keylogger installed. Totally passwordless with Fido2 for example would be even better.')
