For example, I hate phones and insist on emails - it&#x27;s impractical, I know, but by giving firm No&#x27;s, people respect my communication preference at work and personal life.<p>On the other hand, there are some directions that I&#x27;d like to say more Yes to, to consciously open up possibilities.<p>I suppose it comes down to knowing when to say Yes and No, and to act on it.')
