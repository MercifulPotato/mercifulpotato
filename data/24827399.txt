As you go into even basic body building or training, you start taking more and more &quot;Stuff&quot;. There&#x27;s no clear obvious intuitive big line between &quot;natural talent and hard work&quot; and &quot;illegal chemical cheating&quot;. Reading the details of the tests involved a few years ago made me believe the line we draw is thin, porous, arbitrary and ever-changing.<p>The things we are testing for are not so much clear-cut presence or absence, but volumes and concentrations based on statistical curves, and it&#x27;s a constant race so somebody who was &quot;legit &amp; natural last year&quot; may be &quot;doping and illegal this year&quot; or vice versa; everybody will have SOME naturally or legally allowed amount of tested substance; etc. Which means that I cannot get excited that ANYbody at olympic level is doing it &quot;on their own, unassisted, natural&quot;, for whatever definition of above we take.')
