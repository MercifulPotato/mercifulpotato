A company this big, which this much influence, cannot be trusted to operate the digital public square for an entire nation, let alone the world. It is a threat to speech, since the reach of these platforms is such that speech effectively doesn&#x27;t exist if it isn&#x27;t on these platforms. We need competing platforms badly, but it is hard to challenge the first-mover advantage of network effects of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. Perhaps we simply need to instead regulate them so that they do not deplatform&#x2F;censor content that does not break the law.')
