Well, this post answers those questions. But before that, I want to give you a context.<p>Leaving aside the factors or reasons that have led most people to hate math, it is a reality that we need it in data science. For me, one of the biggest shortcomings I found in mathematics was its lack of applicability in the real world, I didn’t see a reason for intermediate and advanced mathematics, such as multivariate calculus. I confess that in school and college I didn’t like them for that reason, but I always did well and got good scores and averages above the majority (especially in statistics). But I still didn’t see how I could use a derivative or a matrix in the real world. I finally ended up as a software engineer and once I entered the world of data science I was able to make the connection between mathematics, statistics, and the real world.<p>Read all here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datasource.ai&#x2F;en&#x2F;data-science-articles&#x2F;21-resources-for-learning-math-for-data-science" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datasource.ai&#x2F;en&#x2F;data-science-articles&#x2F;21-resour...</a>')
