Which isn&#x27;t not interesting! But the expectations set by the cryptonauts was that this was all going to change the world.<p>And then ran face first into the reasons the existing systems work the way that they do, haven&#x27;t communicated well to &quot;average&quot; people, can&#x27;t tell a non-theoretical&#x2F;ideological story of why what they build exists, etc.<p>There are some great people working on crypto projects, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is thriving. The only mainstream company is Coinbase and they make money based on trading, not any underlying tangible value of the coins.')
