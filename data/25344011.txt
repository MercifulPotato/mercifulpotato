Part of me wishes I hadn&#x27;t but also the Pinephone is better than my Samsung galaxy S3 in terms of specs and with actually competent software.<p>If people on qualcomm phones had any amount of faith the company wouldn&#x27;t screw them over or the community would be able to make a huge leap in terms of compatibility they probably would keep the phones but that&#x27;s not how things have worked for about a decade.')
