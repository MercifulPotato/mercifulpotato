Under the hood, SiteSpect is a reverse proxy. Requests from end users are routed to an appropriate backend and SiteSpect modifies the response based on what tests the user is assigned to and then delivers those changes back to the end user. We&#x27;re looking to fill a variety of roles, including seeking client facing front-end developers to help our clients use our tools to test and modify their websites, and advise clients on how best to test and optimize their customer experience.<p>Open Technical Roles:<p>Front-End Solutions Developer (Customer Success)\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3jj3slwX" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3jj3slwX</a><p>Linux Operations Engineer\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3pk3slw4" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.jobvite.com&#x2F;m?3pk3slw4</a>')
