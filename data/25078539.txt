Item(by='codekilla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605238583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078322, text='&gt; Just to be clear; do you mean completely wiping out humanity or a reset to some small population that might have another chance at it?<p>Either might occur, given deployment of nuclear or bio technology.<p>&gt; Getting nations to truly cooperate probably means giving up a lot of identity based on tradition, origin, and history. I have no clue how best to convince people that what really matters about them and their neighbors is how individually happy, fulfilled, and free to explore they are regardless of their differences. Getting rid of false beliefs in zero sum economics and the futility of status signalling might be a start, but humans are sort of innately programmed for a lot of counterproductive beliefs about status, pride, fairness, worth, etc.<p>Yes, and I think one needs to realize that this is a 100 year project. Technologies like nuclear fusion, and quantum computing I put into this &#x27;100 year&#x27; category, that is those that would catalyze profound transformations of humanity (synthetic biology being another, Abstract General Intelligence another [I do not like the term &#x27;artificial&#x27;]) given about 100 years and sufficient resources.<p>So rebuilding and rethinking completely the way humans govern themselves I think is one of these 100 year projects. Things like nomadic citizens (humans without borders), economics with externalities an explicit factor, zero secrecy non zero sum international relations. All stuff that is easy enough to write down, but with no real chance of swift movement towards. Future economic systems are hopefully cooperative, perhaps further enabled by greater gains in digitizing the economy (though risks towards greater inequality that is further destabilizing seem just as likely)\n.<p>&gt; reason under uncertainty without probabilities.<p>I got started in math and computation working on quant stuff during the first financial crash. It was a front row seat to how probability goes wrong (your copulas aren&#x27;t worth the pixels you graphed them on). The idea is that you have to recognize some things just aren&#x27;t <i>accurately</i> quantifiable. If you don&#x27;t recognize that, you just place yourself in a situation where you have a false sense of certainty about uncertainty. You just simply can&#x27;t assign a probability <i>accurately</i> to anything you so choose. It&#x27;s not that probability isn&#x27;t worthwhile, it most certainly is, the point is to be able to accept when you are dealing with a situation where it is non-informational (and likely even counter-informational).')
