Having lived through the exodus (I stayed) of the dot com crash, it feels a bit like that. Too many people trying to deny the reality that economics imposes on all things. It really does matter if you buy electricity for 25 cents a kilowatt hour and your net revenue of selling its work product is 20 cents you just can&#x27;t keep that up.<p>Like the Web 1.0 era, the Web 2.0 era has seen some pretty durable successes. Transactions over the medium are here to stay, they aren&#x27;t &quot;weird&quot; any more. Your portal to technological offerings is not a &quot;PC&quot; any more, it is an increasingly obviously mislabeled &quot;phone.&quot; Margins on communication &quot;services&quot; have been commoditized away and seem unlikely to ever return.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the next thing, what ever it happens to be. The most fun is always the first third of a wave. The swell, the hint of powerful forces just under the surface waiting to be tapped, the anticipation of successfully getting enough ahead to start the adrenaline fueled ride.<p>Never a dull moment in a place like this.')
