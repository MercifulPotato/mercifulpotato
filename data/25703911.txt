Their PR people had to constantly engage the media to tell them that he only kept his account because he was POTUS.<p>He isn&#x27;t gonna be POTUS much longer, there are about 40 other platforms he can use, and he&#x27;s got an entire press apparatus.<p>I&#x27;m tired of this revisionist nonsense.  Again: Trump and others would have been banned A LONG TIME AGO if they weren&#x27;t elected officials who spent money on these platforms according to their TOSes.')
