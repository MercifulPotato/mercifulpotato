There&#x27;s absolutely no possibility that I might notice some detail on some edge case that the author hasn&#x27;t noticed and which affects his own use in some way? The author is infallible and has validated 100% if his use cases to 100% certainty?<p>Because if he&#x27;s not infallible, he should want to at least be aware of bugs in the software. Not wanting to know about bugs is exactly equivalent to not being interested in the quality of your work.<p>If you&#x27;re not interested in the quality of your work, then I don&#x27;t want to use your software. And I&#x27;d hate to inadvertently cost you a tenth of a cent by downloading your crap, so please shut down your webserver and don&#x27;t release any new versions publicly - save yourself the money and save everybody the time and effort of having to interact with you and your shitty software.')
