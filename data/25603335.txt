Most of the country has insurance coverage, and even a high copay is probably cheaper than paying cash for most things.  However, it will hopefully lower prices for people that have no coverage for some procedures by exposing any gross differences between the negotiated rates with big insurance payers and the cash rates offered to individuals.  It will benefit people that are uninsured or undercovered, if they do their homework.<p>I have a feeling that while this is a step in the right direction, people can still be taken advantage of.  Like, hospitals may offer a reasonable cash price for a baby delivery but still tack on all sorts of extra fees.  Similar to the “underbody rust protection” scheme with car dealers.  It’s supposed to be illegal but somehow the hospitals will figure it out.')
