I think the Pandora&#x27;s box is that the social media companies really had a choice of two universes:<p>* A world where they weren&#x27;t the arbiters of truthiness, and were a place that supported &#x27;free speech&#x27;.<p>* A world where they decide what posts to show, and it&#x27;s their job to moderate the platform.<p>The decision to take the second approach is actually a pretty recent development. These companies can no longer hide behind the &#x27;we are just a platform for free speech&#x27; line of thinking, because they have now decided that&#x27;s not what they are about.')
