It will require the segregated replacement of entire enclaves of computers, network hardware and servers across vast federal and corporate networks.<p>I bet IBM, Oracle, Intel, etc are foaming at the mouth at the thought of all the new services and hardware they get to sell to gov&#x27;t agencies.<p>&gt; all elements of national power must be placed on the table.<p>&gt; While we must reserve our right to unilateral self-defense, allies must be rallied to the cause. The importance of coalitions will be especially important to punishing Russia and navigating this crisis without uncontrolled escalation.<p>&gt; He must use whatever leverage he can muster to protect the United States and severely punish the Russians.<p>&gt; An intrusion so brazen and of this size and scope cannot be tolerated by any sovereign nation.<p>Absolutely zero introspection towards our own failed government and agencies and several calls to action about punishing Russia for this and calls for escalation. We left the door open and now we want to punish everyone for going in before we even figure out how to close the door or know who walked in.')
