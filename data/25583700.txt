Salters never sold a version with a plastic adjustment bar on the bottom for the reason I saw, it breaks almost immediately.<p>Amazon is really muddying the waters by combining products too. They seem to be merging comments and products that shouldn&#x27;t be merged and are different SKUs and that is definitely a problem, but its also participating in the fraudulent sale of knock off products and passing them off as the real thing.')
