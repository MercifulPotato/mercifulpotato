People are much more likely to survive an accident at a lower speed.<p>&quot;The results from one of these studies is presented in figure 1, which shows a fatality risk of 1.5% at 20 mph [32km&#x2F;h] versus 8% at 30 mph [48km&#x2F;h].&quot; [1] (in typically British fashion, the actual data is in km&#x2F;h, but this general-public version of the document is presented with miles.)<p>The difference is even greater at the next gap (30mph→40mph, or 48km&#x2F;h→64km&#x2F;h).
