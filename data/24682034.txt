We are developing&#x2F;offer a database for health insurance (specifically the German Market) data, for non technical people to analyse the effectiveness of certain treatments etc. Or create certain cohorts for studies. The paper was an overview&#x2F;introduction to It. while I&#x27;m proud to have written it, it&#x27;s basically marketing&#x2F;legitimation for our field. Another division of our company does actual data science, research and publication on these topics. We&#x27;re in a weird middle ground as our ownership is all health insurances which makes us technically public service, but our work environment is far more tech oriented (and 20 years young on average).')
