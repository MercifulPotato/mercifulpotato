Well, Windows&#x2F;Linux are on the same Ryzen 2700X with a Geforce 1080Ti, the Mac is a 2018 Mini with 32G RAM and 6 core i5. 4k 32&quot; display in each case.<p>What surprised me:\n- Windows UI is WAY the fastest. Linux is the slowest, and with fractional scaling turned off its hardly tolerable<p>- the font rendering on Windows is perfect, while MacOS is a bit blurry. This is very surprising to me since all the hype around the good scaling of MacOS. Windows hidpi fonts are just perfectly sharp.<p>- MacOS is absolutely consistent when it comes to rendering and scaling, the others aren&#x27;t')
