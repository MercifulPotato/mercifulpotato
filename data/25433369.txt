Item(by='caeril', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608057425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426915, text='&gt; Really would love a clear answer<p>It&#x27;s astonishing that you don&#x27;t understand this, but I&#x27;ll assume your question is in good faith.<p>It&#x27;s because &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually produce etched silicon anymore, or really anything of actual value to humanity, at all. In fact, it&#x27;s become a net negative for the rest of humanity.<p>It spends the most valuable IQ points this planet has on endless ad click optimization, addictive social media experiences that induce mass depression, and finding novel ways to censor non-mainstream opinions.<p>There is no value-add, and there hasn&#x27;t been for two decades. I suppose Cupertino can lay some small claim to actually advancing humanity with their silicon design, but at the cost of the rest of the company inventing ways to ensure that humans are passive consumers of Apple Credit Cards and Apple TV instead of actually advancing us somewhere other than Idiocracy or Wall-E.<p>Meanwhile, there are very real and very tangible risks to our very existence that SV ignores because of mathematically flawed assumptions about the actual physical limits to photovoltaics, energy storage, or absurd notions such as  &quot;vertical farming&quot;. If Wired or The Atlantic prints a glowing story on a 19 year old who will solve resource constraints and climate change, well then, by God they&#x27;re going to do it. Faith is all you need. Math and reality can GTFO.<p>What&#x27;s really hilarious is that HN, at least monthly, gets an article posted and upvoted about how toxic and infantile and terrible SV is, but lessons are never learned because anything that interferes with the income stream necessary to maintain the narrative bubble is mere curiosity.<p>You even asking this question is indicative of a problem: specifically the problem that you are NOT actually ignorant of the answer. You read the answer on your own echo chamber regularly. Rather, you choose to disregard it and instead regard the people earnestly answering it as trolls, or proles, or some other ignoble fool whose response can be easily forgotten.<p>As it is that this response will be forgotten. Because introspection is inconvenient, and flyover rubes are beneath you.')
