I called them to be sure and was told that this is to ensure quality. This is doublespeak for &quot;so that we have more control over how you use it&quot;.<p>I get the impression that right now they have the technical capability to disable 3rd party cartridges but do not use that capability for the most part. But they&#x27;re quite upfront that they may change their mind.<p>So yes, non-DRM&#x27;d cartridges work on HP printers for now. That might change at any time though, at only their discretion. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d expect the same cartridge form factor to work in every printer you own.<p>I am saying that HP is making it so that third parties may be technically unable to manufacture cartridges and are left instead doing workarounds like refilling old HP cartridges.')
