The chemotherapeutic agent then binds to the biopolymer.<p>In your one paper you test Doxorubicin, where the site of action is the tumor DNA itself.  Presumably the biopolymer remains extracellular, so how does the &quot;bound&quot; Doxorubicin get to its active site?<p>Do you see Doxorubicin &quot;unbinding&quot; over time?  Does the biopolymer itself enter the cell through phagocytosis?')
