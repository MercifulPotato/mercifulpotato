I believe the kernel already keeps track of what pages are a clean copy of data from the filesystem, so I would think it would be a simple matter of essentially pageing out the corrupted data.<p>What would be interesting is if userspace could mark a region of memory as recomputable. If the kernel is notified of memory corruption there, it triggers a handler in the userspace process to rebuild the data. Granted, given the current state of hardware; I can&#x27;t imagine that is anywhere near worth the effort to implement.')
