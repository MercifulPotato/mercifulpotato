But it helps if the person writing the code has a <i>habit</i> of Quality.<p>That takes many years. When that level is reached, the person basically <i>can&#x27;t</i> write bad code.<p>Early on, code Quality takes extra time. Down the road, once it becomes habit, then it is just &quot;how it goes.&quot; No extra effort at all.<p>But <i>design</i> Quality, in my experience, is even more important. This applies to both architecture and UX.<p>Again, programmers with a great deal of experience will deliver in this arena, as well.<p><i>&quot;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.&quot;</i>')
