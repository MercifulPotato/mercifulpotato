Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603472961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871527, text='&gt; What&#x27;s the point in picking your favorite party if the outcome would be worse?<p>If I&#x27;m in Wyoming, what&#x27;s the point of voting for Biden? Should I not just go ahead and vote for Trump?<p>And as a I mentioned in my other comment, I have met quite a few third party voters who care greatly about things on which they believe Hilary would have been worse than Trump. Don&#x27;t jump to conclusions on what is &quot;better&quot; for them.<p>&gt; I never made the claim that voting for third party in a swing state is bad. But yes, if the state is sufficiently &quot;safe&quot;, the disadvantage of voting third party is marginal.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t about voting third party in a non-swing state, but about voting for the clearly losing party in said state. Why bother voting for Biden in Wyoming or Trump in Washington? That&#x27;s wasting the vote. It&#x27;s a bigger waste than what you are talking about. If you lean towards a third party, voting for Biden in Wyoming is the ultimate waste: You vote for someone who has no chance at winning, and he&#x27;s not even aligned with your political perspective. When it comes to &quot;wasted&quot; votes, these vastly outnumber those voting for 3rd party candidates.<p>I guess growing up in a country where voting wasn&#x27;t allowed does give me a different perspective than you. And people complaining incessantly about Nader&#x2F;Stein voters is a pretty strong signal that their vote wasn&#x27;t wasted.')
