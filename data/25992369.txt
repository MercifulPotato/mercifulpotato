Item(by='peterburkimsher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612206897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989698, text='I like the concept of Solid, and proposed it to the BeWelcome community (who are running a hospitality exchange network like CouchSurfing, but free).<p>Although Solid is a better technical idea, I&#x27;m not sure how the migration from PHP&#x2F;MySQL would work. Nobody on the Solid forum replied to my post asking about it. Another guy, Chagai, is pushing for Matrix and the fediverse. Ultimately, there&#x27;s many great technical ideas, but the real solution doesn&#x27;t lie in writing code - it&#x27;s in building the community.<p>Therefore I&#x27;m trying harder to create more activity in BeWelcome&#x27;s existing community (which is hard when nobody&#x27;s travelling), like an online meetup every Thursday. If it gets critical mass, I believe it could be as widespread as Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap (which it models in org structure). I wish that Solid could be a part of it, but that requires active developers, and currently it&#x27;s hard enough to find someone willing to make an API or native iOS app, never mind a breaking back-end change that people aren&#x27;t asking for.')
