It&#x27;s entirely possible to have much higher precision, but that precision turns out to be not what advertisers are looking for.<p>For example, take &quot;college educated high-earner&quot;. Well, there are a bunch of such types who don&#x27;t spend or making purchasing decisions like the rest of that group, and a bunch of people outside that group who behave exactly like them. How did the advertiser figure out that they <i>want</i> that group? Did they really figure out that if you aren&#x27;t meeting those criteria their ad is a waste of time? Of course not. They&#x27;re just guessing, and they don&#x27;t intend for their guess to constrain their audience.')
