All sorts of barriers exist between EU states making this extremely difficult if not impossible.<p>You&#x27;ll need a salary or other reliable income sources in the EU member state where you&#x27;re buying, banks there won&#x27;t offer you a mortgage.

You&#x27;ll only get the loan by mortgaging the property local to the bank, not the actual property you&#x27;re buying.<p>Some limited exceptions exist for popular holiday countries, but banks will make you pay for that &quot;privilege&quot;.')
