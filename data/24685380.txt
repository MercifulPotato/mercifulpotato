Instead we&#x27;re always buying a service.<p>Buying includes a very short period of trust between you and the seller, where you give them money, and they give you the product in return. Sometimes there&#x27;s also a long trust involved due to warranty, but more often than not those failed me in the past, so I stopped taking them into account when making a purchase.<p>But a service is a long term relationship between a customer and a service provider, and those ALWAYS failed me, if they existed for long enough.<p>Amazon does not sell books to Kindle, but instead provides a service of renting Kindle books. The cause of confusion here is them using a wrong term to describe what they do.')
