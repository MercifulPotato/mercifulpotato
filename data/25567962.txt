Being part of that simulation, we would never be able to prove that a reality exists outside of the system that we exists inside.<p>If there is a reality beyond the system in which we exist, it wouldn&#x27;t have to be anything like system we exist in. There is no reason to believe the system we live in is a model of the one it exists inside!?')
