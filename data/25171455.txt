Item(by='tlamponi', descendants=None, kids=[25171539, 25171498], score=None, time=1605982337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171037, text='I mean, I&#x27;m also not sure if his &quot;FUD avoidant&quot; post has the desired effect the way it is posted, but &quot;damage control and image management&quot; suggest that Debian would be a Company and a PR department doing such a thing.<p>That&#x27;s simply not the case, and the OP is right that there were many Debian Developers in 2019 and there are many other Debian Developers now.<p>Not saying that does not mean that it won&#x27;t be noticed, or just brushed over, if a prolific member decides to step down.<p>&gt; The piece was cogent, respectful, and constructive.<p>Just for clarity, I agree with that.<p>&gt; How about addressing his points?<p>Who, the OP? Even his nick name suggests affiliation with Debian, there is normally support and action of more people required to bring bigger change.<p>But yes, IMO Debian surely needs to continue to adapt or be doomed to frustrate more developers in the future.<p>Things like (from the blog post):\n&gt; I tried to contribute a threaded list archive, but our listmasters didnâ€™t seem to care or want to support the project.<p>Just seems baffling to me, he proposed to do the actual work (and with his record one could be certain that he&#x27;d follow through) of a feature where one can only win (i.e., don&#x27;t like it? Just continue to use what you like).<p>Such resentment against unproblematic changes, bringing value to some group but not taking away value from others, is tedious and demotivating.<p>But who takes up the fight to change Debian? In the end it probably needs to come from within, i.e., a sizeable part of Debian Developers need to drive and push forward, or at least reduce the barriers for those who wish to do so respectfully, without breaking what is now.')
