There’s likely some sweet spot that strikes a good balance between mitigating sickness, providing enough gravity to be useful, and being a reasonable size, and I think testing different configurations with a minimal rig where you change the diameter and rotational speed is the only way to discover it.<p>I might be wrong though. There might be compelling evidence there is no such sweet spot and that looking for one would be a waste of time.')
