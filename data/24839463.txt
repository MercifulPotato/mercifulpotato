So now for a module with sub-modules, part of it is defined in the top-level directory, and part of it is defined in a sub-directory.  Now if I want to move a module from one directory to another, I have to move two items in the file system.<p>&gt; it turns out many people like to &quot;comment out&quot; entire modules when doing big refactorings.<p>It seems to me it would be much better to have an &quot;exclude.rs&quot; file or something to opt out of a sensible default rather than forcing extra work in the common case just to support the common case.  Or else you could still allow a mod.rs if you want to be explicit about your module contents, and just assume it includes everything in the directory if it&#x27;s missing<p>&gt; There are also some interesting edge cases, for example, you can use a #[path] attribute on a module to change what the path to the file is; without a mod statement, it&#x27;s not clear where that would go.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think a design should be optimized to support interesting edge cases.  It should make the common case as simple as possible.  If edge cases need to be supported, I&#x27;m sure a solution can be found')
