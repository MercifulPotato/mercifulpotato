Despite what the name might apply, TeXmacs is not built on top of TeX. This is a good thing. It&#x27;s much less bloated (60 MB vs several GB), and compilations seem much faster. Highly extensible&#x2F;programmable with GNU Guile (hoping they&#x27;ll transition to Guile 3 train soon) + plugins. UI is better than 95% of FOSS apps.<p>LyX requires a LaTeX (or LuaTeX&#x2F;XeTeX) installation, and comes with its lot of pros and cons. Access to massive universe of *TeX packages. LyX seems more widely used.')
