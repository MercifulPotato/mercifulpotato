You know, sometimes less is more, if the game world is just about detailed enough that you can make out what things are supposed to be, you have to let the creative part of your brain do much more work to fill in the blanks, which ultimately gives the final product that your consciousness consumes a more personal note, since it&#x27;s filled with <i>your</i> fantasy. Maybe this is part of why Minecraft is so successful. Everything is so chunky and rough, you have to <i>imagine</i> what things are. And your crude buildings and creations easily fit in with the rest of the game world, there automatically is consistency in detail, so your mind accepts it.<p>I tried Unreal Editor a few years ago. The engine is really impressive, there&#x27;s a ton of assets, high res textures, it&#x27;s easy to create a natural looking terrain, but then bringing it to life is <i>hard work</i> and takes skills. Everything I built looked clunky, out of place, lacked details, lighting seemed off, it was rubbish. Minecraft fixes this problem. Everyone can build good looking stuff.')
