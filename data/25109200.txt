A good benefit of Python is that it abstracts a lower-level language into a higher-order one. So that you get some percentage of the raw speed of the lower-level language but in a &quot;easier-to-use&quot;, &quot;easier-to-reason-about&quot; and safer format.<p>On some level, it&#x27;s like complaining that C# is just using C++ modules because the CLR that interprets the C# byte-code is written in C++.<p>But it misses the point. You wrote this in <i>Python</i> and you were able to leverage the speed of a much more complicate language for your benefit. Without touching the lower language and without worrying about it&#x27;s memory-management or lib dependencies. This is a win, and it&#x27;s part of the beauty of programming!<p>Btw, my compliments to you on writing this! Really cool project&#x2F;poc.')
