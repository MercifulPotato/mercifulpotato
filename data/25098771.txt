A dog is a lot of work, which might be great if it motivates someone. And a dog is a fantastic companion, I know that this past few months would have been a lot more difficult for me without my pup. But they’re living beings, they deserve to be brought into homes where their care is assured. You don’t just “get” a dog. It’s a commitment and a lot like caring for a person. It can also be that rewarding. But a dog isn’t something you go pick up at the store on a lark to feel better.<p>As a person who’s now glad to have a pup: go <i>spend time</i> with a dog or three. Take your friends’ or neighbors’ dogs out for a while and see if you feel like the company is beneficial and if you want that responsibility. If you do, awesome! If you like the hangouts and don’t want one of your own, awesome! If it’s not for you, now you know but you tried a thing and that’s awesome too!')
