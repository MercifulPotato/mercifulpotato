So, for example, mine looks roughly like this:<p>- Fullscreen<p>- Bck&#x2F;[play|pause]&#x2F;Fwd<p>- CURRENTLY_PLAYING_SONG<p>- AirDrop<p>- ConfigMenu<p>- Emoticons<p>- (Un)Caffeinate<p>- (Dis)connectBluetoothHeadphones<p>- (Dis)connectMicrophone<p>- (Un)muteVol<p>- VolDown<p>- VolUp<p>- ScreenDim<p>- ScreenBright<p>- Date<p>- Time<p>- Weather<p>- Battery%<p>CURRENTLY_PLAYING_SONG playing shows the album cover, song name, and artist, but only shows up if there <i>IS</i> something playing. Same with AirDrop, which shows up only if there&#x27;s something that I could AirDrop <i>to</i>, and then gives me a set of options of who to AirDrop to. The Emoticon menu opens an emoticon submenu on the TouchBar with most-recently-used first.<p>That all fits fine into the main touchbar, with other dynamic touchbars available modally (ie, holding CMD shows touchable icons of all the stuff in my Dock (my Dock is entirely turned off)), CTRL shows LOCK AIRPLAY DO_NOT_DISTURB FLUX KEYBOARD_DIM&#x2F;BRIGHT, etc. ALT shows me various window snap locations.<p>Edit: BetterTouchTool also replaced a bunch of other tools for me. Gives you the same kind of tools for scripting eg Keyboard macros, Mouse macros, remote-control via iPhone&#x2F;Watch etc with a lot of reasonable defaults.')
