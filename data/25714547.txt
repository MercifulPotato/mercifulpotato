Most people don’t even have personal computers anymore, so their phone &#x2F; IPad is the only way to access the platforms.<p>* Apple doesn’t allow side loading. Google makes it less and less viable and so many necessary APIs are moved out of the open Android Sdk and into the gated Play APIs.<p>* As if to demonstrate the absolute futility of your suggestion, AWS cut off Parler‘s servers.<p>* Any site need some sort of financial API. How many times have we seen companies like Stripe, GoFundMe, Visa and MasterCard, and even large banks give in to the mob.<p>* every other required piece of the puzzle will do the same: DNS providers, CDNs, and even the large backbone ISPs. Sorry, bigot, but we’ve decided we won’t be routing your traffic through our exchange.<p>* Even power companies are privatized in the US. Sorry, just go make your own power grid, right?')
