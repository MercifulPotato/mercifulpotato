Itâ€™s a dead end for anyone but GNOME developers. Everyone sees it. GTK4 is just the latest demonstration of their incompetence and disregard for other developers.<p>Please don&#x27;t use this type of hyperbole, I&#x27;ve heard this type of thing often in various contexts, and while it may be fun to say, it&#x27;s inaccurate and it&#x27;s thoroughly unproductive in getting the actual issues solved. What you view as incompetence and disregard is more accurately described as &quot;lack of time.&quot; IIRC there are only really 2-3 people working full time on GTK, and most of their efforts are focused on getting new releases out the door. It&#x27;s not as many resources as it may seem from the outside and they don&#x27;t have time to do everything that people want. They depend on volunteer contributors to handle the long tail of issues and edge cases that come up with older applications.<p>If you&#x27;d like to improve GTK2 and GTK1 applications, please find a way to contribute and help out! I can help to point you in a direction if you want. (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really much of a big deal if older applications look weird, the main concern with them is usually that they don&#x27;t break. From this angle, GTK1 and GTK2 apps are not being left behind, they work perfectly fine even on a modern system) I&#x27;ll warn you though, it&#x27;s not trivial to get a legacy app to look and act native on a modern platform. If you really want to do a good job at it, you have to manually redesign each of the apps individually and it gets time-consuming.<p>I personally think it would be great if XFCE&#x2F;Mate&#x2F;Budgie&#x2F;Cinnamon&#x2F;etc had the resources to pay more full time developers to contribute upstream and collaborate more with the GNOME people, but we are not there yet unfortunately.')
