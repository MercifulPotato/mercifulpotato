Both borders were closed (with exceptions) at various times to contain outbreaks to one state. If we loosen up the definition of country then these are Western countries that aren&#x27;t island nations with zero covid.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t also be noted that the borders don&#x27;t have to be hermetically sealed. As long as cross border contamination is minimized other tools (contact tracing) can deal with it.')
