Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re writing a web app, and you want to stick with the JVM. Pull up with Web App Framework Benchmarks, narrow it down to Java, Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure. Let me know when you have stopped scrolling, cause it takes a while before you see the first Clojure framework.<p>Unfortunately, web apps are probably the thing that Clojure does best, and Clojure is already plenty slow there. Try it out for something typically throughput intensive (like mathematical programming or machine learning), or short lived (like CLI apps), and you&#x27;ll give up almost immediately.')
