I&#x27;ve used WireGuard daily for work since lockdown and I used it daily for personal use, while commuting to work before lockdown. In all of that time, I&#x27;ve never had a single issue due to WireGuard (and there isn&#x27;t even a Linux app to be seen). The expectation is often different between Linux and Apple users though.<p>When I was setting up for the first time, Jason even found time to help me himself on the IRC channel, something I&#x27;ve never expected, and for which I am eternally grateful.<p>I made a donation to WireGuard last year, I&#x27;ll be doing the same this year and I encourage others to &quot;put their money where their mouth is&quot; and show a little support for the people making and sharing this software for free. I expect an Apple user can afford a small cut of their or their employer&#x27;s money to do so.')
