We also have blazing fast &amp; stable FTTH for $50&#x2F;month, some of the cleanest and tastiest water I&#x27;ve ever put in my mouth (which comes from our well), and our food is of excellent quality because there are many local small farmers who are ethical and stable. There is just enough work in the way of tech businesses a short drive away to make this life style possible.<p>Maybe a change of scenery is in order for you. I can&#x27;t imaging living in a hellscape like San Fran. I&#x27;m in a veritable paradise as far as I can tell. There are problems, but we are working on them, and we generally have the freedom to do so on our own terms without nanny government holding our hand.')
