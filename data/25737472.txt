What GG said and his real positions don&#x27;t matter. What matters is he bucked the narrative (mostly when he pushed against the propaganda push that the HB laptop leak was of Russian origin) and that made him bad, and then the justifications for his &quot;bad&quot; label were found afterwards. They don&#x27;t hold up to scrutiny but the character assassination is done already.<p>In his own words:<p>“I don’t think that the emails — so far — reveal a huge scandal. They so far just establish standard sleaze and DC corruption. The huge scandal to me is the blatant rank-closing and cone of silence — a prohibition — erected <i>by journalists</i> around this story to defend Biden,”<p>“Is there a single journalist willing to say with a straight face they believe the emails relating to the Bidens are either fabricated or otherwise fraudulently altered, but the Bidens just aren’t saying so?,”<p>“When you report a huge archive, there’s no way to prove the negative that none of it is altered. You investigate &amp; confirm as much as you can, then use your journalistic judgment. The only way you get confirmation is when the subjects of the reporting don’t deny the authenticity,”<p>“You know the subjects of the reporting will immediately claim they’re fake <i>if the are</i>. Of course they will: that would kill the reporting!”<p>“There’s a reason the Bidens aren’t claiming they’re fake,”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;</a>')
