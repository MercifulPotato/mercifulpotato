Over the years I&#x27;ve freaked out several times because I googled some symptoms I had and of course was presented with a slew of SEO-optimized articles that associate them with serious diseases. The thing is, those articles are mostly written by marketing folks that rephrase stuff from Wikipedia or medical literature, but without knowing anything about the conditions they write about. The sole purpose of these articles is to increase the page rank of a website and generate page views that can be monetized. Of course it&#x27;s like that with almost every topic on the Internet, it&#x27;s still highly unethical though as it incites unwarranted, existential fears in people.<p>Presenting medical trials and statistics to an uninitiated reader will probably also cause more harm than benefit, so it&#x27;s good he canned this idea.')
