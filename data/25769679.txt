We ignored that.<p>Countries that have eliminated the virus have ignored this for good results. Some like us here in Melbourne have used lockdowns to eliminate the virus, others like New Zealand have used them as a first resort to contain outbreaks. Because we eliminated it we&#x27;re now back to (mostly) normal, we don&#x27;t have young people sacrificing anything, we have kids in school, we have large sporting events and it&#x27;s not coming at the cost of everyone&#x27;s lives. Despite WHO advice most countries that eliminated it have also kept borders mostly shut.<p>Ireland is a tragedy because the were so close to elimination but never took those final steps to eliminate it and keep it out. The worlds tragedy is that they gave up on elimination, it would have been much cheaper and less impactful than rolling lockdowns.')
