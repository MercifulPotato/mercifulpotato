Messy handwriting, crammed layout and too many steps at once all contributed, but I also just made many mistakes.<p>It felt impoosible to fix and didn&#x27;t seem worth it since the understanding was what I valued. But since I never felt confident in my results - checking the answer was always suspenseful - my mathematics was useless, to actually use, without an answer to check.<p>So I decided to methodically notice where I made errors, and to verify those particular places. &quot;It might take me twice as long&quot;, I thought, &quot;But at least I&#x27;ll have the <i>skill</i> to do it, when needed, and be able to have results I can actually <i>use</i>!&quot;<p>So I began this, and it did take twice as long, and it worked. That sense of suspense started to disappear, because knew I had the correct answer. I became more skilled at checking, so it look less time. And then a very strange thing started to happen...<p>I started to make those mistakes less often. I became attentive to them as I was making them. Then stopped making them. I didn&#x27;t antipicate or account for this at all... I thought it was impossible for me to change - it was like magic.<p>In hindsight, this was &quot;deliberate practice&quot;, with the key quality of not just repetitive practice (which eventually plateaus), but practice focussing on appropriate aspects, changing as needed.<p>An expert coach really helps here, both for identfying issues and psychological encouragement. Although I managed this particular one on my own, it was hard. But finding such a coach seems even more difficult! And I&#x27;m so obstinate, I&#x27;m not sure I would pay attention anyway...')
