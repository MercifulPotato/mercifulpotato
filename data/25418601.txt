Many software developers spend that on education at a university along with 4 years of their time. That education may get you started, then your experience takes over as the most important item on your future job searches. That first gig may have a huge effect on your future options (getting lucky with a high impact position with Google vs low impact at no name.) The more impressive your education, the better leverage you have to land that good first gig. In this case, spending far more than 30K on your education likely pays off huge. You didn&#x27;t need to spend that, but you made a bet which increased your chances.<p>Spending 30K on a bootcamp may not have the same dramatic impact on your chances, but if it pushes you to focus on knocking out a curriculum and ends with multiple offers, then you could quickly recoup that money versus the alternative route. That alternative might be that you have less focus, requiring longer to gain the same skills and you need more time for a job search. That job search might end with a lesser paying job than Lambda may have lined up for you.<p>And paying for courses is a thing. Amy Hoy&#x27;s 30 x 500 is $2000. I ran into an interesting copywriting course the other day which costs the same. Tiago Forte of Building a Second Brain has bundles which run in that range. It&#x27;s reasonable that a program which runs 6+ months could cost 30K. You don&#x27;t need any of these courses to learn the content, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the correct mindset. What will be the return on these courses? Will they help you speed up your alternative timeline? Will they help push you accomplish something you would otherwise flounder on? How long would most people take to create and follow a full time curriculum for landing that first programming gig? I bet most would give up before finishing. If the program gives you a better chance at finishing, then that&#x27;s worth a lot.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m sure I would change my mind if I were to dish out 30K for a 6 month program and then the next week turned into a dumpster fire of courses. It&#x27;s one thing to write about how you should stick to the program. It&#x27;s quite another to pull out your card to pay 30K and then get hit with a feeling of heavy disappointment with the course material.')
