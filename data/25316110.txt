(This is physics, not software engineering.)  The opposite of &quot;local&quot; in this case is &quot;non-local&quot;, which refers to state that propagates faster than the speed of light.  Bell&#x27;s theorem shows that describing reality <i>requires</i> some kind of non-local state.  In the case of both Copenhagen and Bohm, that non-local state resides in the wave function.  But here&#x27;s the thing: you cannot know the state of the wave function because of the no-cloning theorem.  The best you can do is prepare sub-systems in known states.  So QM really is different.  You cannot predict the outcome of a quantum experiment even in principle and even with arbitrarily advanced technology.')
