They could have other wealth or means, and losing the entire investment would not be catastrophic. They might have a personal runway of several years before they have to give up and get a day job.<p>Meanwhile, the early employee at a startup is far from without risk themselves. They are almost certainly not well paid (until the last decade of multi-Billion-dollar Unicorns, startups were NEVER known to pay well). They are also likely not making meaningful savings or even eating into them in the hope of hitting it big.  They are almost certainly sacrificing a substantial part of their personal life just as the founder is, risking personal relationships and health.')
