We’re hiring for a number of roles, like Product Security Engineer, Engineering Manager, and Senior Software Engineer, ML. Our goal is to make access to primary care as easy as googling something, without needing to make a financial tradeoff. We were seeing exciting growth before COVID-19 and that growth has accelerated even more as we help support the response to this global pandemic in the US. Some quick mentions of the technology we’re using: all our infra is in AWS, IaC using CDK (and some Terraform), Typescript, Kotlin, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL. We are usually ONSITE in the office. During Covid, we are fully remote. Looking forward to hearing from you!<p>Recent press about our team:\n* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestreet.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;walmart-sams-club-teams-up-with-telehealth-startup-98point6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestreet.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;walmart-sams-club-teams-...</a>\n* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sams-club-partners-seattle-startup-98point6-offer-customers-telehealth-service&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sams-club-partners-seattle-sta...</a>')
