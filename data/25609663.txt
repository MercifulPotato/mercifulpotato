It is overwhelmingly likely that they will use the money to produce more masks.<p>How are the mask manufacturers going to get more money if they can&#x27;t charge an exorbitant markup? They need to buy new plant&#x2F; materials and hire new people. Is the plan that the mask manufacturers have to go deeply in to debt to create enough masks? That is the best I can think of without sharp price rises, and it is a terrible plan for encouraging people to produce more masks.')
