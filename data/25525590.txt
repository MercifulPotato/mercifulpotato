The game had a storyline that was so good it felt at times like it wasn&#x27;t a computer game but a novel that you happened to be able to play.<p>The authors don&#x27;t shy away from the big questions, like: are humans really capable of governing themselves in a world of computers? Is technological progress worth sacrificing for social stability?<p>Though there are plenty of outlandish elements to it (secret societies, conspiracies etc) some parts of the game even seem oddly prescient today. There was civil strife, powerful AIs, income inequality - there was even a plague called the Grey Death and a limited supply of medicine that people were fighting over.<p>What video games got you thinking about society this year?')
