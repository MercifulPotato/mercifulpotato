If they&#x27;re not going to comply with a search warrant why would they stop using encryption? The logic makes no sense. The only people this law will affect are law abiding citizens.<p>I&#x27;m not willing to give up my privacy just because other people are committing crime and the cops can&#x27;t figure how to do their job.
