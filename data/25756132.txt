Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610497276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25755507, text='&gt; Yeah - so you should probably go to a political rally or concert or a nightclub or something!!!<p>I don&#x27;t recall saying that.<p>&gt; If you have a loss of smell&#x2F;taste you should 100% assume you have Covid and act accordingly, get tested immediately, self quarantine for probably 14 whole days, and get retested at around 10 days.<p>Did I say otherwise?<p>What I said was, if you lose your sense of smell and taste and then proceed to test negative twice for COVID, you may well not have COVID.<p>Rapid tests are right 80% of the time. Two rapid tests back to back are right 96% of the time. That means after 2 tests there&#x27;s a 96% chance you don&#x27;t have COVID, and a 4% chance you do. That doesn&#x27;t mean you should tour your nearest retirement community.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t go out anywhere if you&#x27;re sick in the first place.<p>[edit] Even then, there&#x27;s a 1% false positive rate on PCR, and a 4% false negative rate on 2x rapid test. Even at this point there&#x27;s a 20% chance OP doesn&#x27;t have COVID.')
