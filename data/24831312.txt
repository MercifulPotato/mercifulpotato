You are mistaken.  There are places where it&#x27;s the right answer, or at least a very good one - the best definition I&#x27;ve seen is when your program looks like a pipe.<p>And there are places where FP is the wrong answer - where your program has state, and there are multiple parts to the state, <i>and those parts have to be kept in sync with each other</i>.  At that point, bundling the data to the functions is warranted, because it limits the number of functions that can put the data in an inconsistent state.<p>And if you&#x27;re going to say &quot;don&#x27;t structure the data that way&quot;, well, there are times when that&#x27;s the nature of the <i>problem</i>, not just the nature of the program to solve the problem.')
