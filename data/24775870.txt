Item(by='kgwgk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602679518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24772436, text='&gt; In Quantum Mechanics things travel as waves and interact as particles. Between interactions, everything is described by the Schrodinger Wave Function, which evolves to include every possible path. But at the point of an interaction the wave function must collapse to satisfy conservation rules.<p>That would make some sense if by interaction you mean &quot;interaction with the macroscopic environment&quot;. When small-enough quantum systems (like two particles) interact there is no collapse and the evolution is unitary.<p>&gt; This interaction is enough to &#x27;collapse the wave function&#x27;. No &#x27;observation&#x27; is required.<p>How do you distinguish the interactions that &#x27;collapse the wave function&#x27; from those who do not?')
