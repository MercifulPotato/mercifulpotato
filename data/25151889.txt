The second cable, before it failed, had actually been looked at, and it had been thought that it wasn&#x27;t at risk of failure. So its failure meant that the structure was in more dire straits than previously thought.<p>When highly-stressed cables under tension fail, the resulting damage can be extremely violent. The decision is to safely dismantle the instrument platform rather than risk yet another cable failing and causing less localized damage.')
