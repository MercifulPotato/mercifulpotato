When I saw the app and that it offers in-app purchases, I thought something minimal would be possible without a purchase. But after downloading and launching it, I see the prompt to buy the subscription or the one time purchase, and nothing more. The app description on the store doesn’t make this — that a purchase must be made to use it — clear either.<p>Edit: An observation I’ve had is that third party camera apps on iOS have a niche audience because they cannot be the default app. If you swipe left on the Lock Screen or tap on the camera icon on the Lock Screen, only Apple’s stock camera will open. I hope Apple adds more app types to have defaults set to third party apps. I know Apple cares about camera launch time and how quickly photos can be taken. There could be a minimum performance threshold set for that. It’s high time!')
