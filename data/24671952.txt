Touch the fingerprint reader to continue&quot;<p>But in the real world the cheapest options have zero flash, zero display, just a push button and an LED. The LED flashes to indicate that you&#x27;re being asked to press the button, your pressing it means you signify that you&#x27;re present. All the data is still sent to them, but they can&#x27;t display it, you have to trust your browser to validate what was sent.<p><i>This means it&#x27;s unsafe to &quot;press the button&quot; when plugged into a general purpose computer unless prompted by an application you trust with your credentials, like a web browser you&#x27;re using to sign in to sites</i><p>If the authenticator has no storage it can only really act as a Second Factor this way. But a device with storage can replace all steps of logging in if you want. No need to enter a password, an email address, anything, just one tap to get in. Apple is promoting this for the new iOS. A current Yubikey does have storage, and so it can do this, but the storage is very limited, unlike an iPhone with gigabytes of Flash memory.')
