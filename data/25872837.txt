Agree that generally simpler is better, and microcontrollers are simpler than Linux SoCs for many things (maybe not in getting from zero to main(), but after that).<p>I would add that it really depends on the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, though. Microcontrollers are disadvantaged compared to Linux SoCs for many workloads other than low power and low latency (i.e. hard and soft realtime).')
