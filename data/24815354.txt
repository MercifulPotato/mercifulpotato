Since the logic is coded by application engineer, it&#x27;s usually hard to get this data wrong. These data are then ETL-ed (or EL-ed) over to a DW, as described by the article.<p>For behavioural data, this is where your statement will most apply to. This is where tools like Snowplow, Posthog, Segment, etc come in to set up the proper <i>event data</i> collection engine. This is also where it&#x27;s important to &quot;collect data properly&quot;, as these kinds of event data changes structure fast, and hard to keep track over time. I&#x27;d admit this space (data collection management) is still nascent, with only tools like iterative.ly on the market.')
