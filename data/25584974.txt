I know a number of people that have committed suicide during the lock downs.<p>It is becoming a political topic, which is always risky to weigh in on publicly, but I do implore people to keep in mind when deciding on policy the law of unintended consequences.  Everything in life is a series of trade offs, including the decision to lock down.  Even if you believe the lock downs have been effective, they cause real damage and disruption to people&#x27;s lives and mental health.  It is serious and needs to be considered and weighed.<p>What we have is a variation on the trolley problem, not a simple &quot;save people with lock downs or not.&quot;  I have no idea where the right balance is, but I&#x27;ve been shocked and saddened at the unwillingness of pro-lock-down people to consider the unintended consequences here.  I have plenty of criticism for the anti mask crowd too, but this comment is already long enough.<p>[1]: I have no scientific data to back this claim up.  This is my opinion extrapolated from anecdata.  Take with a grain of salt')
