Item(by='handedness', descendants=None, kids=[25462093], score=None, time=1608248786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459434, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve chatted with an Amazon rep on the issue, and to their credit they seemed to take it seriously and &quot;noted the report violation against the seller&quot;<p>I was deliberately scammed by a seller, and the wave of bad reviews they received after I purchased made me think I was not the only one with whom they dealt dishonestly. I contacted Amazon and received a similar reaction the author of the article received, except they were even more explicit in telling me they were going to shut the seller down over it. They seemed to take it very seriously, but I was still skeptical anything would come of it.<p>That was months ago, the seller is still around, and is still getting terrible reviews.<p>Amazon has come a long way on a lot of fronts, but in terms of being customer-focused they are so much worse than they used to be.<p>Edit: I also ordered something that died during the warranty period. Manufacturer&#x2F;seller (one in the same) was utterly worthless. Wouldn&#x27;t respond to a single inquiry. They released a revised version, emailed their customer list, and I responded saying I&#x27;d buy it if they hadn&#x27;t already demonstrated that they were so dishonest.<p>They asked me to place a paid order on the new model, email them the receipt and the link to my 5-star review, and insisted they would directly PayPal me my purchase price afterwards. (Of the new, less expensive version. Not the original I paid ~2x for.) They also refused to honor their warranty and send me another one, or even just mail me the cheaper replacement model as a compromise. They just had to get a 5-star review out of the whole deal.<p>I put all this into a review and it was promptly deleted by Amazon.<p>At this point, I consider 4-star reviews the new 1-star.<p>I have a few more stories like this from the last year or so. I used to be a very vocal supporter of them, but I&#x27;m increasingly developing a visceral hatred for them.')
