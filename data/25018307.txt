What has been tough for me personally, though, is to see a person as amoral as Trump get so much support. I DO agree that Trump has done some good things, things that before him neither the left nor the right was willing to do in a substantial way (mainly his forcing a re-evaluation of our relationship with China). But his utter (and ongoing) disregard for our democratic system, his incessant lying, the fact that all he cares about is loyalty to him but gives no loyalty in return, the insane narcissism, treating the Justice Dept. like his personal legal firm, etc., etc.. I just find it disgusting on every level.<p>That said, the recent Sam Harris podcast really helped me understand his appeal. And I hope (but am not hopeful) that the left tries to mend their ways by refraining from pushing (mainly white, straight men, but also others, like the religious) many further from the Democratic party.')
