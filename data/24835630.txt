There seems to be a strong (legislative? legal? political?) aversion to easily replaceable overhead wires. Underground cable is the strong preference here. At the moment I live in the city centre of Manchester (the second or third biggest city depending on who you ask) and am stuck with VDSL.<p>There are other problems as well - arguably there is no functional market for internet here. The UK is quite a small and centralised but for whatever reason cannot deliver infrastructure to &quot;rural&quot; areas that are only 50 or so miles from the largest cities in the UK, e.g. Wales.<p>I have co-workers who have moved into <i>new</i> <i>builds</i> with only copper to the building.')
