The S was particularly bad, though that is maybe not  surprising since it was one of the first 50k cars the company built, but the 3 has had its share of issues as well.<p>But the thing is, I&#x27;ve never had any issues that rendered the car undriveable or unsafe, and service has always been a joy to work with. Every problem I&#x27;ve encountered has been addressed quickly and effectively with no hassle or charge. So, I&#x27;m willing to forgive some of the rough edges, and I suspect this is why they get such good customer satisfaction ratings despite the relatively high number of issues.')
