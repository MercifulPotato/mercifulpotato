It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if the hype they&#x27;ve built will last all the way through to then.\nSecond, I fully agree with you that opening the app up is actually problematic for them. It&#x27;s almost like the opposite of the network effect, where I think having more people on the platform is going to potentially make the quality deteriorate. Right now, it feels authentic but somewhat curated (i.e. we have moderators who invite high-profile and very interesting panelists on to speak) - I&#x27;m not sure that will be maintained when it becomes a free-for-all.')
