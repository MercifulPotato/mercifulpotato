That is, when the depth is smaller than 1&#x2F;20 the wavelength we have to start taking into account the effect of the seabed which makes the dispersion relation of waves non-linear and brings entirely new physics. Of course that 1&#x2F;20 is not a magic number just a rough figure when the effects of the seabed start to be noticeable.<p>Unfortunately, we are still off by several orders of magnitude so I would think the effect you describe is unlikely.')
