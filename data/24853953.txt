I know that editors like vim and emacs let you keep your hands on the keyboard, but interacting with anything else requires the mouse&#x2F;touchpad.<p>At least 10 years ago, I imagined that the mouse could be replaced with something like a brainwave reader. You can train your brain to emit simple patterns that can be picked up either with a headband or remotely. It would take individual training, but with a few basic patterns, one should be able to do mouse movement and clicks. The eye tracking seems like the next best thing, especially since it is already implemented.')
