I&#x27;ve been following this vaccine since February when it was created. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modernatx.com&#x2F;modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modernatx.com&#x2F;modernas-work-potential-vaccine-ag...</a> It&#x27;s a little frustrating knowing this cure was out there so long and some of the pain from pandemic could have been reduced only if we had faster testing. IMO we needed a faster pandemic vaccine protocol.<p>I strongly feel that the FDA should have used challenge trials where they deliberately infect healthy people with the virus after vaccinating them. The approach the FDA chose to use was maybe easier ethically for them to swallow where they just let people in experiment get sick naturally in their every day lives. Using challenge trials we would have gotten these results back weeks faster and with less error bars. Weeks with COVID-19 cost 10,000 of lives.<p>The FDA still has not approved this vaccine. Everyday that the FDA does not approve this vaccine after results like this is SOME blood on the hands of the FDA.')
