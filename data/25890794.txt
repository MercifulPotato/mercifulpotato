However 12 years later, it has turned out to be untrue. Also, China was a big buyer of treasuries in 2008 as opposed to now..<p>Today, The fed essentially is buying its own debt through Blackrock (which I didn’t see the article mention)<p>Bottom line is the idea of how much a gov can borrow is hand wavy and arcane because ultimately the currency is backed by pure faith. the US Dollar will cease to have value when people stop taking it.<p>Maybe it’s not studied more because It’s better to stop the things that will lead to that devastating point before it happens and things like buying up your own debt and handing out checks that don’t cause any economic production cause that faith to be pushed further and further to that limit.')
