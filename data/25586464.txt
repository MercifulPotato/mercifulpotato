Item(by='zachrose', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609364335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571285, text='Elm is a purely functional language, meaning all you write are the insides of functions that take a value and return a value. There&#x27;s no imperative way to &quot;do anything&quot; like make an HTTP request, all you can do is return a &quot;command&quot; value from a function and the core libraries will do it.<p>This means that the core libraries define the signatures of the functions that an Elm application must implement. (All Elm apps &quot;work the same way&quot; in that sense.) It also means that you never have to mock or stub anything in a test. There are also great implications for performance and maintainability.<p>Elm compiles to JavaScript and is specific to browser applications, but there&#x27;s no theoretical reason the same idea couldn&#x27;t be applied to mobile apps or CLI applications or webservers or anything else. (It&#x27;s just a lot of work.)')
