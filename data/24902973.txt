If you&#x27;re still employed by Oracle, it might not be a bad idea to disclose that, either in the specific comments where you may be talking (semi-)authoritatively about Java and its licensing &#x2F; commercial model, or within your HN profile. I recall the last talk I saw from you was an AMA at QCon London in 2019 about Java, where you were with Oracle.<p>I found the comments really clueful but also appreciate when others like e.g. @_msw_ are very overt with disclosure of their employment and interests whilst talking about $employer&#x27;s stuff on HN (and in his case that&#x27;d be AWS and EC2).')
