No doctor wanted to listen and no hospitals would test me even after I begged some of the best providers in the region. It wasn&#x27;t until almost 9 months later that the mistake was acknowledged, and it&#x27;s highly likely that community spread existed even in the US in November 2019 or even October 2019 just based on retrospective serology studies.<p>Places with poor hygiene controls like India have likely had far, far more infections than anyone even can imagine. That might be one of the first places to be immune.')
