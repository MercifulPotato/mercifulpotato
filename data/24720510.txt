See Jonathan Haidt for more information on political bias in the humanities. On such a politically charged issue they are not to be trusted and are a corrupted group of individuals. This is exactly why we need a politically balanced team to do any vetting on a platform like Facebook.<p>Also, to say that protesting in support of a Robert E Lee statue is not showing support for Lee is prima facie absurd.')
