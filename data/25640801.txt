I don&#x27;t actually need anything special because I habitually sit on the front half of the chair and don&#x27;t rest my back against the back. So I just got one of the low-tier Steelcase chairs we have at the office and it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;ll last, and it&#x27;s just... fine.<p>I tried sitting on a yoga ball for a while, but realized that it&#x27;s not doing anything more for my back (because of how I already sit), but it&#x27;s difficult to turn between my three laptops because the ball sticks to the floor and my clothes. So I went back to the chair. &lt;shrug&gt;')
