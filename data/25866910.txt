The excerpt mentions &quot;good taste&quot;.. well plenty of people don&#x27;t have good taste, so while saying we don&#x27;t use A&#x2F;B tests because we have good taste, I think its likely a combination of good taste and leadership in the company that allows the good taste to drive the decisions and some level of agreement among a group of leaders of what &quot;good taste&quot; is..')
