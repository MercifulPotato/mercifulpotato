But if someone is going to use linux or not use it at all based just on how it looks then they don&#x27;t need linux and can use a regular desktop os just fine. Linux is important because of how it is used technically to build software systems and that it is open source. If you start bringing on users that don&#x27;t have that interest then then it is just another web&#x2F;chrome platform waiting to be commercialized and have it&#x27;s true purpose undermined. Take Canonical to the extreme. Not everything needs to try to grab the attention of random person off the street.')
