Item(by='troughway', descendants=None, kids=[25102297], score=None, time=1605454461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100397, text='I&#x27;m looking at Blazor&#x2F;wasm nowadays and it&#x27;s causing me an awful lot of nostalgia when I think back to the early days of Rails (if &#x27;08 can be called early days per-se), because of the shit show back then with various tech stacks and the grunt work required to get a site up with some DB backed data source and whatnot.<p>And I feel like today we are back to some kind of a point of having to shoehorn FE&#x2F;BE tech together unless we use some isomorphic approach which, predominantly, forces the use of JS.<p>And I remember DHH commenting on this regarding Java and saying something to the tune of &quot;Why would I write Java when Ruby is so much better?&quot;. Back then I thought such a statement was too indignant, like someone getting on their high horse about a particular kind of building material that is better above all else. But nowadays, I see the wisdom behind it all the same.<p>I just want simple bloody tech that treats the browser as a layout and input handling engine and lets me write code in any language I see fit, whether it&#x27;s Ruby, F#, C#, Clojure, whatever. I&#x27;m hoping Blazor or something like it can deliver on that vision.')
