Who&#x27;s fault is it really, when banks give out loans to young adults with no credit history to get an unknown degree at an unknown total cost? We punish young adults for making a poor decision, but we don&#x27;t punish banks for giving out loans that don&#x27;t have collateral. Seems unfair, no?<p>And that&#x27;s the problem. It&#x27;s a risk free proposition for lenders - students can&#x27;t default, the interest rates are high. But by allowing bankruptcy, then all the risk falls on the banks. Student loans essentially shouldn&#x27;t exist, and only do because of the demand for college, which leads into the second problem:<p>There aren&#x27;t good alternatives to college in the west.')
