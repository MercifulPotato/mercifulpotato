It&#x27;s an attractive page, and bonus that it&#x27;s literally <i>a</i> page that you only have to click to get other soundscapes, or to see the credits.<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted a super-lightweight app like this. I wear hearing aids, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to pipe sounds like this through them when I&#x27;m out wandering about but not interested in talking to others (a very common thing to do in these Covid times). Sounds like this do an awesome job of masking tinnitus, which is something I and other HOH folks contend with fairly regularly.<p>Of course the batteries don&#x27;t need to be contending with graphics and what not when used in this &quot;background&quot; mode, and would need to be phone aware so it can mute when necessary.')
