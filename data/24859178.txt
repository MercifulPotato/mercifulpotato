Things that are mainly conceptual, that build on previous concepts, don&#x27;t benefit from spaced repetition at all.<p>With math, the hard part is the conceptual understanding. But once you understand a concept, you understand it. You don&#x27;t really need to review it again.<p>This is why the part of the article that lists what spaced repetition works well on is all factual&#x2F;associative -- vocabulary, trivia, medical terminology, etc.<p>Spaced repetition is for simple associative facts -- &quot;x is y&quot; -- not conceptual things.<p>For whatever reason, once we&#x27;ve understood a <i>concept</i>, it seems to be part of our thinking forever. But of course the hard part is understanding it. Some people struggle for days, weeks, or even years in school to truly understand things like derivatives, or pointers, or trigonometry. Spaced repetition does nothing for that.')
