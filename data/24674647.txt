I, like a good number of other people, run an Apple TV, which has some ads, but nearly like Samsung (usually ads for content).<p>Does Samsung perform content fingerprinting on streams not played via the Samsung software (i.e. Apple TV content coming over HDMI)? Does the fingerprinting continue to work if you run your audio through a receiver and send no audio signal the TV?<p>I’m looking for ways to allow me to use my non-commercial Samsung TV (a nicer QLED TV from 2017) without having it spy on me. It’s on a VLAN that doesn’t allow outbound connections on my home network, but, honestly, I don’t trust Samsung.')
