The valuation model is to try to determine what X% of the global demand for store of value assets might shift towards Bitcoin in the long run. Probably nowhere close to the level of a fiat currency market or the gold market, but perhaps much higher % than it is today.<p>Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash - attempting to make crypto transactions common. Higher capacity, faster transaction processing. The valuation model is X% of casual transactions. X is probably never going to be an appreciable percentage compared to big transaction platforms like Visa or Mastercard, but it may grow steadily and find niche areas where the ability to quickly transact in a cryptocurrency is highly valued. This is likely to remain correlated to cryptocurrencies that act as a store of value because one main area for demand of casual cryptocurrency transactions will be hedging risk of fiat currencies. Eg if I live in a region with government currency instability, I’ll want to decouple my cash asset values from that government risk, and look to a platform where I can still buy toilet paper or bread without hyperinflation.<p>Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos - network effects and ecosystems of smart contracts. The valuation model is like an app store mixed with a cloud vendor. Much harder to state a clear valuation model, likely very volatile due to perceptions of “killer apps” and how much staying power they would really have, as well as the interplay with regulators.')
