Half a year later it was shown to be thoroughly broken because the server could provide shit entropy to the client which it for some godforsaken reason used to generate the encryption keys.<p>So, yes. He (or any of the other 6 world champion coders that were bragged about) designed a broken protocol. Broken, as in &quot;trivial access to the plain text by the server&quot;, which is pretty damn awful.<p>When people say that telegram rolled their own crypto that mean that they chose weird crypto primitives, weird key handling and generation and combined them in a way that made people go &quot;whoa! That looks weird&quot; and defended it by refering to their own world championship victories, by extension saying that people were to stupid to understand.<p>And 6 months later their protocol was shown to be broken.<p>Use telegram all you like. Don&#x27;t say that their encryption is even close to being the gold standard.')
