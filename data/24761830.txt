Engineered to endure the abuse of Freeride, Downhill and Enduro, the EFFIGEAR&#x27;s Gearbox can also be used for other diciplines.<p>The result is a simple, reliable, compact and light weighted gearbox.<p>Its strengths:<p>o Instant and smooth shifting of gears in any situation.<p>o Shifting of gears under load, without pedaling, or even stopped.<p>o Reliability of the transmission.<p>o Low Maintenance.<p>o Low Centralized Mass: unsprung weight is reduced for more stable, manuverable ride, and increased suspension responsiveness.<p>o Bottom bracket and swingarm bearings integrated.<p>o Drastically increased ground clearance.<p>o Free wheel integrated with 48 engagement points per rotation.&quot;')
