You shouldn&#x27;t routinely be working a ton of nights and weekends. But sometimes shit hits the fan at inconvenient hours and you need to respond. If not, you have to have routine 24&#x2F;7 coverage which gets really expensive really fast ultimately leading to lower salaries for developers.<p>The not-uncommon answer to this is an oncall rotation, where you are paid at some fraction of your full-time salary, to respond to such problems.<p>The fraction likely works out better than &#x27;overtime&#x27; pay, as it&#x27;s for all the time you are oncall, not just when some issue occurs.')
