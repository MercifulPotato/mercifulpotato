Gibson pretty much nailed the petty, pedestrian uses.  It&#x27;s just that most people only remember the glamorous parts of his books.<p>Here&#x27;s how Gibson described a seedy ghetto bar frequented by one of the protagonists, Bobby Newmark, the eponymous Count Zero:<p><i>&quot;People paid to get into the place because Leon pirated kino and simstim off cable and ran a lot of stuff that Barrytowners couldn&#x27;t otherwise afford to access. There was dealing in the back and you could make &quot;donations&quot; for drinks, mostly clean Ohio hooch cut with some synthetic orange drink Leon scored in industrial quantities...&quot;</i><p>The failed heist that much of the book revolves around was Count Zero&#x27;s own attempt to steal some of that &quot;soft kino porn&quot;.<p>Can&#x27;t get much more pedestrian than that.<p>In another part of the book, a &quot;sorcerer&quot; explains to Bobby why he uses a critical technology in the book, in terms Bobby can understand:<p>Vodou, he says, <i>&quot;isn&#x27;t concerned with notions of salvation and transcendence.

Some duster chops out your sister, you don&#x27;t go camp on the Yakuza&#x27;s doorstep, do you? No way. You go to somebody, though, who can get the thing done. Right?&quot;</i>')
