Yes I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of naive fools in the mix, it still is the stock market after all. But the complaint here isn&#x27;t that a bunch of misinformed people thought they&#x27;d be millionaires-- it&#x27;s that a bunch of people made a conscious decision to invest and now brokerages are manipulating the markets. Ironically some of them justify it as being BECAUSE &#x27;retail investors don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing&#x27;. There&#x27;s a lot of condescension towards retail traders, which is weird when 12 years ago the &#x27;smart&#x27; institutional investors and hedge funds managed to  crash the global economy. Looking at the whole picture, I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s so ridiculous that people get a piece of the action when the majority are acknowledging they might not make any money at all on this')
