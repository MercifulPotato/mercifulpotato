This means you have to relaunch the game, get through to the main menu, then load your game. So at 3-5 minutes each time, that&#x27;s an hour of my playtime just recovering from crashes.<p>Maybe 4-5 times I&#x27;ve run into a bug where my character can&#x27;t move and I have to load a save, or the person I&#x27;m supposed to talk to or follow in a quest won&#x27;t move onto the next action. This takes 5+ minutes to figure out that it&#x27;s not going to happen and I need to reload.<p>A lot of the time it&#x27;s clear that the game has a lot of things queued for loading and it&#x27;s trying to catch up. You have to wait 30 seconds or so for it to load everything before you can trigger then next event. These are also the moments that usually trigger the crashes.<p>&gt; Playing on Series X fwiw.<p>Most of the comments I&#x27;ve read that share your opinion, the person is inevitably playing on the pro version of the console. It feels really like they built the game for high end machines, and then did everything they could to get it working on the lower end machines. I don&#x27;t know what the equivalent of building a &#x27;mobile-first&#x27; website is in game development or if it&#x27;s possible, but they clearly didn&#x27;t do that.<p>But I&#x27;m pretty patient and forgiving of bugs, so I&#x27;ve still been enjoying the game despite the issues.')
