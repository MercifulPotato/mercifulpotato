But appreciation for being outdoors comes in different flavours. In Sweden I think many children have been imprinted to appreciate friluftsliv through Skogsmulle, a kind of fairy tale cartoon character, usually an adult dressed up and taking small hikes with children in a nearby forest. While there, teaching kids to not throw trash in nature, about Allemansr√§tten and its freedoms and responsibilities.<p>Another could be the emphasis to learn many types of flower and tree species in biology in school. When I went to school I found that boring and useless but have later realized it being part of building a closer familiarity with the outdoors. Like ancestry in some ways.\nPerhaps the HN crowd could enlighten on this. I have heard that there is not as much emphasis on this abroad.<p>A third example, the focus on Orienteering as a sport in school. When I went to school, it was certainly the most emphasised of all the types of sports we learned and practised in gym class. The only one that got it&#x27;s own day  regularily. I think it was once a semester, reliable as clockwork.')
