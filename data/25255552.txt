And with that assumption, having no limitations on filenames or extensions actually made perfect sense.<p>And BTW, that &quot;.lbm&quot; extension should actually be &quot;.ilbm&quot; (interleaved bitmap), same as &quot;.jpg&quot; should actually be &quot;.jpeg&quot;. The MS-DOS limitations live on long after MS-DOS is no more...')
