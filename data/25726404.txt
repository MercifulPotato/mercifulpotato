It&#x27;s a job for the police.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the platforms job to ensure they don&#x27;t distribute unlawful content. You don&#x27;t want the police involved, since all they can really do is seize the domain and block the website altogether. (And that&#x27;s exactly what they do for file sharing websites)')
