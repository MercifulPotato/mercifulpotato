Item(by='rsj_hn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606101565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183104, text='All US companies actively participate in US immigration policy whether they like it or not, just as they actively participate in US transportation policy, interest rate policy, etc. That is what it means to be a law abiding business in a nation where the nation defines citizenship while individual businesses do not. You do not get to opt out and live in your own little bubble where you pretend you are a nation unto yourself with your own private immigration law.<p>You do not, however, have to participate in <i>another nation&#x27;s</i> immigration policies. This lack of understanding of jurisdictions may be why you think IBM cooperating with a foreign nation such as Germany is equivalent to IBM, an American firm, obeying American laws, working with American legal frameworks and participating in the American lawmaking process. If you are in a situation, say IBM Germany, where you think it&#x27;s immoral to participate in that regime, then your only option is to shut down the business entirely and relocate to a jurisdiction you can work with. Then you will be working in that nation&#x27;s laws. But in no universe do you get to create your own immigration policies. Why this is so hard to understand for some people is truly baffling. It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t grok what a nation is, which might be why they don&#x27;t understand the role of borders.')
