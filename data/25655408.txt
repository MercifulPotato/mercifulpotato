But honestly, if I go back to it would be making a good bunch of trade-offs as well and mostly to satisfy my inner wish of using Linux and Open Source software instead of Macos.<p>But still:<p>1) After a few months, the screen of the thinkpad started to get permanent scratches from the keyboards. This is a common problem, see [1]<p>2) The keyboard is better, totally agree. But the trackpad is much, much worse. I managed to adapt to the bad keyboard on the mac, I didn&#x27;t manage to adapt to the trackpad on the X1.<p>3) The quality of the screen has no point of comparisson. Color gamut, calibration, resolution, etc. I like the WQHD screen, but it is not available for the X1 on many countrie outside the US. In my country (Spain) you only have the UHD which is a fantastic battery draining mirror or the FHD which reminds me of the nintendo 64 when looking at it. Let&#x27;s not talk about scaling hi dpi resolutions, and deciding if using Wayland or Xorg so that I can plug an external screen with different resolution, etc.<p>4)Battery usage is not as optimized<p>5) I think nowadays this is better, but at the time (around 3 or 4 years afgo) I had lots of problems on Linux with bluetooth, resuming after suspending, and the fingerprint reader. Hopefully this has improved since then.<p>6) Price wise, they are as expensive as an equivalent macbook<p>A being &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; has a lot of aspects to it. It is not just &quot;It has the same CPU freq and the same amount of memory then they are equivalent&quot; (not what you&#x27;re saying but something many say when doing this comparison). Build quality matters, integration&#x2F;support with the operating system matters, support matters, upgradeability matters, resale value matters.<p>And also, just compare the f<i></i>*ng mess the Lenovo website is. Every time I think about going back to thinkpad, browsing such a terrible, slow, clunky, outdated, terrible thought out website makes me regret it and just close the tab.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=thinkpad+screen+keyboard+scratched&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi124yn4YbuAhUGjhQKHQVXBgIQ_AUoAXoECBsQAw&amp;cshid=1609917318306672&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=764" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=thinkpad+screen+keyboard+scr...</a>')
