As a Greek living abroad, I wouldn’t mind eating Feta that’s made in Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania etc (neighboring countries which share a lot of the culinary&#x2F;pastoral tradition), as long as I knew that the ingredients and methods are the same. Which is hard to do without strict regulations though, especially outside the EU.<p>Fun fact: there must be thousands of regional variations of Feta Cheese in Greece. Major supermarkets will carry at least 5-6 brands, and in the cheese section you will get an extra 4-5 varieties. They are all called Feta + place name, and they differ in fat content, water content, acidity, saltiness, tanginess etc. Delicious and sad that most non-Greeks haven’t had a taste of good tasting Feta as the exported varieties are usually pretty meh.')
