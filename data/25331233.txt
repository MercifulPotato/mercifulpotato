A decade later, Apple is one of the most valuable companies, no one profits from mobile business more than they do and their phones are clearly the best premium phones (the majority of its competition is from the budget category).<p>The way it&#x27;s similar is that you yourself make a clear case in the number of ways apple&#x27;s new  silicon is actually groundbreaking but then you really are trying to concoct it in a way to find a flaw. The only real problem that you point out here, which also exists with the iPhone, is the anticompetitive and customisable nature of the future Apple is creating. Someone taking a stand on that in principle is commendable though questionable practically. Ignoring that for a moment, it is not really up to argument except by biased &quot;old timers&quot; that this is truly amazing work in chip and software design. It&#x27;s not like no one else wants or cares about any of these metrics, it&#x27;s that no one has been able to get their sh*t together in a way that Apple has.<p>Which is interesting because just a few years back MacBooks became a very bad choice for anyone for a number of hardware issues (outrageous keyboard, finicky motherboards, etc). So this is a very interesting 180 indeed.')
