The root problem is your depending on a company which has a vested interest in lying to you.<p>Glassdoor makes money when companies post jobs , you have a very real conflict of interest if Jill and Joe post about how shitty their employer is. Yet the same employer is spending 5k a year to post ads.<p>I&#x27;ve been ignoring Glassdoor reviews for a bit though. Even word of mouth can be useless, a family member got fired from company X. My experience with company X has been great. The same family member can&#x27;t hold a job for more than 6 months.<p>In all fairness the people most likey to cry about an employer on Glassdoor are bitter with sour grapes. After I&#x27;ve had a bad experience , I&#x27;m on to the next glass of wine.')
