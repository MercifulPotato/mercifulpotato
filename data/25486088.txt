Just think about it. The most power hungry desktop core needs 20W and going all the way from 4Ghz to 4.8Ghz is easily the difference between 10W and 20W. Apple&#x27;s TDP for the entire package is 30W. They can trivially just overclock their CPU to the same performance level of any desktop. Nothing surprising here but everyone sells this like some amazing thing. In practice they use less power because the SoC is fully integrated, they have the 5nm process advantage and there are special processes for mobile chips that consume less power below 4GHz.<p>Consider for one second that in theory the M1 is technologically superior because it can decode double the instructions per second and yet it still is only consuming 2x times less power but at the cost of delivering worse performance on a superior manufacturing process. A lot of hard work with very little to show for it.')
