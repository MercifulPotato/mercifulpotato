Thus, I&#x27;m considering getting an inexpensive graphics drawing tablet purely for ideation, note making, document annotation, and IT architectural diagramming (not for graphics design or digital painting!). A brief research narrowed down my choices to XP-Pen Deco 01 V2, Huion H610 Pro V2 and GAOMON M10K 2018 models (GAOMON and Huion are reported to be using the same [Huion&#x27;s] driver).<p>One thing that I&#x27;d like to know is whether one of these models has any significant advantages versus the two others? For example, I suspect that a touch ring on GAOMON might be much easier &#x2F; more natural &#x2F; more reliable to use than two-button zoom design on Huion and even more so than assignable buttons on XP-Pen. Another - and much more important - question is security and privacy. My concern is whether these (or any other similar devices, for that matter) send any private user information to their manufacturers (would denying relevant firewall prompts be enough? if so, would that be a problem from the driver update and&#x2F;or other functionality perspective?). Finally, I&#x27;m curious about potential differences between these models in terms of their support for non-mainstream applications, e.g., Miro and ArchiMate. I would appreciate sharing your thoughts on this.')
