May I ask you what companies you work&#x2F;have worked for where you experienced what you described? (I understand if you cannot say)<p>Regarding &quot;business architecture&quot;: your question is in a way already an answer to my question. &quot;Business architecture&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be something that is done at digital-first companies like FAANG, but is something that is prevalent at brick &amp; mortar enterprises that have IT. In my understanding it involves breaking down business processes and assigning them to different business domains so that applications&#x2F;systems can be built to support those processes. It does not involve any technical choices.')
