Traffic doesn&#x27;t necessarily happen because there are too many cars on the freeway, but too many cars on the much more limited capacity streets which back up onto the freeways. Everyone taking a self driving car into work isn&#x27;t going to change the fact that traffic is bad because everyone insists on traveling 20&#x27;x5&#x27; apart from one another through a dense urban environment, which is the spacing a car gives you in bumper to bumper traffic.<p>Now autonomous articulated bus that can hold 60 people sitting down in the footprint of 3-4 cars, that&#x27;s another story.')
