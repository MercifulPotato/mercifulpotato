The requirements are different, but to look at many web pages you&#x27;d not notice.<p>Too many resources that could be relatively simple pages with some code to aid user experience, are becoming massive full-blown applications pulling in megabytes of code and supporting assets.<p>Your game <i>requires</i> that code and those assets by its very nature. The vast majority of web pages&#x2F;sites do not, and can probably be just as beautiful without (if not more so, as speed and responsiveness is part of aesthetic judgements).')
