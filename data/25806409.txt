The modified script can be used as a backdoor for all your data and 100% control your computer, because AppleScript can do anything. Probably a legal NSA backdoor that hackers have taken over and a lot of people are in danger. It is not necessary to install pirated software, the download can happen through a hole in the browser. I an old school security researcher, once saw how hacker control a Mac and could turn on&#x2F;off Wi-Fi, modify files, paint over windows, etc. AppleScript can install new backdoors on the target system with manual control, which allows the hacker to hide his activities by playing along with the victim. Be careful, stay safe.')
