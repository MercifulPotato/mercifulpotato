That is to say, something may be amiss, but Texas can&#x27;t be the one to sue over it.<p>Sort of. Thomas and Alito said that they would hear the case, but wouldn&#x27;t grant any of the requested relief. This still technically doesn&#x27;t comment on the merits (the relief requested was not really grantable), but its more than just Texas can&#x27;t sue over it, even if they could the things they were asking for couldn&#x27;t be done.')
