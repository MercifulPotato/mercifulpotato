If so, yes, the story is wildly different for your case.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve never needed the credential for anything but passing the checklist of requirements for my first job<p>That&#x27;s a pretty crucial piece of value! For people who don&#x27;t come from wealthy families, that entry into the college-educated workforce is often the difference between poverty and not-poverty.<p>The networking angle is an interesting one I hadn&#x27;t considered, though personally, while I made several great friends in college, they and the other people I met there have had little to no effect on my job prospects. The closest thing would be that I went to a job fair while in school which eventually led to my first job, though there are plenty of job fairs that are open to the public (potentially even the one I went to; I can&#x27;t remember). Of course it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m not the average case myself and that many people get networking benefits from their college experience; I can&#x27;t say for sure.<p>&gt; how do you measure value?<p>I do want to clarify that I&#x27;m focusing on financial prospects because in today&#x27;s America, those are quite dark for many (most?) people. I&#x27;m not someone who dismisses the value of a real education, or the value of those relationships and experiences and memories. But I&#x27;ve seen several friends who put themselves in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt for those things, and will probably be paying the interest for the rest of their lives, and I just don&#x27;t think <i>that</i> tradeoff is worth it.')
