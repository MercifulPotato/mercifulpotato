If you want to encourage more efficient cars or less driving do it with car tabs.<p>I don&#x27;t need to drive my car on a road to derive value form it.  In the same way that I don&#x27;t have children but still benefit from schools.<p>Property taxes should be the source of funding for infrastructure projects.<p>Use taxes are regressive and result in underfunded infrastructure with the wealthy paying less and adding another barrier to the poor making ends meet.')
