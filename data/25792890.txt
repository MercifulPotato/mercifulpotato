It&#x27;s a great word processor, well-designed for its purpose. But it&#x27;s primarily designed for &quot;consumer&quot; text editing, things like resumes, school papers, and the like. And let&#x27;s say you add some programmer specific functionality to it, but do it in a way that doesn&#x27;t interfere with any of the consumer-first features. E.g., you make it automatically syntax highlight source code files, you make it use a more sophisticated find-and-replace when editing these files, you add a file drawer that you can toggle via two levels in the menu bar, etc...<p>Would you be interested in using this word processor for programming over your text editor or IDE which is designed first-and-foremost for programming? If not, what&#x27;s the difference between this and the way Chrome treats developers? (I&#x27;m not being disingenuous here, I honestly don&#x27;t see the difference personally.)')
