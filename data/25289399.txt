If Intel and AMD were capable of this kind of performance per watt, they’d already be doing it. Years ago.<p>Because the latest x86 chip has to be backwards compatible with 40 years of legacy code, there are certain limitations Intel and AMD just have to live with.<p><i>Apple will likely have a hard time keeping up unless they have more up their sleeve.</i><p>It&#x27;s ironic that it&#x27;s <i>Apple</i> that will have a hard time keeping up when they&#x27;ve already disrupted Intel and AMD. Remember, it&#x27;s not just a processor; it&#x27;s a system on a chip that contains an 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine for machine learning tasks and other components.<p>This has obviously been in the works for several years; Apple wouldn&#x27;t have gone down this path if they didn&#x27;t believe it would give them a sustainable competitive advantage for years to come.<p>Even with its ridiculous performance, the M1 is the entry-level consumer version of the M series suitable for (in Apple&#x27;s lineup) entry-level consumer hardware. The M1-based MacBook Air <i>doesn&#x27;t have a fan</i> and it&#x27;s faster and more capable <i>now</i> than many (most?) PCs that cost more and run hotter.<p>One thing we know: the M2 will be faster and more capable than the M1 and won&#x27;t be limited to 16 Gb. We&#x27;ll probably see M2-based Macs by the summer of 2021.')
