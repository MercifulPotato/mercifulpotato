I wanted a good keyboard, this was what was available.<p>I found the RGB useful to see what I am typing at night, problem is... I can&#x27;t get the thing to behave as I want, and it requires the &#x27;iCUE&#x27; program to be running at all times and that programs eats RAM like there is no tomorrow.<p>If this software lets me ditch iCUE and still have lights... I will certainly use it!<p>My plan is set my keys to have some darker glow (if possible... never tried) so I can see them on a pitch black room, and use the RGB part for information (like if I am running out of RAM or not...)')
