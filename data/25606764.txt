Nobody notices, and even if they do you will likely not get anything out of it. Do your job, but don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. Work-life balance is king.<p>This depends a lot on the situation&#x2F;company. It is definitely true that in many cases it doesn&#x27;t make sense to work hard. However there are situations where hard work is rewarded. Those are just probably quite rare situations after all.')
