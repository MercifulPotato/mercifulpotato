FOSS is a funny thing because people seem to get more upset about things they were handed for free than things they pay for.    Why should your entire *aaS stack be composed of free software of which you make money off of?  How much money did anyone reading this donate to CentOS when they were separate from Redhat?  Redhat bought the CentOS team because their own community refused to support their work.  Think about that...you get what you give.  People are really just upset they will no longer get free Redhat (which is what CentOS is).')
