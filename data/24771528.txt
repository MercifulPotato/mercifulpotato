It seems somewhat like mailing lists to me. I go online, my client sends and receives messages depending on which groups I&#x27;m subscribed to, and messages bounce around in a distributed fashion, somewhat like emails bouncing between SMTP servers.<p>I still don&#x27;t quite get the user experience. What if you&#x27;re subscribed to alt.binaries? Do you then sync all the binaries when you go online? That wouldn&#x27;t make sense. Perhaps it only synchronizes on a level below that, alt.binaries.something.something? But that may still be too much.<p>And what if my ISP&#x27;s server didn&#x27;t have the newsgroup I was interested in? Is it like DNS, where it would then fetch it from somewhere else and then cache it? Or did most servers store the entire data? Or an ISP would just store the messages that at least one of their customers subscribe to?')
