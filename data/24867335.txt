So this is why I cannot just get into Lua or Julia because it is much better than PHP. It is all about cost vs benefit analysis. Sure, if I am building something like whatsapp, I should probably learn Erlang over PHP but if I am building yet another CRUD App (which most web apps are even in 2020), I am totally ok with PHP since that gives me the quickest and most mature way to get started.<p>People who care too much about languages remind me of the &quot;If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot; situation. Not every application has to be built in Julia&#x2F;Lua&#x2F;Rust whatever.')
