They lost my files, claimed I didn&#x27;t fill the forms and after months of fight and involving my employer, they magically found papers I previously sent and paid.”<p>That’s the same insane situation like during the mortgage crisis where banks constantly lost papers or made wrong claims and got away with that. It’s hard to understand that insurers and hospitals constantly get away with forgetting or misrepresenting things. I can’t imagine any other business being allowed to do that.')
