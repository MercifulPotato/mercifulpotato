Their security clearance was revoked and the University cut ties with them. the university stopped paying them immediately. Reassigned their students. Let that sink in... the university didnt fight at all.<p>Meanwhile the lab and public health was claiming that all policies and procedures were followed and they were innocent and yet nothing changed. They never got back into the lab. There&#x27;s obviously no link at all to covid19, or is there?<p>In fact that &#x27;investigation&#x27; never ever completed. There&#x27;s no coincidences. The CBC reported on it because they caught wind of it via non-government sources. The students are the ones who originally broke the story. So why is the government tight lipped on this one?')
