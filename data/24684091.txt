The mass dampener in the video is really what gets to me. FIA just loves to ban random things. Like, I get some forced regulations according to safety. The Halos, for example, I get that they must be to a specific standard. But a simple mechanical device that helps keep the car stable, gripping the road? Ban that? We&#x27;re not talking about group B rally level of innovation.<p>Kind of feels like the FIA adopted the principle, &quot;If it&#x27;s fun and&#x2F;or interesting, ban it.&quot;<p>Fresh blood is needed too.')
