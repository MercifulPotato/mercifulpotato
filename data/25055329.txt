Item(by='lathiat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605066570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055216, text='One of the technical problems with directory mappings in snaps is that a directory has to exist in order for you to mount to it, and snaps use a read-only filesystem so can&#x27;t mount to a directory not already pre-created in snaps. However you can connect &#x2F;home and &#x2F;media if you connect the relevant permission (but not &#x2F;root).<p>It is definitely a source of general frustration, and I think largely because people are still often using it for CLI tools rather than GUI tools which can make use of portals to grant file access permission and&#x2F;or use an arbitrary path more easily - which is how it works so seamlessly on macOS [and is supported by flatpak&#x2F;snap for GTK3 at least].<p>(Disclaimer: I work at Canonical&#x2F;Ubuntu in the Support organisation. But not directly with&#x2F;on snaps, this is a user perspective.)')
