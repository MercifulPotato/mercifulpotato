Topological spaces are perhaps one of the least restrictive models of &#x27;space&#x27; is in mathematics. Peter thinks his definition will allow mathematicians to bring algebraic techniques to bear on problems that were previously not amenable to such methods.<p>The problem is that everything rests on one theorem, whose proof is difficult. Because the proof is so foundational, he&#x27;d like to get it checked by computer instead of relying on the opinion of a handful of mathematicians, who may be sloppy in their checking.')
