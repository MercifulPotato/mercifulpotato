I had to do some research on the Durbin Amendment [1]. It seems to be a legal cap on debit card swipe fees, which saved money for merchants.<p>I could see a scenario where Stripe is currently capturing market share with a 2.9% + $0.30 fee, and then starts increasing this fee once it has a monopoly.<p>However, Stripe Payments isn&#x27;t a loss leader that&#x27;s focused on growth. I would hypothesize that Stripe Payments is profitable [2] and that the 2.9% + $0.30 fee isn&#x27;t a huge sacrifice. If this is true, I don&#x27;t see the incentive for a monopolistic Stripe to raise the fee.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Durbin_amendment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Durbin_amendment</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;stripe%3A-the-internets-most-undervalued-company-2020-09-01" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;stripe%3A-the-internets-most...</a>')
