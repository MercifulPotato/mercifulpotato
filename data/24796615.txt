There are some good programs that teach dev and can go online with minimal hiccups, but that&#x27;s a tiny, tiny subset of technical&#x2F;trade schools.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to paint with a broad brush, but there is some really sketchy stuff going on in this space. I can&#x27;t sum it up better than the California DOJ.<p>&quot;Be careful and do your homework before enrolling in a “for-profit” college or career training college. The for-profit college and career training industry is not part of the public school system; they operate schools to maximize profits for their investors. For-profit schools have been accused of fraud, abuse, and predatory practices targeting the poor, veterans and minorities by offering expensive degrees that often fail to deliver promised skills and jobs. Students have complained about aggressive recruiting practices, misleading graduation and employment rates, and illegal debt collection practices—their complaints suggest that many graduates can’t get jobs or afford to repay their loans. If you are not careful, enrolling in a for-profit school may leave you under a mountain of debt, but not help you get a job.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oag.ca.gov&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;general&#x2F;for-profit-schools" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oag.ca.gov&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;general&#x2F;for-profit-schools</a><p>Brookings did a whole long thing on it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;The-Failings-of-Online-For-profit-Colleges.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;The-Fai...</a><p>&quot;CRL’s focus group research shows that students that enroll in for-profit online programs\nare attracted by easy enrollment and assistance in procuring student financial aid, but\nare subsequently disappointed with the poor quality of education provided.

There&#x27;s no community college pressuring people to take out student loans, or misrepresenting career paths to cash in on GI bill money. They offer absolutely incredible value compared to a for-profit college, or even the first two years of a public university.')
