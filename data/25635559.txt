I&#x27;m really puzzled by this, because Bitcoin seems to tick a lot of the boxes of what people around here are interested and believe in.<p>It&#x27;s open source money!  Open source is huge on here, there are tons of people who will go out of their way to use an open source version of something even if it lacks features of a similar commercial offering.<p>It&#x27;s censorship resistant money. This is definitely one of the more interesting things about Bitcoin, and one I expect people around these parts would rally behind.<p>It&#x27;s permissionless. hackers don&#x27;t like asking for permission to use a protocol. Open protocols allow for innovation to flourish on the layers built on top.<p>The technology is fascinating and extremely innovative, even if it did simply put pieces of prior inventions together in a new and unique way and throw in some game theory.<p>It&#x27;s not controlled by any corporation or government, isn&#x27;t that a hackers wet dream?<p>Also, with regards to price, a lot of naysayers like to mention how people only talk about it when the price is going up. While it is true that excitement brings in new people and more discussion, high price is actually a feature, not a bug. Let me explain.<p>The price of Bitcoin is a proxy for the amount of trust people place in it, the security of the network, and the ability to store and transfer large amounts of wealth. The higher the price and market cap of bitcoin, the more wealth an individual or corporation can realistically store and transfer with it.  You can now realistically move billions of dollars in Bitcoin, this was not possible when the price was lower, thus price is a feature.<p>TLDR: Bitcoin has unique properties that align with the hacker ethos, why do people on HN hate it so much?')
