For example, if you get an email to sign up for something, try to find that page yourself by googling it. If you get an email from someone at Harvard, try to find that person on the Harvard website to verify the email and everything else. But again, don&#x27;t do it by following links in the email. Google&#x2F;Bing&#x2F;DDG is your friend.')
