I suppose you could try to come up with a critique of someone that could not possibly be construed as one of the elements on that list. But I think doing so would be very difficult.<p>For example, &quot;I wish you wouldn&#x27;t be so loud at night when everyone&#x27;s trying to sleep.&quot;<p>Possibly 1 and 2. Playing on the emotion of guilt, and making it seem like everyone is against the noise making. But, it&#x27;s a legitimate request, and, in reality, not poorly delivered.<p>And that&#x27;s about as mundane and simple an example critique I could come up with off the top of my head. Most critiques are going to be much more nuanced than that. You may think that my interpretation is ridiculous, and no one would believe the requester was actually narcissistic, but in my experience many people will find any justification not to correct their own misbehavior, and if there&#x27;s an easy way to rationalize someone else as a narcissist they&#x27;ll do so.<p>Which is why I think this sort of thing simply requires discernment.')
