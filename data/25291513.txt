Most people make a full recovery. Have the fit and healthy passed from COVID? Absolutely, albeit at a staggeringly lower rate than others.<p>Personally, my wife and I made a decision back in the summer to get back to living our lives and accepting the consequence because we are a family of four healthy individuals. We workout several days per week. Our children are healthy. We don&#x27;t eat like assholes. We are not licking doorknobs. We have stayed at home when we knowingly came in to contact with someone who tested positive. We respect others&#x27; decisions who have decided that stricter measures are right for their situation.<p>On the site I acknowledge asymptomatic transmission of COVID. If <i>I am</i> worried about getting sick then <i>I</i> should be taking all possible precautions to minimize my risk including self isolation, etc.<p>A large part of my personal motivation for starting this in the first place is because of the terrible way the media currently reports COVID which is almost exclusively through number of confirmed cases. I&#x27;d argue that stat means very little.<p>It seems true to reason that the sick and unhealthy are the group who suffer the largest impact from COVID. Health is a choice (obviously there are exceptions). Millions of people die every year in the US from otherwise preventable causes like heart disease, lung disease and various forms of cancer. Therefore my thesis is that we are punishing the responsible people in the world to prioritize those who have willfully neglected their health for a significant portion of their life. It&#x27;s really straightforward to not be significantly overweight and workout 2-3 days per week.')
