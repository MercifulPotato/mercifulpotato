The WASM process still has to run somewhere, it&#x27;s probably going to be wrapped up into those systems.<p>Also all of the code written against existing system interfaces for IO etc will not be compatible with the WASM runtime, which means you&#x27;ll have to run WASM + something else too (and the easiest path is probably going to be to use those &quot;ops&quot; systems you mentioned).')
