These will all have their time in the spotlight as tech darlings or villains.<p>You aren&#x27;t using the Stallman Trick here. The fact some organisation or person seems good today is totally meaningless compared to what it is legally allowed to do, and what they have incentive to do.<p>It is a bit cynical, but assume people are going to do what the incentives push them to do and the world becomes a very simple and predictable place. The time to panic isn&#x27;t when someone threatens you, it is when they have the means &amp; incentive to threaten you. Run or fight then, not later on.<p>If the FSF gains power, it will abuse that power. Sooner or later. They will react to money just as much as the rest of us. Look at what happened to Mozilla.')
