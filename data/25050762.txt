They limited themselves to just two dies here, so maybe a real &quot;pro-focused&quot; machine can have 32 GB later. I guess those of us that need the extra ram will have to wait for Apple to release the M2 with DDR5 support and then re-evaluate our options. But for now these are a hard no for me.')
