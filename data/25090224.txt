For some time now I have been thinking about the idea that every philosophical problem is inherently a linguistics problem, as two people must use words to define the ideas in their heads, and words are the medium in which ideas propagate. So, is there a spoken language where two people who understand it can efficiently and accurately translate the ideas in their head to each other? Or is spoken language just too complicated for us to understand in fully?')
