You have to be sufficiently careful how they work to prevent misconfiguring the real thing which may have happened here<p>Example:\nIn production, a load balancer or other proxy handles authentication and passes a signed JWT to the application but running locally the application will take a JWT directly and signature verification is disabled. In this case, the application has multiple checks in place to make sure it&#x27;s running locally and in production environments it has network policies to only allow traffic from the authentication infrastructure.')
