Snapshots are so much better than level-based backups (full&#x2F;differential&#x2F;incremental) when using disk-backed storage.<p>I ended up running into this problem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8305283" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8305283</a> when I got to 20 hosts and a year&#x27;s worth of backups (14 daily, 6 weekly, and 12 monthly snapshots, so 32 snapshots per hosts).  It was made worse in my case because I was using ZFS with compression.  So the original implementation of Snebu used shell scripts, flat files for the catalog, and a small utility to burst apart tar files.')
