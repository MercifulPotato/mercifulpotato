It was addressed in courts, but they expected thousands of voters to have their votes ignored, and the courts found that unacceptable.<p>Then the losing side didn&#x27;t accept the results from the courts, and that&#x27;s where it became a ridiculous circus. Also, the demands were ridiculously out of proportion. In the end, because they couldn&#x27;t get their way, they tried to overthrow the legal result of the election and threatened members of Congress with serious harm.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;No effort was made a conciliation.&quot;</i><p>They never tried. They demanded a total surrender of democracy to their demands. That is completely unacceptable. You can&#x27;t compromise with something like that.<p>The reason these people were angry is simple: they were lied to and manipulated by media and politicians manipulating them to do their dirty work. The lived in an ecosystem of lies that kept telling them they should be angry, so they were. The lies they believed have been refuted time and time again, but they did not tolerate reason.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;evil, ignorant, or both?&quot;</i><p>Considering how eager they were to hurt people, they definitely check the evil box. It&#x27;s hard to believe they honestly believed the lies, but it appears that some of them definitely did. But they must have been unbelievably gullible to take it this far.<p>I really, really hope they will finally learn that their leaders and media have constantly fed them lies; lies that they keep repeating to each other, and I hope they stop listening to them.<p>But there is no way to compromise with their attitude. You can&#x27;t say: alright, let&#x27;s have some lies and some truth. Let&#x27;s have some freedom and some oppression. Some democracy and some autocracy. A movement that is so eager to hurt people our of sheer hatred should not set the political direction of a country.<p>This was the Beer Hall Putsch. It&#x27;s good it failed, but it needs to have consequences. The US can&#x27;t allow this to happen again.')
