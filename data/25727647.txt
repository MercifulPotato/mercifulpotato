That&#x27;s when I started using Python and it really felt more powerful than C++ (and Java) back then. Then around 2008 I became interested in Common Lisp, and then later I made the choice to learn Haskell instead of Clojure. It took me a while before actually getting where is the improvement in Haskell and functional programming. This was all for my own personal projects, which are small programs.<p>I would still recommend against using Python on a big project. Funny thing, I remember talking to my boss (a mainframe programmer) in 2010, when I solved something with a script in Python, that I wouldn&#x27;t use it in production, but it&#x27;s great for small things. Forward to 2020, plenty people use it in products. Maybe the Haskell will be the same, you also have many people today saying &quot;well this is good for experiments but I wouldn&#x27;t write a product in it&quot;.')
