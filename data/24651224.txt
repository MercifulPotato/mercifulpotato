He&#x27;s also running a charity org in his free(?) time.<p>It&#x27;s hilarious too because despite how impressive that sounds he is the most ADHD and scatterbrained person I know. He is incapable of any sort of organization in his life. I think he manages his dysfunction by channeling his hyperfocus into his work.<p>I have ADHD too, and it&#x27;s unfortunate that my brain seems to want to channel my hyperfocus into arguing about random things on social media instead.')
