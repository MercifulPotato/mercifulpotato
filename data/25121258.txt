Any code at all is liability, so if you&#x27;re writing code, it better be worth it. Figuring out what produces value is surprisingly hard, so I would bet the majority of code being written has a net negative impact.<p>And then don&#x27;t get me started on marginal profit. Producing <i>some</i> value is a lot easier than producing marginal value that outweighs marginal costs. Now we&#x27;re talking a smallish fraction of the code being written.')
