You hate C please go and contribute to the many rewrites and one day 25 years from now maybe we will have an OS written in some language that is cool now but would be outdated then.<p>My advice is use the best tool for the job when possible, if you don&#x27;t have a choice then learn to accept that most of us work with less cool languages&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;projects ... the skill we bring is to find solutions for our customers and implement this solutions as best we can with the tools we have, most of the time a developer should be spending reading stuff(documentation,articles, code), thinking and the least time should be spent on typing code or tooling.')
