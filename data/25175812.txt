We use the other one to explain MVP to our customers. How can a &#x27;product&#x27; be viable with only functionality?<p>In my personal observation, working in a cross functional team which includes frontend and backend developers, and ui&#x2F;ux designers, an MVP only consisting of functionality just wouldn&#x27;t be considered.
