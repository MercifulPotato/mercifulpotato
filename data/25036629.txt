Was a great big hulking thing with a flatbed scanner that took up too much space. For the odd things I needed printing, I just did this at work. For scanning I have a lovely Fuji SnapScan (Feed in stack of pages, scans both sides, OCRs them and gives them to Google for storage).<p>With lock-down, I&#x27;m working at home and maybe once a week I&#x27;ve found I need to print something. Shipping labels, application forms to sign etc. I missed having a printer, but didn&#x27;t want to commit to having to keep a printer fed with consumables for those few times I need one.<p>My employer offered to pay for bits I might need at home,  so picked up an HP Tango printer for the Instant Ink. I&#x27;m not going to print more than 50 pages a month, so I&#x27;m out of pocket £2 a month for any printing I need. £24 a year. I&#x27;m happy with that (plus you get a few months free, only starts charging when carts it ships with are switched out, rolls over up to 150 pages and photos printed from app are free).<p>In summary - it suits my needs and I suspect those of many others. If I needed to print loads of course I&#x27;d just buy a laser, but for occasional &#x27;I need a printer&#x27; and don&#x27;t want to get annoyed every time I hear it pumping though ink to clear the heads..')
