This supposed itty-bitty exception - &quot;Hey, just no <i>bad</i> stuff, okay?&quot; - is actually EVERYTHING. You say something like &quot;Just no hate speech&quot; or &quot;Only if they have violence in mind&quot; and those statements inherently violate the very notion of free speech the people are erroneously saying they&#x27;re in favor of, and those innocent-sounding qualifiers are why things are devolving so rapidly. We&#x27;ve taken a simple concept that worked brilliantly for 250 years (free speech) and in the blink of an eye, now that online life has (for better or worse) usurped the government&#x27;s role in setting rules for society, we&#x27;re just rearranging how the game is played. This is the broader issue, online life (for lack of a better phrase, but I hope you get my point) has become so ubiquitous that it&#x27;s like some sort of alternate society with a new governance. We wouldn&#x27;t&#x2F;couldn&#x27;t insert these qualifiers into the constitution, but here we are giddily doing it for our new alternate world.')
