It&#x27;s usually some clean on the surface mess that was mostly cleaned up by the previous guests.  I got sick of having to wash all the dishes, take off sheets, etc when I check out (usually having to check out at 11 am or earlier, so it can be as easy as possible on the host to rent it out again!).  When I vacation I want a hotel room that someone else professionally cleaned, not more chores and what feels like staying in someone&#x27;s dirty house.<p>And we stay in some of the nicest Airbnbs, my brother is a doctor.')
