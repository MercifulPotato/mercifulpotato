WW2 ended only 80 years ago, which is a minuscule amount of time in the grand scheme of things.<p>And since that time we haven&#x27;t had a global conflict, but add up all the proxy wars, civil wars, &quot;low intensity conflicts&quot; and we&#x27;re still looking at millions of dead.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the reason why we haven&#x27;t seen a major global conflict is just the immediate post-WW2 global order (2 major superpowers with nuclear weapons) which drove it to multiple smaller conflict.  Depending on how the world order changes (i.e. China) there is nothing to say we won&#x27;t see another major global conflict.<p>And yes, organizations like the UN are great ways to address conflict before they become major wars, but I&#x27;d argue the effect has been incredibly small.  The UN existed at the same time as the Vietnam War, the Afghanistan War, the Rwandan genocide, both Gulf Wars and it was basically &quot;the UN issued a strongly worded statement&quot; and the wars happened anyways.')
