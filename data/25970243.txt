I&#x27;ve read some forums about RSI and there were quite a few people stating they got RSI right at the time they started learning and using the proper touch-typing method.<p>It makes sense too. Without formal training your hands will assume comfortable positions on the keyboard and the writing technique will evolve to suit your hand size and your movements. This should be more ergonomic compared to strict rules, developed for type-writers, where you have to press each key with the same finger every time, and where typical programming keys (brackets, colons) are left to the smallest finger.')
