If so, I agree.  We are supposed to have different views and opinions.  It&#x27;s OK to believe different things than your neighbour.<p>I think the problem comes in when your neighbour has views and beliefs that are not based in reality and just can&#x27;t see the other side.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with &quot;preppers&quot;, as I can see that it&#x27;s entirely possible that society might collapse and it&#x27;s good to be prepared.<p>On the other hand, how do you deal with those that believe that the Earth is flat?  Even when they discover that the facts don&#x27;t align with their beliefs, they still can&#x27;t accept it.  If you can&#x27;t agree on literal &quot;facts&quot; then it&#x27;s hard to find any common ground on which to stand.')
