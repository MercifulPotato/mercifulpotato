Item(by='qalmakka', descendants=None, kids=[25227116, 25227387, 25228615], score=None, time=1606469984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226863, text='Lol, that&#x27;s kind of true. They&#x27;ve been producing basically a _slightly_ inferior, cheaper knock-off version of Parmigiano-Reggiano for centuries and nobody ever complained; at least they always steered clear from associating themselves with the &quot;Parmesan&quot; brand because like many knock-offs they basically achieve what is arguably a less prestigious and blander product by having laxer quality standards.<p>For instance, Parmigiano-Reggiano can only be made by cows eating certain kinds of grass, which should be dried and not fermented. Farmers grow their own alfalfa, which is then turned into bales and stored away for the winter months; this is a taxing and expensive process, but avoiding fermented, cheeper feeds (like maize trimmings) makes the milk more shelf stable, with less unwanted bacteria, which then reflects into a cheese less prone to spoiling or tasting off.<p>The insistence of Grana Padano (which is mostly made on an industrial scale, compared with the smaller, cooperative dairies in the Parmigiano-Reggiano area) to allow farmers to use lower-quality feed stored in silos forces them to allow preservatives like Lysozyme in their formulation, because their milk gets inevitably contaminated by the Clostridium bacteria from the fermented feed they give to their cows.<p>Before anyone complains, I might be a bit biased towards Parmigiano-Reggiano because I was born and raised in the area it is produced, so I ate a lot of it in every form, shape and size, but I think every cheese connoisseur knows that there&#x27;s definitely a taste and quality difference between the two; I like Grana Padano overall, but even when long aged it&#x27;s definitely not as deep, flavourful and complex as an equivalent wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It&#x27;s simply not the same.')
