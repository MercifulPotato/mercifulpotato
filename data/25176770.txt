The total weight is counted and then the size of actual content is measured and shown as a ratio.<p>&gt; For example: If a website has a total weight of 100kb and 60kb are the documents structure, text, images, videos and so on, then the content ratio is 60%. The rest are extras like CSS, JavaScript and so on. It is hard to say what a good ratio is but my gut feeling is that everything above 20% is pretty good already.')
