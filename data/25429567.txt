Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608034657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427493, text='&gt; every NBA player who has won league MVP in the lottery era (&gt;1985) was drafted in the first 15 picks.<p>I mentioned Steph Curry because the original commenter did, but in general it&#x27;s very strange to focus on the MVP. That&#x27;s a small sample and cherry-picking the results, only talking about the successes and overlooking all of the draft busts. There&#x27;s only 1 MVP in the league every season, and some players have won it multiple times. It was won 5 times by Michael Jordan, who incidentally was drafted 3rd (behind Sam Bowie). Only 21 players have won NBA MVP during that period.<p>In any case, that MVP record doesn&#x27;t hold in other sports. For example, NFL MVP Tom Brady was drafted behind 198 other players in 2000.<p>&gt; NBA teams are really good at &quot;hiring&quot;.<p>Some long-suffering Minnesota Timberwolves fans might say otherwise.')
