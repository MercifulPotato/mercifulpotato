Already, the challenge has been joined by nearly 1,200 competitors, more than 10 percent of which are Kaggle Grandmasters.<p>Knowledge tracing can model student comprehension as they interact with coursework and is used to predict how the student will perform on future interactions so that a study plan can be adapted to the student’s individual needs.<p>The winning teams in the annual competition will share $100,000 in prize money and the winning model will be presented at a workshop at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference in February next year.<p>The competition is based on the world’s largest dataset of student-AI interactions, called EdNet, created by a Korean-based AI education company, Riiid.<p>“As an adviser to this important event, I look forward to reviewing AI-backed solutions that can give educators insightful directions to best coach young minds,” said Paul Kim, Associate Dean and Chief Technology Officer at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education.<p>AI and the Internet hold the promise of democratizing quality education. By focusing the best AI minds in the world on the improvement of AI-enabled education, researchers and teachers together can design a new paradigm for education in the post-COVID era.<p>Craig S.
