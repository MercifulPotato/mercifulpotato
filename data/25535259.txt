You might be able to save $10k by reusing equipment from the last event or using a venue&#x27;s equipment, but if the equipment cuts out mid-show, it will cost a lot more than $10k in missed opportunity.<p>I spent a week hanging out at Circuit of the Americas helping to run a solar car race, and asked about all the loose CAT6 bursting out of every wire conduit. The broadcasters run new cable for their equipment every Formula One race, hardwire it, then cut it loose and pack up. It&#x27;s apparently cheaper to do that than to debug connection problems with existing cables, or risk losing a camera feed unexpectedly due to intermittent connections from failing connectors.')
