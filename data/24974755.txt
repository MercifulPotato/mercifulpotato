The writer, Joey Hess (a relatively well-known OSS programmer, moreutils, for instance), is choosing to interpret this as their banning any repo that hosts the commit hash for youtube-dl (which they banned).<p>So he is jokingly showing you a way to create a Github poison pill. The joke is that if you include this &#x27;illegal&#x27; hash you subject the repo to being DMCA&#x27;d out (not really, but it&#x27;s sort of an &#x27;imagine if&#x27;). Which means his repo is now unpublishable on Github (for long anyway).<p>It&#x27;s kind of hacker humour in the sort of vein that you&#x27;d expect from an old-schooler like him. You sort of have to get the joke to get the joke.')
