At times I’ve taken a supplement that combines calcium, D3, magnesium and phosphorus, to keep these nutrients in balance.<p>Of course one should work with a health professional when considering taking dietary supplements.<p>Sources:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5652077&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5652077&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betteryou.com&#x2F;health-hub&#x2F;magnesium-other-vitamins-minerals&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betteryou.com&#x2F;health-hub&#x2F;magnesium-other-vitamins-mi...</a>')
