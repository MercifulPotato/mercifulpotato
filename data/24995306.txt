As a kid&#x2F;teenager I hated it at the time, since they made me work there. Fast forward 30 years I have a bunch of raised beds in my backyard, grow produce, and find it more rewarding in that non-monetary fashion, than just about any other thing I&#x27;ve done. Properly set up (basically just automatic drip irrigation, which is super cheap) it&#x27;s very low maintenance.<p>So yeah, I agree with the author. As an engineer, doing this to make money is stupid. But as a lifestyle thing I think it&#x27;s a lot of fun. And then you also get to eat what you grow, in addition to the &quot;lifestyle&quot;.')
