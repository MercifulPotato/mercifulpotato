Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[25077110], score=None, time=1605225384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25075527, text='&gt; The nuclear winter model at its simplest: Nuclear detonations → Fires in cities → Firestorms in cities → Lofted black carbon into the upper atmosphere → black carbon persists in upper atmosphere, reflecting sunlight and causes massive cooling\n&gt; \n&gt; Each step is required in order for the effect to occur.<p>Why cities in particular?  Are cities more flammable or more likely to produce the wrong kind of smoke than, say, a forest fire?  (I&#x27;m assuming there exist at least some military targets in heavily forested areas.)<p>Also, is the nuclear blast itself a key component in the effect?  For instance, does the mushroom cloud create an updraft larger than what you&#x27;d have with a regular forest fire?')
