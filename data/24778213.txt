Sometimes, I simply leave the provided choices blank.<p>It&#x27;s different for referenda -- no write-in on those.  But you can still leave it blank.<p>And nobody will know (unless you&#x27;re the idiot that writes theirself in), because your ballot is secret.  <i>Turning in the ballot</i> can be compulsory without making it compulsory to actually fill it out.')
