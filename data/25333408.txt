Item(by='52-6F-62', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607356940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333065, text='I&#x27;ve lived in newer buildings the past 6 years or so, with modern HVAC systems, the works.<p>One thing each of them has had (or neglected, really) is a <i>phony</i> vent for the stove. There is a hood fan, and what appears to be conduit leading to a vent, but there isn&#x27;t actually any vent. It&#x27;s an empty casing made of chipboard. The hood fan just blows upward onto the front of the cabinets above the stove and leaves a delightfully greasy trail.<p>At best, it does some minor filtering. But based on the grease deposits on the aforementioned cabinets, it doesn&#x27;t do much.<p>We&#x27;re moving to townhouse about an hour outside of town [in a beautiful town on the escarpment to boot]. The house was built in 1896 and has better venting than our current modern, downtown &quot;luxury&quot; condo.<p>And the dust. Let me tell you about the dust. It&#x27;s unceasing here. We can dust one day and inside of a week it will be as dusty as if nobody has lived here in months. We&#x27;re looking forward to being in a space that has been built and tended to be lived in rather than an image of a dwelling that is really only a vehicle for investment.')
