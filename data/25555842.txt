Guessing mastadon behavior, extrapolated from what living mastodon? Speculating on behavior vs probability of ending in the fossil record - is that a thing? Where has that been studied? Ignoring risks taken by female mastadons - giving birth, defending calves. Are those part of the behavior group that affects likelihood of fossilization? Nothing in this (soft) article about that.<p>Let&#x27;s be totally honest. Paleontologists have make astronomical errors in interpreting probabilities and statistics in the past.')
