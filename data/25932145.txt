Thatâ€™s essentially marketing.<p>I think you are entirely missing the point of these comments, which is: the &quot;disproportionate reactions&quot; of the YA community are hateful, bizarre, mob-like, and often dip into censorship.<p>You&#x27;re also stating that the &quot;genre&#x27;s fans&quot; are to blame. As the comments above clearly state, the criticism in this thread is toward the professional authors who take part in these mobs. Not the &quot;young people.&quot;')
