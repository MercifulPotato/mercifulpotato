What did you do with it?<p>I looked to port Gtk to MCU, and then gave up. Too much C trickery, and hard to replace, heavy dependencirs.<p>For somebody who knew Qt, and Gtk since 2003, it looks like a miracle now how Qt got smaller, and faster than Gtk, and can even run on an MCU, and quite well!<p>Very big contribution to that was Qt&#x27;s team willingness to undo the wheel reinvention, and willingness to throw out their hacky attempts to replicate new c++, and standard lib functionality.<p>The Glib+Gtk world, unlike Qt, still lives in ANSI C, and C99 era, and refuses to concede on reinventing functionality of modern standard libraries, language features, and compilers.')
