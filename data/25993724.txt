Occasionally it works out, but often you just get a ton of also-rans. The companies are so big a profitable that even complete failure barely moves the stock price.<p>Nobody is incentivized to point out the proverbial emperor has no clothes. Top execs have something they can point to as &quot;innovation&quot; for a few quarters. Lower leadership for the project has their kingdom expanded and probably comes out the other end better off career wise. I would imagine its most frustrating for the actual IC&#x27;s and PM&#x27;s who pour their lives into something that eventually just gets unceremoniously deprecated, but they get to cash some pretty good paychecks and it probably helps their careers as well.')
