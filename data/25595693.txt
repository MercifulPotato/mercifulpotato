Thank you for that additional detail.<p>I have no politics in this matter, as I have no list of desired winners or losers and no desired end-state (aside from just being generally unhappy with the way things are in Turkey currently).  I don&#x27;t know how I could be less political.<p>It&#x27;s a very complex situation, as you&#x27;ve pointed out. My only intent was to provide a shorthand evaluation of the area for others to dive down on if they desired. There is no one &quot;Turkey&quot;, which is why I used the broad term. Of course it&#x27;s much more nuanced. Thanks for the help.')
