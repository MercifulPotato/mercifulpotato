I was recently hospitalized with covid and got the experimental cocktail (remdesivir, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, azithromycin, anti-clotting drugs, zinc, D, C, probiotics) that only became available a few months ago. It cost over $62000. How many people can afford that? And it requires hospital beds because it is strictly inpatient treatment. It&#x27;s not without its risks either. It&#x27;s really only viable if 1) the patient has insurance and money and 2) the hospitals can avoid being overrun.<p>Regeneron could change things. That&#x27;s an outpatient treatment that could be administered at clinics to patients who have tested positive. The problem is it&#x27;s simply not available and it&#x27;s still expensive.<p>If you catch covid, have good healthcare and can be admitted to a hospital then your prognosis is very good. What we can&#x27;t do is treat large numbers of people simultaneously. Mass infection is a disaster.')
