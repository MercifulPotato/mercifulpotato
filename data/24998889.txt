The most extreme scenarios have Trump winning all swing states by a few %, which doesn&#x27;t look likely. So what&#x27;s playing out is not wildly outside the predictions by any means.<p>In other words, if a 10% chance happens, it doesn&#x27;t mean the 10% prediction was wrong.<p>The only way to prove a prediction was wrong is to bet against it over time with your own predictions. As Silver has shown there&#x27;s a huge appetite for election &#x2F; sports predictions. Anyone able to beat him over time would have enormous income potential.<p>For example, if you thought Trump had at least a 40% chance to win, you&#x27;d have a great betting opportunity in the market that had Trump in the 25-33% range. You could have bought in then and sold when Trump&#x27;s chance peaked at about 50-60%. If you arbitrage those mistakes you&#x27;ve identified in the market, overtime you could become very wealthy.<p>Until then, it&#x27;s just pundits pontificating after the results are known without putting any money or reputation on the line beforehand, similar to a casual sports fan late in the 4th quarter: &quot;of course the 49ers were going to blow their lead -- I just knew it!&quot;')
