Item(by='throwaway34241', descendants=None, kids=[25966357, 25964344, 25965642, 25966387], score=None, time=1611962396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962460, text='I saw the Interactive Brokers interview [0] and his explanation actually made a lot of sense to me (I don&#x27;t know about Robinhood other than it has had many previous problems).<p>He said that they were worried about counterparty risk.  They are only taking one side of a trade (on behalf of their customers) and depend on the other side to make good on their promise.  In this environment they are not certain that the other side can deliver on (for example) certain GameStop options trades, and they don&#x27;t want to be stuck holding the bag.<p>When the interviewer asked about customers being angry about the rules changing &quot;in the middle of the game&quot;, he said he viewed the game as market manipulation, which is illegal.<p>But isn&#x27;t he correct?  Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates could almost certainly achieve what the Reddit mob is doing and engineer a short squeeze.  But how would that not be market manipulation?  Probably almost no Redditors believe the long term value of GameStop is $350, market manipulation is the whole point, the new part is that it&#x27;s crowdsourced.<p>IMO both of his explanations are extremely reasonable.  But if you look at the comments on the video (and on Reddit), the take away is overwhelmingly, &quot;he is so honest about the fraud&quot;, &quot;He should be in a jail cell&quot;, that he is covering up insolvency, etc (just look at the linked video, it&#x27;s not just one or two comments).<p>This one interview probably isn&#x27;t a huge deal in the big scheme of things, but I think it&#x27;s very illustrative of a larger trend.  It seems like the level of distrust in our society is so high (particularly towards our institutions) that, increasingly, straightforward explanations for things are rejected in favor of conspiracies.<p>And once we are at this point, it is hard to see how it doesn&#x27;t only accelerate.  After all, believing one thing happened just makes the anger increase and believing the next one even more plausible.  People will inevitably lose their shirt buying GameStop at $350 a share (when it&#x27;s only been worth &lt;$15 for years) then blame the whole system being &quot;rigged&quot; against them.  The number of people who want to burn it all down is only increasing and it makes it hard to be optimistic about the future.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM</a>')
