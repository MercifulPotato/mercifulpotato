I think the only part where you are clearly wrong is here:<p>&gt; Sure you own the CD and can actually lend it but the person you lent it to has no right to effectively use that CD since only you were granted the right (license) to copy it on a limited number (which can be 1) of your own computers.<p>The second-hand gaming market is obvious proof that you are it is indeed legal for multiple people to copy the game to their own computers from the same CD. The only limitation is the same one that applies to books: copying a book that you own for personal purposes falls under fair use, but selling&#x2F;lending the book without also passing on &#x2F; destroying the copy invalidates the fair use exception.')
