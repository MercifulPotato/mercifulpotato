They think they&#x27;re all smart assuming that Starbucks calls a small drink &quot;tall&quot; because of marketing or whatever.  But it&#x27;s actually the too-cool-for-school crowd that is wrong.<p>&quot;Short&quot; is in the shortest cup.  It&#x27;s the small size.<p>&quot;Tall&quot; is the taller cup.  It&#x27;s the regular size.<p>&quot;Grande&quot; is the large size.  &quot;Grande&quot; means &quot;large.&quot;<p>&quot;Venti&quot; is extra-large.  &quot;Venti&quot; means &quot;twenty,&quot; and is used because the drink is twenty ounces.<p>Because Starbucks doesn&#x27;t list the &quot;short&quot; size on the menu, angry people assume Starbucks is trying to hide something.  But it&#x27;s not.  Just ask for a short.  I&#x27;ve never been to a Starbucks that didn&#x27;t have the short size.<p>When I order a &quot;short,&quot; about 90% of the time the response is, &quot;Don&#x27;t you want a &#x27;tall,&#x27; instead?  It&#x27;s the same price.&quot;  My response is, &quot;It&#x27;s not about money.  It&#x27;s about portion control.&quot;  And everyone goes about their business.')
