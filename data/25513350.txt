Programming doesn’t need to be stuffy with only “old timer” languages. Maybe 8 years into programming I myself got very much into language and compiler design. I started as most would by making languages which just had different keywords. Then at some point truly ventured off the deep end with languages that include (for example) built-in abstract algebra and symbolic computation. None of my creations would have ever been passed off as being “practical” for any sort of industrial use. The point was that it was fun, and I learned an enormous amount from my own and others’ languages.')
