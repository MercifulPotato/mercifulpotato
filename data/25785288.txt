One person&#x27;s playbook (or Terraform module or Chef cookbook or whatever) works fine on the developer&#x27;s machine due to assumptions made during the development. But transfer that code to another machine and it&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother story. There is often a lack of rigor around dependency management and versioning, along with hidden dependencies such as programs that need to exist on the machine where the playbook is run. I want to make it possible to include all of the dependencies directly in the binary, so you truly need just one binary (unobin) to download and run.<p>I&#x27;ve made a lot of progress and have what I feel is a solid POC at this point. It lacks many modules but I&#x27;m just writing them as I need them. Right now I&#x27;m working on a reference playbook to build a Concourse CI stack, and that&#x27;s giving me solid feedback to myself about what&#x27;s missing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cloudboss&#x2F;unobin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cloudboss&#x2F;unobin</a>')
