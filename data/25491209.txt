How would you expect America to stop two of their allies from dealing with each other (with a potential courtship in the works)? Especially when America itself gets major weapons contracts to look the other way?<p>This will just continue to get worse. More journalists and human rights activists will die because some delusional maniacs feelings were hurt, some ex IDF techs want to make some money and a President wants to keep jobs at Lockheed Martin.<p>Maybe the BDS list should include more countries. Maybe tech as a whole should replace lip service and instead redirect (and&#x2F;or reject) major funds to fight injustice on a geopolitical level. Maybe VC funds shouldn&#x27;t &quot;techwash&quot; despot dollars.<p>The tech industry has a lot of power in itself and can push the needle without the need to rely on &#x27;America&#x27; to do something.')
