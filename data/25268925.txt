I find there&#x27;s a certain fetishization of even cheap paperbacks, rather than their content, that I don&#x27;t buy into. There are certainly some types of books that lend themselves better to print than tablet and some that are designed to be art in their own right. But, for reading a novel, I&#x27;d rather use an ebook reader for the most part.')
