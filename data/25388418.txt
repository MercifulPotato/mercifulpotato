I think clearly we can say that SpaceX is putting sufficient amount of energy into worker safety. I agree with you this issue posed a risk to safety, and I&#x27;m sure SpaceX will learn from it and applies the lessons from it in the future.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t have that in rocketry. They want to go to Mars and can&#x27;t even get out of the assembly building in one piece!<p>Literally one day before they just took almost the same rocket up to 12.5k and almost landed it. I&#x27;m trying very hard to assume good intentions on your part, but statements like that make it hard.<p>The alternative you seem to be proposing is the Boeing model where everything is extremely slow, methodical and waterfall style. How did that end up? A disaterous demo flight with 2 near misses: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test#Anomalies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test#Ano...</a>.<p>We all agree rocket science is hard. We all agree that going to mars has lots of critical safety requirements. But SpaceX isn&#x27;t going to mars yet, they are just doing rapid prototyping. The requirements here are WAY less.')
