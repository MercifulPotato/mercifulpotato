While I don&#x27;t pretend to be an expert, it&#x27;s stuff like this that really makes me doubt how much we <i>really</i> know about distant parts of the universe. This asteroid is so much closer to Earth than many galaxies and other objects scientists claim to know something about. Of course, science is all about being wrong, refining the model, trying again etc. but my default reaction to any claim made about age&#x2F;size&#x2F;composition&#x2F;distance, is immediate skepticism for this reason.')
