Other than that some people are mentally quicker, or have faster reflexes, or are physically more capable -- &quot;general&quot; things<p>I don&#x27;t understand how this distinction is supposed to work. If someone has exactly the &#x27;general natural inclinations&#x27; that fit to a certain activity, it seems asinine to not call them talented in it.
