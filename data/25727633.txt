Even a relatively trivial problem of audio feedback hasn&#x27;t been solved in all software yet - occasionally you hear echoes in some of them (Skype, WhatsApp?), or otherwise the peer is interrupted when you speak making talking simultaneously imposslbe and the whole experience irritatingly poor. It all seems like a downgrade from the classical telephony where you didn&#x27;t have those problems.')
