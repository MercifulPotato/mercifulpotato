However, I don&#x27;t believe `contempt` assumes the meaning of `satisfied`, instead it is defined as `having a strong feeling of disliking and having no respect for someone or something`.<p>In any case, I have mixed feelings about in which direction society is heading.<p>On the one hand, I think this game of social ascension is the same as before, only the dream changed: we have no illusions of having a well paid job that affords us house, cars and a big family, at least not without acquiring a huge debt.<p>On the other hand, on average, we have much more access to information. The average joe is much more educated and have higher buying power than 100 years ago.<p>I think we can&#x27;t really look at the present comparing with what once was, because we live in a time of its own. We have to reassess the current configuration, fight to keep what we acquired in terms of freedom and equality, but try to fix the perceived feeling of separation, loneliness and helplessness together.')
