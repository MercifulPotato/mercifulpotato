No matter how you put it, it&#x27;s not a government&#x27;s job to distribute a cheap, universally available subscription-free substance that might benefit their citizen&#x27;s health. Why does the government not distribute fruits to all citizens? Should they distribute dental floss?<p>Maybe yes, but only to people in real need who cannot afford any of this or need help (e.g. elderly who are afraid to leave the house due to Covid).<p>In my opinion, the government&#x27;s job is not to act like a nanny. There shouldn&#x27;t be any need for it. They can and should expect a <i>minimum of citizen participation and autonomy</i>.<p>Is that such a bizarre idea to you?')
