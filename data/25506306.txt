There is some absolutely bat-shit crazy stuff coming out of the extremist left. It&#x27;s just not as overtly racist as the equally bat-shit crazy stuff coming out of the extremist right, and the Overton window being what it is it&#x27;s not as heavily monitored&#x2F;censored.<p>&gt; <i>You did not bring them up in good faith</i><p>Nobody talks about the airplane ticket thing if they care about the &quot;wellbeing and rights&quot; of morbidly obese people. But that doesn&#x27;t detract from the facts of the point. Whether someone does or doesn&#x27;t care about the wellbeing of some unnamed morbidly obese person is irrelevant to whether or not they&#x27;re making a good point or argument.')
