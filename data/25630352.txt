In fact, I expect much of his claims against the government of China are true.<p>But it&#x27;s just something to watch out for, especially when he talks about things further from his direct experiences.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, he&#x27;s also close friends conservative media proprietors like former Trump-advisor Steve Bannon (who is articulate, has some interesting and mostly reasonable, well-thought through things to say, but is sometimes divisive).')
