You&#x27;re arguing that it harms too many people, but I really don&#x27;t care; it could have harmed ten thousand times the number of people and that wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>Bitcoin absolutely has legitimate uses, as I&#x27;m sure you know, but that&#x27;s not really pertinent to the issue that the government doesn&#x27;t get to tell free men what they may or may not do because someone else committed a crime.  &quot;Freedom creates opportunities for bad guys&quot; is not an argument against freedom.')
