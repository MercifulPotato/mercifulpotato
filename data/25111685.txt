Basically the time component is 0 so the space speed is 100%.<p>That’s why I find it easier to stop thinking of the speed of light, and thinking of it as percentage of speed of information transfer in the space-time medium. Light (or rather electromagnetic waves) travels at 100% the speed of space, but it has no special treatment in the medium, and does so by travelling at 0% the speed of time.')
