Topics such as religion, abortion, gay marriage, healthcare, marijuana legalization, and police reform have all been going in the favor of &quot;the left&quot;. I can&#x27;t really think of any big issue that &quot;the right&quot; has championed, that they&#x27;ve actually won. They&#x27;ve won political appointments, but not ideological positions.<p>Even having a balanced budget hasn&#x27;t worked out for &quot;the right&quot;. When they&#x27;ve been in power, the budget deficit hasn&#x27;t really decreased.<p>Perhaps this has made &quot;the right&quot; more desperate? Maybe they need to rethink their principles instead?<p>(I use quotation marks for the sides, because these really aren&#x27;t issues that fit on a one dimensional scale. A libertarian could fall on the right, but still support &quot;the left&quot; on most of the above issues. Also, this is mostly US specific.)')
