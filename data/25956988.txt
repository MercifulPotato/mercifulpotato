They start to shine in development of apps, where you have to wrangle views, manage data bindings and react to user input in nontrivial ways. It&#x27;s possible to roll out your own boilerplate and utility methods, but it&#x27;s almost always counterproductive - this is not a part of task you have at hand and you&#x27;ll miss on structure and conventions invented by framework team that really had resources to do it.')
