Sure, the app will give you backup codes you can use to restore the Authenticator on a new device, but clearly very few people are actually recording those somewhere.<p>&gt; Developers screw up password hashing constantly.<p>Developers should know better.  There&#x27;s no excuse for continuing to use poor&#x2F;no hashing for password storage.<p>&gt; Malicious actors should grow to strongly dislike this approach.<p>Not as much as you think.  Considering how many people still think that fingerprints are secure, if stealing someone&#x27;s device means having access to everything they have, then &quot;your device is your password&quot; is flawed.
