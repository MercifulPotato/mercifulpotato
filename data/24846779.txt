The difference to C++ (since that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve mentioned) is that the compiler double-checks everything at the end. The advance in programming language usability will not come from arcane tools like Rust, but from tools like Java, Python or Go which make previously complicated things simpler with e.g. garbage collection or coroutines.<p>Using &quot;scale&quot; is also misleading, because to use again your example C++ is a mainstream programming language and one of the most popular in the world. It towers above Rust by any thinkable metric related to scale - popularity, projects, developers, libraries, etc.<p>I do agree that discipline isn&#x27;t enough... in the sense that one can&#x27;t rely on discipline to achieve safety. This is a well known principle of safety engineering, which applies to all systems, not just SW or SW&#x2F;HW systems. Discipline remains nevertheless essential, because it&#x27;s one of the main things influencing the &quot;human factor&quot;.')
