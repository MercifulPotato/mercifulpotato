Item(by='war1025', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610043273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673689, text='&gt; Unfortunately, I&#x27;m too suspicious of Amazon (and Google, for that matter)<p>For Christmas, my mom decided to get us both a Google Home and a Facebook Portal (with Alexa built in).<p>We already have an Echo Dot that lives on our fridge that my wife&#x27;s parents gave us.<p>Anyway, I thought it was a bit interesting that out of the &quot;big three&quot; evil data stealing tech monopolies, the Google Home was the only one that made me uneasy. I suppose it&#x27;s a carry over from the whole Firefox &#x2F; Chrome rivalry.<p>I don&#x27;t really care for the Echo Dot we already have, but it is admittedly quite useful for &quot;Hey Alexa, play Christmas music&quot; or &quot;Hey Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.&quot;<p>Also I have been legitimately impressed by the video quality and performance of the Facebook Portal because any time I&#x27;ve tried to use their video chat from my computer it&#x27;s had roughly a 30 second lag and been completely unusable. The Portal is both a crisp picture and no noticeable lag.<p>I guess the thing I should wonder most about that is why video chat from a traditional computer is so terrible. The only thing I&#x27;ve ever had work decently for video chat with family has been Skype.')
