It seems they still recommend it. However, Adium seems kind of dead? Last commit (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adium&#x2F;adium&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adium&#x2F;adium&#x2F;</a>) was in 2016.<p>I build a MacOSX app bundle for the original Pidgin long time ago (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;pidgin-macosx&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;pidgin-macosx&#x2F;</a>). At that point in time, this was not so trivial, as the GTK support for native MacOSX was experimental (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gtk-osx.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gtk-osx.org&#x2F;</a>). You could simply use the X11 GTK version but I rather wanted to have a native version. I have no idea what the current state is with GTK on MacOSX. This Pidgin build is obviously very outdated now (from 2009), and probably does not run on recent MacOSX versions (they are frequently breaking backward compatibility...).')
