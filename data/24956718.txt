I did get Firefox 41 .0 working a few minutes ago and immediately went to HN to test it (as an easy https-enabled text-based website) only to find this to be the top post.<p>For those curious, clicking Help -&gt; Is this copy of Windows legal? goes to a 404 [0] page in IE.<p>To answer my own question: Windows XP feels incredibly more user-friendly and accessible than the version of Windows 10 that I bailed from to Linux. I don&#x27;t know how much of that is familiarity and how much is actual difference, though I did use Windows 10 far longer than I did Windows XP before finally deciding it&#x27;s not working for me.<p>Why are there two control panels? Why do I have to move the mouse all over the screen to click something because the OS uses a weird mix of desktop-oriented and touchscreen-oriented design? Why do I have to dive into the guts of the system to disable the invasive features that track me and send my information to Microsoft?<p>Opening Windows Media Player prompted me with some privacy options such as obtaining licensing info and sending diagnostics back to Microsoft, each of which were clearly explained and had to be toggled on&#x2F;off in the setup. It was so clearly out of the norm at the time that they went out of their way to make it visible. I feel like today it would not even warrant a mention, bar locales where that&#x27;s required by law.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but with WinXP it feels like I own the system. The customer-merchant relationship is clear. I paid Microsoft money, they provided me with software and now I am using it. 15 years ago I never would have though to consider that a company whose software I use would be selling my personal data to figure out exactly what kind of ads I should see.<p>Using Windows 10 now feels like a constant battle between me and the company that sold me the software (&quot;do you want to enable Cortana? can we send your keyboard input to our servers? can we update your system without permission unless you have an enterprise account? can we, can we, can we...&quot;)<p>I&#x27;m not RMS. I don&#x27;t care if companies use binary blobs to distribute drivers or collect basic usage info without full disclosure. Yet I still feel the pendulum has swung too far and its momentum continues to push it in the same direction. In both UI design and privacy.<p>I&#x27;m glad that there are still a vocal group of enthusiastic people that are keeping the spirit of FOSS alive, but I&#x27;m concerned about the commoditization of our information.<p>Phew, sorry, I got really bloody off-topic. Great website! It didn&#x27;t work on my WinXP VM under Firefox or IE but it did work on my Linux system. Congrats!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;M2NoHrt.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;M2NoHrt.png</a>')
