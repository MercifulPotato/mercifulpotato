For example:  why only OxyContin&#x2F;oxycodone listed here?  oxycontin was still a fairly new drug in 2002.  Also there are numerous other opioids available, many of those &quot;new pills&quot; might have been replacing other opioids.  Also you seem to completely rule out the possibility that there was untreated or under treated pain out there (which I strongly suspect is the case).<p>Again I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, just that it&#x27;s not possible to know from the context in your post alone.')
