This time it&#x27;s a little easier since most modern toolsets require much less changes in code.<p>Having said that some consideration to keep in mind:<p>- audio code needs to be optimized for real time thread constrains.\nMany optimizations usually made by vectorizing rather than threading that would&#x27;ve lead to locks and synchronization not always possible for real-time processing.\nSo not all SIMD code can be compiled just by changing a flag.<p>- machine specific code. While rare. Some companies still got such code for various reasons. And needs more complex transition.<p>- Not all companies were able to obtain DTK. We for example, got our first M1 machine 3 weeks ago.<p>- Backward support. While we&#x27;d like to have universal builds, musicians use their systems for years. We still support 10.7.\nWith Big Sur Apple seems to break SHA1 signs making builds from Big Sur work reliably only on 10.11 or newer. (The first release to support SHA256 codesigns)<p>- some companies already got Universal builds.\nREAPER, FabFilter and Adobe Audition are few I can remember.<p>Keep in mind electron, docker, Homebrew and even other &quot;devs&quot; tools still not fully Apple Silicon ready.<p>So indeed the above statement is unfair for a small industry (vs finance or other software markets)')
