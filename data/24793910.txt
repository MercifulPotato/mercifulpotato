My point is not whether there&#x27;s any basis to Apple being better or not, most everyone knows that&#x27;s impossible because the average Apple engineer is no better than the average engineer in the rest of FAANG or Microsoft or [insert pretty much every other large company here].<p>My point is that it&#x27;s completely irrelevant to the discussion. That Apple fans think Apple is better in no way justifies the practices mentioned in TFA, so their &quot;perception by others in comparison&quot; is not really here nor there.<p>At least as far as I can see, I could be wrong of course.')
