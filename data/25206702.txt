This is doubly true in skewed dating markets like the bay area (less so in favorable markets like NYC, DC).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of &#x27;what you can&#x27;t say&#x27; [0] in that book, sexual selection is skewed in lots of ways people pretend it isn&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;d be better to acknowledge some of these things and consider it in an intellectual way - not so you can leverage it in some sleazy&#x2F;misogynistic pick-up-artist way, but because understanding how it works helps you know how to behave&#x2F;show confidence etc. Helps for the aspie-er among us where this doesn&#x27;t come naturally (and is more important for men seeking women where for better or worse we have to be the ones to figure it out [1]).<p>On a somewhat related note, this Ted Chiang short story explores some of this and is just generally great: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:vSPLnvgBqIgJ:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvas.wayne.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;102861&#x2F;files&#x2F;3959556&#x2F;download%3Fdownload_frd%3D1+&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:vSPLnv...</a><p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;say.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;say.html</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W7QZnwKqopo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W7QZnwKqopo</a>')
