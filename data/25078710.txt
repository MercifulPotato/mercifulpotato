First and foremost, I want to get money from my customer to me, reliably and in full compliance with any applicable laws and regulations.<p>On that score, using a direct payment scheme, such as Direct Debit here in the UK, beats charging cards using a service like Stripe on every important point. Lower fees. <i>Much</i> lower involuntary churn due to charge failures. Outside the scope of SCA and all the complexity that introduces. Even for international payments using similar direct payment schemes in other places that have them, if we compare GoCardless for those with Stripe for charging cards, the currency conversion is much cheaper via GoCardless as well because they now work with Transferwise.<p>It&#x27;s 2020.
