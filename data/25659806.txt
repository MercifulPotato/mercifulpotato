Item(by='erentz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609953510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655224, text='So I currently have over $480,000 in denied claims. (I am fairly hopeful it will be resolved shortly, thanks to a complex work around my employer organized since it’s a self funded plan.)<p>I made sure that the treatment was preauthorized. Got a copy of the preauthorization. And I have a recording and email of the insurance company confirming the providers are all in network. But they denied the claims for being out of network anyway.<p>The part of the insurance network that provides the authorization is Blue Shield of CA. Even though I live in WA the authorization gets sent to Blue Shield CA. And that’s how they want it done. They approve it. They somehow look up and say provider is in network (multiple times). The provider themselves confirms all this too calling them. Then after treatment, when the claims are submitted, Blue Shield CA denies as out of network and tells the provider to submit to the Blue Shield franchise in WA (Regence). Now somehow the provider (an infusion pharmacy) isn’t in network with Regence, they are with Blue Shield CA. And so clearly in the Blue Shield nationwide network but not specifically with Regence. So Regence also denies it as out of network. Then they tell me this is somehow all correct and it’s my problem.<p>There is literally NO WAY for anyone to avoid this kind of trap. I was told they were in network multiple times, and they explicitly authorized the treatment knowing full well my home address and home state.<p>PS: the $480,000 is the magical inflated pricing, in real pricing ends up being &lt;$100,000.')
