The reason is also capacity, aldo policies on who is allowed to get test etc. Your case is literally someone who should be tested and was not, hence &quot;not enough testing&quot;.<p>Here,  I can get comertial test if I am willing to pay. No  one will send me home. And if I was in contact with covid infected person,  I get test for free (it is mandatory). And if I live in household with sick person, I have mandatory quarantine.<p>Sounds like where you live is no contract tracing and thus not enough testing.')
