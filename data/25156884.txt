I love to see the intersection of many fields of engineering, science, finance, and mass media here on HN. A truly amazing resource. But yes I struggle with the semantics when they blend together too much. I struggle to see how, when petty Us vs. Them battles flare, it&#x27;s generally in circles where these fields all culminate into one. I struggle to see the sleazy culture of east coast advertising and stock-trading types (bigots from the 50&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s) infiltrate technology as a profession, specifically in Silicon Valley. I struggle to see that &quot;social responsibility&quot; and&#x2F;or spiritual awakening is being packaged and sold like McDonald&#x27;s.')
