Item(by='judofyr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602260502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731158, text='&gt; Not GP, but I propose doing absolutely nothing.<p>There are multiple places on the internet where you can access completely unmoderated content. 4chan and 8chan are two popular forums, and yet they are far from mainstream.<p>The fact is that moderation is a <i>feature</i> which people want. People don&#x27;t want to go through 200 spam e-mails everyday. People don&#x27;t want to spend tons of time going through bullshit.<p>Facebook and Twitter has never been about getting &quot;unfiltered&quot; news. Facebook became useful because your friends was there. Twitter became useful because you could read content from famous and skilled people.<p>&gt; There have always been tabloid newspapers, underground conspiracy theory magazines and various AM broadcasting stations peddling all kinds of nonsense.<p>And these will continue to exist on the internet. The only thing that&#x27;s happening here is that Facebook and Twitter is taking a stance that they don&#x27;t want to become part of this group. Is that so bad?')
