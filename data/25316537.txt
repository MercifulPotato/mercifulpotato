Also cp. <i>case</i>, <i>casus</i> by the way, from the same root. It is rather formulaic, which is however reasonable if it should cover even the most minor cases.<p>The fact that <i>accidental</i> could come to mean <i>by chance, involuntary</i> was probably due to the consequences being a bigger worry than the causes, in most cases. Legalese has developed a more fine grained scale of responsibility, leaving room for doubt between <i>dolus eventualis, dolus directus 1</i> and <i>2</i> and in contradistion so called <i>negligentia, luxuria</i> and <i>culpa latis</i> all of which should be nevertheless culpable, in theory. However it is not always clear who to blame. Certainly not the wording, is it?')
