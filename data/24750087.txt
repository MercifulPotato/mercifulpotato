They replace those hundreds of expensive programmers who do nothing but maintain the Microsoft kernel with thousands of free programmers maintaining the Linux kernel.<p>Notice I said &#x27;Microsoft kernel&#x27; rather than &#x27;Windows kernel&#x27;. That was to distinguish the Windows &#x27;look and feel&#x27; code from the underlying invisible OS code. Those hundreds of Windows (Desktop) programmers will remain.<p>It&#x27;s very likely that you won&#x27;t notice the difference between Windows with a Microsoft kernel and Windows with a Linux kernel.')
