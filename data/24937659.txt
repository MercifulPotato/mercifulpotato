Item(by='TechBro8615', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604016677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937231, text='The NBC article is focused on an anonymously drafted report, which was mostly a dump of open source intel. The article criticizes that report for using a fake persona as its author. The initial disseminator of the report (who may or may not be the author of it as well) cites privacy and fear of retribution as reasons for publishing anonymously.<p>What the NBC article does <i>not</i> do is address or refute any of the facts in the report. It also ignores a lot of relevant back story and fails to make connections between this report, Hunter&#x27;s laptop, and Tony Bobulinski.')
