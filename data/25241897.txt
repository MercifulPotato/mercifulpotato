And that continues, basically every time I&#x27;m faced with a hard problem, even though I&#x27;m now a mid-level Area TL at Google responsible for software that hundreds of millions of people use.  That&#x27;s the nature of software (and innovation in general): before you&#x27;ve done something, other than the most trivial problems, you wonder whether you <i>can</i> do it, and then once you&#x27;ve done it, it&#x27;s done and you move on to bigger challenges.<p>I would basically stop thinking in &quot;rest of your life&quot; terms and start thinking 2-3 years down the road.  Are you happy doing what you&#x27;re doing?  Is there something else you&#x27;d rather be doing?  Are there any particular developments that make you excited?  Answer those questions first and that&#x27;ll give guidance to shape the rest of your life.<p>I have no idea what the world will look like at the end of my life in hopefully ~40-50 years (who knows, I could get COVID and die next month).  I suspect that demand for software engineers will be a lot less than it is now.  But there&#x27;s also a whole bunch of tail risks we&#x27;re certainly underestimating - the U.S. might break up into lots of tiny little states, Russia could roll through all of Europe, we might all be underwater from rising sea levels, whatever.  It&#x27;s not worth worrying too much about them.  Worry about the risks you&#x27;re going to face in the next couple of years and trust in your ability to adapt beyond that.')
