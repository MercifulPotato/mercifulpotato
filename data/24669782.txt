So, no Apple, no Samsung, no anything. It&#x27;s a product category dead on arrival for me.<p>I can consider smart glasses because I&#x27;m wearing them anyway. But they must be light and survive sport activities, including sweat (cycling in summer with a helmet.) Finally, given the widespread concerns with privacy, tracking, advertising etc (yesterday&#x27;s discussion about smart TVs) the less smart they are the better.')
