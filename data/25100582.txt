Ignoring that though, I&#x27;ve been doing quite well. I was always a freelancer, so my job didn&#x27;t really suffer much, I&#x27;m pretty much working exactly as much as I used to. My friend circle is all similarly international people, and we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to not seeing each other for months, sometimes years at a time so this is just another one of those periods for most of us. Since getting out of the house is a bit of a hassle, I mostly just do yard work now, it&#x27;s very calming. Not much has changed, other than the inability of flying whenever I pleased like before, but I&#x27;m hopeful that those travel restrictions will loosen relatively soon, and once that happens I&#x27;m pretty much back where I started, which is a good place.')
