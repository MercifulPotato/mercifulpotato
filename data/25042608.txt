What specific ingredients are irreplaceable in Indian cooking? I&#x27;ve replaced paneer with tofu, kheer (and consequently, most milk-based drinks) is trivially made with oat milk, vegan yoghurt can replace curd in 99% of the dishes (like chaat, raita, etc), vegan butter is indistinguishable from dairy-based butter. Ghee doesn&#x27;t have a substitute, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal. Naan has curd in it traditionally, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to make it without dairy. Since going vegan, I&#x27;ve made virtually all of my favourite Indian dishes and it was no more difficult than the traditional recipes.<p>South Indian food (where I&#x27;m from) is even easier as most dishes don&#x27;t have dairy to begin with.<p>Some milk-based sweets are the only things that I miss out on, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing anyway.')
