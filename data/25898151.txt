The distance traveled is s=1&#x2F;2a t^2. Plugging the first into the second gives s=1&#x2F;2 v^2&#x2F;a. So a=1&#x2F;2 v^2&#x2F;s= 1&#x2F;2 (10m&#x2F;s)^2&#x2F;0.1m=500m&#x2F;s^2~50g<p>Interestingly this directly follows from the definition of acceleration and doesnt use anything like Newtons laws.<p>Looking at the Video, why didn&#x27;t they just do it in a controlled environment? Some gauges&#x2F;meter marking and high speed cameras. The time it takes for the stop is in the order of t=v&#x2F;a=10&#x2F;500s=1&#x2F;50s so only one frame in normal video rate.')
