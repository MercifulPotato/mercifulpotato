The biggest arguments I have around Bitcoin are<p>1: Even if you can treat it like an asset, it&#x27;s an unproductive one.<p>2: It&#x27;s too easy to have some sort of problem and lose it.<p>At the end of the day, I see the long term value of BTC going to zero.<p>I feel lucky to have had some at one point, just to have that experience. One day, I saw that Bitcoin sitting in my wallet, and realised I didn&#x27;t really care anymore. It didn&#x27;t solve any problems I was having, and I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it other than look at the balance or send it somewhere.<p>I&#x27;d rather have my future wealth come from value I create, than some asset I happen to hold.')
