It is a wild story but nothing indicates specifically that Russia is involved. Per the story this material has already been submitted as evidence to a Senate&#x2F;FBI investigation quite some time ago so if it is completely made up the FBI and&#x2F;or the government can say so. I don’t think it’s right to censor an article from a legitimate print publication with investigative reporting staff, even if they tilt towards sensationalism. This isn’t a fake news outlet with totally fabricated stories.')
