I searched around and everything I found seems to cite one NPR article from 2015.[1] The interviewee&#x27;s book is out of print and costs $100[2], so that&#x27;s where that trail stops. If public sentiment against automatic elevators was as strong as described, it seems like there would be more historical evidence available. It&#x27;s easier for me to find articles disparaging self-checkout systems than for automated elevators. I realize the change in elevators happened long ago, making articles harder to find, but you&#x27;d think at least <i>one</i> of them would have gotten digitized and indexed.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;31&#x2F;427990392&#x2F;remembering-when-driverless-elevators-drew-skepticism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;31&#x2F;427990392&#x2F;remembering-when-dr...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Ascending-Rooms-Express-Elevators-Passenger&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1937689107" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Ascending-Rooms-Express-Elevators-Pas...</a>')
