The outgroup group would respond more negatively. But there is a problem with this design and they found out that it is not bias towards the outgroup that created the result. Maybe they have experiments that demonstrates (without a bias) that xenophobia is natural in humans, but I doubt it. I want to see some extraordinary evidence before I believe such an extraordinary claim.')
