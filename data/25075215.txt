Safari just added Favicon images last year, and I don&#x27;t even think they&#x27;re visible by default.<p>Don&#x27;t give them too much credit.  For a <i>very</i> long time, the minimum size for chrome tabs resulted in them hiding the favicon, becoming a completely useless row of triangles.  And to add insult to injury, the tabs were still big enough to show favicons if they wanted to.')
