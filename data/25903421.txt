Given the timing, I wonder whether it&#x27;s meant to be representative of the journey time expected of the <i>Titanic</i> - perhaps the record speed achieved by a White Star Line <i>Olympic</i> class ship at the time?<p>It&#x27;s possible that the dataset consists just of record journey times by certain notable ships. It&#x27;s certainly not <i>all</i> the blue riband records (why are none of the times from 1846 to 1855 plotted?). But then it&#x27;s not clear what the notable ship that took ~9 days in 1856? was (probably the <i>Persia</i>, but... why is that more notable than the <i>Canada</i>&#x27;s 8.5 days in 1849?)')
