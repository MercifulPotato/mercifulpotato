Some examples:<p>* authority over schools and the school system is almost entirely Kantonal<p>* tax authority is mostly regulated on a communal and kantonal level. the feds just get sort of a fixed share of what the kanton collects, but it’s itemized separately on each tax bill<p>* authority over all roads, with some concessions regarding highways<p>* autonomy over how kantonal subdivisions are organized<p>* like in the US or Germany, Kantons have their own justices and police departments<p>while that may all sound kinda time, keep int mind that we have 26 kantons and 8M inhabitants.
