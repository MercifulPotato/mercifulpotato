Item(by='djur', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610772505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798635, text='Lua has a type of value called &quot;userdata&quot; that is just an opaque reference to a C resource. There&#x27;s no way for Lua to know how do a deep copy of that resource, if it&#x27;s possible at all. Tables can also have &quot;metatables&quot; that modify how they function. It&#x27;s not obvious whether a deep copy should also create a deep copy of the metatable (and its metatable, and so on) or whether the copy should share the original metatable. There&#x27;s good arguments either way.')
