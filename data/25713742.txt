People discussing it are literally participating in democracy.<p>The problem is that these discussions go nowhere. Everyone may come to an agreement, and yet no one will do anything about it. Politicians themselves don&#x27;t participate, which is sort of ironic.<p>Plus, these discussions often devolve into shit slinging over some general issues like racism, minority rights, wealth, power. It only takes a few people to start it, and often, all the rational people just leave at that point.<p>All of this blocking will just limit everyone&#x27;s freedom and access to information. The core issue, education, is what needs to be solved.')
