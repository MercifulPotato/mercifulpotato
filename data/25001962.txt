I remember writing my first bare HTML website in the early 2000s using Microsoft Frontpage. How times have changed!<p>As people grow curious to create their own digital garden a claim their own space on the Internet, I found that the main blocker was getting started. They have ideas, notes, and thoughts, and they&#x27;re ready to share them on the Internet, but they don&#x27;t know where to get started. To reduce the barrier to entry, I created a simple digital garden template [0] along with a step-by-step tutorial to set it up [1]. More than 70 people have forked the repo to try it out.<p>Once the first step of setting the technical part up is complete, it&#x27;s easy to start sharing ideas with the rest of the world. :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maximevaillancourt&#x2F;digital-garden-jekyll-template" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maximevaillancourt&#x2F;digital-garden-jekyll-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maximevaillancourt.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maximevaillancourt.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;setting-up-your-own-digi...</a>')
