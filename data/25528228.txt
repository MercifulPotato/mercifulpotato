They are super kind and one of the nicest human beings I&#x27;ve ever met. They led the Rust Project until their involvement with Tokio caused them to drop off from Tech.<p>Alex Crichton is an extremely talented, kind, and hyperproductive individual, who after their involvement with Tokio dropped all async&#x2F;await work and luckily &quot;refocused&quot; on WebAssembly.<p>If one is going to recap the road towards Tokio 1.0 and mention all the people that have left the Rust async ecosystem or Rust all together, you might as well spell things out.')
