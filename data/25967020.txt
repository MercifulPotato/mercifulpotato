I&#x27;ve never seen sideloading being used to describe anything other than to suggest &quot;impropriety&quot; or something that&#x27;s not &quot;officially unapproved&quot;, and only in the context of applications --- I haven&#x27;t ever heard of someone &quot;sideloading&quot; music to a player either.
