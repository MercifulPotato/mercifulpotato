At that scale individuals have the power to sway governments. (A billion is likely not the right number, but it’s a good starting point.)<p>- Kill the money in politics. Make lobbying illegal.<p>- Kill the filibuster<p>- Kill the electoral college<p>- Decouple healthcare from employment (The only realistic solution I know of is socializing it).<p>- Provide a robust safety net (but get rid of the checks balances to prevent “abuse”). Just blanket give everyone $2000&#x2F;month.<p>- Eliminate exemptions to providing benefits make it proportional to hours worked (worked an average of 10 hours a week for a month? That employer must provide 1 week of benefits to that person.) There is no common good from giving employer a massive expenses break to employ 2 people at 20 hours a week instead of just hiring one full time employee. This is gaming the system plain and simple.')
