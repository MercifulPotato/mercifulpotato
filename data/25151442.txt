I&#x27;m unsatisfied that they didn&#x27;t entertain my conspiracy theory! &#x2F;s<p>If you actually informed yourself properly about this explosion (instead of reading -- I&#x27;m going to assume -- conspiracy websites), why the whole thing was sitting there for so long is pretty clear, and is actually briefly covered in the video (6:05): no one in the government nor military felt responsible nor did they want to take responsibility, having a fight using letters instead of recognizing the danger and acting to fix it. As to the source&#x2F;why no one wanted it back, that&#x27;s also been covered in the media.')
