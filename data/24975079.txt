Most of it before our winter hit then I plateaued now that spring&#x2F;summer is back I expect it&#x27;ll start dropping again.<p>3 major changes for me:\n1) Every (or most days) day I get up and on my bike. I dont set a limit, its just enough that I get on it. What I&#x27;ve found is that over a fairly short amount of time I started riding longer and further just because I was enjoying it. I now add in a stop at an outdoor gym for some sit-ups and push ups etc.<p>2) I skip breakfast every day. Call it Intermittent Fasting or Calorie Restriction... It matters not.<p>3) I no longer drink sweetened drinks. black coffee, black tea, water... that&#x27;s about it.<p>They&#x27;re not world changing things but they all seem to add up and work. I think they shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to keep up indefinitely.')
