There&#x27;s a back-office side to all this, too—driver managers and dispatchers need to know the decision matrix the driver in the field solves so they can help plan what&#x27;s coming up next. Our web-based tools help with that, and integrate with the mobile app.<p>As a remote team (since founding!), we&#x27;re super lucky to have some great folks who use the ability to work from home to spend more time with their kids, help volunteer at a school, or otherwise be more fulfilled than they would be working from an office. You could join us!<p>If that sounds fun and rewarding to you, the full description and info about applying are over here:<p>Apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;eleostech&#x2F;f4ad8636-085e-45cd-82ce-de1a680d2e3f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;eleostech&#x2F;f4ad8636-085e-45cd-82ce-de1a...</a>')
