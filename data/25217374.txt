Your opinion that is poorly executed doesn&#x27;t actually mean that it is.<p>&gt; But we must read what they’ve written as an attempt at controlling the narrative.<p>And...? God forbid their wanting to control the narrative about... Themselves? I&#x27;m not seeing the problem there.<p>&gt; They’re asking the world to discredit an article that (as you’ve mentioned) hasn’t been published yet. That deserves an extreme amount of scrutiny and skepticism.<p>But the NYT should be inherently trusted, unless I read your original comment incorrectly.<p>&gt; How could I possibly defend an unread article? It’s impossible and illogical.<p>You literally called it &quot;fundamental truth&quot; in your original comment, so I&#x27;m actually a bit curious about your answer to your own question.<p>&gt; I’ve been attempting to illustrate why their own attempt at damage control actually predisposes me to distrust them<p>Reading your comments, it seems more like a bias in favor of the NYT et al what is predisposing you to distrust them.<p>Of course, nothing wrong with that. If you feel like they properly represent the truth of your views, <i>not</i> supporting them would be incongruous. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that someone who disagrees about how well they represent the truth of the matter has to share your opinion. Indeed, sharing your opinion would be incongruous in that case.<p>&gt; It’s an incredibly amateurish PR move on their part, honestly.<p>This is not enlightened discourse. Again, just because you think it is doesn&#x27;t mean that it is. Specially when using vague non-descriptions like &quot;amateurish&quot;.<p>&gt; it’s partly speculation<p>It&#x27;s <i>entirely</i> speculation.')
