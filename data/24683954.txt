Like European football, it&#x27;s basically a money pit that generates good indirect returns only to the very top teams. That&#x27;s why it struggles to keep 10 teams on the grid every year (of whom 3 are effectively &quot;B-teams&quot;, one is half-owned by another&#x27;s boss, one is driven by pilots managed by that same boss...).<p>That&#x27;s why manufacturers as massive as Honda and Toyota never stick around F1 for long: they come in, realize how much money and time they will <i>really</i> need to waste to get any hope of winning trophies, and just pull the plug.')
