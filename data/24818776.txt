Happy days and all but... I don&#x27;t think that C++ isn&#x27;t cutting it here. I&#x27;ll grossly oversimplify it but tl;dr you can achieve roughly the same results with C++ but it will take more effort. But that has more to do with the nature and the design of both languages(and their respective standard libraries) more than anything.')
