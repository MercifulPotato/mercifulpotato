Patents have expired on the TBDR fixed function hardware blocks.  The rest is just a combo of a little RISC core that does job dispatch (Programmable Data Sequencer in their parlance), and a cluster of SMT barrel scheduled cores (used to be called USSE in the SGX days, not sure now) that do the heavy lifting wrt shaders that don&#x27;t really have any secret sauce AFAICT.<p>The value add is all in the software stack where they run a full little ukernel on the main GPU cores, and optimizing the shit out of the software that runs on those cores from their pretty clever compiler.<p>I bet they think that if they open source the drivers, that&#x27;s giving away the one thing that makes PowerVR GPUs special in the first place.<p>If a IMG person reads this: y&#x27;all are wrong with that last piece.  Your company is dying without opening the drivers, and you&#x27;ll be able to control the hardware&#x2F;software co-design in a way that nobody else can even if you give away the software.  You&#x27;ll have to keep doing work to have new hardware available and stay ahead of the curve, but that&#x27;s true anyways and is the sign of a healthy business.  Sure beats withering away as your patents expire.')
