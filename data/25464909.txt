There is not_null&lt;T *&gt; and some people even argue for using std::reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt; to void null dereference. But isn&#x27;t the root issue that the compiler allows dereferencing of a pointer that&#x27;s not guaranteed not null? Wouldn&#x27;t life be much easier if we&#x27;d tweak things so that dereferencing a pointer is not actually allowed unless it&#x27;s a not_null wrapped one? What are peoples thoughts on this?')
