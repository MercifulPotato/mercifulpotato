For one, if you&#x27;re a public figure that Twitter bans you can just maintain a website and your followers will spread the word.  If you aren&#x27;t a public figure, there are plenty of alternatives that serve just fine.<p>More important however is the issue that Twitter can only block access to Twitter.  That it is difficult to switch ISPs only matters because with few alternatives an ISP blocking a site, or you canceling your contract, would lead to that site being inaccessible.  The general policy &#x27;companies shouldn&#x27;t use their position to alter access to other companies&#x27; is more defensible than &#x27;popular social media has to pretend to be a utility for a given value of popular and social media&#x27;.')
