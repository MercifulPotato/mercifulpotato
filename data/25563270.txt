He lead a clean and sober biker club, but you can&#x27;t really tell the difference between that and a gang unless you know the symbols (&quot;colors&quot;) on the jackets.<p>When I was maybe 11, we were in eastern Washington, I was on the back of the bike, and we got pulled over for failing to signal when pulling out of a gas station. Which I don&#x27;t think is a violation? And also we did signal. But in any case, the cop approached the bike with gun drawn and pointed at us.<p>It&#x27;s not about the suspected violation. These are cops willing to aggressively threaten lethal force when they are experiencing fear&#x2F;anxiety&#x2F;uncertainty based on what the suspect looks like, be it their skin color or their clothing.')
