And most of the <i>rest of those</i> only succeed for a few weeks or months when let&#x27;s players happen to discover them and make them viral.<p>As far as the framework, my advice is Unity or Unreal for 3D or console, Godot for 2D, but Unreal only if you have a studio and a budget otherwise it&#x27;s overkill. But in the end the framework itself matters less than the license, which matters less than the game itself and the platform(s) you intend to publish to. Remember the guy who made Flappy Bird crapped it out in a weekend and made so much money on it that it actually scared him.<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember that the code is the least important part of a game&#x27;s success. The code just makes it work, it&#x27;s the plumbing, not the architecture. The days when clever programming could make a game are long, long gone - now, code is only notable when it breaks. What makes a game successful is design, artwork, production, the things the player engages with and cares about.<p>No, sorry.. what makes a game <i>successful</i> is mostly luck, but a game won&#x27;t have a chance to be lucky without the rest of it.')
