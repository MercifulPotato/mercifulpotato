It&#x27;s possible her paper was perfectly benign, with minor issues, and she handled the <i>response</i> to the minor issues in a &quot;we accept your resignation&quot; kind of way.<p>For an extreme example: I could say &quot;I got tazed and arrested for doing 5 mph over the speed limit&quot;. That sounds insane. That cop should be fired and in jail! What I haven&#x27;t told you is: I <i>was</i> doing 5 mph over the speed limit, and I was just going to get a warning from the cop, but I became combative and tried to physically fight the cop, at which point I got tazed and arrested.<p>It&#x27;s also possible she was fired for the paper. But she has published many papers while at Google without issue, so it would have to be something stunningly different than her previous papers.')
