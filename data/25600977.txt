This was a fun project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;damiankao&#x2F;81b6ebd123b9ccf98e0e47f1ddd3ddd5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;damiankao&#x2F;81b6ebd123b9ccf98e0e47f1dd...</a><p>This is a naive probabilistic method that calculates probabilities of base change according to base position in codon, base, and amino acid of codon. Then it applies the probability to the viral sequence to generate a vaccine sequence.<p>The sequence generation is not deterministic. It appears to generate ~87% matching vaccine sequence most of the time.<p>*edit<p>I just realized the blog post was calculating % matching of codons, not the base-pair sequences. In which case, my method is ~66% matching.')
