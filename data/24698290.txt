Modern encryption means that anyone on the planet can send a message to anyone else on the planet without fear of government decryption in transit (asymmetric public keys, Tor, PGP, pick your tools).  Using freely available tools I can encrypt a file on a USB drive in a way that even an NSA data center running for a billion years wouldn&#x27;t decrypt.
