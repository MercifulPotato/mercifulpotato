Without subsidies, some farmers may become insolvent, but either they will be able to restructure their debt or someone will buy the operation with a cheaper cost structure. Aren’t the same principles at play as in oil extraction or production of any other commodity? If production drops, prices will go back up, and someone will produce to meet the demand. Certainly this would be a cold reality for family farmers, but I don’t see how it results in the US not having any food producers.')
