Problem is, sometimes you want interactive elements in your document (like navigation menus), and sometimes you want a layout that is precise but is also responsive to the browser width, and sometimes you really want a native application that works on all platforms that people don&#x27;t have to download (and update) something special. HTML and semantic web get less and less useful as you go down that list. Flutter is trying to solve the cross-platform application problem. If your problem is well-addressed by a document, then you don&#x27;t have the same problem that Flutter is solving, so yeah, you probably won&#x27;t like it.')
