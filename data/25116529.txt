That&#x27;s the 311th day of our 365-day leap-year 2020. Thus naively scaling the 77,300 number to the full year would predict ((365&#x2F;311) * 77300 =) 90,721 deaths in 2020. That&#x27;s higher than 5 of the shown previous 10 years.<p>But also, the deaths as of November 6 may not be a complete total: often such data series continue to be updated (increased) for a few weeks after the calendar date.<p>And further: looking at US figures for 2017, November tends to have about an average number of daily deaths, but December is one of the deadliest months, with about 15% more deaths-per-day than is typical in the lowest-deaths Summer months of June-July-August.<p>So even my extrapolation to 90,721 is likely to be a <i>floor</i> on the true end-of year number, if lagged reporting or a typical December death acceleration means these November 6 numbers aren&#x27;t an accurate sample for the full year. (And that&#x27;s not even counting the Covid-19 case surge happening now in Sweden as with most of Europe.)<p>Everyone trying to draw final conclusions from Sweden is making a call too soon based on incomplete data. We probably won&#x27;t truly understand whether Sweden is on-net a Covid-19 success or disaster until retrospective analyses balancing all factors in late 2022 or 2023.')
