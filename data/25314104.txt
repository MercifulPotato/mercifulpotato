It really is just about the experimenter (plus apparatus) becoming entangled with the experiment -- or entering into a superposition with it, if you will. That&#x27;s it. No spooky consciousness, etc. goes into it. One&#x27;s consciousness simply enters into the superposition.<p>(If you can&#x27;t tell, I fully subscribe to the Many World interpretation. AFAICT it&#x27;s, by quite a long way, the most parsimonious explanation in terms of extra &quot;theoretical stuff&quot;, even if it is &quot;wasteful&quot; in terms of the amount of actual stuff it posits.)')
