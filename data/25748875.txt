All viewpoints and thoughts are equal before the law; only actions can be prosecuted.<p>&gt; We need to stop pretending like everyone&#x27;s viewpoint is equal and we shouldn&#x27;t exclude people for what they believe. Violent racists should be ostracized and pushed out of society. People who choose to have those kinds of beliefs are a constant threat to the safety of people around them.<p>I will hard disagree with this every day of the week. To me this is a clear example of how ideology has taken the place of religion in today&#x27;s society. It&#x27;s no longer enough for you to be civil and respect the laws, but even having the wrong thoughts is considered criminal, just like lust and envy are considered sinful in religion.<p>We&#x27;re heading in a dark direction if we&#x27;re re-adopting the same principles and perspectives that were behind McCarthyism, let alone used to burn witches and conduct the Inquisition.')
