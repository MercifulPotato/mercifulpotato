This is how trades are offered for free.<p>Why?  Because they know that they can buy those shares at some reported price then trade them on their own books then sell them at a price sufficiently different from the reported price that they make a profit.<p>This means that HFT is explicitly getting &quot;in front of retail&quot; and is actually trading at a price different from what retail hears about.  That difference goes where?  Oh right.  Right into the pockets of HFT and out of the pockets of retail investors.')
