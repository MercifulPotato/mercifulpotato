Does he really think &quot;big O&quot; is all there is, presumably because those ivory tower compsci people have no clue about computers?<p>Hi!  I&#x27;m the author.  I do have an ivory tower compsci degree. I&#x27;m poking fun at myself as much as anyone else.<p>&gt; There are some good bits of advice in the article, too, though.<p>Thanks!  &quot;Everything Sysadmin&quot; is my 3x&#x2F;yearly column in ACM Queue.  My goal is to bring a bit of operational reality to an organization with a reputation for being ivory tower.  Click on the phrase &quot;everything sysadmin&quot; to see the other columns I&#x27;ve written.<p>&gt; So, when you are using C&#x2F;C++, &quot;small&quot; for this problem is a billion elements.<p>I know, right?  &quot;Small&quot; has gotten so big that we have to re-think our gut reactions and recalibrate our back-of-the-envelope estimations.  Just imagine how big small will be for the next generation of developers?')
