The &quot;New Mathematics&quot;, they called it. I remember encountering talk of sets and functions in UK primary school circa 1975.<p>It never worked very well in practice. I expect that when you&#x27;re fortunate enough to have unusually able teachers teaching unusually able pupils it might do OK -- but then, in that situation, <i>anything</i> will do OK.<p>(Tom Lehrer fans will know about this from his song &quot;New Math&quot;, with &quot;It&#x27;s so simple, so very simple, that only a child can do it&quot; in the refrain.)')
