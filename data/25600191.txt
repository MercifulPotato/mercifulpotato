But on the outside, it’s very simple and clean, just a simple square building. Some people have even likened the reception area to a hospital waiting room. It’s kind of serene.<p>I can attest!  Just like a hospital.<p>You can also see a glimpse of it from the nearby train station.  A quiet unsuspecting almost industrial part of Kyoto; away from the more touristy areas.  Perhaps for a reason; unlike many parts of Japan it isn&#x27;t necessarily a convenient walk-to - so better maybe to have a taxi drop you off nearby.<p>And then when you arrive up close; a sublte Nintendo logo adourns the gated entrance - where the boring square shaped building presents itself.<p>Also one day, many months later - walking casually in Osaka in an area not too far from the busy Umeda &#x2F; JR Station.  I saw an interesting looking blue and white sign atop a commercial building amongst mostly residential apartments...<p>I asked my friend at the time what the Kanji meant.   To my surprise, &quot;Nintendo&quot; she said.  It was neat moment because at the time I was living in the area and had been for fair while - and all that while did not realize my childhood idol Nintendo was right there in the neighbourhood too.  I just assumed they always display their romaji logo &#x2F; classic font name but apparently not for this office, which was quite large as I recall; among the tallest &#x27;medium sized&#x27; towers in a rather dense area.')
