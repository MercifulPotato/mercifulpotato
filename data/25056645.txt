The only thing that seems different is that it seems to be more common (but <i>not</i> any more or less <i>supported</i>, since you can obviously have named non-async functions and you can also have anonymous async functions) to call named functions in async&#x2F;await and anonymous functions defined inline as callbacks with promises.')
