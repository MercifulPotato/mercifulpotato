Should I be punished for not seeing thru the lies that Amazon shows in their website? I don&#x27;t think so. Don&#x27;t blame the victim, blame the scammer.<p>Who was the victim here? The OP was a repeat buyer, implying he already had the item and was satisfied enough to buy it again. Hardly sounds like a victim.<p>Look, I&#x27;ll rewrite what I wrote earlier but more simply: Paying for good reviews = bad. Posting a good review to get paid for it = bad. There are approximately 12,000 bad people in the scenario this thread is about.<p>But there are platitudes and there is real advice. The platitude is &quot;scammers are bad&quot;. Very good, I agree with that. The advice is to be cautious where you spend your money, and be aware of who you&#x27;re giving it to. That is the consumer&#x27;s choice. You can choose to give it to the no-name company you&#x27;ve never heard of who just-so-happens to have more reviews than any other item for the search term &quot;webcam&quot;, or, you can choose to buy the Logitech for a little more.')
