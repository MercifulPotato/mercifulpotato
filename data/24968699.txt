I am absolutely not talking about mopeds (small motorcycles).<p>I very much do not want motorycles or mopeds or even fast electric bikes (which can weigh nearly as much as the rider) on bike paths.  A scooter&#x2F;step weighs about 15kg, and more importantly, most of its weight is very close to the ground.  It might knock your feet out from under you if it hit you, but it won&#x27;t crush your ribs or head unless you&#x27;re already lying on the ground.')
