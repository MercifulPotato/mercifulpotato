On the other hand, this is a network effect, and the Nest, in its current incarnation, is only 3 weeks old. It&#x27;s getting better every day, though.<p>The two main features I&#x27;m working on at the moment are:<p>- CI&#x2F;CD. This is almost ready to go, it is &quot;sort of&quot; working. One issue that I fixed recently is that Pijul versions are tricky to compute: change A, followed by B, is the same state (guaranteed by design) as B, followed by A. Our version identifiers handle that now (try `pijul log --state`).<p>- Social features, like discoverability, recommendation of collaborations. We&#x27;re really just getting started at this, and figuring out what works best.<p>I should add that until two weeks ago, the Nest would stop accepting connections at random times, or crash. It&#x27;s much more stable now, and we can finally think of adding features.<p>&gt; Secondly, it is much less mature ass a platform<p>There are tags for issues. You can configure them in the &quot;Admin&quot; page of your repositories. They&#x27;re not used very much for Pijul itself, because most issues so far have been closed within minutes or hours after their creation.<p>&gt; Which is a mind twise of an idea. But they say they solved it, so nice.<p>As one of the authors, I can tell you it wasn&#x27;t easy to get everything to work together, especially for conflicts. But the theory is clear and sound now (and I have good confidence that the implementation is, too): any two patches that could have been created independently can be pushed to a remote repository independently from each other.')
