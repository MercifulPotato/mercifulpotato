One alternative would be to pump water up out of another reservoir downstream, but there might not be one. So, just put a big air bladder on the bottom of the reservoir and pump air in.<p>Same applies for offshore wind power.<p>About half the energy you put into a pressure vessel becomes heat that you would not get back, under water. (But rock is an excellent insulator.) With enough spare water, you can draw almost the same amount of heat back in on discharge. Or, you might have a use for cold air.')
