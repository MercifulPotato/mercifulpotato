I make things simple. I&#x27;m a luxury eCommerce automation specialist. I have done reasonably well for myself throughout the pandemic because I have focused on establishing a culture of transparent communication and reduction in manual workload. My background is in stochastic processes. I use machine learning, data science and quantitative financial mathematics to basically get a grip on chaos. I&#x27;ve built products that eliminate the need for frontend developers. I&#x27;ve designed frameworks that automate data scientist pipelines. I&#x27;ve formalized models that allow you to beat the market without doing anything at all. My goal is simple, we should all be doing less and making more.<p>I&#x27;ll let you know up front, I&#x27;m more interested in consulting opportunities. I do not think it is cogent to lockdown into any long term arrangement for either party if you want some flexibility to adapt to the situation. It&#x27;s entirely my prerogative not to make a quick or easy buck. I want to be helping the right people do the right thing so that we can support people who need it. I have spent most of my leisure time donating my services to helping nonprofits and organizations poised to serve communities that are vulnerable and in need.<p>Our time and attention is our most precious and scarce resource. I want to use mine to help the people who are struggling build a future which will provide them the support they need to survive. The calvary is not coming.<p>Feel free to reach out to me, even if you don&#x27;t explicitly have an opportunity or are just interested in chatting. I am here to help you.<p>Email: info@odomojuli.com')
