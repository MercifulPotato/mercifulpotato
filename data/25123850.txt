IMHO it is the perfect compliment to the command-line interface since it provides a nice visual model of your commit graph and branches. The graph is interactive so you can use the GUI for things like merging, rebasing, cherry-picking, etc (very nice for visualizing those changes). But at the same time, the Ungit interface mostly just stays out of your way unless you need it. It does not try to force you into a certain workflow or usage pattern.')
