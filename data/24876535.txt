I believe the master, v14.x, and v15.x branches are diverging anyways, each with their own development. They snapshot the master branch at some times into a new branch as the next master version, and do patches on that branch. So multiple branches are concurrently being developed. But the master branch, not v15.x, would be the canonical &quot;develop branch&quot;.')
