I&#x27;m motivated to start a few side projects to see if I&#x27;ve that streak in me, but I need some clarity , and wanted your inputs on the below questions :<p>1. Is it possible to build and sustain a SaaS business as a solo founder ? For a medium sized project (say something like asana&#x2F;trello), how long would it take from start-&gt;finish (MVP which can be monetized) if one spends around 20 hours on a weekend?<p>2. Does one have to be super smart in the algorithms&#x2F;data structures&#x2F;programming language and&#x2F;or a domain expert to take care of both development &#x2F; customer requirements&#x2F;support etc ? A feature like adding a new way of auth take at-least 2-3 weeks to complete at large enterprises with multiple folks working full time.  What chance can an individual have against these large companies?<p>3. Is it a good idea to spend 2-3 months on learning the tech, and then start on the side project ? I&#x27;m asking this, since with a full time job , one can only expect some 2 hours a day and around 8 hours on a weekend, if most of that is spent on stack overflow,then the progress would be really slow.<p>4. Since monetization is tricky and not guaranteed, is it a good idea to simply work on the side project to amplify job opportunities? Or is it best to give it all as if there&#x27;s no plan-b ?<p>5. Lastly, what&#x27;s the primary reason to go and start your company instead of say spending the same 20+ hours on getting better at your current job&#x2F;seeking a better job in the same field at a better company ? Isn&#x27;t the latter more secure&#x2F;stable option ?<p>Sorry if some of the questions sound obvious &#x2F; cliched. But I wanted a fresh take on some of the above questions that has been brewing in my head for a long time. Thanks in advance :)')
