I claimed that Kickstarter specifically unionised because of extremism, namely, the belief that it&#x27;s essential to help fund those advocating violence against conservatives (or really, anyone who isn&#x27;t Marxist). I also claimed that other SV tech firms that unionise will probably do so for similar reasons, rather than the classical (non extreme) reasons that affect everyone like wages or working conditions.')
