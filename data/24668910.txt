(And much of that quality information is gated behind proprietary walled gardens, or is monetized through adware and spyware.)<p>Not to mention the modern trend of burying five bits of useful information in an 8 minute video, the first two minutes of which are pointless small talk and requests to like&#x2F;subscribe&#x2F;follow, and the other six are an unsearchable morass that takes way too long to get to the point.<p>The internet does two things better - searchability, and multimedia. The rest is a hot mess of largely superficial depth, and dubious quality.')
