But it&#x27;s easy to taste a wine and say &quot;this is earthy&quot; or &quot;this is fruity&quot; or &quot;this is peppery&quot;.  Earthier wines tend to be from grapes that are in more mineral present soil. Have you been wine tasting in a major region before? It&#x27;s actually a fantastic experience.  There&#x27;s so much complexity in wine flavor.')
