(Gary if you&#x27;re reading this I enjoyed your feed!)<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any good OSS examples, either.<p>I think React and Redux are in a way an implementation of these concepts. React is a view layer that sends messages and each component is (ideally) a pure function of state, and sometimes its own history. It&#x27;s so, so easy to unit test the interactions.<p>Hooks make it a little harder to reason about, and it&#x27;s unfortunately easy to write hooks that perform IO and you suddenly end up in a miasma of difficult-to-test code where you have to return to using a mocking library to &quot;replace&quot; IO functions with fake versions, and then you&#x27;re on a slippery slope again toward mixing interaction and mutation in one layer.')
