These are computers on your head. I don&#x27;t mind replacing the whole unit. But you don&#x27;t even have to replace them entirely...Apple will replace the battery for $79. So if after 5-10yrs, you wanted to get the battery replaced, you can.<p>It&#x27;s almost like people on HN have never bought noise canceling headphones - none of the top models have user-replaceable batteries.')
