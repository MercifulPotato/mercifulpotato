Then what, you hope it doesn&#x27;t break?<p>Master-master Postgres is significantly fiddlier and less well-tested than Kafka. And what do you gain? Fiddlier APIs and a query language that makes it easy to deadlock yourself with no warning or write queries that will run for months.<p>Just use Kafka unless you&#x27;ve got a good reason not to.
