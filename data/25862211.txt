If you <i>really</i> want to pin at a specific image, you need to specify the image hash, rather than using the &quot;latest&quot;, or even a version tag (e.g. &quot;2.1&quot;).<p>In your image that extends from the base image, you&#x27;ll typically update the package repo cache (it is typically cleared after building the base image, to reduce the size), then install whatever packages you want.<p>Like you, I don&#x27;t see a particular issue with updating system-level packages - especially from a security standpoint.')
