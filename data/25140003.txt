It should regard only how things could be improved when related situations comes up in the future (and in an achievable way).<p>3. on the receiving end, I also think you should demand that negative feedback is constructive - rather than wallowing in the negativity, you can normally train people to give you more useful and productive feedback. If the problem is something you can&#x27;t do anything about, it&#x27;s useful to identify that and reflect it back.<p>People are much more receptive to constructive negative feedback if they know that you&#x27;re recognising their positive efforts and have understood a more complete context.<p>I&#x27;ve observed that people who say they dislike the hamburger method will still respond positively to it, compared to bluntly negative feedback.')
