Some suggestions:<p>- Let me toggle this on and off by clicking its icon (hijacking the double click on every site I visit is both intrusive and annoying);<p>- Better yet, don&#x27;t inject any script until I activate it;<p>- Please, don&#x27;t pollute my JS console with debug and other logs (find a way to turn it off in production version) :)<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think you had a great idea with this extensions. You just needs to polish it up a little bit.')
