Item(by='ScottBurson', descendants=None, kids=[25183215], score=None, time=1606093733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172526, text='People with strong eyeglasses (more than 3 or 4 diopters positive or negative) may find wide-gamut monitors hard to use for text.  The problem is that chromatic aberration is wavelength-dependent; the larger the difference in wavelength between two photons, the greater the angle between the paths they take when they pass through the lens.  (Except at its optical center, the surfaces of the lens aren&#x27;t parallel, so there&#x27;s a prism effect, which increases toward the edge of the lens.)<p>These wide-gamut monitors have both a deeper red source (longer wavelength) and a deeper green (shorter).  So the red and green peaks are quite a bit farther apart -- possibly as much as 80% -- than they are with a standard CCFL or WLED backlight.  Combine that with high-index plastic lenses, which have higher dispersion (a measure of chromatic aberration) the higher their refractive index, and you can get a real problem.<p>Since my correction is about -6.75 diopters, and I have wide-gamut monitors, I had a pair of glasses made with CR-39, a relatively low-index plastic with low dispersion, almost as low as that of glass.  CR-39 is generally not used for such strong lenses because they would need to be thick at the edges, but this problem can be minimized by making the lens round in shape and not too large.')
