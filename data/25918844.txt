I think it&#x27;s easy to frame this as a &quot;selfishness&quot; issue - and I&#x27;m sure a lot of people who voted for Brexit just wanted to get rid of immigrants. That&#x27;s not my case, as I&#x27;m an immigrant myself (and son of immigrants in my mother country).<p>I think we shouldn&#x27;t have centralised form of governments because the more you move the problem away and try to generalise it, the more you end up with solutions that upset a minority of your consumers.<p>If we take a democratically elected government that follow through with their promises, you&#x27;re not upsetting a majority of your consumers, but you will likely upset a minority.<p>On top of this, by centralising problem solving, you create a machine that has an excuse to be fed with everyone&#x27;s money. And you can be sure a percentage of that, will be spent just on the inefficiency of the machine, which derives from not having competition and market forces driving down the price.<p>The best solution to make everyone happy is then to have a society where any combination of rules is possible. People can naturally cluster based on the rules they like and make some compromises based on that.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should have anyone imposing laws or taxing someone else. We can get by with services provided by private companies. Private Health Care, private Protection Services, private Courts, private contracts between individuals. Voluntarily provided donations to aid those who have no money.<p>If you put my anarcho-capitalist society on one extreme and the Soviet Union on the other, you can see that having a government per country is somewhere in the middle - and, IMHO, it&#x27;s bad enough; having a single Union for several countries where the rules are all the same and decided by democracy, means moving more towards the Soviet Union model, where even more people are unhappy.<p>If the problem is having import taxes and bureaucracy between countries, just get rid of them, you don&#x27;t need to shift power far away to solve that.<p>If the problem is that moving across countries is too complicated, just get rid of restriction, you don&#x27;t need to shift power far away to solve that.<p>I&#x27;m not happy with the world we have, and I know many people who believe in the European project are not happy as well.<p>Still, I think the solution is LESS government, not MORE.')
