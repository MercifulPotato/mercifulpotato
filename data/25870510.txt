It is very common to see trivial backdoors, massive amounts of data collection, and plaintext protocols. For situations where the developer is being security conscious, the language barrier often means that reports of concerns are either ignored or misinterpreted.<p>It is often the case that software developed outside of China, for devices produced in China is alright, but on the other hand many companies like Honeywell simply contract all of their software development there as well, and it painfully shows. I shouldn&#x27;t be able to buy a product in 2020 that has a linux kernel from 2012 and multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities just from public CVEs, but the Honeywell Tuxido security system managed it with ease.')
