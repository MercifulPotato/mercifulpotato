Which produce the biggest market capitalizations.<p>But long term planning is still mostly done in Europe as it&#x27;s considered too expensive almost everwhere else in the world, particularly in the states where remnants from the cold war makes the concept of the government pooling money to fund big projects a politicaly incorrect idea.<p>So the next logical step will be that like last time Americans will not produce anything meaningful for next 20 years which will give the time to Europe to capitalize on their previous innovations and to produce the next generation of ideas, and the cycle will repeat.<p>But if we wanted to increase the pace of those innovations, some bipartite solutions could be imagined...')
