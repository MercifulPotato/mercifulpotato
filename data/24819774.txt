Item(by='petecooper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603043933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819451, text='&gt;Does Adguard work better&#x2F;differently to justify the cost?<p>I can&#x27;t comment on better as I haven&#x27;t used either of those products in anger or recently, but Adguard installs itself as a system app, not a browser plugin, and it just works. It&#x27;s become a standard install on new computers when I set them up. The only side effect I see of an average day is <i>some</i> pages taking a second or two longer before the first paint, presumably due to the quantity of ads removed.<p>For where I am, the cost of an evergreen licence for a single seat is less than an hour of work, it looks after itself, and I only see ads in Tor. Well worth the $.')
