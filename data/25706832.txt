Item(by='natsup123490', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610238886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25705030, text='&gt; We must have law and order<p>Absolutely<p>&gt; that requires accountability for Trump and his enablers.<p>Absolutely not. It&#x27;s words like that that truly frighten me. Have you lost your good sense?<p>What truly worries me is this part: &quot;his enablers&quot;.... what exactly are you saying? That voting for Trump was a crime? That supporting Trump was a crime? That protesting for Trump (but not engaging in violence nor tresspass) was... what.. Terrorism (as the media is now trying to suggest)? No, no it was most definately not. It is very dangerous to use loose words like this which can be interpreted in too many ways, especially now. If you mean to say that Trump committed a specific crime and had co-conspirators, explain it that way and name the conspirators. Otherwise you are going to have a huge percentage of the population believe that you intend to &quot;round them up into camps&quot; or &quot;line them up against the wall&quot; or other things that other very dangerous people have tweeted. Trump supporters will defend themselves, potentially pre-emptively (just like how the war between the states started) and nobody wants that.<p>I don&#x27;t associate with a political tribe, I didn&#x27;t like Trump, and I left America long ago. But I&#x27;ve cautioned my mother who still lives there and who supported Trump all the way (she believes all the nutty theories, but isn&#x27;t a bad person) that she needs to plan an escape route into Canada. Because I truly fear for her life at this point. Biden and the media keep wrongly using the word &quot;Terrorism&quot; in order to (I&#x27;m quite sure) invoke special governmental powers that allow them to suspend all civil and human rights from... who? ... all Trump supporters?  And PATRIOT-ACT V2 has landed, all premeditated and prepared, ready for a huge draconian power grab.<p>Nobody has demonstrated that Trump has committed any crime (AFAIK). I&#x27;m sure there will be attempts. But nobody has even pointed to a credible suspected crime (AFAIK). Well respected constitutional lawyers like Alan Dershowitz have weighed in with clear opinion that Trump doesn&#x27;t need to pardon himself because he has not committed any legally cognisable crime.  And that his speeches were not incitement to violence... and Alan gives a long history of speeches that resulted in violence... and America has always punished the violence doers, not speakers, being extremely hesitant to invoke &quot;incitement to violence.&quot;  In this case it&#x27;s laughably far from such.. he said walk, he urged peace, he only called for a protest.<p>But I&#x27;m positive many people will attempt to &quot;require accountability for Trump.&quot;  Go ahead, do so via the court system using the laws of the land. Both political tribes will support that.')
