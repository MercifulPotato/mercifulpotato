Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608069232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434502, text='&gt; Splitting hairs over the semantics of the word &#x27;journalistic&#x27; is an attempt to discredit the study about authoritarianism being at an all time high in the U.S.<p>Those two things are not the same, and in many ways aren&#x27;t even connected within the context of this article.<p>1. The article&#x27;s definition of journalist would allow me to claim that I&#x27;m a journalist.   I would never consider myself as such, nor would any reasonable person, yet my photography has adorned the covers of published books, my writing has been published on respected news sites, and I&#x27;ve been invited as a speaker to conferences as an authority on a variety of subject matters.<p>&quot;Some track record of journalistic work&quot; is a very low bar, depending on the meaning of &quot;journalistic work&quot; and &quot;some track record&quot;.<p>&quot;self-identifying as a journalist&quot; is an even lower bar.<p>2. If you&#x27;d read the article, they even assert that half the incidents reported occurred to people not associated to any known or major media organizations and presumed to be freelancers.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just &quot;splitting hairs&quot;, the definition is central to the validity of their methodology.  Is there a problem with growing authoritarianism in the US? In my opinion, yes, unequivocally.  I&#x27;ve been discussing this matter in my circles for more than a decade.  The revelations from Snowden, the work the CATO Institute&#x2F;Radley Balko did on police militarization and brutality, no-knock warrants, asset forfeiture, etc. are all strong evidence of a persistent and growing authoritarian trend in the US.  That may or may not validate the evidence in the article, but the way the article states it&#x27;s evidence and methodology comes very much down to semantics about what it means to be a &quot;journalist&quot;, and that is not a decided question in 2020.  One can recognize and acknowledge growing authoritarianism in the US while at the same time pointing out flaws in the article and it&#x27;s associated study methodology.<p>I think it is not in good faith to try to tar people who bring up good questions about definition as &quot;splitting hairs&quot;, or being pro-authoritarian, or in other ways trying to straw man their position.  You can be anti-authoritarian, be against police brutality and the suppression of the press, have observed with your own eyes credentialed reporters being harmed and assaulted by the police in 2020, and still want to know with some specificity what this study considers to be a &quot;journalist&quot; for the purpose of reporting their stats.')
