What I don&#x27;t like about paying $18&#x2F;mo for Youtube (family) is that they are still collecting truckloads of data about me and using it to target MORE advertisements.<p>If I pay for a service, it my expectation that you provide me a way to opt out of your additional revenue opportunities. To that end, $18&#x2F;mo for premium is gouging, in my mind. The fact that Youtube is implementing even more ads tells me the service is bleeding customers or cash, maybe both, and Google is handling this by making the barriers HIGHER.<p>Google has their hooks deep enough into most people - charge $3.99&#x2F;mo for an ad-free experience and grow the subscriber base.')
