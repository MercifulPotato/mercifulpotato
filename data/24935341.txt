You&#x27;re making a leap of logic there. It&#x27;s the same thing as saying &quot;we can neither confirm nor deny&quot;.<p>The &quot;Senate Committee&quot; you speak of is chaired by Ron Johnson, who is a staunch Trump ally and again, a rank partisan.<p>In order for the general public to have any degree of trust about this, there is going to have to be some authority who is at least not a partisan who can speak with authority to actual facts. Not vague &quot;assurances&quot; with no evidence. This issue is way too political to trust Republicans, especially after Benghazi (went nowhere after dozens of investigations by partisans) and Hillary&#x27;s e-mails (went nowhere after a whole year of hyping it up as the worst crime ever by a politician). This entire thing just smells like the next big Republican freakout over nothing.')
