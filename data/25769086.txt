Certainly more reasonable than extraterrestrials. I was under the impression that the radar data that concluded insane speeds was aggregated from multiple sources. If that&#x27;s not the case (as Mick seems to suggest), then I suppose it could be a radar glitch. And since the speeds and maneuvering of the object is the only thing that made it seem not man made to me, that falls too.<p>My point about &quot;something was there&quot; still stands though. I&#x27;ve heard other debunking comments that simply dismiss it as a video issue, and that is what grinds my gears.')
