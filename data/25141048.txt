I am also, like others here, in the process of writing my first &quot;book&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redis.pjam.me&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redis.pjam.me&#x2F;</a>. Mainly inspired by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.jcoglan.com&#x2F;building-git&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.jcoglan.com&#x2F;building-git&#x2F;</a>, rebuilding Redis, instead of git, in Ruby.<p>&gt; For my first few sections I wrote the code as I wrote the sections, but then Lak made the suggestion that it would probably be easier to write the code first and then write the chapter<p>I can echo this a thousand times, I&#x27;ve written the last three chapters this way and this has made a huge difference, wish I had known that earlier!<p>I will also add that it really made me learn so much because even though I thought I knew quite a bit about Ruby (I knew early on that I didn&#x27;t know much about Redis). So many times I found myself trying to explain something and realizing that I didn&#x27;t actually know how it worked and ended up spending hours (days?) researching the inner workings of said thing<p>PS: Using quotes around book mostly because that&#x27;s the imposter syndrome kicking in, I was calling it &quot;a series of blog post&quot; for a while, to kinda downplay it')
