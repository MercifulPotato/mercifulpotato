The first is so that you can manage your secrets and env vars in the same way in development as you do in production. Engineers focus a lot on doing this for code, but this hasn&#x27;t hit the env var space yet. The second is so that all your secrets live in one place. Doppler is your source of truth for secrets in the same way that GitHub is your source of truth for your code. Your developers pull from GitHub, Azure pulls from GitHub during a deployment, etc. This centralization allows for really smooth access controls and auditing.')
