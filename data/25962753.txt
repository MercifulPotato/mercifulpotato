Is that an expectation for me to act contrary to human behavior?<p>I have been having serious issues around this notion that everyone lies 500 times a day - that it normal and super common. I think I&#x27;m aware when I lie, and it usually amounts to something more like not sharing my full opinion so not to hurt feelings. But even that isn&#x27;t common.
