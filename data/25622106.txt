Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[25622217], score=None, time=1609685930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622059, text='&gt; Both forms feature &quot;implicit flow of control&quot;, contrary to Zig&#x27;s stated goals.<p>They absolutely don&#x27;t. All control paths are explicitly represented by syntax (no different from the hidden goto in a while loop -- it&#x27;s explicitly recognised by the while syntax); proof: you can draw all of them by just examining the syntax of the current subroutine, while knowing nothing about others. Exceptions, however, are implicit: any call, foo(), might or might not cause some control flow change in the client without there being any explicit acknowledgement of that by the client; you cannot draw all the flow paths just by examining the syntax of the current subroutine.')
