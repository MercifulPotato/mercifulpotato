Lubuntu now comes with LXQt and is surprisingly robust.<p>Default applications on Lubuntu are all Qt apps, fast and memory efficient. Falkon Web Browser is great unless the websites use some weird JS and since there are several websites which do weird JS stuff I had to install Firefox too and with it increase memory by another 1GB to prevent hang ups(which still happen with Firefox occasionally).')
