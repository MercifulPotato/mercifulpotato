The file is originally simply an stream of MP3 frames written into a file without any structure and usually with technically invalid and undecodable frame at both ends (due to how MP3 compression works). Because it is originally designed for transmission across some kind of somewhat unreliable network, there are resynchronization structures in the stream and decoders tend to be able to ignore various kinds of totally invalid crap in the input data, this feature is exploited by all the ID3vX formats to essentially embed arbitrary data into the file. Several other commonly used &quot;MPEG something&quot; &quot;file formats&quot; are exactly the same thing.<p>This is somewhat ironic given the fact that quite large part of MPEG specification deals with various framing and metadata structures (on the other hand the overall architecture of all that is best described as &quot;overengineered&quot;, so ignoring it makes some kind of sense).')
