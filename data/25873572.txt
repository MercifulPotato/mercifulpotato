I mean, the reason I go with MTs is because I love how responsive it is.  I still giggle when I&#x27;m driving around at 4000 RPMs and punch the throttle to get that instant thrust.  Even with manual shifting modes on automatics, it&#x27;s not the same because the torque converters mute this responsiveness.<p>I&#x27;ve never driven a Tesla or anything, but I expect that they aren&#x27;t so hyper-responsive under normal driving conditions because it would be pretty fatiguing to drive.  Adding that back I think is must have for me to go full EV and not keep around a Miata or WRX for fun driving.')
