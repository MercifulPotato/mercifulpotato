Maybe WordPress.com but definitely not the self host option. Not if you want anything other than a vanilla install.<p>&gt; the client isnâ€™t programmer-savvy \n&gt; wants to make changes themselves and immediately upload them over FTP.<p>Why would you want a client who isn&#x27;t savvy to make changes themself? Advocating for cowboy coding for end users is trolling... unless you&#x27;re upselling a support package!? They can tweak things in the admin but I&#x27;d think long and hard before giving said client access to server files. Not to mention how easily end users mess things up by changing admin settings.<p>Having worked with such clients for 2 years, I gave up because at some point, the support burden was just too much!')
