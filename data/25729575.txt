There are a lot of additional features that I will be releasing soon as well :)<p>This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve told anyone about it, as I still have a lot of refinement to do, but I&#x27;m looking forward to early feedback!<p>I made a 20% off discount code for this thread - just enter HN20 at check out if you&#x27;re interested! Also, if you can&#x27;t afford it, just hit me up and I&#x27;ll hook you up ;)<p>Super excited! Happy coding everybody!')
