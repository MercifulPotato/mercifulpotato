In this case, however, you are a messenger repeating someone else&#x27;s representation of what might be the truth, without actually knowing the truth for yourself.<p>Thanks for the link though. Anecdotally, I wouldn&#x27;t say this chart matches my experience, so I will need to dig into their methodology to get a better understanding of how this has been determined. Though in all honesty I don&#x27;t read things like Breitbart or The Daily Wire, so maybe its just a case of survivorship bias, where the things I&#x27;ve seen linked have always been the least egregious due to the sites I actually do visit consistently (HN).')
