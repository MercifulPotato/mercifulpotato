We use space, a lot. The thing is, in terms of things we actually want to do, automated vessels work a lot better than manned ones. People who are focused on manned space missions aren&#x27;t focused on space, they&#x27;re advocates for one particular tech stack that&#x27;s extremely inefficient at doing the things we currently want to do in space.')
