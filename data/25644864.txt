Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25645206], score=None, time=1609849979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644655, text='&gt; Autonomy isn&#x27;t the only concern in moral actions (see cases of exploitation where autonomy is respected), and it&#x27;s certainly not the only concern in justice - the capabilities approach recognizes autonomy, but it also recognizes it is bounded by structural factors outside the individual&#x27;s control.<p>You&#x27;re free to form whatever opinions you like; the autonomy of other human beings is a <i>grundnorm</i> that is either respected because its a human right, or violated because the violator has some value they wish to impose on other humans who don&#x27;t share that value.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s beside the point, though. The market (the actors within it) does not, in many cases, produce just outcomes.<p>Perhaps I would agree. Thats still an agreement between persons about the affairs of others. It would be more unjust to interfere in the affairs of consenting, autonomous adults because we didn&#x27;t like their preferences.<p>&gt; Each party has the ability; in many cases, only one has the capability.<p>Thats why I specified <i>free</i> market. In a free market, by definition, parties are free to choose or decline to transact.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a structural issue with many employers and a far greater number of employees.<p>To the extent that is true, it is because of things that limit the spread of capital and reduce marginal profitability.<p>&gt; Something being mutually beneficial or a Pereto improvement doesn&#x27;t motivate me at all, because even mutually beneficial arrangements can be exploitative.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to explain why I would care that you think something is exploitation. A Pareto improvement means the parties to the transactions both improved their status, your opinion is not even relevant.<p>&gt; This is irrelevant to bargaining power; the employee can barter with his skills, of course, but not if they&#x27;re replacable (at a low cost or otherwise).<p>Of course, and with easily replaceable skills I&#x27;m at a loss as to why you think he would be entitled to a stronger bargaining position.<p>&gt; I agree, but the definition of exploitation as generally agreed upon or argued for is not &quot;subjective&quot;.<p>The generally agreed upon definition of exploitation certainly doesn&#x27;t include employment in a first world country.<p>&gt; The issue is employment in cases where bargaining power is low (structurally or caused by an actor). Starvation is only the worst case.<p>This is created by restricting barriers to ownership of capital so there aren&#x27;t competing employers.<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t decide that, it&#x27;s &quot;decided&quot; by the market<p>The market isn&#x27;t a thing, its just what we call the emergent decisions of all the market participants. The worker decides what his wage is worth when he agrees to sell it.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m also not sure why it would be a human right to decide that.<p>Because its a <i>grundnorm</i>. Slavery offends the morality of all decent people.<p>&gt; You can make all the decisions you want - and someone with more power can override them. If I dedide my labour is worth $100k, I&#x27;m laughed out of every office I step into.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re saying here. I&#x27;m suggesting that social norms that respect the autonomy of people are the ethical ones. Of course someone with power can steal your tools or your warehouse of products. That would be a scenario where my autonomy wasn&#x27;t respected. If your labor is worth $100k a year and no one wants it for that, then oh well. Maybe it&#x27;s not really worth that much? If its worth that much to you then don&#x27;t work. But if you want to live and eat and can&#x27;t make the wage that you want, well maybe your desires are larger than your entitlement.<p>&gt; What use is the right?<p>It would be a prerequisite to the demand.<p>&gt; By this metric there is no such thing as a &quot;need&quot;. That&#x27;s ridiculous, or I&#x27;m misinterpreting you.<p>Needs are contingent on goals. Given no goals, one needs nothing.<p>&gt; Marxian idea of a &quot;planned economy&quot;.<p>The left is collectively engaged in a process of pushing authoritarianism while claiming anarchism and it&#x27;s not really helping the working people with their struggle to survive, when all these people enable corporate dystopia by inviting known-to-be-corrupt politicians to collude with corporations in writing regulations that suppress competition, consumers&#x27; rights, and the working class. Marxians should probably read more Marx.')
