Item(by='zokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604857201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026617, text='&gt; but itâ€™s impressive that people could seriously entertain such out of the box ideas as recently as 100 years ago.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there was any other period in history than 1920 when this sort of thing could have popped up. It was exactly the period of time when people seemed to have been swept up by all sorts of incredibly idealistic&#x2F;weird&#x2F;outrageous&#x2F;revolutionary&#x2F;utopian ideas. This is the period when things like Communism, Anarchism, and places like Fordlandia seemed like a good ideas. Also notably League of Nations itself came from that period.<p>Also I&#x27;m not sure how seriously this idea was really entertained even at the time, and how much it was just regular crackpottery that happens to have survived.')
