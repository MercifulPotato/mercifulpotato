Notion markets itself as a general tool that can fulfill each of those use cases. As a result it is hard for them to come up with UX that fits everyone.<p>Some of the things people are saying here that they canâ€™t stand about Notion are some of the things that I like the most about it, and some of the improvements people are suggesting here are things that would make me abandon Notion if they changed it to be in line with what they suggest, and I think a lot of that is from difference in expected use case (I use it as a personal knowledge base)<p>It is definitely a weakness of their product.')
