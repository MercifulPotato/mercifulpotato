If we are able to purchase an open-hardware CPU and verify its integrity through hardware&#x2F;metrology checksums in addition to a software checksum, society will have made a step forward. \n    The hardware checksums might be expressed through moire-patterning visible in x-rays, for example. The CPUs on which such technology might be developed need not be fancy - if a proof-of-concept works on cheap chips, the extension to the high end is apt to be feasible.')
