Programs often reserve a lot more memory than they actually use (zero hit in performance) so memory stats are misleading, and the OS is really good at swapping memory not touched in a while to the SSD without you noticing.<p>Yes, sometimes it takes a couple seconds to switch to a tab I haven&#x27;t touched in Chrome in <i>days</i> because it&#x27;s got to swap it back in from the SSD.
