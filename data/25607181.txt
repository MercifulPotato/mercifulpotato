There are all kinds of ways you can misuse your property that will result in it being taken from you; in general all of us are fine with that. It&#x27;s legal to drink, and it&#x27;s legal to drive, but if you drink and drive you might lose property or your freedom, probably both.<p>What&#x27;s <i>not</i> fine is the government saying &quot;you purchased this legally and in good faith, but it&#x27;s not legal anymore and we&#x27;re going to need to take that&quot;. This feels like a good idea when it&#x27;s something with obvious negative externalities, but it is a wildly dangerous power to give the government. Especially since this power will almost certainly be delegated to the executive branch by the legislature, giving random un-elected appointees the ability to expropriate property without even a hint of deliberation.<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s probably an ex post facto issue anyways. You generally can&#x27;t punish people for something that was legal at the time that they did it. This is why various gun regulations almost always exclude all banned items that are currently in private hands, because attempts to take that property away would be unconstitutional.')
