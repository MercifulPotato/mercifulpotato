So, the midi-&gt;score conversion is indeed one of the harder parts, I spent a lot of time on that and I&#x27;m not yet satisfied with the results. There are quite a few ways in which this can be improved further, there is a long list of &#x27;todo&#x27;s&#x27; where I basically have worked out how to make the improvement but I have not yet gotten around to actually implementing it.<p>Midi is &#x27;lossy&#x27; in the sense that it flattens a bunch of knowledge about how a piece is to be rendered into note-on&#x2F;note-off pairs. You then have to do all kinds of tricks to even begin to approach what the score looked originally. Lots of enharmonically (identically sounding) combinations may have looked completely different on the original score, and when you start adding the various chord combinations it gets even more complicated. Even so, I&#x27;m strongly convinced it can be solved and we have made considerable progress on this already.<p>The &#x27;wiggle room&#x27; aspect of it has been addressed to some extent. For instance, we build up a map of all the notes that are sounding at a given time, and will ignore notes that are technically &#x27;wrong&#x27; but that are still sounding. This allows for much smoother restarts after mistakes.<p>Your final point is a bit tricky, but thank you for the hint, I will definitely add it to the list of things to look at to see if we can find a way to make that work.')
