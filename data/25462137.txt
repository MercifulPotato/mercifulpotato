Live frugally and save as much as you can.<p>During those 3 years do these things:<p>- Meet people. Specifically, technical people who are in other technical areas. Learn a little bit about what each of them does and how they do it.<p>- Treat your time away from your day job as time you&#x27;re working for yourself. Develop ideas, flesh them out, build prototypes, maybe an MVP.<p>- Learn about corporate financial statements: P&amp;Ls, Cash Flow, Balance sheet. This is important for analyzing your business ideas. Once you have a product or service concept, build a pro forma financial model and convince yourself whether the idea can fly as a business.<p>Once the 3 years is up, you&#x27;ll have seen a broader variety of &#x27;real world&#x27; problems to be solved, you&#x27;ll have met people who you might leverage in establishing a business, you&#x27;ll have a handful of ideas to choose from, and, you&#x27;ll have savings to sustain you while you put your shoulders into it.<p>Importantly, don&#x27;t force it, be patient and remain objective.<p>Good Luck!')
