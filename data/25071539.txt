My last couple vehicles have had Lane Keep Assist and Adaptive Cruise Control. I believe those two equate to about &quot;Level 2&quot; of autonomous driving. Whatever the technical definition is doesn&#x27;t matter though, the important point is that those two features alone make driving long distances so much less mentally taxing.<p>The Volvo system in particular is great... keeping your vehicle firmly in the middle of the lane like it&#x27;s on rails. Frankly, it&#x27;s better at that task than I am and only requires slight and occasional steering wheel input to stay engaged -- just enough to know you&#x27;re paying attention.<p>Before these systems, I&#x27;d be mentally exhausted after driving 2.5 hours to my parents house, especially if there was stop n go traffic and it took even longer. Since these systems, I arrive feeling mentally refreshed instead of drained. There is no way I&#x27;d buy a general purpose vehicle without these systems ever again and I look forward to any other ways that automated systems can augment my ability to drive safer, more precisely and with less effort.')
