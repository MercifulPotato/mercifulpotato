Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=[25240237], score=None, time=1606593501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239629, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t understand, so you don&#x27;t care and it&#x27;s okay if he cares, but if he says that people not caring is part of the problem then he&#x27;s an elitist? What is your argument here, that he has no grounds to point out the apathy toward the long-term impact of your decisions?<p>What problem? How do my decisions  to prefer one computer platform have any impact on GP or you or anyone? Apple turning the entire Mac line into iPads can’t and won’t eliminate more open platforms that you or GP may prefer. There’s no future inflection point where Apple has locked down the Mac platform in a way that enables them to storm into your home and replace your Linux computer (or whatever) with a Mac.<p>It’s <i>elitist</i> because the suggestion is that my preference represents an inability to evaluate the impact it has on <i>me</i>. It has no meaningful impact on you. It would have no meaningful impact on you if I decided to eschew all computing technology and go live in a monastery.<p>&gt; You go so far as to validate the things he&#x27;s concerned about and reiterate that you just don&#x27;t care about them. I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with pointing out the inherent shortsightedness of that line of thinking.<p>I am allowed to have different preferences and priorities. It’s not shortsighted, I see the compromise I’m making and I’m satisfied with what it provides in return. And since it in no way harms you or GP, it’s not your business to tell me to change my preferences.<p>&gt; Have you considered that those people understand basic human psychology and that they take issue with the exact priorities that they are speaking against?<p>Have you considered that taking issue with other people’s preferences and imposing your own is far more controlling than just accepting that some people like different things, even if their preferences are personally limiting in a way you’re not comfortable with for yourself?')
