Item(by='JVillella', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1611270218, title='Show HN: I hate waiting on hold with the bank so I made an app that waits for me', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;ve been dealing with banks, telehealth, and CRA a ton these days over the phone. I guess a lot of others have too since the hold times have been ridiculous. I built a little tool that waits on hold on my behalf and calls me when an agent is on the other line. It&#x27;s saved me some time so I thought I&#x27;d share it with others: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youcallme.io<p>I generated a few quick access pages for the worst offenders too: e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youcallme.io&#x2F;wayfair https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youcallme.io&#x2F;chase-bank https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youcallme.io&#x2F;jetblue-airways https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youcallme.io&#x2F;walmart and a bunch others.<p>Would love to hear if you find it useful for yourself')
