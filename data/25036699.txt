I was working for Bell at the time, as an Engineer. I have a degree in Engineering.<p>My MP told me to get a job at McDonald&#x27;s, Wal-Mart or Crappy Tire, because they have rubber-stamp approval for Permanent Residency, and that would be the best way. I&#x27;d just have to suck it up and earn minimum wage for 2 years.<p>Or be a student for four years. He had no idea how I was supposed to pay for that.')
