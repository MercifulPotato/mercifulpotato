They all return strings. That is the issue. What about subclasses or type wrappers? What about functions that return bytes or utf8 strings? How would you handle code that then calls “.startswith()” on a returned string&#x2F;bytes value?<p>A language pragma that fundamentally alters a built in type across all the code you have in a program is never going to work and pushes the burden onto library authors to support a large matrix of different behaviours and types.<p>It would make the already ridiculous py2 str&#x2F;bytes situation even more ridiculous.<p>&gt; They would obviously not be removed and still be available but depræcated.<p>Having two almost separate object models in the same language is rather silly.')
