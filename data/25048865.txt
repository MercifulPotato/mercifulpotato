When one person was screwing up, the other could not observe this. On a Boeing, each person would feel the other person&#x27;s force because the controls are physically linked.<p>The stall warning was designed for mild stalls, not severe stalls, and would turn off if the stall was really bad. They got into that state. Every time they reduced the stall, they would get back into the range in which the warning would alert. This caused them to go back into the worse condition, in which the stall warning just gave up.<p>The pitot tubes, used to sense speed, were prone to clogging with ice. Better equipment is expected on a large passenger plane.<p>That&#x27;s all the aircraft itself. If you want to blame the pilots for any of that, then Boeing can rightly say the same for 737 troubles.')
