Visibility within the company is just as, if not more, important. A common theme I&#x27;ve noticed regarding this in stories from Apple is people covering up&#x2F;scapegoating failing projects by lying to management, creating fake reports, fabricating data, etc. The con seems able to be kept up for a long time because there is only one person you need to fool or convince to not care.<p>At the less secretive companies I&#x27;ve worked at, where there are many-to-many dependencies and interactions, you&#x27;d never be able to get away with something like that because people will freely talk&#x2F;collaborate&#x2F;associate with people without going through management. Or people would just look at your source code and see that it&#x27;s all smoke and mirrors.')
