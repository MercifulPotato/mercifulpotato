I have winced about that being thrown at Trump ever since the incident - I think it was horrendously poor wording, but it was actually him in his own way attempting to unify people.<p>However at the same time I want to clarify that I&#x27;m talking here about a level of facts even more basic than that. That is still an interpretation of what he said but at least he said it. We have an even deeper problem right now where people believe things that are completely totally untrue. Things that are provably not true without any need to bring any interpretation into it.<p>For example, how do we have a reasonable discussion about how to fix social justice if one side believes most of Portland has been taken over by anarchists burning cars and smashing windows of every shop and the other things it&#x27;s a peaceful hippie commune covering a block and a half? Somewhere in there is an objective truth. If we can&#x27;t get to that, we&#x27;re never going to have a productive discussion about the underlying problems.')
