Who makes a living writing for a linux media outfit who will turn against the interests of those who pay his salary?<p>How do you know there is a choice for people if you don&#x27;t know the amount of bias there is in media what to project as &quot;mainstream&quot; and &quot;popular&quot;.   When Distrowatch a little while ago, run a poll, about init systems, systemd DID NOT come 1st, and its 3-4 top adversaries got 60% of the votes.  Based on this I&#x27;d say systemd is a little second class adversary that can only get newbs fooled to use it because that is what mass media tells them they should try.<p>Ubuntu,  Mint, Manjaro, Debian, Fedora.  This is what media is pushing down peoples&#x27; throats.')
