I thought they settled already but I guess this is still on going. Do you have more details on this? I really think Bitfinex&#x27;s defence is very weak and they could be charged with wire fraud and money laundering.<p>If what I hear is true then the drug cartels have been successfully using cryptocurrencies and bitfinex to allegedly launder their money and its participants and speculators may have played a role.<p>I expect many people to face the courts or head to jail.')
