How is that not market manipulation?<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t someone be allowed to lend out a security they own to someone else?<p>If not allowed, why wouldn&#x27;t I be allowed to make an agreement where I pay you the difference between a future stock price and some fixed value?<p>&gt; The difference is retail is going to win AND there&#x27;s no backroom deal to be made to stop the bleeding.<p>The backroom deal will be a phone call to the CEO of reddit, discord, disqus and similar and tell them to cut it out. Simple as that. No coordinating mechanism, this will die.')
