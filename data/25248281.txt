As far as I understand it userspace caching is necessary to cache <i>uncompressed</i> blocks, since the decompression is (presumably) done in userspace. I definitely could be wrong though, let me know if you&#x27;re talking about a different kind of kernel caching.<p>Actually, I guess if DwarFS is a kernel module and decompresses blocks before they hit the kernel&#x27;s filesystem cache, then the kernel cache would do it? I&#x27;m not sure how to tell from the README if DwarFS is a kernel module or not. So I guess I&#x27;m just confused and looking to learn -- what kind of kernel caching did you have in mind?')
