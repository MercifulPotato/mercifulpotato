That C extension uses AVX2 intrinsics. How well does Julia support intrinsics?<p>Even supporting something like __builtin_popcountll() would be nice, but <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rosettacode.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Population_count#Julia" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rosettacode.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Population_count#Julia</a> suggests that it&#x27;s not supported in Julia.<p>I&#x27;ve no experience with Julia and my attempt at finding this out on my own failed - does anyone here know about Julia&#x27;s support for intrinsics?')
