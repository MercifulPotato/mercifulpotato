Not going to make any corrections, so that you caan see what the state-of-the-art is right now, including bugging us (that supposed to be bugging this. Apparently it doesn&#x27;t recognize that word it&#x27;s the quality of being buggy).speech is my primary interface my computer due to health issues, and my God is it infuriating.it&#x27;s never going to really take off until it just works.<p>imagine if your keyboard had about a 2nd latency and every couple words got messed up in some way. Not only that, but those same words that got messed up are probably getting be messed up again when you try to go back and fix it with the same broken keyboard. you wouldn&#x27;t say that typing is nearly solved, you&#x27;d say that typing absolutely sucks and keyboards just don&#x27;t work.<p>I firmly believe that speech is going to be the main interface-actually want to scratch that last sentence, but correcting it is can the pain with voice. I firmly believe that speech is going to be a game changer of an interface, especially for coding, eventually. But until it stops sucking, it&#x27;s only can be used where where there is no other choice.<p>(By the way, this is me, a native English speaker with a standard salmon Cisco accent-that&#x27;s a standard San Francisco accent- dictating it on a many hundred dollar microphone into a many hundred dollar speech engine, speaking relatively slowly and enunciating the hell out of out of things.when I first started with that, it was even worse. and yet somehow a lot of people treat speech recognition as if it is in some way solved, or the error rate is better than human.or loader ship-that&#x27;s supposedd to be what a load of ship-whatever you see what I mean)<p>-----<p>(edit: After the fact, I decided to calculate the word error rate dictating thhis. About 7%. If you ignore the non-speech-related bugs, it&#x27;s about 4%, which is supposedly &quot;superhuman.&quot; take that as you will. my take is that &quot;human level&quot; is not the same as a human trying to work as fast as they can, and maybe not paying particularly close attention. And that 4% is ridiculously far from 0% in terms of usability)')
