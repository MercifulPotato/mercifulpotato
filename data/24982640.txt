I&#x27;m curious because I&#x27;ve been debating trying it out for some relatively simple stuff with GPIO pins and MQTT (largely just reading some sensors, enabling&#x2F;disabling some other pins based on those sensors, and submitting telemetry via MQTT).  MicroPython seems a lot faster to get up and running with, but I&#x27;m concerned that on such a small device that it&#x27;ll be prohibitive (but I&#x27;m also coming from a server background, so I may be overestimating how much slower these are).')
