The prior probability of voter fraud is so low that it demands really incredible evidence. When you frame it like &quot;vote fraud or not voter fraud&quot;, you&#x27;re implicitly lending a whole lot of credibility to something that is, well, not the least bit credible.<p>Also, to borrow from a completely different polarizing thread, you&#x27;re making a classic motte-and-bailey argument in record time. You start out broad - &quot;election fraud&quot;, a &quot;zero sum game&quot; that they <i>must</i> be cheating at - but by the end of the comment you&#x27;re already on, &quot;Okay, <i>not</i> election fraud, but there were votes that were incorrectly cast somehow, and <i>thats</i> what I&#x27;m actually upset about...&quot; which of course is obviously a defensible position that nobody would disagree with.<p>Another way to think about how silly this is: Can you conceive of a world were Trump and his supporters <i>don&#x27;t</i> claim there was fraud, but accept a Joe Biden win?')
