The limit was something you&#x27;d ordinarily think ridiculous even on cheap plans, IIRC I had 1000 texts&#x2F;month in the plan, and the equivalent for pre-paids was also very cheap. It turns out 1000 text messages a month is enough for everyone except teenagers in love.<p>Also I remember people in my circles laughing at Americans, because we believed that the US doesn&#x27;t have SMS service for some reason.')
