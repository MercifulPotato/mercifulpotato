Probably his entire childhood includes random things like private piano lessons at the critical young age for maximal value, which I obviously did not receive.<p>I&#x27;m already pretty successful relative to my peers.<p>He might be a billionaire instead of a millionaire because he &quot;made personal choices&quot; but his first million is much better explained by his handouts than by personal choices. &quot;Personal choices&quot; is such vague shallow and useless advice, it only tells me that he was smart enough not to blow it all on cocain.<p>They only water I can glean from this rock of a comment is that I should have chosen to be born in his family instead of mine.')
