The effects of carbon dioxide production are not simply a collection of linear relationships. One tonne of CO2 today doesn&#x27;t have just as much impact as one tonne of CO2 last year.<p>There are points at which ocean acidity levels become incompatible with certain forms of life. There are limits to carbon sinks. There are points at which positive feedback loops become active.<p>All of these things - and more - mean that there are very marked differences in the impact of the first coal fire and a steel plant (for a topical example) even after you normalize for the amount of carbon dioxide produced.<p>Presenting current and modern carbon dioxide production as simply a continuation of the first coal fire is at a minimum ridiculous.')
