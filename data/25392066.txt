When electric motors became available, they replaced that single giant coal engine with a single giant electric motor.<p>They got their lunch eaten by people who built new factories with electric motors at every station, distributing the power using wire.<p>These tractors are autonomous, you can have multiple tractors per operator.   5 50hp tractors are probably cheaper and more capable and easier to run by a single operator than a single 250hp diesel monster.')
