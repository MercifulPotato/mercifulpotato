If you&#x27;re not blindly following GPS navigation, and pay attention to signs and what&#x27;s going on around you, it&#x27;s not an issue.<p>I use Google Maps navigation from time to time and I get that it can be helpful negotiating new territory. Of all the newfangled gadgets in cars, that&#x27;s the one that has the most value, but it should be a supplemental tool; you shouldn&#x27;t be lost and hopeless without it.')
