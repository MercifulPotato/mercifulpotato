When asked why people are using nightly the largest reason was to use the Rocket web framework which has announced it will work on the stable version of Rust in its next release. The next largest reason for nightly was const generics, but with a minimal version of const generics reaching stable, we should see less of a reliance on nightly for this feature.<p>TL;DR: unless you&#x27;re doing certain specific things, stable Rust should work well for you.<p>Regarding rustup vs apt, you can absolutely install via apt if you want to. Depending on what version you get, you may or may not be far enough behind the rest of the world for it to be a pain. Which version you&#x27;ll get depends on the specifics of the distro.')
