Processing their vehicle includes opening&#x2F;closing doors to let them in, guiding the user to park accurately, rejecting vehicles that are too large, etc.<p>Basically, we&#x27;re looking to hire somebody to solve this entire experience (and is hands on).<p>Skills Required:<p>Off the top of my head, a hypothetical single person to execute on this would need to have many of these skills:<p>- UX&#x2F;product sense: They need to think from the point of view of the driver and make the experience intuitive.\n- software&#x2F;embedded engineer: They need to implement state machines to manage flows (e.g. sizing vehicle, rejecting vehicles, opening&#x2F;closing doors, etc.)\n- electronics&#x2F;mechatronics engineer: They should have some familiarity working with circuit boards or choosing the right sensors&#x2F;electronics to integrate with the state machine.\n- frontend software skills: They need to implement user interfaces and displays.<p>Discussion:<p>- Does the first hire for this vertical really need to have all of the above skills?\n- What type of companies or backgrounds would be good matches for candidates with the above skills? Is it mechatronics? Embedded engineer?\n- Maybe it really is necessary to split the hire into two hires? Frontend engineer + embedded engineer (but they need to have great UX sense)?')
