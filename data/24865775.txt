As a photography enthusiast, having trying out the app for a bit, I came to the conclusion that phone photography should be kept as simple as possible. While having advance options is great, the reason I carry a phone and not a camera on that certain occasion is because of its simplicity. I don&#x27;t want to mess with aperture, exposure or focusing, etc. while on the go. If I wanted to do that I would bring my camera. So, yet I think there will be people who&#x27;s excited for this kind of app, I see it has no use for me personally. It&#x27;s a nice app though, and no doubt there will be people enjoying it, but the default iOS app does a good job for what I want.')
