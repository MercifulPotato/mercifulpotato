It should be perfectly normal for either mother or father to stay home with their kids if they want and that preference should be respected absolutely.<p>But then you have to zoom out a little bit and ask why you see so few men become stay at home fathers or househusbands compared to women and is the explanation a problem? Why don&#x27;t men feel like they can be homemakers or take on the primary caregiver role for their kids? Why do so many women take on those roles? If the answer is really always voluntary preference then maybe it&#x27;s not an issue but that&#x27;s unfortunately not the case and the pressure and judgement imparted by society for people to conform to their &quot;roles&quot; creates this dynamic and is bad for everyone.')
