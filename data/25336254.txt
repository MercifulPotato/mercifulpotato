Unfortunately their home countries in most cases don&#x27;t want to accept them back or the migrants have &quot;lost&quot; their passports&#x2F;documentation before coming to the EU thus there&#x27;s no country to deport convicted criminals back to.<p>For the record, I as a Western&#x2F;Central European have nothing against immigrants, as long as they come here to work&#x2F;study&#x2F;lead law-abiding lives like it&#x27;s been done for decades. <i>However</i> coming here for no other reason than to be an eternal drag on the social benefit system and then on top of that committing crimes?<p>IMHO that <i>minority</i> (from TFA ~100 out of thousands for Denmark) of immigrants is not and <i>should not</i> be welcome in any country.')
