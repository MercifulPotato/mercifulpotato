I think it will be interesting to see how this will play out.<p>Then again, it might be sufficient to to code something in an LLVM-supported language of choice, then compile it to WASM and just hook it into Shopify, without needing to understand the WASM code that was generated. Good luck troubleshooting or debugging this though...')
