With some frequency the engineers would come up with a way to help people make a better buying decision. E.g., picking a TV is a problem, so they&#x27;d make a wizard that would ask you questions and then give you a recommendation. Problem solved, right?<p>Alas, no. Turns out most of these user guidance things wouldn&#x27;t help, because people had no reason to trust the thing. They might go through the process, but their behavior didn&#x27;t change. I&#x27;d expect to see the same effect with a kiosk. Most wouldn&#x27;t engage, and those who did wouldn&#x27;t weight the recommendation very highly.<p>A website would have an even deeper trust problem, and would add an SEO problem on top. Imagine a referral is worth $1 on average and you spend $0.50 on coming up with good answers, $0.49 on making sure you&#x27;re on the first page of Google results, and take $0.01 in profit. You&#x27;ll very quickly have a competitor with that spends $0 on research and $0.99 on being ahead of you on Google. Sure, their data will be garbage, but the page will be just as convincing to somebody who doesn&#x27;t know anything, which is your target market.<p>I suspect the real outcome, as with many would-be startups, is that this is a feature, not a business. Somebody like Wirecutter or Consumer Reports could turn this into solid content that would be a nice addition to what they have already. They&#x27;ve already built a trust relationship with their users, and they don&#x27;t have to specifically find people in the (very rare) moment of choosing a new medication.')
