Assume there is &#x27;top&#x27; and &#x27;bottom&#x27; of the sphere, don&#x27;t know how they do navigation in space, but assume it is like the usual earth maps. So how the things on the bottom get drawn to the earth, while they should go into the other side. Clearly there is something I don&#x27;t understand, but I don&#x27;t know what it is.')
