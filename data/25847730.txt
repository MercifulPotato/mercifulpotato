Because the Trump administration was so insane in so many ways, we tend to forget (or maybe misremember) that there is a very real and persistent form of corruption in our politics that far predates Trump. The end of the Trump regime does not mean the end of political corruption, not by a long shot, and we would do well to remember that.\nI think one of my biggest fears with Biden is that because he isn&#x27;t Trump, everyone will take a deep sigh of relief, and then ignore the more mundane &quot;political corruption as usual&quot; aspects of his presidency.')
