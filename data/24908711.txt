They add nuance, but it&#x27;s unclear if it will stick. The same happens for example with the rehabilitation of the Vikings, which were savages who built a culture, by any account, on pillage, rape and murder, supported by the archaeological record (the many burnt settlements) and the historical one (the many first hand accounts of the despair and fear they sowed).<p>The stability of the roman empire was a marvel. After incessant war within the borders during the republic, violence moved to the borders of the empire.
