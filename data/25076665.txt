(And they didn’t seem to mind; it’s great to find fellows interested in the same niche&#x2F;obscure topic!)<p>I was under the impression that it was a very deliberate choice for git to store&#x2F;show email, and part of participating publicly in a software project involves attaching a name&#x2F;email to commits. If one doesn’t want that exposed, then it’s okay to have some junk&#x2F;null value.<p>The worst thing would be for some automated software to weaponize this by mining email addresses from git repos and spamming them or selling them to marketers. &lt;this is why we can’t have nice things&gt;')
