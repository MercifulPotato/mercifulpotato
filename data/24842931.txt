Quick endorsement (no connection to company):<p>I discovered Retool fairly recently during a bout of frustration-with-our-designers-and-engineers-spending-too-much-time-on-internal tools.<p>We were fighting very very elementary bugs mostly because the people implementing our internal tools were just not thrilled about that work (vs. the customer-facing stuff) and there&#x27;s just a natural progression of common bugs when you&#x27;re building things from the ground up.<p>We are just about to launch our first full conversion from an internal tool to a Retool-powered one, and I&#x27;m super excited.  We were able to get the project to 0 backend engineers, 1 frontend engineer (who gets some help w&#x2F; SQL queries), and 1 designer who works directly in Retool (which, to be fair, isn&#x27;t as powerful as Figma, but that&#x27;s actually a good thing!).<p>And for the product guy (me), I can go in and tweak things without filing a ticket and waiting for a test-review-deploy cycle.  So the whole thing is just quicker and better for this use case.  Now our team can focus 100% effort (or, at least 99%) on the customer-facing stuff, which is where we&#x27;re adding the most value anyway.<p>Suffice to say I&#x27;m very pleased so far.')
