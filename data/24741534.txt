I&#x27;m used to it meaning &quot;one who denounces behavior in others while engaging in the same behavior themselves,&quot; which doesn&#x27;t seem to apply here, I think, since the person in question ceased engaging the behavior he denounces, and as you point out, we have no record of him denouncing anyone else doing it.)')
