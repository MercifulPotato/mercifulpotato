And, recursively, so is technology. That is why economists don&#x27;t claim all value is created solely by labor, and why econometrics measures the contribution of various components.<p>Where does Labor come from? From being taught skills - and that took capital to train someone before their labor could add value. All pieces are interrelated, and modern economies cannot work by ignoring that all pieces are <i>needed</i>.<p>&gt;The labor of knowledge workers, which is what software engineers are called by economists<p>And those knowledge workers did their labor with zero capital investment before by an employer (or themselves)? Computers, tools, infrastructure all were provided so the knowledge worker could work, and those pieces required capital before the knowledge worker could produce labor.<p>I have hard time understanding why so many people cannot accept that capital is a valid and necessary input to creating things, including creating more capital, which can then be invested in yet further productive pursuits.')
