From the outside Google management seems to endorse solidly left-leaning politics, so while anything is possible it seems unlikely that they objected to her views or activism. If they think she is toxic, it follows that they likely had actual reasons - and if there are actual reasons someone is a bad employee then they can be fired in my experience.<p>That lends some credence to the retaliation theory. If they can&#x27;t expel her for good reasons, grab the first half-baked opportunity.')
