By completing a degree, you will have demonstrated that you A) have a well-rounded education (thank you, general studies requirements!), B) have the ability to learn and apply critical thinking skills, and C) can stick with a project or program for 4+ years. That&#x27;s fantastic right out of the box!<p>Almost any white-collar job will have &quot;a Bachelors degree&quot; as a minimum requirement. Check! You&#x27;re already halfway there.<p>As for jobs and career paths, the truth of the matter is that 95% (or more!) of what you need to know on the job is something that you will <i>learn on the job</i>. In other words, if you have the capacity to learn and grow, you can and will excel in any field that you put effort into. Thinking about going into bioinformatics? Well, your computer knowledge will contribute and your math background will help, but most of the day-to-day work you can and will learn on the job. What about actuarial work? Once again your math and computer knowledge can come into play. In fact, your CS degree will help you with automating any digital aspect of <i>any</i> job. What about a salesperson? You&#x27;re good with numbers, you&#x27;re good with logic, and if you can learn a new programming language, you can learn anything. You&#x27;ll be fine.<p>You get the point.<p>Me? My degree is in Theatre, and I&#x27;m a Director of Engineering for a pretty large company. I&#x27;ve been working professionally in the tech industry for 15 years.<p>The critical thing to do is to look at your degree and ask yourself: What qualities do I have and what skills have I learned that are broadly transferable to any industry?<p>For example, in Theater, I was an actor and a director. What are actors required to do?<p>- Show up on time<p>- Work independently<p>- Work as a group!<p>- Take constructive criticism and direction<p>- Memorize vast amounts of material in a short period of time<p>- Be comfortable speaking in public<p>- Be a good communicator<p>- Be empathetic and able to put oneself into someone else&#x27;s shoes<p>- Be able to meet deadlines -- the show must go on!<p>- Be adaptive and able to tackle a wide range of problems, from flaking paint on a set to a broken costume to disruptions in the audience to poor ticket sales<p>- Be comfortable doing the same thing over and over for a long period of time (shows don&#x27;t run just once!)<p>I could go on... but consider this: <i>any</i> employer in <i>any</i> industry would wet their pants if a candidate walked in and could demonstrate those qualities right off the bat, right?<p>How many people are geniuses at C++ but can&#x27;t work with a group or take criticism or give a presentation on their work? Fat lotta good that C++ is doing when management is spending all their time putting out fires that this problem employee creates because they can&#x27;t follow rules!<p>That whole day-to-day thing? You&#x27;ll learn that on the job. We all do that, anyway. I&#x27;ve been working professionally in tech for 15 years, and I&#x27;ve never yet had a job where I didn&#x27;t spend the first month trying to figure out the company&#x27;s tech stack, administrative processes, people dynamics, and more. It&#x27;s just how the world works.<p>So don&#x27;t think of your degree as a finalized career option. Think of it as a ticket to an interview, as physical proof that you CAN learn and you CAN complete a project and you ARE someone that can do the job -- any job.<p>Good luck.')
