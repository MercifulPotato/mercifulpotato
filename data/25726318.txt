Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25726448], score=None, time=1610354679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726234, text='&gt; You can see them drag someone down the stairs in the first few seconds of the video and then you see them beating someone on the ground.<p>It looks to me more like flag-holding-man throws it away to help someone get up, who then joins the protestors. The police officer in the yellow vest is under the arch on the right on the start, away from where the protestors are doing whatever they are doing. When a bloke in black gets up off the ground he joins the protestors too.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is a video of protestors beating a policeman. If they were the video would probably have been more violent. I think the protestors might be helping the bloke in the blue jacket stand up at the start.<p>The intent of the mob is entirely comparable, at any rate. Protestors hurling stuff at police vs. protestors igniting stuff.')
