Just because you know trigonometry and someone 2000 years ago didn&#x27;t know trigonometry doesn&#x27;t mean that person is an idiot...<p>I agree there are many strangeties that are in the Bible that don&#x27;t seem to be plausible, and we should not accept them as fact, due to the nature of translating ancient texts and the corrupting influences of government and religions. You are right that certain stories shouldn&#x27;t just be believed or accepted without evidence. But you are wrong to say that there is nothing in the scriptures that lines up with observable reality.<p>The Bible contains many many stories about Human behavior and emotions. Mob violence, rape, drunkeness, greed, corruption, and contain many good lessons on understanding these behaviors in order to overcome them. These are behaviors we observe in our everyday lives.<p>There are great teachings in the Bible if that is what you are looking for. If you look in the Bible to try and find every falsehood or inconsistency you will never actual find anything of value to your life.<p>&quot;It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.&quot; - Proverbs 25:2')
