Any social network that is as large as it is, which relies on advertising (and thus cannot be as content-neutral as e.g. phone companies are regarding what you talk about on the phone), is going to face the same situation.<p>Of course, if FB ends up getting way smaller as a result, that would be fine by me.  But I&#x27;m not holding my breath...')
