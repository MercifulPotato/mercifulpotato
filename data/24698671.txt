It&#x27;s the equivalent of telling Wal-Mart, Costco, and Target they cant sell Great Value, Kirkland, and Good &amp; Gather.

Does that mean that game publishers can no longer own game studios?  Are game engines a platform, or only virtual stores?  Can GameStop no longer make an inhouse game? Making a &quot;simple&quot; rule like that, would cascade much further than you lead on.')
