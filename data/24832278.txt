He&#x27;d just upgraded his iPhone and his MacBook, so I repeated the popular-on-HN-at-the-time line about how it was bone-headed that you could buy a top-of-the-line iPhone and a top-of-the-line MacBook, and you couldn&#x27;t plug one in to the other without buying a separate adapter.  He said it had been years and years since he&#x27;d wanted to actually plug his phone in to his computer; he uses WiFi.<p>I recently bought a new printer. I plugged an ethernet cable in to it and the router.  And yet, its menus still tried to get me to go through WiFi setup, I had to press &quot;back&quot; and go through some hoops to tell it &quot;no, just use the Ethernet plug&quot;.  That&#x27;s not a great design--it should have just detected that I&#x27;d plugged something in to the Ethernet port, but it helps show:<p>Somewhere along the way, WiFi absolutely became the expectation, wires became an oddity, and a lot of us techies missed it.')
