That said, this takes us straight to the familiar for&#x2F;against discussion, just with a sharper edge. The union busting debate needs to be had too, but it doesn&#x27;t tell us much about the type of union they want to build and what that means.<p>The linked article (thanks) is another case in point, I think. It talks about union busting. Ways in which (like your quote) working conditions aren&#x27;t good. ... OK.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to disparage... IMO, the elephant in the room isn&#x27;t being addressed. What would a &quot;union win&quot; in amazon (or other young megacorp) mean? More pay, how much more, how would that work?<p>Let&#x27;s compare to another field: sports. The UFC is currently experiencing player union agitations. What a &quot;union win&quot; looks like is fairly defined. Other sports leagues are unionized. The realistic range of outcomes is understood.<p>Forget the conflict side for a moment, what&#x27;s the goal?')
