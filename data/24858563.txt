From my outside perspective, this study matches what I observed: Vaguely better moods associated with increased confusion. They were more immersed in their tasks, but that was partially because even easy tasks were more difficult on their microdosing days.<p>The most concerning part of their experiment was how it distorted their own perceptions and judgment. They’d feel like they had arrived at great epiphanies or accomplished something impressive after solving trivial or obvious problems.
