The few times I saw someone trying to implement the task count, it would sometimes be the case the count couldn&#x27;t be determined beforehand! So I&#x27;d see progress reports like: 1&#x2F;123 done.... 42&#x2F;124 done... 45&#x2F;2616 done... 68&#x2F;98213 done...<p>I think scandisk (or whatever the disk scanning utility that runs before Windows boots is called these days) was prone to such ever-growing task counts. I don&#x27;t know what the right answer here is, except maybe try to split your process into a &quot;planning&quot; part and &quot;execution&quot; part if possible...')
