I have seen these people working as pain specialists. They get money from pharma industry and prescribe ineffective pain meds or do it in a way that harms the patient. Some tools in their box are telling patients their pain is only in their heads, that they are nothing wrong, asking patient if they come to get drugs, prescribing opioids where other way are more effective, cutting the doses so people feel withdrawals and so on. The biggest nightmare of these people is medical cannabis as it changes perception of pain and in many cases they lose power over patient.')
