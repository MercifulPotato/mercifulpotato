Please.<p>If you do want to come into the field, please first take the time to understand the tools. Learn enough to re-derive and re-implement the tools you&#x27;re using. Learn the assumptions that need to hold. Don&#x27;t just learn to point the tools at data and hit go. It&#x27;s not like a lot of programming where it either succeeds or fails. Failures are often silent in this field. If you can&#x27;t reason through how and when a given tool will succeed and, probably more importantly, reason through how and when a given tool will fail, you haven&#x27;t learned enough to know what to use and when.')
