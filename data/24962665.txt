Yet in a way, horrible as all this was, it was unimportant. It concerned secondary issues â€“ namely, the struggle for power between the Comintern and the Spanish left-wing parties, and the efforts of the Russian Government to prevent revolution in Spain.`<i></i><p>My gran grandfather died 15 years ago. And there is no week without he screams in his dreams about his sisters and mother being raped by the &quot;bolsheviks.&quot;<p>Then once all his family were killed, he escaped, went to the port, and decided to work as a maritime merchant.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a war between &quot;left&quot; or right as we have with partisan politics. But it was war between:<p>a) Foreign and revolutionary ideologies<p>b) Foreign and adversarial powers;<p>c) No rules<p>Several countries later fall to the communist regime and USRR influence, causing misery and death.<p>This was not your neighbor discussing or putting signs from your opposite candidate. It was war, with blood, rape, and destruction.<p>Because we live and more &quot;prosperous&quot; and civil we can&#x27;t really understand how evil people can and derive pleasure from being able to be evil without any limits (order) or restrictions (moral).<p>Note: The embassy of Spain once offered him a travel to Spain because he was one of the oldest on the local community. \nHe declined because his Spain was &quot;dead&quot; and he wanted to keep the things still alive in his mind.')
