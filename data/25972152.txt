On the one hand, I&#x27;m upset that centralized control led to big tech being able to so easily squash ideological competition (Parler and NY Post, and I am no ally of these, as well as stuff on the left and many individuals), and I want to see some sort of government whip-cracking.  On the other hand, if they repeal 230 and everyone is afraid of lawsuits, then you&#x27;ll see comments disappear everywhere, content disappear everywhere, freedom to publish diminish, and not platforms but content itself be centralized to that which is &#x27;approved.&#x27;')
