I reasoned I &quot;might as well&quot; get something with Windows on it, since being able to easily play DVDs and use Office would come in handy.<p>I had an &quot;aha&quot; moment when I realized &quot;wait a second, if all I want is Office and a DVD player, I guess I could get a Mac?&quot; OS X had been released about a year before, which of course meant the Mac appealed to me more than Windows for the first time.<p>It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say I knew at that time, at age 21, that Apple was about to blow up, because when I brought my new G3 iBook Mac in to work at my tech job, EVERYBODY wanted to see it and play with it, especially the greybeards.<p>I desperately wanted to buy Apple stock then, but I held off, since it would be on borrowed money. I don&#x27;t regret it, because it was the right decision, but it sure would have paid off :)<p>Oh anyway, back to the story. My iBook came with wifi, and I paid a handsome $300 for the Airport Extreme base station (the &quot;snow&quot; 2nd gen model, not the graphite 1st gen).<p>Interestingly, both the AEBS and the iBook used the same PCMCIA wifi card inside, so many years later, when the iBook&#x27;s card got flaky, I just swapped in the one from the AEBS I wasn&#x27;t using anymore, and it worked great.<p>Not many people in the dorms in 2002 had WiFi-- in fact, almost nobody I can remember did. my dorm room with wireless access point faced an outdoor gathering&#x2F;picnic area, so during a fire alarm one time, I took my laptop with me and was surfing the internet while everyone else figured out what to do with themselves.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBook</a>')
