In fact, the model where a company develops a managed service and offers it on cloud providers infrastructure (i.e. &quot;app store&quot;) would have everyone benefit:<p>* Amazon, from the wealth of innovative managed services they could offer without fully maintaining them themselves<p>* OSS companies, for the ability to financially sustain their projects <i>and</i> still offer it for free for those that want to self host without offering a managed version of the same software<p>* End users, who can both use the software however they wish and also choose to get a nice managed version of it.<p>Instead what will happen due to AWS behavior here is that there will be a lot less incentive to develop innovative new services, at least in a non-proprietary way =&gt; therefore there will be fewer services in general for AWS to offer without doing all the product work from scratch, fewer tools in general for engineers and fewer OSS tools in particular and more Firebase-like offerings. So everybody loses here in the long run.<p>I&#x27;m going to go on a limb and say that whichever of the cloud providers figures out the &quot;app store&quot; equivalent for managed services is going to be able to take over from AWS.')
