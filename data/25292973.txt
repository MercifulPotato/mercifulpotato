So when the semen is generated and collected in the epididymus they&#x27;ve been soaking in virus contaminated fluids lying dormant until release? Is that accurate?<p>Also for the women half I suppose the mucous glands on the cervix make a steady release of virus particles? What&#x27;s going on here exactly with these viral mechanisms as they relate to tissues and the fluids they produce and precisely how the virus winds up in the fluids.')
