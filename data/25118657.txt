Item(by='oneplane', descendants=None, kids=[25120215], score=None, time=1605570802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117451, text='I don&#x27;t understand why people seem to want K8s but then find it &#x27;difficult&#x27;. It&#x27;s really not that complex, and when you add stuff on to it, that is your own choice (just like with k3s and k0s). You essentially end up with a kubelet, apiserver (with etcd) and two or three copy-and-paste YAML files (manifests) to setup a &#x27;full&#x27; k8s cluster.<p>If that is too much, is k8s even relevant to your case?<p>Say your workload is so small and so simple that having a minimum of 2 servers isn&#x27;t what you want, then again, is k8s even relevant for your case?<p>Or perhaps the better question: who is this for?')
