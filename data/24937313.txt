And AVR... and 8051 and 6502...  I find things about Pi and Raspbian annoying, and sure wish there was more I&#x2F;O and better graphics support...<p>But, how awesome is it that there&#x27;s a ~$50 lego brick out there, with a ton of computation and long term support that a huge ecosystem of projects have sprouted from?  And even better, we have all the boards around with less traction (Beagle*, oDroid, etc) to pick from.  I don&#x27;t see the draw in being elitist.<p>There&#x27;s all kinds of projects I&#x27;d have had to spin a challenging-to-lay-out and expensive-to-manufacture board for before.. and now I can make a little silly Pi hat and get prototypes done in hours.  This is exciting!')
