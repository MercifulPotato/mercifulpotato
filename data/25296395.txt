Most medium-to-large corporations have an Enterprise PKI issuing internal-use certificates.<p>&gt; do you spend time improving things for the other billion users?<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: Google&#x27;s users and Microsoft&#x27;s users are much the same people, in roughly the same total numbers.<p>But Google would much rather have those people be only Google&#x27;s users, and not Microsoft&#x27;s users any longer.<p>Why implement a feature that helps &quot;the competition&quot;?<p>Why implement a client feature that your company&#x27;s server products don&#x27;t need or use?<p>Why bother with the private enterprise when your company only sells stuff via the public cloud?<p>Why bother with security at all if the attacks don&#x27;t affect you directly?<p>These are very important question to think about, because the answers say something critical about the future of not just &quot;The Web&quot;, but <i>computing</i> in general.<p>Google has decided they won&#x27;t bother any longer.
