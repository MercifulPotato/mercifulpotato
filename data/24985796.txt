If you can get away with pre-scattering the light before it hits the dish adding an IR lamp is no issue since you&#x27;re using a parabolic mirror which has no diffraction. I have no idea if it &#x27;feels&#x27; right doing that though.<p>For full immersion you would also want a number of different light sources since leds are have very narrow spectra.')
