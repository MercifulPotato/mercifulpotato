That&#x27;s been the case for every platform ever and <i>particularly recently</i>, with no conspiracies involving Wall St bribery required.<p>&gt; That argument would make sense if the justification of the ban had been about legality, not use of language. If it&#x27;s about use of language then it&#x27;s not relevant.<p>It&#x27;s an obvious retort to the suggestion Discord could have delayed enforcement action until after it blew over [if they weren&#x27;t in cahoots with Wall St]. The only reason to delay when they&#x27;re getting complaints <i>now</i> is to help one set of their users unload financial positions onto another, so keeping it open until that happens shouldn&#x27;t be a consideration <i>precisely because</i> it&#x27;s irrelevant to their stated reason for the ban.<p>(I mean, I&#x27;m sure Discord had internal discussions about the legal liability of [not] taking action whilst people pumped stocks too, but the answer was likely &#x27;none whatsoever, do whatever you think is best for your reputation&#x27;)')
