Item(by='qiqitori', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603775433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903128, text='IANAL, but for me the terms used here are kind of problematic on a technical level.<p>- &quot;unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by YouTube on the Service for that Content.&quot; -- If there is a download link somewhere in the comments you&#x27;re allowed to download using youtube-dl?<p>- &quot;provided functionality&quot; -- either functionality is available or it&#x27;s not. Whether there is a button for it on the UI or not is entirely different. (However, this sort of seems to imply that the HTML specs are legally binding?)<p>- Your internet connection is only capable of sending and receiving packets, and it isn&#x27;t wrong at all to describe &quot;sending&quot; as &quot;uploading&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; as &quot;downloading&quot;.<p>- It says that you aren&#x27;t allowed to (among other things) &quot;display&quot; any Content for any other purposes -- other purposes than what? &quot;For your information and personal use&quot;?<p>- It used to be that you could just copy video files from your browser&#x27;s cache directory, or you could use hard links -- then you wouldn&#x27;t even have copied them technically. (Not sure if that&#x27;s still possible on youtube -- but again what if you had a browser that generated PNG files instead or or before &quot;displaying&quot; stuff on the screen?)')
