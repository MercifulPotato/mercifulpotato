That&#x27;s why I allow that game to run with very little protection.<p>If I visit a random website, I have to be prepared for the worst. And if I visit any website that finances itself with ads, I can assume that they will behave like offensive attackers trying whatever they can to collect more information about me in ways that I do not want.<p>As such, WebGL needs a very strong sandbox around it, to prevent rogue websites from causing harm. For desktop games, that trust issue does not arise, because they have a different business model.<p>That&#x27;s why in my opinion, desktop OpenGL will always remain faster than WebGL.')
