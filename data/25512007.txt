From the description is &quot;Mark came to me with an idea and a design. Who knew a simple idea could turn out to be such a complicated device? [...] It was fun being able to bring Marks concepts, designs,  and ideas to reality, and together work to solve each problem as they arose&quot;.<p>Mark releases about a video a month. No way can he do 12 projects a year entirely on his own. Everyone big on YouTube has a full team behind them. It&#x27;s big business!<p>Is a company founder the only force behind a startup? No! They hire and build a company! But are they the driving force? That&#x27;s often a fair statement.<p>I feel like you&#x27;re pitching a story of &quot;YouTube personalities are just a facade who don&#x27;t do anything&quot;.
