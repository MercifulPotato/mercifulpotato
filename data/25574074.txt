Please don&#x27;t make up strawmans.<p>&gt; And by your reasoning, then bullying shouldn&#x27;t exist today because the school policies should prevent it, yet it&#x27;s more rampant than ever.<p>I never said that.<p>&gt; I was bullied once. Eventually I fought back and gave the kid a bloody nose. Guess what - he was nicer to me and to other kids too. Prior to that he had no empathy. That experience changed him. I know others with similar experiences too.<p>Funny how I only hear the &quot;stood up to bullies succesfully&quot; story and never the other ones. See my other comment.')
