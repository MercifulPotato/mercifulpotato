It&#x27;s speculated that intelligences that are too different in form or quantity might not be able to communicate with each other at all.<p>Likely the most probable scenario of our contact with extraterrestrial intelligence is they will completely ignore us, and will not attempt to communicate, or even if they attempt to, we will not perceive it as communication.')
