First of all men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gymnastics have some different events and different judging criteria for the events they have in common. On the whole the men&#x27;s events and scoring criteria require more core and upper body strength to pull off successfully.<p>Secondly while the strength to weight ratio of women might peak at 15-18, in men it keeps increasing into their mid-late 20s. In general, the strength difference between a 15 and 25 year old man is much much greater than that between a 15 and 25 year old woman. Basically a 20-25 year old man can pull off feats of strength that a 15-16 year old simply can&#x27;t. The same isn&#x27;t really true for women (again in general).')
