I think the real lessons here is that:<p>- a founder CTO needs to be very strong on product: I never accept offline capabilities or even mobile compatibility for a MVP, this is simply never necessary to get the needed early feedback<p>- as a tech startup cofounder, your infra should be a docker-compose.yml and that&#x27;s it, your CI should be a README &quot;ssh, git pull, docker-compose stop, build, up&quot; and it should take max 3-4 hours to set up<p>- caring about unit tests and the like is useless when you&#x27;re still iterating fast, automated tests are good once the product is stabilized and you want to kinda &quot;freeze&quot; it or at least stabilize it and introduce some friction in the dev process to prevent regressions (you trade speed for quality)<p>Sounds to me you spent entire months working on things which did not provide any business value')
