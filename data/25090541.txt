In the end, the developer needs to know the types in both cases anyways. Otherwise, if they don&#x27;t know the types, they will pass in a callable that expects the wrong types (for example they mix up [int, Exception] to [Exception, int]) and now you just have a runtime error.<p>If anything, having type signatures like that are a good thing! If you think they are too complicated&#x2F;ugly or driving you crazy, then you have an incentive to improve them. In many languages, callbacks are now considered bad style and that&#x27;s good! Hiding the type signature does not make the problem go away, you just move it into the future where it will bite you even more.')
