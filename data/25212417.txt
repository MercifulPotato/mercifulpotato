If you have someone who is distance 2 from 20 people who died unnaturally, but not distance 1 - that person is likely related to their untimely death.<p>The reason metadata is useful is because, unlike the text, it is generally required to be unobfuscated to 3rd parties for the communication to be useful to the 1st and 2nd parties.')
