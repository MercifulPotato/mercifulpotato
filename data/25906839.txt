I&#x27;ve had them for ~3 weeks and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy them sooner. I did go from a wired headset to these for work and they&#x27;re a game changer. Battery life is excellent. Noise cancelling is great. Yes, it seems to pair to the closest device but pairing is a couple of clicks away.')
