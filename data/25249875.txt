While there are regions of the world this won&#x27;t work well, solar is the energy source to beat right now.<p>Next, the physics is against him most energy is basically fusion (in the sun) -&gt; solar collectors -&gt; biomass -&gt; petroleum. Each phase incurs losses, so using solar now is much better than letting the sun grow things and waiting thousands of years for us to use it in oil (which is the natural implication of what he is stating). Directly getting energy from fusion is better, but we aren&#x27;t there yet (hopefully soon).')
