You can parse first few bytes to get the size of the header section. Then the first header is required to be CONTENT_LENGTH, thought I&#x27;m not sure if all servers respect that requirement. Even if some don&#x27;t, CONTENT_LENGTH is still guaranteed to be present. So you need at most two memory allocations to read the entire request into memory.')
