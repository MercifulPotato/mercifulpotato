I think these numbers matter more than we realize.  I believe that many politicians today are using Twitter&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;Facebook likes as modern Gallup polls.  Manipulation of the numbers could result in actual policy changes.<p>Say there is a video about net neutrality, or the breakup of the social media giants.  I honestly think all sorts of people in government will be looking to the popularly, or lack thereof, as a gauge of public support for the content of the video.  So, imho, manipulation of likes&#x2F;dislikes is becoming very serious.')
