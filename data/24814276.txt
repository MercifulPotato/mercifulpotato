Interesting proposal. I don&#x27;t normally take a cynical view, but humans are emotional creatures, otherwise these dishonest mechanisms of generating engagement wouldn&#x27;t work. In such a system it is likely that the most emotionally motivating algorithms would win.<p>Beyond that, why does one company need to make multiple algorithms? Why do we need a law to enforce this? Why don&#x27;t we just have any company able to make any product they like and let people decide?<p>We have that now of course. And the problem I laid out with this is plainly obvious on the internet today. People are picking the algorithm that generates in them the most emotional reaction. But I suggest that these algorithms fail in the marketplace by a different mechanism: they inevitably lead to the state we are in now, where people become disillusioned with the control of information flow (and other problems associated with the curation algorithms), and people move to other websites with other algorithms.<p>In the past couple of years we have seen an explosion of alternatives, some echo chambers, some failed but genuine attempts, some sizeable competitors, some in the pipe. There is a large and fast growing diaspora from the big websites. Essentially what I&#x27;m saying is, what you want is happening now without any intervention, and everything is as it should be.')
