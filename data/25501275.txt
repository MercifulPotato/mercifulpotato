Item(by='reificator', descendants=None, kids=[25508492], score=None, time=1608595157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500619, text='&gt; <i>If you&#x27;re driving along a road with parked cars, you slow to a speed where if someone (say a 4 year old child) jumps out you can stop within your reaction time. Anything else is dangerously reckless.</i><p>Going substantially slower than the posted speed limit is a ticketable offense in most areas.<p>It also makes it more difficult for other drivers to judge your speed and position if you are not going either the posted or &quot;accepted&quot; speed for that stretch of road.  This can and does cause accidents, particularly in retirement communities where older drivers slow down because they feel it will be safer.<p>My previous post was merely stating that driver vigilance is not the only factor in a collision with a pedestrian.  Jumping out in front of the car is just one example because it&#x27;s easy to visualize.<p>I am very much not stating that drivers are already vigilant enough.  Only pushing back against a disingenuous statement.  I don&#x27;t want people to espouse a view I agree with <i>(drivers should be more vigilant)</i> with an argument that is easy to debunk.')
