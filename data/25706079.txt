Item(by='cabalamat', descendants=None, kids=[25706148], score=None, time=1610233957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25705807, text='&gt; left leaning calls to violence get banned on social media all the time<p>Yes they do, but a lot less that right leaning calls do, because social media companies lean leftwards.<p>For example, Parler was recently kicked off of Google App store, and Apple and Amazon have also threatened to kick Parler off their app store and hosting platform. This was because Parler leans right and some messages by some users encouraged violence.<p>None of these companies would ever do the same to a mainstream (i.e. left leaning, because social media censors the right more than the left) social media platform because of left wing violent talk&#x2F;threats.<p>It&#x27;s blatantly obvious that big tech is biased to the left. (I say this as someone who is fairly left-leaning, FWIW).')
