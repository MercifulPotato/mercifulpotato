Item(by='amscanne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606951669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282300, text='I work at Google, but have no inside knowledge of these events.<p>I doubt that Google spontaneously published the reason for the firing. AFAICT, the former employees went to the press following their firing, and the &quot;violation of security policies&quot; explanation was the response to articles initiated by the former employees. It&#x27;s not clear to me how the parent&#x27;s comments are a smear, unless the statement that &quot;she bypassed restriction in our code change system&quot; is not factual (which I don&#x27;t know, but I have no reason to doubt it).')
