Who had access to the wallet, etc...  Wiretaps, observation, all of it is part of the game now.<p>In short, investigation will continue, as well all available means and methods applied to better understand who moved the coins and why they were moved.<p>That is likely to be an expensive, potentially freedom limiting, time.<p>Being unable to prove it NOW doesn&#x27;t mean forever being unable to prove things.<p>Good luck with that game.  It&#x27;s very difficult, time consuming, dangerous, and expensive to play.  Your opponents are willing to play hard indefinitely.<p>Best not benefit from the moved coins in the future.<p>Both implication and deduction are available legal means too.  Remember that part.')
