I actually wonder if it could function as an auto-dog walker for my organic dog on the days when I&#x27;m too swamped with work to do so.<p>The thought of attaching a leash to my dog and the leash to Spot while I&#x27;m indisposed is actually kind of attractive.  I would have to make sure my dog has already done her business though, since I wouldn&#x27;t want to be the kind of asshole that not only uses a robot to walk his dog, but also lets his dog shit on his neighbor&#x27;s yard <i>while</i> a robot walks his dog.')
