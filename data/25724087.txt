Law firms are expected to represent people accused of the very worst crimes in order to promote a just outcome. It&#x27;s extremely disturbing that political actions which may be distasteful but <i>could never be prosecuted as crimes in normal circumstances</i> have become a justification to harass law firms until they refuse to represent a client. I say &quot;normal circumstances&quot; because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will be until we get show trials and mass convictions of political figures.')
