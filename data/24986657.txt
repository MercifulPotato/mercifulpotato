Item(by='sprobertson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604468945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977678, text='For ESP32 and ESP8266 there are a few good non-Arduino options I&#x27;m aware of:<p>* Official Espressif SDKs (C): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;espressif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;espressif</a><p>* NodeMCU (Lua): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodemcu.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;release&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodemcu.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;release&#x2F;</a><p>* MicroPython: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.micropython.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;esp32&#x2F;quickref.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.micropython.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;esp32&#x2F;quickref.html</a><p>I haven&#x27;t used the official SDK in several years and frankly the current state of their Github org confuses me (why are there so many options now?), so I won&#x27;t say much about that. They do have a large library of examples however.<p>NodeMCU is a Lua firmware that abstracts away much of the ugliness you&#x27;ll encounter trying to learn the C SDK. After the initial Lua learning curve and figuring out what it means to build and flash firmware, it&#x27;s quite pleasant to use. I find the development iteration cycle much quicker than with the C SDK.<p>MicroPython is of course a Python firmware along those same lines. I personally haven&#x27;t had much success with this one, and NodeMCU worked well enough that I didn&#x27;t try much harder.<p>I too would like to see a nice straightforward solution to BYO editor to the Arduino IDE, everything I&#x27;ve looked at has been a set of strange hacks.
