There&#x27;s to much changing to fast at too many layers to be a really good target, unless you are serving an actually static site (Which is not a bad thing, it&#x27;s what I do). Even then, HTTPS still has value, as it can prevent ISP&#x27;s from injecting advertisements. I don&#x27;t believe this is currently a large issue in the US, but I remember a recent discussion about bad behaviour by ISP&#x27;s in India and other countries.<p>Edit: I do however believe that (for a static site on https) it is a good idea to allow a fall back to http, assuming of course that you are fine with the contents being mitm&#x27;d. Also, I think the Gopher is a good thing to serve in this kind of situation.')
