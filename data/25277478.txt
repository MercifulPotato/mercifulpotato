I might be getting old&#x2F;jaded.<p>It might also be because I used to have better access to arthouse cinemas that played more experimental, independent titles, while now I&#x27;m at the mercy of whatever is available on streaming services. So I end up just supplementing that by watching weird stuff on YouTube, which is somewhat suboptimal.')
