Where Elixir has the most advantage, in my opinion, is Mix, the language&#x27;s build tool &#x2F; project config &#x2F; task runner. You use the command line tool to compile your project, run your tests, and any other user-defined task you&#x27;d like. And you use the Mix module to define your project&#x27;s dependencies, environments, and build targets in Elixir code. It&#x27;s a really nice all-in-one Swiss Army knife compared to the cobbled-together build processes from disparate tools found in other languages.')
