Although they don&#x27;t have the street cred of ASML, they are important because (A) there&#x27;s a shortage, and (B) the demand side of the machinery market needs to foster competition in order to keep ASML from gouging its customers.<p>To go even further than your comment (with which I agree, 5nm isn&#x27;t the center of AMD&#x27;s income right now), TSMC isn&#x27;t even making most of its wafer revenue from 5nm and 7nm. Straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth (Wendell Huang, CFO):<p><i>&quot;Now, let&#x27;s move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 29% and 13%, respectively. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 62% of wafer revenue. On a full-year basis, 5-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 8% of 2020 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 33% and 16-nanometer was 17%.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fool.com&#x2F;earnings&#x2F;call-transcripts&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fool.com&#x2F;earnings&#x2F;call-transcripts&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;ta...</a>')
