If there&#x27;s no street address, check the search string to see if there&#x27;s a city, or city, state. Find the lng,lat of that to use as the proximity bias. If nothing exists, use the user&#x27;s current location. (Maybe this is why the mobile SDK is better.)<p>2. Then add the proximity bias while searching for the POI<p>But just a heads up, even a simple city query can be problematic. From personal experience, &quot;san jose&quot; would return San Jose in Costa Rica, or San Jose City in the Philippines, and rarely San Jose, CA, US unless a user was to type all that.<p>Google definitely has better NLP to handle user search queries.')
