Not all fats are created equal.<p>For example Inuits consume 50% of their calories from fat [1].  They do not have the &quot;western diet disease&quot; (obesity, heart disease, etc.)<p>It really IS the processed fats that are bad for you.  You can see this all over the world when Aboriginal peoples are introduced to industrial cooking &#x2F; ultra-processed foods &#x2F; &quot;western corporate diet&quot;.<p>They literally get addicted, and their body size increases by double digit percentages within a generation.  This also happened in the US, but happens faster around the world.  The average body weight for a man in the US increased from ~166 in the 1960â€™s to ~196 today  [2].<p>This is an amazing fact that needs an explanation if you don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a result of the rise in industrial cooking.<p>And if you believe in capitalism, you would have to explain how this would NOT happen.  Why wouldn&#x27;t companies gradually develop cheap, consistently manufactured, addictive foods?  The profit motive would lead them there, even if it weren&#x27;t intentional.<p>I suggest reading some of Michael Pollan&#x27;s books like Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma or Cooked; they talk about this (and probably talk about Inuits specifically as far as I remember)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inuit_cuisine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inuit_cuisine</a><p>[2]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;wonk&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;look-at-how-much-weight-weve-gained-since-the-1960s&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;wonk&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;look-...</a><p>----<p>Another anecdote: I know someone from the Midwest with &quot;industrial cooking disease&quot; who dropped from 350 lbs to 200 lbs in a year by going on the &quot;carnivore diet&quot;, where he ate  exclusively beef and chicken (yes, literally).<p>I remember someone else remarking the same thing on HN, and observing that going vegan can have the same effect.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19177116" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19177116</a> (not sure if this is the thread but there are many of them on HN)<p>Hypothesis: Both the carnivore diet and a vegan diet are  BOTH suboptimal.  The reason that they help many people with &quot;western diet disease&quot; is that you eliminate industrial cooking &#x2F; ultra-processed foods from your diet.<p>The human body is extremely flexible and can metabolize a wide variety of things in the environment.  What it apparently can&#x27;t metabolize is addictive foods that corporations have created...')
