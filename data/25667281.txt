A desktop app has access to <i>a lot</i> more than what the browser exposes. At least with the browser, if they try to access a file, they can’t. Desktop apps on Windows have pretty much free reign on the file system (see ransomware).<p>Sure, drive by ad tracking is easier with the web, but fingerprinting through desktop apps does exist.<p>Basically, why should I be forced to download a program that gets <i>more</i> access than a web app gets? Just so privacy advocates feel better about averting another privacy leak that can be prevented by browser permissions (like the webcam is)?<p>And as a developer, why should I be forced to learn Qt&#x2F;GTK so I can do something like USB? And if I use Electron, I’m skewered by other developers for writing a bloated mess because I had no choice.')
