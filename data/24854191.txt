It is not like companies that do profiling do that in the open, in verifiable manner.<p>Also, weird you mention dvorak. I know this is just a hyperbole for the joke of being an easy to identify linux hacker... but keymap is the one thing you can&#x27;t use for fingerprinting... well, you are able to use the language (by detecting typed in keycodes and matching against a mimum denominator of keymaps) but not the keymap itself (e.g. no way to see qwerty-US vs dvorak-US, but easy to detect <i>-US vs </i>-DE for example)')
