No matter what, there is always some &quot;breaking news&quot;. This causes news sites to become more of a slot machine than a substantive source of information.<p>A Brief History of Yesterday tries to be an antidote. It uses Wikipedia to show a summary of what happened yesterday. It&#x27;s no news anymore, the content is already gradually becoming history.<p>I started working on it last weekend. It is still in a pre-alpha state, but please let me know what you think of it!')
