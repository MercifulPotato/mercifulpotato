They are minor annoyances that I can&#x27;t even list well. Stuff like an icon would get stuck to the mouse cursor and I have to lock the screen and unlock again to fix it. Or I&#x27;d get light text on light background in the context menu. Or the font gets messed up randomly. Or alt tab works weirdly (yes I searched and fiddled with it, it&#x27;s still not how I expect it). Many more small things. I should make a list but then again, I&#x27;m trying to get stuff done, no to compile meticulous bug reports.')
