Add 5 for network round-trip to get 37.<p>&gt; 5ms roundtrip<p>5 ms network round-trip or less is common in offices or homes with fiber. Here&#x27;s ICMP ping 1.1.1.1 from my office just now: \nrtt min&#x2F;avg&#x2F;max&#x2F;mdev = 4.075&#x2F;4.700&#x2F;6.407&#x2F;0.459 ms. (UDP wouldn&#x27;t be so different.) Of course, on wifi or low-speed broadband it wouldn&#x27;t be so fast.<p>&gt; high latency TVs<p>High-latency displays makes network latency less noticeable relative to a conventional console game (but more noticeable relative to a PC game on a fast-updating screen).')
