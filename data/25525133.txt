Why aren&#x27;t you seeking a more stable permanent position? You likely have more quality full-remote opportunities available right now than at any other time in your career, even in the down economy. If it&#x27;s because you believe people aren&#x27;t hiring, look again, you may be surprised; there&#x27;s strong demand for LAMP devs right now and your salary demands are quite low. If it&#x27;s because you prefer freelancing, surely a permanent position is better than asking for donations and taking out loans in the meantime. Applying to jobs, you pay no advertising and in general it is less involved than the dreadful task of finding new freelance clients.')
