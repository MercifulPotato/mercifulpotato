Would that not qualify as a threat to the republic?<p>In other words, what if the mob had gotten its hands on Pence, Pelosi, Grassley, or others?  Don&#x27;t you think that would have been a bigger deal than what transpired with Snowden?<p>Incidentally, there are reports that a number of Republican members of Congress voted in favor of the president on Wednesday because they feared for the safety of their families.  It seems plausible that they might have been influenced by the rioters chanting &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot; as they entered the Capitol.  Legislators voting against their judgement because of extortion seems a significant threat to the democratic order.')
