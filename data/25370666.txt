We believe this despite the fact that on any given day there&#x27;s an article (several, sometimes) about some event driven by fraud in basically any other human endeavor that goes on in this country or the world that gets upvoted to the front page. Elections in this country are basically based on the honor system. We don&#x27;t enforce any nation-wide robust protocols to verify anything. We just <i>trust</i> that everything that happens is on the up-and-up at the local level. That&#x27;s fine, in my book, but it&#x27;s also fine to be suspicious that there should be more scrutiny.<p>Is claiming the election was &quot;stolen&quot; part of that scrutiny? Well, I don&#x27;t know. And neither does YouTube. Tech has made it super easy to amplify claims of scrutiny, but it&#x27;s really uncomfortable to me that Google gets to decide what kind of scrutiny is okay. This is the company that has a business model that is literally based constant and universal surveillance of its users. Whey the hell should I trust <i>them</i>?<p>Feels like we should all take a break from the internet for a while after reading this thread.')
