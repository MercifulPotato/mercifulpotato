Indeed, I find it hard to believe that he really feels he&#x27;s making an original point here - it seems almost axiomatic.<p>Nevertheless I think you&#x27;re making a solid point: information overload can be pretty harmful.  I think that&#x27;s what Thompson is getting at with his comment &quot;the solution to misinformation is improving our ability to tell the difference&quot; but honestly that&#x27;s not a <i>solution</i> so much as it is a <i>goal</i> - granting that it&#x27;s desirable for people to have this filtering capacity, how can it be learned?')
