I think a lot Darknet activity goes through Tor. The resulting drug purchases to and within the US will end up going through USPS. If I had Congressional funds to go after illegal drug shipments made through Darknet sites, I&#x27;d definitely be using Tor to make purchases from the biggest dealers on the most popular sites, and then investigating the source addresses, the types of packaging used to conceal the shipments, etc.<p>While I think it&#x27;s immoral and a waste of taxpayer money to go after small time users buying personal quantities of drugs and controlled meds, it would be a satisfying and interesting job to help take down large suppliers of fentanyl laced drugs that are causing ODs all over the country.')
