Yay, it was about time!  A simple license : MIT. Clear differentiation between free &amp; paid plans. I am liking what I am seeing so far. One of our client is in advertising industry and is syncing data from 20 different API vendors to postgres. So I am one of your potential customer.<p>However, there is a big problem I&#x27;m noticing with &quot;Open source alternatives&quot; lately on HN. I had to mention this.<p>Even a simple installation of airbyte on my local machine fails :( I tried docker-compose up!<p>I simply wanna know why a basic example is not working on an important day of your company ? :) Is this a genuine mistake ? Sorry, this feedback will sound harsh but companies are taking words &#x27;open source&#x27; for a complete ride. It&#x27;s a great marketing trick. Gets you plenty of eyeballs, good will &amp; trust to begin with. Then later we figure it&#x27;s not even self hostable.<p>Here is a bad example that you may not want to follow : Supabase &quot;The Open Source Firebase Alternative&quot;. The product is not self hostable despite calling themselves open source firebase all over internet. The Founders of Supabase have been disingenuous not to address self hosting[1][2] and its a been long time since their launch. The self hosting section on their website[3] doesn&#x27;t provide any details on how to self host and they are careless enough to even mention &quot;how to migrate away&quot; from Supabase in that section.<p>[1] : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;219#discussioncomment-231261" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;219#discuss...</a>\n[2] : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;issues&#x2F;85#issuecomment-741528624" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;supabase&#x2F;issues&#x2F;85#issuecomment-...</a>\n[3] : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supabase.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;platform#self-hosting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supabase.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;platform#self-hosting</a>')
