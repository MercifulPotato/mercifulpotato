Item(by='feralimal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605693981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134957, text='&gt; From about 3,000 years ago to about 100 years ago, sea levels naturally rose and declined slightly, with little change in the overall trend. Over the past 100 years, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree C (1.8 degrees F), with sea level response to that warming totaling about 160 to 210 mm (with about half of that amount occurring since 1993)<p>This is hearsay.  You were not there 3000 years ago, or even 100 years.  You have been told a story and are re-telling it to me.  Why should I believe it?  I know how people can mislead into lying with statistics, for their work, etc to prepare information that is not accurate.  I just don&#x27;t have any faith in science.  (I love the scientific method, but that&#x27;s a different story, that pales into insignificance when funding is involved.)<p>&gt; In 2018, the all-species index in the UK, based on the aggregated population trends of 130 breeding species, was 11% below its 1970 value.<p>We have had industrial farming methods take off at that time, and we do throw some awful stuff on the soil - I&#x27;m prepared to believe that this is probably fair data.  However, how can I know this is really true?')
