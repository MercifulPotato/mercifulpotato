Count Dankula:<p>&gt;Mark Meechan, 30, recorded his girlfriend&#x27;s pug, Buddha, responding to statements such as &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; by raising its paw.<p>&gt;The clip was viewed more than three million times on YouTube.<p>&gt;Meechan, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, was sentenced at Airdrie Sheriff Court after being found guilty of committing a hate crime last month.<p>&gt;He had denied any wrong-doing and insisted he made the video, which was posted in April 2016, to annoy his girlfriend.<p>&gt;But Sheriff Derek O&#x27;Carroll found him guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive because it was &quot;anti-Semitic and racist in nature&quot; and was aggravated by religious prejudice.<p>Cases like these are an absolute waste of the police and prosecutor&#x27;s time, in my American opinion.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43864133" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43864133</a>')
