Item(by='11thEarlOfMar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608243095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460496, text='That&#x27;s interesting.<p>The median home price in the US (it varies dramatically by region, I need to simplify first) is $295,000. Divided by 4 is about $74,000.<p>The median household income (using household since you&#x27;re using house prices) is $69,000.<p>The actual numbers would need to change for this to work, maybe it needs to be 1&#x2F;10th the median home price as the threshold, for example.<p>But it&#x27;s interesting to think through the impact this type of approach would have on home prices. I&#x27;m confident the tax rates and taxable thresholds could be worked out to generate the revenue needed, but to what extent would people be incentivized to move to areas with lower home prices?<p>Taking an extreme example, the median home price in Santa Clara County is $1,395,000. If we use the 10% threshold, families would not pay taxes if their household income were below $139,500. The median household income is $124,000.<p>Income and housing prices are not linearly corelated, so it would need some type of non-linear scaling. But at the heart of it, housing is generally the greatest family expense and perhaps it makes sense to use that in the approach to taxing income. Come to think of it, perhaps that&#x27;s in effect what the mortgage interest deduction does.')
