So I don&#x27;t see how they can open any of the secrecy envelopes, let alone count any ballots, until they&#x27;ve determined if the ballot in the envelope should be counted, and they can&#x27;t do that until they get the poll book back from my election site at the end of in-person voting. (But maybe NY is one of these 8 states due to this rule?)')
