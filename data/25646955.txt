Realist theories are actually just rhetorical sleight-of-hand.  Bohmian positions, for example, are supposedly &quot;real&quot; but they cannot actually be measured, and this inability to measure them is not a technological limit, it is an inherent part of the interpretation.  Bohmians essentially take the randomness, hide it in the infinite digits of a real (no pun intended) number, call that number &quot;the actual position of a particle&quot; and claim that, because it&#x27;s &quot;the actual position of a particle&quot; that it is somehow &quot;real&quot;.  Well, it&#x27;s not real.  You can&#x27;t measure it.  You&#x27;ve just hidden the randomness behind some clever rhetoric.<p>&gt; the reality is that we do not know<p>Yes, we do.  The Bell inequalities and concomitant experiments show that quantum randomness is fundamental.  You can hide it or sweep it under the rug but you can&#x27;t get rid of it because it&#x27;s actually part of our reality.')
