I recently installed ubuntu server to see what it was like compared to fedora server and was shocked to see that the python package still links to python 2 (!) despite it already being officially discontinued.<p>Fedora Silverblue&#x2F;CoreOS look like a massive step in the right direction which no other mainstream distros are working on.<p>Fedora also seems to be the only distro willing to set sane defaults for everything (SELinux, Wayland, CGroupsV2, soon to be pipewire, python 3) while every other distro waits around for someone else to make the first move.')
