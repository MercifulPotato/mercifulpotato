Particularly in rust belt cities like Detroit or the Midwest.<p>You’re describing a $73.2k salary for a mid tier rails developer in Berlin.<p>It’s hard to think of a comparable city to Berlin in the US. I think highly of Berlin, it has a great startup scene and a reasonable cost of living compared to other German cities I know of. But it is also somewhat of a recovering “rust belt city” that keeps costs low to fuel this growth.')
