His work isn&#x27;t about the story, but the language. The work is poetry, both literally and figuratively, and a plain English adaptation is like somebody telling you about their favorite song.<p>Better, I think, is to see a good film adaptation. Shakespeare was never intended to be read, but to be performed. There&#x27;s a lot in the text that isn&#x27;t apparent until you&#x27;ve studied it closely, but a good performance will bring it right out in the open.<p>A few films that I&#x27;d suggest to get started with:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Henry_V_(1989_film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Henry_V_(1989_film)</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Much_Ado_About_Nothing_(1993_film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Much_Ado_About_Nothing_(1993_f...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_III_(1995_film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_III_(1995_film)</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Titus_(film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Titus_(film)</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coriolanus_(film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coriolanus_(film)</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romeo_%2B_Juliet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romeo_%2B_Juliet</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hamlet_(2000_film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hamlet_(2000_film)</a><p>These are all good, accessible versions of his plays. You don&#x27;t need to be an expert to understand and enjoy them. (They&#x27;re very roughly in order of my favorites, if that matters to you.)<p>I won&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll like them. There&#x27;s really nothing wrong with that. People get snobby about Shakespeare, and they shouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s OK to say, &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s not for me&quot;. But under all the snobbery, there really is great text and great performances that people genuinely enjoy. If you&#x27;re interested in that, these films are the places I&#x27;d start.')
