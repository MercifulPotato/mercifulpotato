Item(by='justinclift', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601950074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693038, text='&gt; Alastair Reynolds is just amazing to me.<p>The earlier stuff, definitely yes (eg The Inhibitor series).  His more recent series (eg Revenger series) is pretty average if not outright bad.<p>I&#x27;m on the third book of the Revenger series now, and it&#x27;s just... crap. :(<p>If you haven&#x27;t read it yet, avoid it.  Major foundation sections of the third books&#x27; plot are completely nonsensical, the characters do outright idiotic things to move the plot along, etc.  It&#x27;s not good reading. :(')
