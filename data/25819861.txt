(Enterprise use—where the company has issued specific hardware to clients—is an obvious exception.)<p>Vanguard, for example, only trusts Yubico keys, and it&#x27;s a pain in the ass.<p>That said, your complaint about Secure Enclave&#x2F;Keystore trust doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Is there an architecture with on-device authenticators where you don&#x27;t have to trust the device manufacturer? The use of SE&#x2F;Keystore is a red herring here, no?')
