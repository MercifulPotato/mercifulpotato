I&#x27;ve had unlimited voice&#x2F;SMS for close to a decade. \nInstead of paying by the minute&#x2F;SMS&#x2F;MB, the trend here is instead to use additional services (music, netflix, etc) to keep the prices up.<p>Here in Denmark, a $50&#x2F;month mobile subscription will get you unlimited voice, SMS, and 20-30GB data, along with Netflix, HBO Nordic and a music service. A basic subscription includes unlimited SMS, &lt;10 hours of voice, and 1-5GB data, and is around $15&#x2F;month.<p>Usually during summer&#x2F;christmas i get unlimited data as well for 1-2 months, and from July until new years eve we had unlimited data. It probably has some &quot;fair usage&quot; limit, but i&#x27;ve never hit it. Also, Netflix consumption doesn&#x27;t count against your data cap, so you could create a wifi hotspot on your phone and stream netflix over 5G all day without using any data at all.')
