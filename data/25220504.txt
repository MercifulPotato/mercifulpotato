It just isn&#x27;t.<p><i>&gt; Because web developers who do JavaScript for a living find it easier to write JavaScript</i><p>This is an argument I can accept from a random free-time-opensource developer, not from a well-funded behemoth like Mozilla. An org that big should pay attention to what <i>their objectives</i> are, not what they feel like hacking together on any given day. How can they not see that making this sort of tool significantly burdensome to install on 90% of desktops is bound to limit its impact?<p><i>&gt;  suddenly every utility &quot;should of course&quot; be written in Rust</i><p>No. Write it in Go if you prefer. Write it in brainfuck, I don&#x27;t care. What I care about, as a user, is that I can just get a single executable I can run on my machine. I care about <i>usability</i>, that&#x27;s all I care about. How can it be acceptable for a tool like web-ext to have a setup story that is &quot;figure out how to install npm; npm install web-ext and see it fail; figure out how to install Visual Studio (will it even work with the free version? I hope so); re-do npm install web-ext, ignoring a bunch of warnings about everything being horribly insecure and unmaintained&quot;...? And then they have the gall to say in their copy that &quot;you only need a text editor&quot;, just before pushing this crap. I mentioned Rust only because it&#x27;s terrible optics that its very home doesn&#x27;t dogfood it. Again, not rocket science to notice, at organizational level.<p>As a fervent Firefox advocate, this is the sort of thing that <i>really</i> riles me up.')
