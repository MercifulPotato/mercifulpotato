It was something to do while bored. I was motivated by a desire to play the old star trek game, which it now does. It&#x27;s called TrekBasic, but the github project it still private, as it&#x27;s just a fun hack.<p>It is not as cool as yours, as I wrote it in python. It does have better features for developers than most BASICs from long ago:<p><pre><code>    Code breakpoints\n    Data write breakpoints\n    Single stepping\n    Execution timing\n    Execution tracing\n    Code coverage reports\n    Reformatting\n    Renumbering\n\n</code></pre>\nI think my next step will be to move it to LLVM, just for the fun of learning about LLVM.')
