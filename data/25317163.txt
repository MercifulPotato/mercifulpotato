More C++ programmers are newly hired, in any given week, than the total at work using Rust. That will be true for some time to come.<p>Here on HN you can always get upvotes by promoting Rust (and it really is the only interesting new systems language in 30 years) or complaining about C++, but C++ is going nowhere but upwards. C++20 is better than &#x27;17, and C++23 will be better than &#x27;20.<p>A language has achieved something when there are more articles complaining about it than about having succeeded in coding something using it.')
