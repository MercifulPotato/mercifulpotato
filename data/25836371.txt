The ACA was designed to benefit the middle class and non-vulnerable. At which point the middle class and non-vulnerable (and the press) stopped caring about who had healthcare.<p>To drive home that point: A few years ago I ran ACA quotes for typical income levels (typical for non-wealthy regions, 12k-32k) and found that premium cost steeply dropped for each 10k rise in income.<p>My primary issue isn&#x27;t that this happened, it&#x27;s that we weren&#x27;t told. It&#x27;s that ACA supporters + the entirety of press compulsively gloss over ACA realities.<p>&gt; I wish the Dems could just own up to that and push for something more.<p>I suggest that uncovered Americans don&#x27;t need something more. They need something.<p>&gt; The problem is that both sides are so deep in the industry’s pockets, that I don’t think real reform is even possible.<p>Pols trading law&#x2F;power for campaign cash is the other thing that news orgs have ~0 interest in.')
