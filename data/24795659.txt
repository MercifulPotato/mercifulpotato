From Jim Carrey to Boris Johnson, from Jack Dorsey to Elon Musk, from Mark Zuckerberg  to Alysa Milano, they have spouted absolutely nonsense and they are as influential as ever.They should not be banned btw, but ridiculed.Alex Jones deserves the same treatment and not being hypocritically swept under the rug.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know why you are trying to trivialize &quot;tin-foil brigade&quot; when it literally killed many people this year.<p>This a global pandemic, a big portion of the deaths was sadly unavoidable no matter your location in the map or your political persuasion, it is  juicy ammunition for political gains though. The other big part in the deaths comes from the clusterfuck of mismanagement of the crisis. The people responsible for that WILL NOT be cancelled. The influence of the loonies in their youtube channels represents at worst a minuscule fraction of the deaths.')
