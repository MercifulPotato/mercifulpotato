I was addressing this:<p>&quot;Python is superior to C and Rust for most kinds of scripting tasks, given equal mastery of both. It has a REPL, it doesn&#x27;t have a compile time&quot;<p>To me it makes the impression that you are conflating here, hence my answer about REPL. Technically of course REPL is different from having &quot;no compile time&quot;.<p>In any case I do not really consider opinion about Python being the better one for scripting tasks as anything but subjective.')
