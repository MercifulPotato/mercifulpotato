I tried to do the right thing and emulate a successful adult life, but it&#x27;s been a pretty miserable experience so far.<p>At this point, after so many years in tech, there&#x27;s no way I could convince the government that they should cover my health care and pay me a stipend because I&#x27;m so disabled that I can&#x27;t work.<p>There&#x27;s not much else to do at this point besides push through to retirement, one day at a time.')
