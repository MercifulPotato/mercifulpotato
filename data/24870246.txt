I think ‘do the busy work’ can even be applied more broadly:<p>Years ago I ran a small business in my mid-20s, and one of the critical mistakes I made was getting hopelessly behind in our bookkeeping (and by hopelessly behind I mean it - things were going well and the bank account kept going up, so I kinda just piled the sales receipts on top of each other for close to a year).<p>When the company started to grow up, we had to get properly reconciled financial statements in order for our bank loans to be renewed.  I hired what felt like an endless stream of contract bookkeepers and financial consultants who all had their own way of “doing it more simply” to try and avoid what at that point was probably 100 hours of busywork to reconcile all the credit card transactions.<p>They all failed.  We just kept falling more and more behind and lost resolution on how the business was doing.<p>In the end, the ONLY thing that worked was when I found someone who understood this and just rolled his sleeves up and did the work.  There simply was no way around it.  No shortcuts.  No way to intuit how your business was doing without knowing exactly how much each customer spent.  And no way to do that without matching up each credit card transaction.<p>Do the work.  Don’t try to find ways around doing it because it’s hard or rote or mind numbing.  Do the work.')
