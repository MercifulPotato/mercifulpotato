Item(by='netsharc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607864897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404760, text='&gt;I&#x27;d be surprised if there weren&#x27;t some frivolous ones in there.<p>But the frivolous ones are being made by a team of &quot;presidential&quot; &quot;lawyers&quot;...<p>&gt; If your argument is simply &quot;No good case has been made yet, therefore no good case can be made&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not my argument, nice effort trying to use your powers of deduction, but I&#x27;d take it back to the supplier and tell them it&#x27;s defective.<p>&gt; we can&#x27;t know until they are presented.<p>So should we give Team Total Landscaping all the time they&#x27;d like?<p>I would bet some money that there was at least 1 fraudulent vote during the whole election. I would bet more money that there weren&#x27;t that many fraudulent votes that if they were cancelled it would flip the results and give Trump the win. Trump and Giuliani are screaming &quot;massive fraud&quot;, which sounds like they have a good case, but they&#x27;ve shown up to the court empty handed. Some have argued &quot;they&#x27;re just preparing the very good case&quot;, geezus christ that&#x27;s not how that works, and besides, their time is running out.<p>If a team of astrophycists from a famous university started screaming &quot;Something&#x27;s happened to the sun, it won&#x27;t rise tomorrow&quot;, we&#x27;d pay attention. If we ask them to show us what data they have, but they refuse, and they just continue yelling shit, we&#x27;d start wondering if they&#x27;re still sane. And if the sun rose tomorrow, we&#x27;d be more certain that they&#x27;ve lost the plot. Maybe they&#x27;d change their claims, still offering no proof, but if the sun still rose the next day...<p>If a group of homeless people claimed the same thing, we&#x27;d probably laugh and continue with our day. Sadly some people are being fooled by a bunch of &quot;homeless&quot; people, probably willingly because they can&#x27;t admit to themselves that they&#x27;ve been fooled by conmen.')
