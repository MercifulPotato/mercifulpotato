Although I don&#x27;t have hard numbers, my impression is that the USF (Universal Service Fund) is a typical government boondoggle, and the RDOF auction format was a pretty innovative way to distribute the funds.<p>For a minute there it looked like they would try to exclude SpaceX from bidding in the high bandwidth &#x2F; low latency tier, but ultimately they went with taking a chance on their unproven tech and they were able to win $885 million in subsidies.')
