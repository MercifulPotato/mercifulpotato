Without him, Greece could just pretend their situation since is due to the weather.<p>If you&#x27;re an ideologue, you can somehow twist that regret into blaming him for German banks making massive loans to Greece to pay for things like military equipment that they didn&#x27;t need, and the inability of Greece&#x27;s currency to adjust in order to keep this from happening.
