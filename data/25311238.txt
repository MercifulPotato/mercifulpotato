Specially given that a lot of reviews in more popular conference are very hit and miss.  You can submit the same paper to the same conference multiple times and get wildly different opinions on the same paper.<p>The variation in reviewers&#x27; response is often due their lack of knowledge and unfamiliarity with the problem.  Take a look at the recent reviews on some of the more popular conferences on OpenReview.net.  Most of the reviews don&#x27;t have any substance and are often vague&#x2F;generic.<p>I&#x27;d take the reviews from peers that I trust and are aware of my work more seriously than reviewers of conferences.')
