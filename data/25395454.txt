Item(by='davidf560', descendants=None, kids=[25395595], score=None, time=1607746406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395176, text='The FDA announced early this morning that they were definitively going to authorize it[1], but they didn&#x27;t actually issue the authorization at that point, with people telling the press that authorization would come &quot;in the next few days&quot;.<p>If someone called up the FDA after that and said &quot;hey, you&#x27;ve already told everyone you&#x27;re going to approve this, so just sign the papers and make it official today rather than going home for the weekend and finishing it up on Monday&quot;, I have no problem with that. That&#x27;s not pressure to prematurely authorize it (since they already confirmed they would), that&#x27;s just cutting through the red tape&#x2F;BS and making it official faster (IMO).<p>Put it into a tech perspective - if your company&#x27;s cloud product went down and you were losing $millions every hour, and the devs found the bug and fixed it, but the product manager said &quot;hey great, we&#x27;ll fill out the release paperwork in the next few days and maybe approve pushing the change to prod on Monday&quot;, would anyone go for that? No way - they&#x27;d say we&#x27;re not going home until this is fixed and released. Replace $millions with actual human lives and that&#x27;s basically what we have here, isn&#x27;t it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-statement-vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-meeting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-stat...</a>')
