Look at all the tooling and workflows that depend on GitHub.  Issues, pull requests, code review, etc..  Combine it with integrated services that require GitHub to run like Actions (CI) and Codespaces (dev env) and you start to see how it works.<p>In a few years it&#x27;ll be normal for new developers to view a software project and a GitHub project as the same thing because the entire process from creating the project to publishing it (on Azure most likely) will happen via GitHub.<p>Saying that no one is dependent on GitHub is like saying a mechanic isn&#x27;t dependent on their tools.  Moving away from GitHub is like a mechanic walking out of the garage with a single crescent wrench (the git repo).  Then you find out no one else sells any of the tools you know how to use and that the only option is to rent them from someone else (Atlassian or GitLab).')
