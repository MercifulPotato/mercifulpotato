Without much care, because surely, anything I&#x27;m able to do will be on mass market in a few years. Long story short even ignoring relying  on 3rd party servers and privacy concerns there are still no comparable commercial solutions today I&#x27;m aware of. Latency, reliability, being able to create actually &quot;smart&quot; home instead of having 20 gimmicks.<p>This is not meant as a brag. I think the market is just too small and to truly have anything remotely &quot;intelligent&quot; you basically need to be a coder because there is no better way to tell your system how to behave. Even then it takes few years to iron out special conditions and however small ongoing maintenance.<p>On the bright side, micro-controllers, sensors and single board computers market blossomed so nicely that it&#x27;s basically lego blocks if you have basic electronics understanding.<p>Coders can dive in easily, but I should warn you, an approach of &quot;I like tinkering&quot; will make you much happier than &quot;I want to get this thing done, it will save me time&quot;.')
