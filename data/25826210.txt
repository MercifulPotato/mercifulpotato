Yes, there are a lot of bad things that happen in Bangladesh--it&#x27;s a very poor country, with limited law and order, political unrest, and significant problems with organized crime and gangs. One wonders what things would be like if--on top of all of that--more than a quarter of kids were growing up fatherless like in the US.')
