There&#x27;s a lot you can learn from a picture. Often enough to say &quot;You don&#x27;t seem like my type.&quot;<p>If I don&#x27;t want kids, I won&#x27;t swipe on a picture with kids. I&#x27;ll rule out somebody whose picture is doing shots with friends in a bar. Conversely, if a photo has a bookshelf, I&#x27;m certainly going to take a closer look.<p>The filtering happens at some point. There are thousands of women there and I don&#x27;t have time to chat with all of them. I swipe the ones I think I have something to talk about with. Your photo conveys your personality, and people who put time into selecting a photo that gives me something to talk about are attractive to me.')
