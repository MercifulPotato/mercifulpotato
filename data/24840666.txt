But even now Rust, I think, together with C++, Ada, and Scala, easily ranks among the top five or so most complex programming languages in software history.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a matter of personal taste, but <i>to me</i>, Rust seems a monumental, awe-inspiring shrine erected to worship at the altar of accidental complexity. I admire the technical achievement -- I never imagined accidental complexity could be given such spectacular prominence -- but having spent my share of time with both C++ and Ada, I&#x27;d like to look elsewhere. I don&#x27;t know if Zig will do the job, but the vision it has for low-level development is so refreshing, radical and different from everything else I&#x27;ve seen in my &gt;20 years of professional software development that I&#x27;d like to give it a chance before settling for an improved C++. Anyway, it&#x27;s a matter of personal aesthetic preference.')
