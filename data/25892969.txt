That is, as you say, a major reason to use it.<p>However. That assumes you are only needing to edit text with basic formatting (bold, underline, etc...) As soon as you get into anything more complex you pretty much have to understand HTML and CSS.<p>I just ran into this with three different Wordpress installs. Two use Divi and the third uses WP Bakery. Those are really nice plugins and in 100% of the cases, the person using the site told me they don’t understand what’s going on and kept making a mess of something.<p>I’m guessing that for The Whitehouse site they will mostly be doing minimal content editing. Then again, they have the resources to have a person who understands HTML and CSS manage the site when things get tricky.<p>I’m not saying Wordpress is bad but it very quickly can become not as easy to use as most people make it out to be.')
