On a personal note, most of us on the team have been there in one way or another, struggling to actually monitor our own work. We’ve had surprise Datadog bills and felt the pain of scaling Prometheus. (In fact, I’m planning a blog post about this struggle, so stay tuned.)  It feels like this problem should already be solved, but it’s not. So we’re trying to fix it.')
