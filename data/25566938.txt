But it&#x27;s a balance of keeping myself happy&#x2F;learning and having cash, and I&#x27;m OK enough on cash that I do this to keep myself happy and learning.<p>Adoption is... decent? One of the interesting parts of this is that I will really never know how many people are using it because a lot of people will take the project, implement something, but definitely not post it to somewhere like github. And really, that&#x27;s fine. There are games using the library on Steam right now, a few commercial systems that use it, and I get lots of reports from independent developers doing different things with it, so that&#x27;d good enough for me.')
