Other than that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen or heard of any issues across a large range of more modern SSDs. The reliability and endurange issues which occured on earlier SSDs no longer seem to be a problem (this is in part because flash density has skyrocketed: because each flash chip can operate more or less independently, the more storage an SSD has the faster it can run and the more write endurance it has).')
