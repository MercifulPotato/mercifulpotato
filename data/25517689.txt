But you can also offer your clients direct execution on the exchange, in which case you don&#x27;t have to (and must not) shop the order around. If RH had done that, they&#x27;d be in the clear.<p>Yes, I understand that retail brokers aren&#x27;t usually in the business of directed orders (because shopping round the orders is in the interest of both them and the client).')
