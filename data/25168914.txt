A mathematician would laugh you out of the store if you tried to get them to used cubical Lean (Lean 2 by the way implemented HoTT ideas) and give up classical logic.<p>The HoTT people are doing good work and I don&#x27;t doubt that automation can help with the _significant_ additional complexity of higher dimensional cubes, but that&#x27;s not really all that would be missing.<p>Finally, if you can&#x27;t claim Lean is good enough for all Mathematics then you can&#x27;t claim it for any existing system or any system that doesn&#x27;t take classical logic seriously (postulating an axiom doesn&#x27;t count).')
