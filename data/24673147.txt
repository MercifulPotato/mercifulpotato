First, it is not intended for non technical folks, this was never claimed! However, even if it was, we are currently working on a gui, where (non technical)users can run it by writing a simple cmd in the terminal.<p>Second, I&#x27;m a technical user, in fact this is my daily work and we build this tool for reasons that were mentioned in the docs&#x2F;readme, so you can check it out.<p>Third, you mentioned understanding YAML Format. Really? I mean yaml is the most understandable format any person can understand. I can never imagine that a person cannot learn yaml in 30 min at most.<p>Finally, yes sklearn is great and well documented but did you checked how many libraries are out there that represent basically a wrapper to make it easier&#x2F;abstracter to write sklearn code? you ll be surprised.<p>As discussed in the official repo &amp; docs, it is a much cleaner approach to gather your preprocessing &amp; model definition parameters&#x2F;configs in one human readable file&#x2F;place, where you can manipulate it easily. Re-run experiments, generate drafts, building proof of concepts as fast as possible, than to write code. At the end of the day, we all have different opinions, you can still write code of course. The tools are there to help.')
