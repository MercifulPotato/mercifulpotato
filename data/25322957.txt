I&#x27;ve been burned a few times trying to pick something new to base a non-trivial app on. Almost every time I do this I end up running into bugs that haven&#x27;t been reported or documented anywhere. Building an app and starting a business is hard enough.

This round up post[1] goes into more detail on innovation tokens (aka. a system for choosing new tech in a controlled way) and other trend extractions from 50+ episodes.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runninginproduction.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runninginproduction.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;talking-with-52-devs-about-building-deploying-web-apps-and-tech-stacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;talking-with-52-devs-about-bu...</a>')
