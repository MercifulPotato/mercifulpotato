A horse trainer once said to me, &quot;Animals don&#x27;t think, they just make associations.&quot; I responded to that by saying, &quot;If making associations is not thinking, then I would have to conclude that I do not think.&quot; People with autism and animals both think by making visual associations. These associations are like snapshots of events and tend to be very specific. For example, a horse might fear bearded men when it sees one in the barn, but bearded men might be tolerated in the riding arena. In this situation the horse may only fear bearded men in the barn because he may have had a bad past experience in the barn with a bearded man.')
