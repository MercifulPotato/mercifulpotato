Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602189124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710798, text='To restate my comment in more precise terms, users do not care which protocol of { HTTP&#x2F;0, HTTP&#x2F;1, HTTP&#x2F;2, HTTP&#x2F;3 } their browser selects and uses when communicating with the remote server at whatever URL they entered. They expect the URL to work, and they don&#x27;t care how.<p>The Unifi issue you cite is due to a series of problems that are related to the <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> migration, most of which Unifi could have easily discovered and mitigated had they cared to. I&#x27;m really disappointed in Unifi here, but the browser is at fault, too.<p>First: Your browser&#x27;s fallback process for handling &quot;the user entered an invalid URI&quot; is attempting <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> first, rather than <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> first.<p>Second: The Unifi is responding over <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> with a completely useless error page, rather than a redirect to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> at the same port.<p>Third: The Unifi probably isn&#x27;t setting a Strict-Transport-Security header on responses to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;:8443" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;:8443</a>, which means that your browser can&#x27;t learn a better default.<p>Fourth: If the Unifi&#x27;s instructions tell you to enter &quot;unifi.home.arpa:8443&quot; <i>rather than</i> &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unifi.home.arpa:8443" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unifi.home.arpa:8443</a>&quot;, their instructions are clearly wrong. (If you&#x27;re not following their instructions precisely as written, that would explain your discover of the prior three; I can&#x27;t say I blame you â€” I would have left it off too.)')
