Similar to Python getattr(), setattr(), hasattr() APIs.<p>This package provides user friendly helper APIs built on top of the Golang &quot;reflect&quot; library. Reflect library is tricky to use due to its low level nature and results in a panic if an incorrect input is provided. This package provides high level abstractions on such tricky APIs in a user friendly manner.')
