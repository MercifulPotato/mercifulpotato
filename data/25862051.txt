However the later seems appropriate more as an attitude towards work. Kind of subtle &quot;to try to be something&quot; this sort of carries notes of fabrication and possibly hubris? Alternatively, &quot;to strive to be something&quot; carries a degree of humility of knowing you may not attain it, but recognizing it&#x27;s the process of convergence that matters not the ultimate end state. I may be reading too much into this but those are the thoughts that cone to mind.')
