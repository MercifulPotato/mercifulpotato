I find it sad that people are trying to get into compsci just to get ahead in their career. It&#x27;s also sad that Asian parents are pressuring and coercing children and teens into high-workload test prep classes, creating a toxic environment optimizing for top colleges with stratospheric admissions criteria, at the expense of mental health. Top college admissions essays select for self-aggrandizement, and they often have stricter requirements for Asian students.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that Asian (specifically Chinese) parents push for education because it was the only path out of poverty in China and after immigrating to the US, and others saying that in the US, pursuing high-income careers is necessary in the face of racial discrimination in broader society.')
