I am well aware of defcon&#x27;s voting village. I&#x27;m well aware of many of the issues with voting machines and actively advocate for better security (and voting methods).<p>But I think you&#x27;d taking the results too far. You&#x27;d have to hack into hundreds or thousands of machines within a single state to change its votes. Worse, you have to do this in a way that looks plausible. You&#x27;re talking about a major conspiracy that would have to take place. And if Russia is going to change votes why wouldn&#x27;t China, Israel, or others? So they would have to all organize together so they don&#x27;t undo one another&#x27;s work. And that would have to happen without us (NSA, FBI, CIA) finding out. You&#x27;re talking about a conspiracy that would be very difficult to pull off and require high amounts of organization.<p>Hacking a computer is easy. Hacking a thousand computers in a room full of people that are worried about their computers being hacked? Different story.')
