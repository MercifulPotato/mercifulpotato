We don&#x27;t need to find a physical process that produces a modern DNA molecule from &#x27;raw parts&#x27;, rather one that takes not-quite-DNA and converts it into DNA.</i><p>We haven&#x27;t found that, and apparently aren&#x27;t even close. We don&#x27;t even have any idea what something like that might look like, or even more critically: given all the incredibly, insanely, unbelievably rare DNA sequences that exist in the world today, why is such a fundamental process capable of producing them not abundant as fuck already? Where&#x27;d it go? Why is this process even a mystery in 2020? It should be <i>ubiquitous</i>; in fact, all of the primordial soup mechanisms should be. Certainly that&#x27;s what we <i>expected</i> when the theory was developed, and it hasn&#x27;t panned out.<p>Anyway, I think we&#x27;ve exhausted this topic. Thanks for commenting.')
