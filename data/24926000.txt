For most users X is good enough, and replacing it with a quasi beta-quality implementation is not appealing to them. As long as there is only a very small group interested in developing the Wayland ecosystem, it is unlikely ever to get to the point where users (or distros) can be convinced to adopt it.<p>The way things are currently going, Wayland may turn out to be another HURD: it&#x27;s always a year away from being ready, and there are some enthusiasts working on it, but in the end, it is supplanted by a more pragmatic solution. And the only way that is happening is once X is falling apart enough that some company like Redhat coordinates an effort to replace it.')
