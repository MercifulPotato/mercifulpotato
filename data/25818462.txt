My network of friends has kids older than my own. So they pass all the clothes down - some of them rarely worn. Obviously shoes, undergarments and socks are an exception. Almost everything else is fair game.<p>We have rarely bought our kids clothes.<p>On the flip side, we had bought a new crib when my first one was born. It lasted through our 2 kids and now with a family who uses it for her grandchild.')
