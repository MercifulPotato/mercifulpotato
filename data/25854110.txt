I’d need to do some homework to prove it, but my theory is more power is used every second for Bitcoin than an hour’s worth of videoconferencing worldwide. That said, we have to start somewhere, but is videoconferencing really the thing that’ll have any positive impact on CO2 emissions?<p>Edit:<p>Per this source[0] (no claims to its accuracy), a <i>single transaction</i> on Bitcoin causes nearly 300kg of CO2 to be emitted. So compared even to the high point of the article’s range (aka 1kg per hour meeting, though the included chart shows ~1&#x2F;10th that for Zoom), that’s multiple orders of magnitude higher, <i>per transaction</i>.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption</a><p>Edit 2:<p>I did some further research and multiple seemingly solid sources give <i>conservative</i> estimates of Bitcoin electricity consumption in the range of 80-100TWh per annum. To put that number in perspective,  that’s more electricity <i>per year</i> than <i>all</i> of Google’s servers worldwide combined since its founding over <i>twenty years ago</i> (estimates put that number around 75TWh). I’m not going to keep digging, but based on the numbers I saw, I have a feeling Bitcoin uses more electricity per year than AWS, Google, FB, Microsoft, and Apple’s data centers combined per year. I’ll leave it to you to decide if Bitcoin is worth it and you should just turn off your webcam next time you’re on a videoconference to save the environment!')
