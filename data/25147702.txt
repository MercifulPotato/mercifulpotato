That is crystal clear and there is not even any leeway for interpretation about it. On a side note, the kind of justifications &#x2F; rationalization you give for the annexation - somebody installed politicians there that were not pleasing Russia enough - are not only factually incorrect, too, they are also irrelevant to the question whether the Crimea was annexed by Russia or not.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you think the &quot;green men&quot; militia came from, but I know for certain that they were Russian military (and no, not on vacation). And let&#x27;s not forget that a Buk system was provided directly from Russia that then downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, killing all 283 crew and passengers. Dutch authorities and international investigators have uncovered and documented every single minute of this crime, from the arrival of the BUK system to its hasty departure afterwards, and identified the Russian officers involved in it by name and picture.<p>These are the facts.')
