Or why is there a tiny amount of scroll overflow here when I specify overflow-x hidden? What does vertical-align do and how does it work when inline and inline-block boxes are in an inline flow? etc. etc.<p>So I would add that the next frontier after learning the proposed foundations is learning how the browser actually determines box sizes and layout, and I think this is difficult to understand, mainly because it jumps straight into the spec, or worse, your browser&#x27;s layout engine specifics.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;css-sizing-3&#x2F;#auto-box-sizes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;css-sizing-3&#x2F;#auto-box-sizes</a> for instance is a nontrivial subsystem that a CSS dev will easily run into when nesting flex containers, and I think the standard box model of yore wasn&#x27;t really written to help grok these concepts.<p>Edit: one particularly hairy explanation from the spec I recently ran into while trying to deepen my understanding of the box model:<p>&quot;Except for table boxes, which are described in a later chapter, and replaced elements, a block-level box is also a block container box. A block container box either contains only block-level boxes or establishes an inline formatting context and thus contains only inline-level boxes. Not all block container boxes are block-level boxes: non-replaced inline blocks and non-replaced table cells are block containers but not block-level boxes. Block-level boxes that are also block containers are called block boxes.&quot;<p>Not saying this is relevant for the average use case, but I believe even something like the box model is a day-to-learn-lifetime-to-master kind of thing.')
