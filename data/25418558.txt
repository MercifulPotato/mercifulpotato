They&#x27;ll play for position, rather than material advantage. Your pieces will be less of a threat, and won&#x27;t be guarding the squares they need to guard. Taking material would just slow them down.<p>They might even just let you take pieces, since you don&#x27;t know what pieces are involved in the attack and which aren&#x27;t. There&#x27;s even a name for it: &quot;pawn munching&quot;. It&#x27;s not a compliment.')
