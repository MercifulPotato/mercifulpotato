Do hotels and restaurants in California demand to see proof that you are a registered Democrat before you are allowed to patronize them? Do liberal employers start carrying out mass firings of conservative employees?<p>Except those are false equivalences.  It&#x27;s not &quot;conservatives&quot; that are the problem.  And they aren&#x27;t.<p>They have just as much right as anyone else to their point of view, political preferences and to advocate for them as anyone else.<p>However, those who would use violence, intimidation and lies to advance their political goals are <i>not</i> conservatives.  Or liberals.<p>They are, at best criminal thugs and, at worst, radical insurrectionists bent on destroying our constitutional republic and the rule of law.<p>And calling such folks out for their behavior isn&#x27;t a slap at &quot;conservatives,&quot; because those who are honest when they call themselves that (at least in the US) want to <i>preserve</i> our constitutional system of government and the rule of law.<p>Don&#x27;t conflate the two.  Because they aren&#x27;t even remotely similar.')
