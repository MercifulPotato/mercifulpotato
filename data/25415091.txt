Take a few youth as projects and start working with them, improving their lives. Donate to existing youth groups.<p>In our community, all crime has dropped tremendously since we started, and many youths now have purpose to their lives that will (hopefully) keep them from ever joining such groups.<p>And, importantly, don&#x27;t forget your own kids. Keep an eye on their friends when growing up, make sure you spend the time to keep a good relationship with them.<p>If everyone in Central America consciously worked to raise their kids to be better people, and each also took two or three less fortunate kids as projects, it would show. (I am sure plenty do, but we need more working to improve the world!)')
