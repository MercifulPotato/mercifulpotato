It&#x27;s just easier to blame foreigners.<p>I&#x27;ve read stats that indicate that nearly <i>20%</i> of home owners in the Toronto area own at least one additional &quot;investment&quot; property. This rings true with my own experience, as the cult of home ownership is ridiculously strong in Canada, and many have been betting on and fueling rampant speculation for the past decade -- buying boxes in the sky for hundreds of thousands of dollars under the assumption that real estate just keeps going up.<p>But the anecdotal stories about the occasional foreign buyer is somehow much more satisfying and comforting than the thought that Canadians are also responsible.')
