If people want to spend their own money outside the single payer system, why not let them?  It doesn&#x27;t absolve them of contributing to the public system, so the public system benefits when they decide to go outside it.<p>And in Canada, there isn&#x27;t much private healthcare because of the way Medicare is set up.  A doctor has to choose - practice in the public system <i>or</i> the private system - they can&#x27;t do both.<p>As a result, you have a handful of doctors who do private with the majority in the public system.  For certain procedures there is actually a lot of private healthcare in Canada.  Take a look at MRI&#x27;s.  Instead of waiting 2 or 3 months for an MRI you can pay $300 and get one this week and send the results to your doctor.')
