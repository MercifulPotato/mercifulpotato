Other commenters have touched on this (pointing out the decline of community orientation, rise of corporate oversight, or the fading glamour, for example), but no one has identified it directly.<p>The article points out that we collectively re-examined Brook&#x27;s rule, going from &quot;adding more engineers to a project makes it ship later&quot; to &quot;if you need to get more work done, go attract more contributors.&quot; I think the evidence shows it&#x27;s more nuanced.<p>If you have a large amount of potential tasks and a large pool of potential contributors, and little strong preference for which tasks get done (OSS in the 90&#x27;s maybe) then highly self-motivated people can pick up work they find interesting or which are useful for them. You can then avoid the exponential explosion of communication&#x2F;coordination overhead by empowering those individual contributors to make their own decisions about how that work should be done. This is how OSS can scale to hundreds of contributors.<p>Once you introduce some sort of top-down planning that dictates which tasks are important, the blessed approaches, strict coding patterns etc. then you demotivate a large number of contributors who don&#x27;t share the top-down priorities and you have to pay the exponential overhead cost of distributed coordination to enforce the top-down priorities.')
