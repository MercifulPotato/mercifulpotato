I suppose nobody had punched tape on their home or office computers, it was in the realm of programmers and operators.<p>The disks are mechanical devices, so their shape is dictated by function and thus was uniform. E.g. USB flash drives do not have such consistency.<p>What the endgame of symbols look like is easy to see in Chinese &#x2F; Japanese. E.g. &quot;save&quot; ‰øù consists of a man, a mouth, and a tree. It&#x27;s about as easy to make sense of as a combination of a square with a cut corner and a rectangle inside it.')
