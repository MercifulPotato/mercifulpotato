If someone is holding a sign on a street corner saying &#x27;the holocaust didn&#x27;t happen&#x27; then I may find that quite objectionable but I can choose to go and remonstrate with the person or conserve my psychic energy and ignore them. On the other hand, if I&#x27;m having a discussion about history and a person comes up tries to force their way into the conversation,  my walking away is ceding them the space that I formerly occupied.<p>In the physical world there&#x27;s a cost to moving around and and physical constraints on people, so if I hear someone on the other side of town is holding an objectionable sign I have to decide whether I care enough to physically go there. that calculus might change if the objectionable message were on a billboard or an objectionable speaker were holding a rally with amplified sound, in which case I might consider it more worth my while to refute their prominent or loudly-staged opinion.<p>In the virtual world distance isn&#x27;t a practical factor so it becomes trivially easy for people in different communities to raid each other and engage in semantic provocations, often with few consequences. Interestingly, there is some evidence that responding to provocation with aggression is more effective in deterring raiding behavior than politely ignoring it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snap.stanford.edu&#x2F;conflict&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snap.stanford.edu&#x2F;conflict&#x2F;</a><p>It should be borne in mind that the object of raiding (whether for sport as in MMORPGs or for deadly serious reasons as in military conflicts) is to drive people out of territory that they occupy. Getting them to walk away by being sufficiently obnoxious is not directly violent, but is often predicated on an implicit threat of violence.')
