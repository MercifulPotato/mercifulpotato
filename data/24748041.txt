You said the logical conclusion would be them <i>participating</i> in the doxxing.  Those are very different things.  The list of actions that I think are justified but don&#x27;t participate in is enormous.<p>(And by &quot;mandatory for everyone that believes that&quot; I meant that logic would mandate it, which is the same as it being the logical conclusion.)<p>But even with your new version, just talking about it being justified, well that&#x27;s not necessarily the logical conclusion.  One reason is that their participation is at a different level, so the justification might not extend to them.<p>And if you go by the motive in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24738218" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24738218</a> then identifying the police is being done for a very direct purpose to level the playing field on the ground.  Someone might reasonably feel that this reason doesn&#x27;t apply to Apple employees, even while saying that Apple employees have blood on their hands.')
