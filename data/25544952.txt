If, say, your city bus network is designed so that each driver can make a 5 minute stop at terminus and fill up when required, of course pushing an electric bus into that will create 1-2h gaps in service and be &quot;not fit to operational requirements&quot;. But it&#x27;s a simple exercise to shift things around so that all recharging is done in low demand periods and all your fleet is online during rush hour.<p>The bottom line: electrics are quickly overcoming the 1000Km&#x2F;charge barrier, in the next 10 years it will probably become the norm.  That&#x27;s a charge level that can last you a full day in almost any conceivable usage mode, so it can cover 99% of real world tasks.<p>Sure, there will still be very specialized tasks where 2 hours of downtime per day is unacceptable, or some fresh produce delivery route that requires 36 hours non stop driving by a shift of truckers. But that would be negligible in the grand scheme of things.')
