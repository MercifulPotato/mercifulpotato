Additionally with GraphHopper walking routes avoid bigger streets and consider many signals from OpenStreetMap data. My personal route would probably just to avoid some dark parks to be honest as every detour is ugly.<p>And so a nice feature is the customizable routing where you can change your preferences per request because it is not clear if a longer detour along lamps is really safer if it is twice the length and at which point your personal preferences are or how you wish to mix other signals into the cost function of the route.<p>Check out the next release soon that will get a heavily improved customization feature: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphhopper&#x2F;graphhopper&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphhopper&#x2F;graphhopper&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2209</a>')
