It&#x27;s not really a &#x27;programming language&#x27; in the way software engineers would see it. It&#x27;s more a loose collection of stats functionality that is tied together with text interfactes in a way that somewhat looks like programming to the uninitiated. I mean, batch scripting is technically &#x27;programming&#x27;, and Excel (even without VBA) is technically Turing complete, but neither of those would be considered &#x27;programming&#x27; by software engineers, at least not under an intuitive understanding of what &#x27;programming&#x27; is. (by that I mean, it&#x27;s easy to be pedantic and argue that R and batch files and Excel files are &#x27;programming&#x27; because of [xyz] where [xyz] will probably involve real &#x27;definitions&#x27; and selection criteria etc; but despite those tools being <i>useful</i>, you can&#x27;t do real <i>software engineering</i> in them, which you sometimes want&#x2F;need).')
