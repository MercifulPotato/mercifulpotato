And if this person is ready to do this, why is the latter person held responsible for this?<p>&gt;&gt;They&#x27;ll both be listed as &quot;computer related occupations&quot; and apply for the same visa in the same quota. Does that makes any sense to anyone?<p>Yes, because they are being hired to do the same job. Hiring Captain America as a guard at ToysRUs doesn&#x27;t change the job description of a security guard. It just means Captain America make a bad decision to work the wrong job.')
