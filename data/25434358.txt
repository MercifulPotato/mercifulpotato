A crawl+index company that gives equal access to all competitors.<p>The search front companies would use the index to retrieve pages, then they would rank these pages with their own criteria and filter with their own white&#x2F;black lists, then present the result in their own UI. Each one would have their own ads and tracking (or lack thereof). The index would not be able to know the identities of the users.<p>In the end they all boil down to an &quot;attention economy&quot;, it&#x27;s about us and our eyeballs, we should have more say on what we are consuming.<p>The part about ranking, filtering, tracking and UI is true for FaceBook and Twitter as well, even though they are a different kind of service. We could have alternative views on these systems, where we have more control on the way the system manipulates the information for us.')
