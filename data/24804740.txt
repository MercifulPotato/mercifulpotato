It changes as you attempt to become it. It changes because you learn more about yourself and the universe _as_ you try to change.<p>So while your knowledge and perception of the universe is always imperfect, it can also always improve. Pursuit of your better self is the means by which you both improve yourself and your knowledge of what that better self is.')
