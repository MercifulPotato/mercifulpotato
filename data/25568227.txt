A lot of the non-metallic mass of the satellite would probably vaporize, but any surviving bits would have a bunch of added kinetic energy.<p>Especially for things that reflect both infrared and soft x-rays, with pretty high melting points and pretty high thermal masses, nuclear explosions do less damage than you&#x27;d think.<p>There was a nuclear test where they put a steel sphere about the size of a bowling ball pretty close to a device similar to Gadget &#x2F; Fat Man.  Spoiler alert: it survived barely scratched.[0]<p>You could probably design a satellite with thin enough pieces of metal and add carbon black &#x2F; carbon fiber to any polymers too transparent to IR&#x2F;soft x-rays.  You could probably also use a thermonuclear device, but the particle steams caught in the earth&#x27;s magnetic field would damage satellites, and there&#x27;s also the EMP to worry about.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=by1xpy8ob8E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=by1xpy8ob8E</a>')
