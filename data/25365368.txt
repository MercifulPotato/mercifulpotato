It&#x27;s a lazy explanation since expensive city property is a problem elsewhere in the US and internationally too.<p>That continued price growth also tells you that &quot;exodus&quot; is a misleading oversimplification, since it means <i>people are still buying</i>. It wouldn&#x27;t be too expensive for the people leaving if there weren&#x27;t richer people buying!<p>(Even in a prop-13-less CA, the additional people selling their current properties to buy new CA properties instead would be adding to both the buyer pool and seller pool, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;d be an increase in inventory without an increase in buyers. So price effects seem potentially weak?)')
