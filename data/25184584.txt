It’s hard to have an informed populous when they are allowed to censor the stories that make their emotions feel bad. It’s like allowing grade schoolers to vote on what they eat for lunch every day.<p>As a reddit user, this is what you’re dealing with. The non-college educated majority has control over the following things:<p>- what politics you see\n- what comments you see \n- what science you see\n- what news you see<p>It’s going to take a while, but one of the emerging lessons of this era is that democracy for information spreading is a pretty terrible idea. Ted the conspiracy enthusiast&#x2F;barista maybe shouldn’t have the same voting power on a comment thread about orbital dynamics as an astrophysicist.')
