Should you still have to wear a mask?<p>If we are following the science, you should be fine to not wear a mask due to immunity, right?<p>Should these people also be allowed to live a normal life, gathering with others indoors, etc? I’ve never heard people giving the previously infected a pass to return to normal. I think everyone thinks it’s only fair to make them continue to suffer too, despite having immunity and ignoring the actual reason for social distancing and mask wearing.')
