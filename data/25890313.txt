I absolutely do not want to switch styles as I work on the same project. I don’t much care what the style is. Successful implementations I’ve seen include: tasking one person to pick a style, then allowing exactly one meeting in which to iron out the quibbles. Or, literally googling for a style recommendation and just choosing one of the top results, as is, no discussion.<p>I agree that the endless religious arguments must be avoided.
