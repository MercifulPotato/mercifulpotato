I was working for a mid-tier IT consultancy and a bunch of us were working at a utility on a long-term program. Having delivered the initial version of this core system, and still hanging around doing a lot more dev work (many more features and fixes), the utility turned around and did a deal with the consultancy for a dozen of us to &quot;go native&quot;, presumably with a suitable financial compensation as well as the promise of a level of continued engagement beyond our transfer.<p>The surreal part came when the CEO of the consultancy and the CIO and CFO of the utility took the dozen of us out to dinner at a very upmarket restaurant. There were multiple times that night when a few of us felt like chattel. I almost felt like I should be baring my teeth so the new owner could check me out. Very weird, but it was a win-win and I stayed at the utility 7 years doing some really interesting work.<p>EDITED TO ADD: I should point out that our salaries went up, but for the utility that was still cheaper than the T&amp;M rates they were paying.')
