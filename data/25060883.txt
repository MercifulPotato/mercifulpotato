It might help you catch some bugs a bit sooner, but, outside of languages like C that have no guard rails to speak of, the bugs I&#x27;ve seen cause problems in production are rarely, if ever, the kinds of bugs that static analysis tools are even trying to look for. I am a big fan of linting, but it&#x27;s primarily because I like anything that makes the code less surprising to future readers.<p>For a similar reason, I see the Java boilerplate as a maintenance liability because, while the IDE can write it for you, it&#x27;s a readability burden. Future readers have to look at that boilerplate, recognize it as such, and then read more closely to make sure it is perfectly standard boilerplate before they <i>actually</i> know what the code is doing. And any small deviation creates uncertainty. Was that deviation intentional or was it a mistake? The thing is, boilerplate is boring, so nobody actually does that. In short, it&#x27;s a classic example of the paradox of automation.')
