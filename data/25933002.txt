In car insurance you have multiple providers you are free to choose from with different coverage levels and service options. If your bad driving history prevents you from getting standard insurance, government programs provide a backstop alternative way to get coverage. Yes the alternative costs more, as it should, because you are responsible for your driving habits. But there are also government programs on top of that for low income drivers.<p>The point is, the free market should be plan A, and government programs should only exist to cover the gaps. Ultimately, people should be responsible for their own health, but in special cases, for no fault of their own issues, government should provide a backstop because it is the right thing to do.<p>Most taxpayers would agree with that. What they don&#x27;t want is to be forced into something that is inferior and on top of that be penalized to subsidize someone else&#x27;s premium.')
