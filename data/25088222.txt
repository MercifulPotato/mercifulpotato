I don&#x27;t remember all the settings which are changed, but it&#x27;s a substantial list. Biters are not disabled completely, (one of the achievements involve aggroing the biters with pollution) but they&#x27;re turned down enough such that they do not actually attack the base. To get them to aggro for that one achievement, you have to actually construct stuff inside of one of their cells.')
