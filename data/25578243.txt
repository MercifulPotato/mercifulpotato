It’s implemented according the constitution which is just a piece of paper and as such cannot make anyone consider or consult about anything. Instead, it does the next best thing and says “One man, one vote*” regardless of how misinformed anyone thinks they are. There are no provisions for “the electorate was misled” scenario because nobody can be trusted to determine that. So you don’t think that’s democracy? Well, that’s totally fine, it doesn’t care what you call it. To me, if people just voted for whoever was the sexiest, that would still be democracy.')
