Item(by='bawolff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611040276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830646, text='oh_sigh suggested that we should replace the general duty of a citizen to know the law of the land, with a presumption that if you have a professional license, you are knowlegable of all relavent laws and regulations, and thus cannot clam ignorance to avoid prosecution.<p>My general claim is that that is essentially already the case. If you become a citizen you have to pass a test to demonstrate familarity with the local society (if you&#x27;re born here, high school is mandatory). This is no different than how professional licensing works. You could argue that citizenship tests&#x2F;H.S. barely covers the law, but professional licensing doesn&#x27;t either. My claim is not that the current system is neccesarily perfect or good, just that the current system where you&#x27;re expected to know the law is functionally equivalent to expecting professionally licensed people (other than lawyers) to know the law, except that you just have a new class of people who are exempt for roughly no reason. Thus it doesn&#x27;t really make sense as a suggestion since it is basically what the status quo is.')
