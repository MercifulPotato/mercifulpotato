The first to trigger seroconversion, the subsequent ones to exercise the secondary immune response (and for those relative few individuals who did not seroconvert after the first jab). The interval between them is typically quite long, often on the order of years [1]. From that pov, the 3-4 week booster interval for the COVID vaccines is tiny. It&#x27;s likely the minimum possible interval given that seroconversion takes &gt;= 14 days (I&#x27;d guess the short interval was chosen to get trial results as soon as possible). There are many reasons to think that alternative dosing schedules would be not only viable but better than the current default.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;imz&#x2F;child-adolescent.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;imz&#x2F;child-adolesc...</a>')
