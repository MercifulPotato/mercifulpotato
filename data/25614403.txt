I have a repos directory and a scripts directory, and then I pretty much just use the Debian defaults. Perhaps my Google Drive structure would be more interesting, but even there the structure is pretty straightforward, with folders like Finances and Career.<p>For work it&#x27;s slightly more complex, but also more driven by the environment tools that work provides (eg a datasets folder that gets mounted into the Docker images I use to train models).')
