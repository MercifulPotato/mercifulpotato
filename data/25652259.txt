Item(by='zhdc1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609886670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651687, text='5% is more or less the long term average mortgage rate.<p>Owners generally keep a mortgage on their property (~65% of the property value) to off-set wealth and property taxes. Residences are taxed by their estimated rental values, which is treated as income. Interest payments are tax deductible, while the principal on the mortgage lowers the amount owned for wealth taxes.<p>The other issue is that most primary mortgages don&#x27;t allow for early repayment, meaning that the principal either has to be payed off in full or refinanced once the payment period is over. Owners become conditioned to continuously roll over the principal on their primary mortgage.<p>To answer your question, because the expectation is that residential property will be mortgaged through out the entire ownership period, banks have to make sure that someone who can afford the payment on a 1% mortgage can also afford the payment on a mortgage refinance if and when rates eventually go up.')
