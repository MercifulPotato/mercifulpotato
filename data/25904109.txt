In Europe you can get a Fiat Panda, brand new, for 9kâ‚¬. Smallish engine, barebones interior, but overall a pretty decent car.<p>Mitsubishi Mirage and other ~15k hatches fly off the (metaphorical) shelves.<p>Just not in the kinds of neighborhoods HN tends to live in.<p>Also HN&#x27;s househeeper tends to buy a used Corrolla (or some other hallmark of upper middle class conspicuous consumption) from one of their clients so HN doesn&#x27;t have that sort of exposure vector either.')
