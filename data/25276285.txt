Yes, Mars’s atmosphere can protect you from micrometeoroids, but it also makes it absolute hell to land anything there. The atmosphere is thick enough to burn up any spacecraft you try to land there but nowhere near thick enough to use a parachute. The moon, on the other hand, is much easier to land on using only retro rockets as brakes.')
