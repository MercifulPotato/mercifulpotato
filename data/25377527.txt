My opinion is that the deliberate abuse and exploitation of social niceties is immoral.  What I don&#x27;t see is how it being an opinion does anything to invalidate it, nor how pointing it out is an opinion is expected to convince me against holding it.<p>Edit: Perhaps I am a bit harsh here.  I am frustrated overall at the general idea that nothing can ever be condemned, and morals may not be discussed, merely because they include a subjective value judgment.  Those value judgments occur at all times, and are what give importance to the facts.')
