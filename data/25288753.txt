We had now made a binding agreement, the app and I.<p>I hate this whole premise. We <i>have to agree</i> to an incomprehensible text wall of vague legal nonsense, that very often violate our own laws (as in this case), in order to install an app.<p>These illegal contracts are completely void of any meaning, and it should not matter that you &quot;agreed&quot; to be screwed over like that. Being screwed over like this is illegal, so those who do this, should not stay safe just because you clicked &quot;I agree&quot;.')
