For an even competition, look at the numbers for the 5800X and 5900X, which are respectively $50 cheaper and $50 more expensive.  Compared to those, the 10900K isn&#x27;t impressive.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbenchmarking.org&#x2F;embed.php?i=2011098-FI-AMDRYZEN983&amp;sha=26392a4eee24&amp;p=2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbenchmarking.org&#x2F;embed.php?i=2011098-FI-AMDRYZEN...</a><p>And the reason people got excited is not because Intel parts became useless, it&#x27;s because AMD finally managed a generation of chips that flat-out beat Intel&#x27;s, even in single core performance.  Especially in light of how important a role AMD played in breaking the status quo of quad cores, putting fear in Intel&#x27;s eyes is great for competition.')
