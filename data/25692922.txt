You need to point to something that people who are in the middle will read and think, yeah that makes sense, I&#x27;m surprised you didn&#x27;t do that earlier.<p>Instead, they have this PR that I honestly disagree with, even in the current climate, I don&#x27;t see it.<p>I can only think, they wanted to ban him before he left office in order to set a precedent that they could ban him before he left office, and use that for some sort of future legal justification.  I could see this as a use to ban future presidents before the 4 years are over.  Or if he became president again they wouldn&#x27;t have to re-instate his account.')
