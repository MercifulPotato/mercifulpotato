Sorry but a chat application is no replacement for async messaging.<p>&gt; * Anyone who replies to your email unencrypted (which is the default way to reply, because email is insecure by default) will leak not just their own message but your encrypted message as well<p>This is major bullshit as they would have to know how to setup encryption to be able to decrypt your message in the first place, and all email clients I know will default to making the reply encrypted if the first message was encrypted in the first place.<p>&gt; Every archived message will eventually leak<p>Even if that were remotely true, and it&#x27;s not, the point is that you are able to TRANSMIT it over email in a safe way regardless of which provider you use. Archiving is besides the point.')
