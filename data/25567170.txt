I appreciate the concept of typing with a typewriter, which serves as input only. Your description of &#x27;maintaining the flow&#x27; is very accurate. \nWith computers it seems that using &#x27;notepad&#x27; (in Windows, for example) to type ideas quickly is the closest to using a typewriter, and avoiding distractions. Just get ideas diem as fast as possible. \nI wonder what would be involved in making that all work with a classic old electric typewriter, for instance the gigantic Selectric. It was a wonderfully clunky machine. You could really type with emotion!\n(Ps- on the other hand, I remember a long time ago, dreaming of getting a computer so that I could type ideas; articles, projects, papers, books.)')
