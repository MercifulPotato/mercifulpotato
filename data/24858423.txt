As a text editor however, emacs can never handle things like project-management, software development and testing in the same way as an IDE. Yet, it has all the features of an IDE available in some melpa repository. Unfortunately, one is always forced to configure the editor and tweak it here and there to get maybe 80% of what would be possible. And then your settings break your workflow in *that other project* or for a simple plain file. Emacs should finally acknowledge that projects are a thing and support them out-of-the-box.\n\n  I would wish for an emacs daemon that considers itself responsible for a single project and manages the language server, version control, compiler and all the other project settings. Whenever I open a file in the scope of that project, the daemon should then configure my emacs instance accordingly to work well in the context of that project.</code></pre>')
