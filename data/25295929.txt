In the past, I&#x27;ve seen positions notified internally on a pin up board in the lunchroom.  Apparently there is some law that requires that.    \nI wonder if that&#x27;s the bare minimum or if jobs have to be notified online now.  I know a lot of legal things have to be notified in newspapers for example.  This is usually the print edition which have less subscribers these days.<p>But now that companies are fully remote, how are you supposed to be notified of pending H1B, jobs etc... ?  It seems like an interesting question!')
