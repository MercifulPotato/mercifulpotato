So far it&#x27;s had huge returns 100% of the time. Is it a good strategy?<p>Obviously this is a wacky example and I&#x27;m trying to make a point, but you could overfit lots of different investment strategies that would have been 100% successful in the past; that doesn&#x27;t mean they are guaranteed to work in the future.<p>And for the record, I&#x27;m not advocating for any other investment strategy. I&#x27;m just pointing out that you cannot <i>possibly</i> claim that any strategy is going to be 100% effective in the future, because you can&#x27;t predict everything that will happen. The conditions under which DCA is effective may not hold forever, and no investment fully protects you from all risks.')
