One place I worked had a bug where users could take over accounts because of missing&#x2F;inconsistent unicode canonicalization. Case can be a problem, as can special characters.<p>There&#x27;s something to be said for strings, though. Prefixed IDs that mark the type can be nice to work with when it&#x27;s an otherwise opaque ID, but they&#x27;re a pain to handle internally.<p>If you&#x27;re storing third-party IDs, you probably want strings...unless their clever JSON API returns 1.3E6 as a number. Or the string &quot;null;&quot; that&#x27;s always an adventure.')
