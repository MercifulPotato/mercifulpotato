Then, it becomes impossible to tell whether the obfuscated code comes from program A or program B. Did I understand this correctly?<p>But this in general seems relevant only for algorithms- two algorithms can produce, provably, the same output for each of their inputs, one being better than the other in terms of performance. Fine. But then the performance of the encrypted version could actually point to the used source code, so unless it&#x27;s obfuscated away it still can be used to determine the origin of the obfuscated code. But then if the performance is also obfuscated, what reasons are left to encrypt the code?')
