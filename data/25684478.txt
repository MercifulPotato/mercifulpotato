It immediately reformatted my whole conversation list as phone numbers instead of names.  I can&#x27;t rename the conversation, but I can &quot;add to contacts&quot;... which inexplicably shows me my OS contact editor, which they&#x27;re not allowed to read.  So I guess that as punishment for not letting them constantly vacuum up my contact list and send it all to FB, they make it harder to figure out who I&#x27;m talking to.  Classic FB.')
