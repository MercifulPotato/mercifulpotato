Item(by='autarch', descendants=None, kids=[25271470], score=None, time=1606862675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267847, text='I like charity gifts!<p>For many years, I&#x27;ve made enough money that the the things I want are either easily affordable (rock climbing equipment, a gaming console, etc.) or completely unrealistic as gifts (two round trip first class tickets to Taiwan). And this is compounded by the fact that I&#x27;m the most expert person among my friends and family on most of my interests.<p>So for many years I&#x27;ve asked people not to buy me gifts for birthdays or other occasions, but to instead donate to an animal advocacy nonprofit (and I&#x27;ll suggest some to them). I&#x27;m _much_ happier to see them spend some of their money improving the state of the world, as opposed to getting me stuff that I don&#x27;t need or could purchase for myself any time I wanted it.<p>That said, some relatives still get me gifts, but at least they&#x27;re very usable, like gift cards to my favorite restaurants or book store.')
