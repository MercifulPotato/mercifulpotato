Item(by='cmrdporcupine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603889346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916267, text='Population groups, not races.<p>Skin colour is a poor dividing line between populations, though maybe on this vitamin D issue it might be more reasonable. There is no &quot;black race.&quot; There are populations of various African origins, a much more complex and messier situation that the category &quot;race&quot; obscures. There is statistically more genetic diversity _within_ Africa than in the entire human population outside of Africa, so drawing a cline based on some &quot;black&quot; or &quot;African&quot; or &quot;Negroid&quot; basket of traits is fully 19th century quackery.<p>EDIT Put another way: &quot;race&quot; is a cultural category, with little biological meaning. The key question here is vitamin D responses in southern-adapted vs. northern lattitude adapted population groups.')
