That&#x27;s something i have some experience with, unfortunately. If its a sprint i will lose the sprint. This is all normal mechanics. The only situation it doesn&#x27;t do anything is in a flat time trial which starts with everyone already at the speed they will hold for the race, which doesn&#x27;t have any change in road or wind conditions nor \nany corners. I doubt a race like that exists. maybe the triatlon comes closest because of the very long distances involved.')
