Item(by='0x5002', descendants=None, kids=[24758717], score=None, time=1602529326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756234, text='&gt;  Free speech has limits.<p>Not in America, it does not. You folks have &quot;hate speech&quot; laws, banned symbols, banned words, banned expressions, and used to have banned video games, music, and movies. The core of your legal system has the concept of &quot;honor&quot;&#x2F;&quot;dignity&quot;, which is inherently subjective.<p>The justification is always a variant of your thought, saying that it will only affect &quot;bad people&quot;, with the very definition of that being heavily influenced by the aforementioned concepts.<p>Germans tend to defend the concept of filing charges against an individual for the crime of &quot;insulting them&quot; with similar logic - it&#x27;s generally a nasty thing to do and only &quot;bad people&quot; will do it, therefore, it shall be punishable under the law.<p>Any limits to free speech are by definition on the famous &quot;slippery slope&quot;. As others have called out, once the legal precedent is set, nothing stops politicians to expand it at their will, given that it is based on subjective judgment - history can be a great teacher - and I&#x27;d like to remind you that a much harsher version of the current German &quot;social media hate speech&quot; law just made its way through international media earlier this year. This law was justified with &quot;a rise in right wing extremism&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before, I&#x27;ll say it again: The ACLU, an arguably left-leaning organization, has famously defended KKK member&#x27;s 1st amendment rights for those very reasons. They don&#x27;t argue about the content - as an analogy to the HD topic, it should be easy to debunk with massive amounts of historical evidence - but rather about fundamental human (and, in the case of the United States, constitutional) rights.<p>Naturally, all those points apply to governmental censorship and not to a private entity. That being said, I don&#x27;t believe in limits to free speech.')
