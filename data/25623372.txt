I forgot) so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s rarity.<p>Now that said, a little bit of paredit-fu allows for some funky coding sessions.. you can swap sexps, move blocks up down the tree .. you can even process the sexp with some elisp code in emacs.. it&#x27;s very very swift.<p>What annoys me is the people who never expanded their knowledge beside a few paradigm .. they&#x27;ll stick with python only or js .. or cpp. They&#x27;re stuck onto a few libs and syntax.. it&#x27;s a pity.')
