Namely the &quot;british cultural game&quot; Grand Theft Auto. How!? Yes, how is GTA a british game? Well you see Take-Two bought Rockstar, which itself was a formerly a fully UK owned company.<p>Now Take-Two has turned around and is buying out one of the UK&#x27;s few remaining publishers. No doubt the UK will now pay Take-Two yet more generous subsidies to keep Codemasters running.<p>The UK government is literally taxing domestic industries to subsidize an over seas corporation to further buy out UK industry. This is not a cohesive plan. The last thing the UK needs is to hollow out yet more industry.')
