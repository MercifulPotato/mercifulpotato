Whatsapp&#x27;s client is terrible - it not only requires a phone during signup, it requires an <i>active</i> connection to your phone, so if your battery is every running low - good luck with that.  Additionally, it allows just 1 desktop client to be active at a time, which is just a hassle.  Finally, in practice the connection to a well-charged phone is still subject to the vagaries of a phone app - it&#x27;s very common for the desktop client to lose its connection temporarily, and require the user to &quot;nudge&quot; the phone app to wake it up.<p>Much as electron is ridiculously heavy, I&#x27;d pick that <i>every single day</i> over the joke that is the whatsapp web UI.  I guess our experiences differ!')
