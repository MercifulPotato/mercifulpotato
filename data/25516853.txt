One of which was that we don&#x27;t need to crack all encryption on the planet. The &quot;suspects&quot; who did this were exactly that. Previously been identified as potential baddies, with the intent to do bad things. Authorities knew them&#x2F;about them. Authorities failed to track&#x2F;monitor&#x2F;&lt;other verbs&gt; them, and 9-11 happened (and it was a horrible horrible event).<p>Now, for the solution. Get authorities to get their shit straight, remove their heads from their asses, operate properly.<p>The solution that &quot;if nothing is a secret we would have prevented that&quot;.. imho doesn&#x27;t stand. One shouldn&#x27;t go about messing up with EVERYONE&#x27;s privacy (and defined rights) because 100&#x2F;1000 people in the world are baddies. The world shouldn&#x27;t create next one Stasi in every country because of 9-11 or Bataclan or London Bridge.<p>And lack of transparency is a pure characteristic of a &quot;Stasi&quot;.<p>Anyone with power, funding, combined with no transparency or accountability will become a dictator in their own domain.<p>Humanity is not yet mature &#x27;enough&#x27; (&#x27;enough&#x27; varies - eye of the beholder thingie)(btw this is not a threat, it&#x27;s dissapointment&#x2F;acceptance).')
