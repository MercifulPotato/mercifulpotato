It’s just one of those things you’ll need when you need.<p>Some places you might use it: real-time financial data streams, multi-agent worker task&#x2F;management, distributed database syncing. It’s basically a networking lib that makes common patterns easier. E.g send this message to everyone, list connected peers, handle these messages this way if the peer can’t take the message, and so on. They support doing this in a bunch of languages over a bunch of communication protocols.<p>Now all the Async&#x2F;coroutine&#x2F;ipc verbiage is mostly just because synchronization is a communication problem which is what zeroMQ happens to solve as well.')
