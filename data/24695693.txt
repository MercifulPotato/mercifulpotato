Looking at the site in Chrome on my OnePlus 6 (phone), it&#x27;s maybe a tiny bit large meaning around 40 characters fit on a single line, but that is far from unreadable.<p>I&#x27;ve checked a few browsers on desktop and it seems to be no problem at all there, with the added benefit that most (or all?) modern browsers let&#x27;s you easily change the font size that is used with Ctrl +&#x2F;- (or Cmd) on almost all sites. For instance, I have the fonts scaled to 125% here on HN since I find them a bit small normally. (You can do that on mobile as well, but I&#x27;m not sure if that works on a per-site basis like how it works on desktop.)')
