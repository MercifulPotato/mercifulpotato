Fun fact, this is frequently used by compilers as a &quot;cheap&quot; way to zero out a register.<p>In addition, there are comparatively few cases in programming where we XOR. Sure, it happens in things like games quite a lot, but the main use is actually _cryptography_.<p>Between these two facts (more like hints really), I managed to reverse engineer the bulk of a piece of malware I was given to analyse in a an internship. I was handed the malware, a copy of IDA Pro, and given a few days to see what I could find. All I could remember when presented with a wall of hex encoded machine code were the hints above. I looked for XORs of different values, assumed it was crypto, and extrapolated from there. Found a routine happening three times in quick succession and guessed it was triple-DES. Then I guessed that writing your own 3DES from scratch was unlikely, so googled for crypto libraries and happened to find one that nearly matched (I think an earlier&#x2F;unmodified version), and worked my way up tagging the operations until I got to the purpose, exfiltrating various registry keys and browser history to [somewhere].<p>It was a fun exercise, and therefore these facts will stay with me for far longer than they are accurate I&#x27;m sure!')
