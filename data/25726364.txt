While I didn&#x27;t get infected the site did start displaying system like prompts (my phone was also vibrating at this point and playing the same sound I get when there&#x27;s a natural disaster) saying my device was infected and that I should tap OK to download an apk.<p>I did several things after this:<p>- Reported the ad to Google (no followup from their side - naturally).<p>- Removed Chrome.<p>- Installed Firefox and uBlock Origin.')
