There&#x27;s the whole feed and there are specific feeds with topics of interest from hnrss where I ask questions and learn things from people here, or offer solutions on how we&#x27;re doing things. I regularly visit Ask HN and chime in when there are questions I may have answers to based on what I know has worked for me (being more productive, management, getting to know a code base, becoming a better individual contributor, writing better code, B2B, building product, building an organization, etc).<p>Sometimes I&#x27;ll reply with an &quot;index reply&quot;[0] that contains a collection of replies that are relevant to the Ask HN question.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25367011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25367011</a>')
