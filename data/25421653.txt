For scientific reasons? To suppress religion in some freemasonry conspiracy?</i><p>I think it has nothing to do with &quot;increasing scientific literacy&quot; or anything like that, for sure. It would be very odd that of all the scientific things you could push to teach kids, the theory of evolution is somehow the most important one. I think it has everything to do with attacking the Christian Right at their homes by forcing their kids to learn something they don&#x27;t want them to. It&#x27;s a socio-economic and political tool for war.<p>When grilled by someone, I remember Richard Dawkins, one of the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; of New Atheism, said that he just wants people to understand that it happens in nature but doesn&#x27;t want people to live by the idea of natural selection or something to that effect. In other words, he wants people to understand evolution but not &quot;believe&quot; it... i.e. in the sense that he doesn&#x27;t want people to live by it (I disagree with Dawkins, but more on that later).<p>Speaking of that, it reminds me of a comment I posted yesterday here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25412712" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25412712</a><p>I know that if one really believes in evolution, there is absolutely no reason to &quot;conserve a species&quot;. It makes absolutely no sense. Species come and go. Whatever species remain will evolve to acquire characteristics suitable for whatever changes happen... or perish. So why does everyone believe in conservation and in evolution? Because they don&#x27;t. But what if they believed in Noah&#x27;s arc? It would be terrible if one of the species that Noah himself picked to be on a boat were to go extinct because humans did something, wouldn&#x27;t it? That is exactly the reaction you see from all these westerners who allegedly &quot;believe&quot; in evolution.<p>I mean people can make use of certain rhetoric for status, or political gains or economic gains, but to actually believe those is a different matter altogether. I think westerners believe in many dogmas of Christianity, no matter how much they deny it or pretend that they are above it. I, as a non-Christian non-westerner who grew up mostly outside of the reach of westerners, see it in many aspects of how they actually live. The things that they actually believe in comes from Christianity. The things they pretend believe in comes from corporate and political PR material that they&#x27;re exposed to... and some of it they do believe, as long as it doesn&#x27;t contradict with Christianity.')
