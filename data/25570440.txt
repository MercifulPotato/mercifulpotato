Nobody remembers MAC addresses because nobody needs to: IP and the upper layers hide that. If you don&#x27;t want to adopt IPv6 because it would make remembering your IP addresses harder I&#x27;d say you have much more pressing issues to resolve first.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that many people, me included, have simply stopped remembering phone numbers (and maybe addresses) now. I have some (my parents&#x27;, etc) committed to long-term memory but there is no way I need or even try to remember new phone numbers I come across. My contacts list does it for me.<p>IPv6 adoption is slow because a) it hasn&#x27;t been essential so far, b) it&#x27;s weird and different to IPv4 and if using it isn&#x27;t essential, why bother? It&#x27;s the technical equivalent to rewriting all your recipes from imperial to metric units, despite owning scales and measuring tools that still do both.<p>(Note: I am a nerd and like playing with this stuff so I am mostly v6 where possible.)')
