Whenever they were implementing a new feature, they would write several small stored procedures to obtain data, and then process it iteratively inside the application server.<p>The ensuing result was that there was <i>far</i> too much chatter between the application server and the database server than was actually necessary; loading a new web page in the application would take <i>seconds</i> with one single concurrent user, and this was a product that was supposed to scale to <i>tens of thousands</i> of concurrent users!')
