What should be censored is what they say, not the person. This whole discussion going on everywhere misses a crucial point: Twitter and Facebook are American companies. If they blocked POTUS and where owned by China then what? I know POTUS likely wouldn&#x27;t post there then but for the sake of argument. It shows that the government(s) lack control and enforcement options.')
