Item(by='iguy', descendants=None, kids=[25160586], score=None, time=1605866460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151092, text='&gt; you know that grant money is working hard here<p>Am I the only one who finds this a little disturbing?<p>I mean the thing is beautifully produced, no doubt, I don&#x27;t want to take anything away from the skills of the people who made it.<p>But the slickness moves it somehow from &quot;scrappy bunch who gathered all the open data &amp; collaboratively figured stuff out&quot; into a different category. More like &quot;someone with very deep pockets wants to tell me a particular story&quot;. Like getting the sort of 10-page glossy brochure they use to sell manhattan penthouses, but it&#x27;s from the local animal shelter... and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the kitten pictures, the photography is excellent, but you wonder a bit who paid all those professionals, and why.')
