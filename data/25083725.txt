I have lost contact with my parents, I’m single, I do have 20-50 friends in my city but not enough to feel loved during lockdown anyway. I know social media and movies are a poor man’s affection, but I removed that, I’d be madman #10000th. I’d also argue most studies don’t check whether it’s not the lack of affection&#x2F;social fabric which causes addiction to social media and other problems.')
