We make it easy for skilled trade businesses to find, vet, and develop great employees.<p>Most skilled trade businesses (HVAC, electricians, plumbers) are bad at recruiting and training employees. More than half don&#x27;t have training programs. 3 out of 4 don&#x27;t find the internet to be an effective way to find skilled talent. Here is what the hiring&#x2F;training process at a company I spoke with looks like:<p>- Post job on craigslist<p>- Hope candidate has some experience or mechanical aptitude<p>- Rely on one of their more experienced employees to teach new employees everything while on-the-job<p>Every business owner I&#x27;ve spoken with has listed difficulty in finding skilled talent as their biggest problem. Our web platform gives businesses access to pre-screened talent and enables them to easily build a world-class, internal training program.<p>I previously led product&#x2F;bd at LendEDU (YC W16). I&#x27;m a self-taught programmer with a strong background in SEO and sales. I&#x27;m looking for a co-founder with a technical background to help me build out our platform and&#x2F;or a sales&#x2F;bd&#x2F;product background to help me develop strategy&#x2F;GTM. If you have neither, but are interested in solving this problem - I&#x27;d love to talk to you as well.<p>alex at infraschool dot co')
