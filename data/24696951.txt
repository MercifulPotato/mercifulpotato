We also see no relevance of “malleability” to the standard definition of signature security. For example, if we slightly modified the system then replacing S by −S and replacing A by −A (a slight variant of the “attack” of [75]) would convert one valid signature into another valid signature of the same message under a new public key; but it would still not accomplish the attacker’s goal, namely to forge a signature on a new message under a target public key. One such modification would be to omit A from the hashing; another such modification would be to have A encode only |A|, rather than A.<p>They key here is the second half of the paragraph: &quot;it would still not accomplish the attacker’s goal, namely to forge a signature on a new message under a target public key&quot;.<p>Similarly how the design doesn&#x27;t see a problem with malleability in the sense of converting one valid signature into another valid signature, It seems to me it was never a design goal of Ed25519 to begin with to strictly define the set of valid (and invalid) signatures.<p>This is why cryptography is difficult, because it&#x27;s easy to use a primitive in a complex system and assume things about the primitives that possibly make them unsuited for the system developed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ed25519.cr.yp.to&#x2F;ed25519-20110926.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ed25519.cr.yp.to&#x2F;ed25519-20110926.pdf</a>')
