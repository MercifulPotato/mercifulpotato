If a company manages to save on a salary because the employee doesn&#x27;t have much negotiating power, good for the company.<p>So, according to you, companies should have kept exploiting women and kept discriminating against under-represented groups by paying them less, because they didn&#x27;t have &quot;much negotiating power&quot; and because it was &quot;good for the company&quot;? Equal pay shouldn&#x27;t just work in an ideal, utopian world. It should work in all worlds because that is what is fair!')
