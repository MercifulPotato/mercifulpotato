While that&#x27;s certainly a benefit of having a single architecture to support in their product ecosystem, there have been plenty of threads on HN about how Intel&#x27;s rate of chip improvements have been stagnating. The much-touted scaleup of their 10-nm chips ended up being delayed by 2 years, and their 7-nm chips aren&#x27;t arriving until 2023, by their own (likely optimistic) estimate[1]. The more likely narrative is that relying on Intel became untenable both cost- and performance-wise.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;circuitbreaker&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;23&#x2F;21336356&#x2F;intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;circuitbreaker&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;23&#x2F;21336356&#x2F;i...</a>')
