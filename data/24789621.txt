At any of my previous jobs when work started going poorly, my friendships were, if anything, a <i>boon</i> to me because I had a support system that immediately understood my work situation and challenges. They were immediately in a position to help because of their close proximity both to me and the challenges at work I was facing. After leaving one job, the relationships with my &quot;work friends&quot; were invaluable to me in helping me find another job since they were in the same field and had connections I could leverage.<p>Outside of work, my &quot;work friends&quot; and I go out to eat, go play sports together, hang out at each other&#x27;s houses, etc. We talk about work sometimes because it&#x27;s obviously a common interest, but our friendship doesn&#x27;t revolve around it, and if someone severs their relationship with the employer that we have in common, it does not mean our friendship also severs.')
