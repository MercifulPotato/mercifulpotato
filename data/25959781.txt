If you want to avoid moving pictures during your break, the optimization of the time doesn&#x27;t have to be productive:<p>- go for a walk (even if its only within your work area)<p>- talk if you&#x27;re around someone who also needs a break)<p>- organize your time&#x2F;ideas for your next task<p>- water your plants (if you have any)<p>- play with your dog&#x2F;cat (if you have any)<p>- stretching or some other short spurt of physical activity<p>- work on a puzzle<p>- chess<p>- drawing<p>- meditate<p>- nap')
