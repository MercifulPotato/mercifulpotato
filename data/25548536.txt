But all the system built-in frameworks are shared via dynamic linking in userspace. (Eg Cocoa, UIKit, Foundation, etc). Native macos apps <i>feel</i> native because they dynamically link to the system&#x27;s standard set of UI libraries. (And more recently font sets like SF Symbols.)<p>For many reasons, none of that is available via docker.<p>The GP is also referencing the fact that even if you somehow had access to cocoa from your linux binary inside your docker VM, the docker image doesn&#x27;t &#x2F; shouldn&#x27;t have access to your host (macos&#x27;s) filesystem. So the save &#x2F; load dialog wouldn&#x27;t work properly anyway.')
