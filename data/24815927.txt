I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s &#x27;Amish&#x27; in any real sense, though: I switched from Kerrygold to it, and found it basically good but really salty. Ended up switching to Cabot, which is also regional. Maybe I&#x27;ll go back around to Kerrygold for good measure :)<p>Pretty much all I use butter for is omelets, but that&#x27;s every breakfast.')
