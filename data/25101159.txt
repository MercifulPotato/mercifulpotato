Most people who don&#x27;t want to do this cite the effort required, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to put a lot of effort into a polite refusal - you can literally just create an email template or some other copy&#x2F;paste mechanism to simplify the rejection. It shouldn&#x27;t take that much longer to refuse in this way than it would just deleting it, and then possibly having to deal with continued pokes.<p>And who knows, if you actually _do_ refuse with a note about $very_high_price as an alternative, they might just buy!')
