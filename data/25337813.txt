Someone needs to put their money where their mouth is.<p>Currently, the only company willing to bet enormous amount of money and frankly the entire Mac platform to change status quo is Apple. Maybe (and I really hope so) Apple will push other ARM processors on the desktop as a side-effects - while Qualcomm is more or less &quot;just&quot; the packer of ARM designed cores, and if I understand the market it&#x27;s entirely out of their reach to design M1-class CPU, maybe Apple will push ARM to design more efficient desktop cores. Maybe Amazon or Google will do that with their custom ARM silicon now when Apple demonstrated that processors doesn&#x27;t need to be hot to be powerful. For so long Intel sold us basically the same thing, and we cheered when AMD was just a couple percent faster. However this ends, I&#x27;m glad that someone at least rocks the boat.')
