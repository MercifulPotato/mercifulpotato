Your mileage will vary depending your usage.<p>With the announcement from Marvell&#x27;s exit [1] of ARM Server CPU it is now all but confirmed that Microsoft and Google are also working on their own ARM Server CPU. Which means all HyperScaler will now have a common interest to have Software running on ARM. And this will trickle down to every part of the industry.<p>It will take some time, depending on your scale, the cost benefits of switching over may be different. But there is no denying that Intel doesn&#x27;t have a short term ( 2-3 years ) answer. And I dont see their medium term ( 4 - 5 years ) are any better. Their new Optane SSD is really exciting though [2].<p>And I am willing to bet all of these New Server CPU comers has absolutely zero experience in CPU forecasting, and risk averse enough to put down commitment on capacity, which ultimately leads to TSMC getting a bad name yet again for &quot;Not Enough Capacity&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;impact-of-marvell-thunderx3-general-purpose-skus-canceled&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;impact-of-marvell-thunderx3-gen...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;new-intel-optane-p5800x-100-dwpd-ssd-dominates-pcie-gen4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;new-intel-optane-p5800x-100-dwp...</a>')
