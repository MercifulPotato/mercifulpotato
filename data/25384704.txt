It&#x27;s the price of living in a city.<p>So you talk to your neighbours and you come to an understanding. Since you have a long running relation with them (you live next door to each other) you can improve living conditions for both parties by communicating. If you have different party go-ers every week next door you can&#x27;t do that.<p>Housing area&#x27;s should primarily be liveable. They are not there to provide real estate for someone to speculate with or to rent out to party go&#x27;ers. Though I guess this might be a too socialist view for you in which case we&#x27;ll probably never agree with each other.')
