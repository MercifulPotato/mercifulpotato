You are bound to hit interesting problems where you can ask them what they would do, if they&#x27;ve had similar issues, how they solved it, what tech they used and why, would you do it differently now, etc.<p>If you care about performance and data structures you can dig in, you can ask what bottlenecks they had, what structures they used. I&#x27;ve had a lot of success just asking in the middle something like &quot;why not use a list or vector?&quot; (in C++), the discussion that follows tells me already if this person knows how memory works, how algorithms scale, etc and this are things I really care about in my industry, not just random trivia.<p>All of this is done as a conversation, I want to minimize their nerves as that just obfuscates the real person I&#x27;d be working with.<p>I get none of that info asking someone to invert a binary tree on a whiteboard.')
