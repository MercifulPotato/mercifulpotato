Item(by='matlag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608156197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447303, text='&gt;The idea that all of the &#x27;scandals&#x27; and morally repugnant behavior within Facebook management and in the company as a whole has been reported and revealed is so laughable that I cannot believe anyone would try to suggest this with a straight face.<p>The point is not that all potential scandals have been reported. The point is the ones that have been uncovered have been extensively reported. And that didn&#x27;t change anything to the majority of users.<p>So why would you think more scandals will do?<p>&gt; Most users stayed due to lack of a good alternative, not because they felt any affinity for Facebook.<p>When asked what the alternatives miss, the answer is almost always the network. When you ask to contribute to alternative so you grow that network, it&#x27;s &quot;meeeh, too complicated to use 2 networks&quot;. But it&#x27;s not too complicated to use FB, and Twitter, and Instagram, and Linkedin, and...<p>&quot;There is not good alternative&quot; is a lame excuse. The honest answer is: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do any effort nor any kind of compromise whatsoever&quot;.<p>And if you don&#x27;t want to change anything, in my view, you&#x27;re fine with the status quo.')
