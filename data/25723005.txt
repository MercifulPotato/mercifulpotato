I can explain more what I mean by this, but it seems unlikely you are willing to hear what I have to say. I can tell you if you&#x27;re trying to convince me to be hostile towards any specific developers for any specific project, I will have to decline to get involved with that. You don&#x27;t have to resort to character assassination, if you have some ideas on a good technical direction for a project, just make the argument and write the code: people will listen if your arguments are sound and your code works.')
