I used to be so involved in TC39, framework wars, build systems, I was super-passionate and excited about the work; I loved the inner workings of things and loved making the products and tools I and my team use as awesome as possible.<p>That lasted for nearly 15 years. In the last two years or so, though, I&#x27;ve realized that management at the utterly enormous corporation I work for simply abused that passion. Things that were &quot;works of programming art&quot; or miraculous deliveries of impossible things became not just expected but demanded. That passion was simply burned out of me. Even when I see something I built in a keynote in front of thousands of people or on a website that gets literally millions of unique views every day, my feeling is, &quot;meh.&quot;<p>The upside is that I&#x27;ve discovered other things in work and life: physical fitness, better work-life balance, and a learned defensive approach to scoping to protect the health and well-being of my team have started to define me more as a person instead of an on-demand voodoo-doctor&#x2F;wizard&#x2F;miracle worker. It comes as a detriment to my employer though... I refuse to pull all-nighters every week and my velocity has definitely dropped.<p>I have a feeling I&#x27;m not alone in this experience here. I&#x27;m assuming this very shift in perspective is why companies are less willing to hire us greybeards as opposed to fresh-faced amped-up kiddos despite our experience... we just know better.')
