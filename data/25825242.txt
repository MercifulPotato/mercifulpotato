Raku&#x27;s ability to just use many of these existing Perl modules, including ones that use XS, completely unmodified, running via standard perl binaries, and thus running exactly the same as they would be if run standalone instead of within the Inline harness; <i>and</i> using standard Raku syntax, as if Perl modules were native Raku modules; all of that, done well, is an extraordinary breakthrough.<p>Stefan Seifert did remarkable and respected work for a decade on some of the most important Inlines that Perl folk use; imo his 5 years of work on the Raku evolution of that notion are far more remarkable in terms of the long term implications I see as I watch the maturing of the Perl Inline and look forward to the anticipated redo of the Inlines for other langs to catch up with the Perl Inline.')
