By accident I got hold of the the &quot;Linux Unleashed&quot; book during 1995&#x27;s Summer, which made my life much easier by not having to travel 1h into the campus and wait for free terminals.<p>After my degree I actually spent most of the time with commercial UNIXes, then eventually went back to Windows as my main computing platform.<p>Still use Linux on the server and naturally as the kernel powering my Android devices, but not as heavy as during my engineering degree and UNIX related assignments.')
