It is by no means as optimised or clean as I would like, but it is at a state I now consider usable. If you ever had to write pseudocode in LaTex I think you can understand the pain. \nThe pseudocode syntax described in the paper is simple and powerful enough to contemplate pretty much any use case. I&#x27;m interested in reading your opinions and observations and who knows even contributions. Thank you.<p>Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bruno-anjos&#x2F;PseudoTex')
