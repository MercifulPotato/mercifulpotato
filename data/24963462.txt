I do not remember ever being off by any significant margin. I&#x27;ve done way too many of projects either directly or as a director during the course of my life so it is mostly an autopilot at this stage for me. Also my clients tend to be real business people with real business needs. They do not really like to go into methodology level. they just look at my resume, and check references. They are much more interested in how I can solve their problem on conceptual levels before really engaging.')
