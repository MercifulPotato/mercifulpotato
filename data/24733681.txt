They get paid for the clicks, not the impressions. Serving ad impressions costs money, the clicks make money. I don&#x27;t quite follow your line of reasoning here.<p>Google has display ads (nee double-click) and search ads (adwords). Display ads can be pay per click or pay per impression (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;google-ads&#x2F;answer&#x2F;2454058?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;google-ads&#x2F;answer&#x2F;2454058?hl=en</a>).  Search ads are pay per click.<p>&gt; Why wouldn&#x27;t it? How do we know the bidding process is fair and the clicks we&#x27;re paying for are valid? We don&#x27;t and that&#x27;s the problem. We wouldn&#x27;t tolerate this type of behavior from companies in other industries. We need to quit giving tech companies a free pass and start holding them accountable.<p>For cost per click there&#x27;s an economic argument that the auction is fair. Google has limited ad slots and leaves money on the table if it serves low bid or low quality ads instead of higher-bid or higher-quality ads, and if Google pretended low-quality ads were high quality the advertiser would see it as an insanely high cost per conversion.  Click validity is also easy to measure; count how many clicks you&#x27;re charged for and compare that with how many referrals with gclid from google.com show up in your logs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;35813737&#x2F;matching-google-adwords-referrer-url" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;35813737&#x2F;matching-google...</a>).<p>Impression ads are trickier which is why there are fancy cross-device conversion&#x2F;attribution metrics to correlate purchases with impressions, but ultimately that is the problem with pay-per-impression in general.<p>&gt; It only has to be good enough to convince people to keep using it. There&#x27;s no financial incentive to eliminate fraud completely, or even try, without regulation.<p>Here I mostly agree; I was pretty disappointed to find out Google was serving those stupid &quot;Download Now&quot;-button ads on various software distribution sites.  I think that particular insanity has been fixed now, but &quot;not against the rules&quot; was the answer for most of the time I was there.<p>Trust is also a financial incentive and is the primary incentive to prevent outright fraud.  Ad-blockers or moving to another ad network are the proper responses to indicate lowered trust.')
