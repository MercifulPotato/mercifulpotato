Of course, this being a technical website and everyone needing something to believe in there are people who say that this company&#x27;s success is mostly based on its technical achievements (and on the people that helped implement those technical achievements), but looking at the character of people like Mercer that success is probably most likely based on stuff like insider trading.')
