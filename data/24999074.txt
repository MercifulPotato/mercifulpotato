I think ideal efficiency is proportional to Tcold&#x2F;dT (T in Kelvin) so it could go as high as 400% if there weren’t fluid, pump, and insulation losses.<p>The real challenge is reliability and cost of electricity. If your power goes out and you have heating oil you can still live for a week.<p>Brewing water temperatures peak at ~100C (pressurized steam is dangerous) and even with 20C water that’s an 80K difference so you’re down to 350% ideal, which probably puts you close to breakeven with pump losses. It’s the complexity that kills it.')
