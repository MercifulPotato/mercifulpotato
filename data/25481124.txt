I&#x27;ve worked in the public subsidy of private ventures sector (<i>exactly</i> in this sector.) It&#x27;s entirely unreasonable for any company to expect that there would be any monitoring or enforcement of compliance to employment claims made when the subsidy was awarded. There was certainly none where I worked, and we gave away billions.')
