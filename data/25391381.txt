TomWoozle was my handle back then.<p>I worked at the company from 2003-2005, having (like many here) grown up on their games and spent hours modding Escape Velocity.<p>I mainly worked on the website (I wrote a version of the online store ground up in PHP), but also ran testing for a while and worked managing the later Windows conversion of EV Nova.<p>It was an incredible place to work and I learnt so so much. Andrew was an amazing mentor and an extremely generous guy. My time there absolutely changed my life.<p>One thing that stands out, and it feels like something that wonâ€™t be regained from that era, is that everyone there was just having great great fun. I loved going to work. We were a business, but I never remember money being the deciding factor in any decision. It was all passion.<p>I miss those times!<p>If people are interested AMA (though late here so may be tomorrow when I answer).')
