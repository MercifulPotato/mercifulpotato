That project very explicitly wants to be viable as a safe tool for writing systems code, and the fact that it&#x27;s accumulated a lot of complexity doesn&#x27;t take away that intent (or the fact that it&#x27;s being successfully used in that capacity).<p>That said, I am super excited about the Zig project, and it hits a sweet spot for me in a way that none of the other &quot;C but better&quot; projects have. Calling it another &quot;C but better&quot; language wasn&#x27;t an attempt to disparage the project, but to classify it.')
