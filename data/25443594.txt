And so far local politicians often refuse to enact EU laws when they don&#x27;t make sense, and there isn&#x27;t much EU can do about it since the local politicians are more powerful than EU politicians, instead EU tend to make exceptions for those who refuse.<p>Lastly unlike US countries can still leave EU. If they make it illegal to leave then I&#x27;d worry, but until then the local government always comes first, since if EU pressures them too much they&#x27;d just leave.')
