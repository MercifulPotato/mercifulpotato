The article makes no such claim.  Maybe that&#x27;s not what you meant, though, because clearly there are things like drug overdoses, suicides, domestic violence, etc., that can also explain a lot of it as well.  Tens of thousands of people die of fentanyl overdoses each year, and the number was growing up to this point, so it&#x27;s not farfetched to consider that the COVID restrictions have resulted in more people taking addictive drugs or killing themselves out of desperation.')
