Apple isn&#x27;t a major player in the internet market and they have a history of &quot;dumbing down&quot; features, or at least reducing their apparent complexity, to make the experience friendlier to the average user. So when Safari hid the full URL, that didn&#x27;t raise many eyebrows.<p>Many of Google&#x27;s moves in recent years, most notably AMP, appear to be part of a larger plan to make the internet require Google to function. Messing around with the URL visible in the address bar seems to fit in with this plan to reduce the average consumer&#x27;s awareness of where exactly they are going on the internet.')
