I’ve seen enough logistics vans here navigating the small number of dirt roads, and I’ve had frozen food delivered to islands without road access from Bangkok in a refrigerated vehicle the whole way too. On the whole, logistics here seem on a par with the UK which also has a few hard-to-reach areas.')
