Less GABA is typically associated with more anxiety and stress.<p>+ Alcohol acts like a fake version of GABA, giving you temporary euphoria and calmness when you drink.<p>+ In being a faux GABA, it fills all your GABA receptors and your body stops producing more GABA, thinking it&#x27;s already full up.<p>+ Having less GABA and no longer consuming alcohol, you feel anxious.<p>+ Eventually your body produces normal amounts of GABA again (in healthy people)<p>What initiates the drinking can of course be chasing that GABA-ergic feeling to begin with, and this may be part of the mechanism of alcohol abuse. Ultimately this can be a spiral of behavior where having an anxious day makes you want to drink to &quot;calm down&quot;, which in turn makes the anxiety worse the next day, on and on.')
