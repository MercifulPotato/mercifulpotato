If state actors wants to replace the signal apk with a backdoored one, they&#x27;ll need to pull off a preimage attack, not a collision attack. A collision attack wouldn&#x27;t be useful because you still need the original publisher to sign the apk for you, which seems unlikely considering OWS isn&#x27;t a CA or anything. If OWS was compromised by state actors into signing, then they can just sign the backdoored version directly, no need for a collision attack.')
