You would be charged with unsafe driving or something similar, in which case you could make the argument that driving slower would not necessarily have been safer. I believe that is splitting hairs and I am sure you understand the basis of my argument when it comes to election workers following the laws set in place by the legislature.<p>&gt; Sorry, TIL<p>Apology accepted and apologies for assuming you were being pedantic about it.')
