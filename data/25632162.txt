The previous team had kept some foreign engineers on-call and never taken shifts - and there were daily pages, absurd processes to &quot;fix&quot; things, etc.<p>In about two weeks of putting engineers on call for their own services, most of the major problems were fixed.<p>It&#x27;s easy to write buggy software when you aren&#x27;t the one who gets called at 2am to fix it. Once you start being responsible for your software, the urge to take shortcuts really evaporates. On the other hand, a team that is not responsible for their output will always cut corners - it&#x27;s just the way it goes.')
