There is no evidence supporting any of the claims of fraud, any evidence that doesn&#x27;t support your position is automatically dismissed as untrustworthy.<p>Your claim is really that the Georgia Secretary of State (a staunch Republican and Trump supporter, along with the governor) managed to pull off a huge operation to secretly change the results of the election (which would have involved hundreds of people and require that none of them speak out). That&#x27;s a really outlandish claim, and requires supporting evidence, of which you have none.')
