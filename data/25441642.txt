For example, a building or railing texture will be good, but a dumpster or any other object which isn&#x27;t fixed will be extremely low resolution. On the whole it&#x27;s very soft and just gives a &quot;blurry&quot; or &quot;out of focus&quot; feel.<p>The result for me is eye strain as it feels like I&#x27;m always trying to focus on something that won&#x27;t be focused.<p>Subjectively speaking, it _feels_ worse quality than a 1080p game when I was playing on PS4. I don&#x27;t have any real evidence to back it up though.')
