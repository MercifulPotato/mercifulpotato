I think there is a room for a Plausible version of auth. I think it&#x27;s good that you offer to self-host it but honestly that is a bit of work as well.<p>I use a js-only backend so installing Java as a dependency maybe isn&#x27;t the biggst deal but it&#x27;s still something I will have to consider.<p>Even if it&#x27;s more work to configure and setup an auth myself I will know the intimate details of how it works and don&#x27;t have to spend time learning another tool in another language. Both takes time and since I&#x27;ve implemented auth several times already it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal for me.')
