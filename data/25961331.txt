Any interaction with the police is inherently imbalanced.<p>They get to stand wherever they want (often in groups), in body armor, with guns and handcuffs and the permission to arrest you (or shoot you!) at any point in time, if you say&#x2F;do the right mix of things.<p>If you&#x27;ve _never told them anything_ or _agreed to sit in a room with them_, you&#x27;re much less likely to be prosecuted for lying to them.<p>&gt; Officer, I do not talk to police.<p>If they arrest you:<p>&gt; Officer, I do not talk to police.<p>etc. You might spend a night or a month in jail, but it&#x27;s better than 5 years for a murder you didn&#x27;t commit, but the officer was pushing hard to get one more conviction before closing out FY2021')
