Apparently it is &quot;Jewish people, white people, Europeans&quot; — “are a little less&quot; and have a “deficiency” that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.&quot;<p>It gets worse the more you go down the rabbit hole but I&#x27;d argue this is just as bad as the lizard people stuff <i>because</i> it is less outlandish, perhaps making it more &quot;believable&quot; for some.<p>If you <i>really</i> want, I can go through and find the tweets that had thousands of upvotes, defending the antisemitism and &quot;discussing&quot; how Jews control everything (especially sports and music).<p>&gt;There&#x27;s an important difference between the mere existence of an echo chamber and the contents of the chamber. Let&#x27;s not &quot;both sides&quot; this when comparing to anti-semitism.<p>I can agree on this.  The problem is the contents of the twitter echo chamber <i>are</i> pretty bad too and its only seems to have gotten worse.')
