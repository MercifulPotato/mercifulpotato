I don&#x27;t see them talking to economists trying to understand what damage will be done to our businesses, and how people will suffer as a result of that; or even of what lockdowns are doing to our mental health. The ONLY risks they&#x27;re considering are on the side of taking the vaccination.<p>And this is always how it works for them, both in normal times and during the pandemic. Consider last March, when the CDC&#x27;s covid-19 test was defective. Despite the fact that the assay is a simple matter that any decent hospital can do in their own lab, the FDA would not allow anyone to do it. That set America&#x27;s pandemic fight back by a couple of weeks. If we could shift the spread backwards by two weeks, how many thousands of lives would we be saving? The FDA&#x27;s hidebound refusal to look at both sides is responsible for this.')
