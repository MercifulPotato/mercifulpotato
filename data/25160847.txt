Item(by='namdnay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605883396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25160430, text='&gt; President Macron actually paid a visit to Raoult back in April. The visit probably inadvertently cast a gigantic spotlight on the shoddy (or at best preliminary) research. In my opinion it reflected quite poorly on the quality of Macron&#x27;s scientific council.<p>By the time Macron visited Raoult, the spotlight was already on and shining bright. He was more or less forced to visit him for domestic political reasons: Raoult tapped straight into the anti-establishment anti-elite yellow-vest zietgeist , if Macron hadn&#x27;t at least shown some gesture towards him they would have seized the trope of the &quot;intellectual snob who is too aloof to talk to the people and their hero&quot;. The populist politicians from the south of france were already riding the Raoult train by then: Estrosi, Melenchon etc<p>So he went, he talked, he got his photo taken, and he left. Raoult got the attention he craves, Macron took some bullets out of the guns of his enemies, and nothing much happened. I agree that a more principled stand would have been nice, but that&#x27;s politics :&#x2F;')
