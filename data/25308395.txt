Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607117691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306028, text='Trying to track &quot;return visits&quot; often requires installing identifying tokens (cookies, localStorage, etc.). Even if no human ever looks at an individual person&#x27;s data, you are processing it, so GDPR applies.<p>But that&#x27;s where the last legal basis comes in:<p>&gt; processing is necessary [for] the legitimate interests pursued by the [website], except where such interests are overridden by the interests [of] the data subject<p>So:<p>(1) on the one hand, the site owner has a legitimate interest in making the website better. This really can even solely benefit the user, e.g. if you&#x27;re a non-profit like Wikipedia, but it might also just benefit you and that&#x27;s okay.<p>(2) on the other, everyone has the right to privacy. Is privacy violated if you analyse this in an automated fashion? Is there any potential negative consequence for &quot;private and family life, his home and his correspondence&quot;[1]?<p>If the answer to (2) is a very clear &quot;no&quot; then here&#x27;s your legal basis for data processing. Since it is <i>not</i> consent-based, you can do it without consent and without &#x27;cookie wall&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m no lawyer, I don&#x27;t know if this is a clear &quot;no&quot; or if it&#x27;s a &quot;maybe somehow&quot; or how a judge would rule that or what judges previously ruled on that. I don&#x27;t have all the answers, but it should be clear not all tracking has to be consent-based, especially when you have the user&#x27;s privacy at heart. Hence my phrasing of &#x27;invasive tracking&#x27; earlier in the thread.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re a small company or startup that really tries to do good but misinterpreted the law, the data protection agency is not going to give you a large fine. If there is neither an intention of violating privacy (in an ethical way, not a letter-of-the-law way) nor clear negligence, then the DPA will probably send you a warning. It&#x27;s also a fundamental right to get a reasonable punishment, so they can&#x27;t give you a fine that creates major issues if you didn&#x27;t do anything majorly wrong (people often look at GDPR&#x27;s vague clauses and â‚¬20 million fines and think &quot;how could your mom and pop store ever pay that for small violations&quot; while in practice that&#x27;s not how this works).<p>[1] Article 8 &quot;Privacy&quot; from the European Convention on Human Rights: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_8_%E2%80%93_privacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_Convention_on_Human_R...</a>')
