What he calls <i>degrowth</i> is actually <i>massive</i> growth and consumption in my view. Public services for all? FANTASTIC and exactly what we need. But that&#x27;s not &quot;degrowth,&quot; that&#x27;s <i>massive</i> growth. Switch to renewables? That requires absolutely huge economic growth and change.<p>In practice, on the ground in communities using words like &quot;degrowth&quot; in their politics, degrowth is rich people continuing with what they have and nobody else getting access to it. &quot;Degrowth&quot; is the word and philosophy used to block projects that help working people because the wealthy are doing A-OK. The &quot;degrowth&quot; language allows the wealthy capitalists to hold onto everything, and will never enable the correction of wealth inequality and distribution problems of capitalism. I see it in my own small town, that is an outlier in the US.  ~30% residents label themselves anti-capitalist, ~30% are working class non-landwoners without much political ideology except populism, ~30% are landlords trying to extract money. A significant chunk of the &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; segment are also landlords and influence the politics of the &quot;degrowth&quot; anti-capitalists to privilege the already privileged, this is really dangerous ways to think about things. The terrible language enables the reactionaries more than the revolutionaries. Make &quot;capitalism&quot; vague and unspecific enough to be a vague &quot;bad&quot; label, make &quot;consumption&quot; a vague and undefinable term, and it will be used by those in power as a tool to subvert any change.<p>For a school of thought that seems to abhor &quot;contradictions,&quot; they seem to embrace them when it comes to using words.')
