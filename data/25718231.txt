Now that Trump supporters murdered a police officer reality has set in for them. This is the end of Trump. Most conservatives are good people who would never murder a police officer for Trump. They are not going to fight for him to be replatformed. No one is going to insure his physical rallies. Even if they do the turnout will be low as most people don&#x27;t want the attend a murder riot.')
