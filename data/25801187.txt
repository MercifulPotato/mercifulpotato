I have learnt more building a micro framework from scratch about how single page application work than from using React or Angular and constantly checking stack overflow and other docs to make sure I was doing stuff &quot;in the right way&quot;.<p>I would however be curious at what are the limits of such frameworks. Real-time dom updates... depends how complex I guess, and how fast. It would be nice to have a way to benchmark this properly...')
