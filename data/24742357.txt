It uses 4x the CPU cycles and 4x the storage capacity for no measurable difference when it comes to human hearing.<p>2) 96kHz vs 48kHz does allow for some small but probably worthwhile improvement in the behavior of the anti-aliasing filters used in the analog-&gt;digital converters.<p>3) I have a theory that has been shot down by some highly respected DSP people but I retain it nevertheless. In Ye Olde Analogue domain, most of the distortion that occurs will be somehow related to harmonics, because of the nature of the analog electrical signal and the components it passes through. In the New Digital Goodness, there&#x27;s no inherent reason why any of the distortion will be fundamentally harmonic. Consequently, if either type of signal pathway introduces any distortion at all, the analog one will tend to be &quot;musical&quot; because of the harmonic aspects at its core, whereas the digital one will be something else.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing about the amount of distortion etc. Anybody who knows anything about this stuff knows that Ye Olde Analogue pathways were full of distortion, but that either we grew to love it or it was just inherently musical enough that we loved it from the beginning. The sound of that old analog gear you love? Yes, that&#x27;s right, you love the distortion it adds.')
