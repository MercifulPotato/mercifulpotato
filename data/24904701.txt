HFT market makers facilitate more efficient trading. If anyone tried pitching automated trading to you as some form of altruistic endeavor then obviously that’s bullshit. These people are out here to make a buck. Those milliseconds to nanoseconds moves are just competition between MMs happening in realtime. Is it done for the sake of a better world? No. But it just so happens to benefit society as a byproduct (on average) in the form of tighter spreads and liquidity. It’s up to you to decide if that’s good enough for you.<p>If we’re going to paint anyone as “real” villains in the world of trading then I’d argue it’s the informed big block traders. ie hedge funds, banks trading exotics with a high barrier of entry, etc. At least MMs are largely market neutral.')
