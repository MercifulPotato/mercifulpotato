Everybody has WhatsApp...<p>In my circles WhatsApp usage was pervasive and I was one of those who really pushed for it.<p>Soon after it became obvious that Facebook was still Facebook even with WhatsApp on board we started pushing for Telegram (remember this was probably before Signal existed in its current form and long before Matrix became mainstream.)<p>It took two years or so calendar time, a few hours work I think - mostly advocacy - and included moving people from early teenage to late eighties, but was mostly painless and definitely worth it because of usability alone, even if the most important point was to keep our social graps out of the hands of future Cambridge Analyticas  and whoever else Facebook wants to sell it to. (And I&#x27;ve hopefully learned not to underestimate grannies..!)<p>Today I&#x27;d probably pushed for Matrix, but as mentioned above that was not an option then.<p>Signal is also really nice despite one or a few big security problems (remotely exploit in the desktop client being the big one for me). Also it is US centric with all the problems that comes with it, it prioritizes security above everything and UX actually suffers from it and it isnÂ¨t open, so as far as I can see we are locked in should they turn bad.')
