Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25589079], score=None, time=1609362032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565642, text='Hey, I understand how activating internet threads can be, and  I get from your comment upthread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25564255" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25564255</a>) that you have a personal connection to this topic which most commenters don&#x27;t. I respect that a lot, and the fact that you were willing to share some of your experience in your GP comment was a really positive contribution. I know that&#x27;s not easy, and you&#x27;re under no obligation to do it, but FWIW, we badly need more of that.<p>Please don&#x27;t post like this comment here, though. It only hurts and makes things even worse.<p>The thing that helps is to share some of what you know and some of your experience, so others can learn. A small minority of commenters is going to react badly, repeat stock objections, downvote etc., and respond with flamebait. But most of those comments will eventually get downvoted, flagged, and&#x2F;or moderated. That&#x27;s the best we can hope for on a public forum where anyone can easily create an account.<p>More importantly, the rest of us are genuinely interested. If you would please follow the site guidelines by ignoring the flamebait (other than to flag or downvote it, and email us at hn@ycombinator.com in egregious cases), and by sharing information with curious readers when you&#x27;re so inclined, we&#x27;d be grateful.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
