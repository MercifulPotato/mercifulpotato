Your life will be a lot worse in aggregate than if you merely prioritized work to at least some extent and were able to maintain an income to pay for creature comforts.<p>You can&#x27;t just, at every moment, prioritize whatever is most fulfilling or heartwarming or whatever at that moment, and then have it negatively affect other long-term important stuff like maintaining your income.  I&#x27;m not gonna skip a meeting that people are expecting me to attend to call my mom when it can wait until later in the day.  If she were on her deathbed -- of course.  but she&#x27;s not.<p>That is all overly sanctimonious.')
