None.<p>There are dozens of separately regulated prominent webs now and that&#x27;s going to get a lot worse this decade. We&#x27;re never going back, nations are not going to give up the control they&#x27;re assuming, it will splinter further and further; complexity will grow, accessing foreign markets will become more onerous. It&#x27;ll gradually fully mirror the physical world, where if you want to travel to another nation, or do business in another nation (access their market), you will have to comply with all of their myriad of local regulations (which will continue to grow rapidly in number and complexity).<p>Nations will fence off their citizens online, and you will have to comply to access them. We&#x27;re already seeing this directional shift in many nations, it will spread comprehensively.<p>Turkey&#x27;s web is not regulated the same as India&#x27;s web which is not regulated the same as China&#x27;s web which is not regulated the same as the EU&#x27;s web which is not regulated the same as Brazil&#x27;s web which is not regulated the same as Australia&#x27;s web which is not regulated the same as the US web which is not regulated the same as Britain&#x27;s web and so on.')
