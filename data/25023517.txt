D-Wave provides the &quot;quantum computers&quot; that others have and they&#x27;re completely irrelevant when it comes to breaking ECC (or RSA, for that matter; ECC is broken by a variant of Shor&#x27;s algorithm, which is used to break RSA).  They&#x27;re quantum annealing chips, not general-purpose quantum computers; they literally can&#x27;t run Shor&#x27;s algorithm, now or ever.<p>We&#x27;re orders of magnitudes out (qubit-wise, on real quantum computers) from breaking RSA or ECC in practice, and the difficulty level is on the same order for both.')
