Freaks &amp; Geeks: 1 season, amazing. Ditto UK The Office. Fleabag: 2 short seasons, amazing. The OA: AMAZING first season with a complete coherent ending, then they had to make a bizarre, scattershot second season. Ditto Killing Eve (how many damn times can she get killed lol). Downton Abbey: PLANNED for 3 seasons (pre, during, &amp; post wwI) but it was so popular they just rambled on for ages until it looked like the scripts were being pulled directly from tumblr (&quot;beloved character came back from america! for a wedding episode! plus: PUPPIES!!&quot; literally).<p>So I don&#x27;t totally get the &quot;cancelled too soon&quot; argument. The OA should have not run to even 2 seasons.<p>There&#x27;s a trend of not producing art or even something original, but producing &quot;content.&quot; For example someone asked me if The Mandalorian is good. &quot;It&#x27;s star wars Content&quot; I replied. &quot;If you like star wars, and want Content, you&#x27;ll like it.&quot; Is the plot novel? Is it original or compelling? No, but boy it&#x27;s fun to see yoda puppet and more Content from the SW universe you&#x27;ve come to know and love!<p>A lot of these series may have run their creative course &amp; while megafans want more &quot;Content&quot; it&#x27;s the same thing as something being cancelled too soon, and most people aren&#x27;t megafans.')
