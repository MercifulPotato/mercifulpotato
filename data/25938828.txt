They all expect the stock to return to $5-50 when the squeeze is done. That means that the ones who currently own GME or it&#x27;s call options plan to sell those in short order when whatever target price is achieved.<p>Hence my calling it a pump and dump... They are pumping the stock up with highly positive videos like the one you posted and comments on WSB to get the price higher faster so they can sell and make a max profit. But for this to happen, they are going to need a buyer who buys at the very top.<p>Who is that buyer going to be? No savvy investor will go near buying a pump and dump with a ten foot pole. Sadly, it will be the newbies on WSB and the newbies watching this Rossmann video who buy at the top and lose everything as it plummets down.<p>You might say, &quot;Well I am not going to be that newbie&quot;... But only a very few will sell at the top... Maybe 1-5%. A few more will make solid returns. But all that profit for those guys on top will come from gullible retail investors. That is why MSM is calling BS.')
