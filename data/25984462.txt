The broker just calls you up and says &quot;you had the share in your account but we lost it, here&#x27;s some money for your troubles?&quot;<p>It seems like the holder wouldn&#x27;t care if they were just selling it, but if you were transferring the stock out to another brokerage, they just give you the alleged ask price of the shares (which actually doesn&#x27;t exist because the shares are illiquid) because they made a mistake and lost your shares?<p>I also find this confusing for voting rights: if my brokerage is loaning out my shares without my knowledge, then I don&#x27;t actually have the voting rights that I think I do, since the share is actually held by someone else?')
