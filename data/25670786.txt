Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610026363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670551, text='&gt; The United States was some sort of imperialist throughout much of its history (even at the time when that imperialism was confined to the American continent) and yet solidly democratic throughout that period.<p>True. But doesn&#x27;t stop imperialists from being autocratic in the areas they colonize because no rule of law exists once a regime is toppled and a vacuum created in those regions. It is literally free for all. For a period of time, that occupied area belongs to the imperialist power (unless the power is magnanimous enough to let go of the occupied area and allow the people to determine their fate). But during that period, would the laws of the imperialist power extend to occupied territories? I don&#x27;t think so. I haven&#x27;t heard of any such instance in history.<p>&gt; By contrast, there are countless instances of autocrats that don&#x27;t invade other countries, e.g. Lukashenka.<p>True as well. But it comes down to not having WMD and threatening the World (case in point: North Korea or even China). So these are autocrats but with their sphere of influence only restricted to their own territory because of lack of military capabilities. Do you seriously think that Lukashenko won&#x27;t flex his muscle over other neighbouring European countries if he had military capabilities the likes of which US has?')
