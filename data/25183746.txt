Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606107792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182720, text='&gt; Of course you know this, but are merely stating this as some kind of &quot;gotcha&quot;.<p>It wasn&#x27;t meant as a gotcha, just a reminder that lack of English isn&#x27;t quite the black mark you were making it out to be.<p>&gt; not with a massive backlog of educated, English-speaking, law-abiding people waiting in the queue.<p>I don&#x27;t see much support for reducing the backlog either.<p>&gt; What do you think happens to the people who have their SSNs used?<p>I actually don&#x27;t know. Can you tell me more please? It can&#x27;t be identity fraud to open lines of credit. As you said, the migrants who use the SSNs are uneducated, relatively unsophisticated people who have very little knowledge of English.<p>&gt; Then you may hear it right now, businesses that knowingly employ illegal aliens should be prosecuted for breaking the law.<p>It&#x27;s admirable you say that, but it happens relatively rarely. Making an example (e.g RICO-ing assets) out of a few big fish, and performing consistent enforcement thereafter would provide a strong deterrent to hiring migrants illegally, and a strong disincentive to migrate illegally. It should also cost the government less money; fewer investigations to pursue, fewer government agents and less bureaucracy required. Ask yourself why this doesn&#x27;t happen, why it&#x27;s not part of any campaign platform, and who benefits.<p>&gt; Unfortunately in our current two-party system, the options are &quot;Build the wall&quot; or &quot;Give them all free health care, and a path to citizenship&quot;.<p>&quot;Give them all free health care&quot; (not actually <i>free</i> free, since migrants are also taxpayers) is internally consistent with &quot;Health care is a human right&quot;. It may understandably be unpalatable to many, but at least it&#x27;s honest. &quot;a path to citizenship&quot; appears to have widespread bipartisan support among voters, at least according to some polls I saw long ago, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong about that.<p>The problem is &quot;Build the wall&quot;, isn&#x27;t just less effective than &quot;Punish the employers&quot; at reducing illegal migration to help domestic workers, it&#x27;s also inconsistent with smaller government. Policies such as the war on drugs, foreign interventions, weakening unions, opposing strong health and safety laws, or denying climate change (we&#x27;re going to start hearing about climate refugees in North America in the next decade or two) also undermine domestic workers, increase illegal migration, and&#x2F;or increase the size of the government. It&#x27;s dishonest.')
