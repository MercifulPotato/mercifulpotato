My current operating philosophy on real estate prices are that inflation is demand driven (buyer purchasing power), and that individuals are already maxed out (40 year mortgages, rents 50% of income). The only reason I can see real estate continuing its climb is if government policy continues to insist that home prices can never depreciate. If that plays true, then sure, you get your 4%. But it feels like a ponzi scheme waiting to collapse.')
