Notably, a put explicitly a contract to sell something at a given price in the future. Nobody buying or selling a put has any intention of stock trading hands -- and the option can even be written as cash-only, where stock never actually does. So while selling a put is the same fundamental idea as a short (&quot;I think the price will go down&quot;), it&#x27;s mechanically very different.<p>A short sale is something very particular: it&#x27;s selling something you&#x27;re borrowing. The counterparty has actually bought a stock. Not an option, he can hold that stock for sixty years. This is fucking weird.')
