Transcoding the video would be a plus and can&#x27;t happen remotely due to encryption. Raw mjpeg is also an option though, storage isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> expensive (or throw more CPU at the encoding system; a raspberry pi is just an example).<p>&gt; encrypting the network traffic end to end<p>but the video stream? The idea is that the storage server (Google, for that matter) doesn&#x27;t need access to my video stream. Not sure if end to end encryption is too much to ask but I did figure since it&#x27;s 2020, it should be doable.<p>Thanks for your responses by the way, it&#x27;s helpful to have a second pair of eyes on finding a simple solution. Since there doesn&#x27;t appear to be one, I will start experimenting with some ideas, feeding ffmpeg to gpg and checking cpu vs. compression ratio etc. Next step will be seeing which protocol to use for local + remote writing of the encrypted file (not sure if sshfs does incremental writes &#x2F; appends). Let&#x27;s see how hard this is! :)')
