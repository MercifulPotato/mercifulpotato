If Wordpress is your self-hosted version of Medium, then this is your self-hosted version of Twitch.<p>I&#x27;ve been little by little chipping away at building an easy to use and super useful live streaming server for individuals.  It&#x27;s still early days, but some recent updates include a dashboard where you can see some basic viewer metrics, configuration settings, and how your hardware is handling all that video crunching.  We all know working with video can be intensive on the hardware side, so hopefully this helps people keep tabs on things.<p>There&#x27;s a demo server if you&#x27;re curious what it&#x27;s like.  But if you&#x27;re a streamer, or even have a little interest in the space, I&#x27;d love for you to give it a spin.  Feedback is highly appreciated!<p>If you want to learn more about the project check out the documentation, and of course all the source, issues and additional discussion are over on Github.<p>Demo:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;watch.owncast.online<p>Github: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owncast&#x2F;owncast<p>Documentation: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;owncast.online')
