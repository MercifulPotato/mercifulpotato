On the other hand, this solves the problem for me but not others, and I&#x27;m less likely to notice the problem and reply all or leave a comment with the non-AMP link.<p>Also, it&#x27;s available from the same developer as an addon for Chrome desktop; I suppose if you were just annoyed by the experience and don&#x27;t care about de-Googling it works there too.')
