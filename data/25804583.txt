In Europe, you have a <i>lot</i> of things making rail expensive - there&#x27;s infrastructure like bridges or tunnels everywhere which means you can&#x27;t double-stack, and there&#x27;s millennia worth of villages and cities that you have to build around.<p>Add to that that most US freight is done with diesel-fueled locomotives which means that the US saved a lot of the money that Europe spent on electrification.')
