My youngest is 8 and learning 0 to 3 times tables right now. My oldest is 11 in grade 6 and just doing his 3 times tables...<p>The speed of the class for my grade 6 is not keeping pace and they are doing stuff my son in grade 3 is doing.<p>My youngest did a 0 to 3 times table quiz up to 12 and got them all correct.<p>What do you do? If I let my kids go on something like KhanAcademy they will be 10x ahead of the class and probably make it unbearable to be in class.<p>I find public school extremely slow paced, nearly every day the kids tell them they didn&#x27;t learn anything. They are constantly getting substitute teachers.<p>Private school is cost prohibitive but I think there&#x27;s potential for a hybrid with something like KhanAcademy that could work.')
