The truth is video games are a healthy outlet, as well as self train an individual to deal with defeat over and over and over again.<p>I bet if you took groups of individuals whom played sports for X hours a week, and compared them to an equivalent number of individuals whom played video games for X hours a week, the sports group would have more violent tendencies.  This isn&#x27;t just hyperbola, after observing as many humans as we have in both these activities, it&#x27;s practically self evident.')
