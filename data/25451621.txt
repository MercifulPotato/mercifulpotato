In mathematics, you don&#x27;t cite evidence, you write proofs. Most of the papers in conferences like POPL deal with topics like domain theory, type theory, category theory, formal logic, semantics, models of computation, etc. Results in these fields are achieved on paper or in a proof assistant, not by taking a survey.<p>For whatever reason, papers about programming languages that attempt to use data to make arguments about productivity, safety, etc. always seem unconvincing to me. Maybe it&#x27;s because they usually aren&#x27;t reproducible, or maybe it&#x27;s just because the way most programmers write code doesn&#x27;t matter to me, because most programmers aren&#x27;t aware of what is possible on the frontier.')
