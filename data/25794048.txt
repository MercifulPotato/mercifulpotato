(And a robust and even less-secure-against-”paste this command into your browser programming environment” attacks version would be good for more advanced programmers, but even worse for everyone else.) And having specific browsers targeting each of those environments would be possible, but negate (especially for beginner programmers) a significant part of the advantage of having the programming environment integrated in the browser in the first place.')
