I seriously struggled because I was a new developer and had no onboarding. Just tossed into the deep end and unfortunately I drowned. Our 1 on 1 meetings were an interrogation about all the mistakes I&#x27;ve made over the past week and why I made them. The increased stress of not making mistakes made me make more mistakes... Finally the deadlines were constantly shifted. Boss would ask how long something would take, I&#x27;d give an estimate, we agreed on that date. When that date arrived he&#x27;d say, &quot;I think it shouldn&#x27;t have taken this long. The other guys on the team could have done this in half the time&quot;. This went on for a few months until one day I was fired on the spot. It was a blessing in disguise! I&#x27;m at a much better place now.')
