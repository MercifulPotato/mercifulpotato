We ultimately found that attempting to mix Framework&#x2F;Core&#x2F;Standard projects together was an excellent substitute for nightmare fuel. So, the happy path for us turned out to be to do it all at once and only use .NET Core project types throughout (DLL&#x2F;EXE). Trying to convert your overall solution 1 project at a time hoping for some sort of incremental outcome is probably going to be more frustration than it&#x27;s worth.<p>Assuming you bite the bullet on all or nothing, the next challenge will be: Is your code is even supported anymore? This is obviously going to vary wildly depending on your use cases. For us, the Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility shim was enough to restore 100% of the functionality (we rely on System.Drawing and DirectoryServices). But, there was also a lot of other rewrite to support new AspNetCore primitives, and we also moved over to Blazor for web UI (which is more of a rewrite than migration).')
