Where is Toto Wolff going after the announcement that he will leave Mercedes? and why you say Williams? (Wolff has bought shares of both Aston Martin - former Racing Point - and Williams)<p>That&#x27;s 6 Mercedes cars, but only 2 allowed to go fast and win.<p>Ferrari-Alfa Romeo are in a similar situation.<p>I say let them race and see what happens.<p>Put the human factor back by having less cars, but with similar performances.')
