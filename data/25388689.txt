I, a user, want a phone that is locked down. You are demanding that the government force Apple to stop making that phone. You are demanding that no such phone is allowed to exist: that the government steps in to remove that choice for me.<p>&gt;I, as a developer, have no control over what phone you, as a user, buy.<p>No, you don&#x27;t. And you shouldn&#x27;t have. But you are trying to make that a moot point by demanding the government prevents me from buying the phone I want. You are trying to assert control over the choice of features of the phones I am allowed to buy.<p>And your propaganda is that you are all about freedom of choice.')
