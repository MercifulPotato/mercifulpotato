The law in this case is politics - it&#x27;s whatever the people say it is - and the political system is terribly broken right now.  I think it is still proper to move these agencies to have more civilian oversight but in the short term we&#x27;re going to see a whole lot of abuse of the system until our representation can be fixed.')
