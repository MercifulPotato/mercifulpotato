And switching workspaces is faster for me than turning my head to another screen.<p>An added benefit is that my window manager always knows what workspace I&#x27;m looking at. With multiple monitors, your computer doesn&#x27;t know that, and so keyboard focus becomes a problem, e.g. finding what is currently &quot;in focus&quot; takes more time, finding where your mouse cursor is, etc.<p>Finally, my setup is the same everywhere I go (at home, at work, on a laptop, etc.) since I only use one physical monitor. I think this is a huge advantage too.')
