(Is that true?)  Or do they need the clean rooms, solvents, filtration, etc. to improve just as much with every jump in node size?<p>I was also wondering, since Apple is not marketing on Ghz and playing the Intel game, how do they deal with variable chip manufacturing yield?  Is there a narrow band or minimum chip speed that they&#x27;ll accept and toss anything performing below?\nDoes the SoC become so physically larger that yields also go down by any significant amount, and any defects at such small sizes become much more troublesome?')
