It even supports auto-update over HTTP, so all my devices periodically talk to my home server to see if a new firmware is available using a simple server I wrote:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;stavros&#x2F;espota-server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;stavros&#x2F;espota-server</a><p>Since I&#x27;m very familiar with ESPurna but not with TASMOTA or ESPHome, I can share some of its drawbacks:<p>* Provisioning is hard. I have tens of devices and I want to deploy firmware on them with specific settings already preloaded, so I can just flash it and have it automatically connect to my Wifi, MQTT server, autoupdate server, etc. Not only do I need to compile my own firmware for this, but I need to compile one version of the firmware per device <i>type</i>. This isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle, I wrote a simple for loop to do it, but what <i>is</i> a hassle is that my configuration needs to be in the form of #defines in a header file, which makes updating a big pain, as I have to figure out what upstream changes were made and how to merge them with mine.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s the only drawback I&#x27;ve found, it&#x27;s otherwise worked perfectly, the community is great, the maintainer is very responsive and the software does what I need and more. Definitely recommended.')
