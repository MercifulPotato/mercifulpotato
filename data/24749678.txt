The reactor designs are often licensed, but reactors are constructed on site.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you seem to think that nuclear weapons are connected with nuclear power. These are very different technologies. You don&#x27;t need control rods, pressure vessels, and heat exchangers to build nuclear weapons. You don&#x27;t need precise blasting plugs and explosive lenses to build nuclear power plants. The only shared technology is nuclear enrichment, but enrichment infrastructure already exists and countries can buy enriched fuel from other countries.')
