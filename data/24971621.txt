Given what I felt were going to be significant economic disruptions due to unemployment and drops in income, I prepared myself with the understanding that our little resort town was going to be facing some hard times.  Usually, small resort towns tend to take it on the chin when the economy turns.<p>Boy was I wrong.<p>Once the initial shock of lifestyle changes happened due to COVID, people FLOODED the area and any piece of real estate not bolted down was flying off the shelves and bought for cash unseen.  I sold a small lot in the Whitefish City limits for a significant capital gain, after buying it for what I thought then was at the top of the market in 2019.  I&#x27;ve been offered cash for home-run-knock-it-out-of-the-park prices for my retirement home property that are simply unfathomable.  The only reason why I don&#x27;t sell is because I treat this property like I do my two labrador retrievers - everything has a price, but I&#x27;m not interested in selling. :)<p>There is a lot of angst in Whitefish over the changes - all the building and influx of money really helps the local economy, but the quality of life (traffic, etc) is suffering.  It&#x27;s the age old dichotomy for a small Montana popular town.')
