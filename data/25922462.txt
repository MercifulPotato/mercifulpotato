Eliminate DNS lookups.  I gather the DNS data in bulk before I start reading and add it to custom zones file that are served from localhost authoritative servers.  For example, I gather all the DNS data for all sites posted to HN before I start reading.  One way to do this, if encryption is desired, is to use DoH+HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining.  I wrote some custom programs to speed up the Base64URL encoding.<p>This way, there is no DNS traffic leaving the network.  The only lookups preceding a TCP connection to a website are to the loopback.<p>That is the number one way I &quot;make the web fast&quot;.  If retrieving a web page were a chemical reaction, DNS is the &quot;slow step&quot;.  In most cases, I eliminate it.')
