Some of my services require config files, and I need to interpolate the values of environment variables into those config files, write them out, and then start the application.  (Also assume the application itself doesn&#x27;t have options for dropping privileges.)  I&#x27;d rather not make the filesystem locations in question writable by `somenonrootuser`.<p>My current strategy is to let the container entrypoint start as root, but then I have a wrapper program installed that drops privileges before it exec()s the actual service.  It works, but is there a better &#x2F; more accepted way of doing this?')
