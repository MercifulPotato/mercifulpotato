Item(by='newscracker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611059126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25828336, text='&gt; I&#x27;ll make sure there&#x27;s a warning email sent a couple days before any charges are applied,<p>Since you&#x27;re still figuring the best possible options and seem to be open to feedback, a reminder email two days before the charge is never enough. Ideally, it should be a few emails spread across a longer period, such as one month before, two weeks before and five days before. You could choose when and how many emails to send (bother the user), but it shouldn&#x27;t be just one, and that too something that could be missed, like just two days before.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m not a fan of subscriptions. Since key features will be disabled unless renewed, I don&#x27;t think it works as much for the benefit of the user as it does for the developer.')
