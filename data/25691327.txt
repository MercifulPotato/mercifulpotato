Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25692072, 25691770], score=None, time=1610144702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691281, text='&gt; Wait what? So you don&#x27;t have any argument against what I said and now you change the subject?<p>Take a step back and breath. Lets cover things.<p>1. You&#x27;re clearly not seeing the big picture here. Planning for this event has taken place over social media. A large portion of Americans were ignoring thedonald.win, and other websites, but the events on Wednesday means we can no longer ignore these fringe sites.<p>2. The intent of these trespassers is clear. They&#x27;re not saying &quot;Some anomalies in some votes&quot;, they want Trump to remain president. This is a far more extreme view.<p>3. They are now harassing Graham because Graham was supposed to support them in the electoral college tally. But Graham changed his tune after the events of Wednesday and is now arguing that the protesters be arrested.<p>From the perspective of the insurrectionists &#x2F; would-be coup, Graham has betrayed them and their cause. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re harassing him.<p>-------<p>And yes: arguing that they are &quot;not a coup&quot; is the very definition of apologist. You are trying to whitewash their actions by using a weaker word to describe their illegal actions.<p>My point to you is this: they were not defeated on Wednesday. All that has happened is that they have revealed themselves on the national stage. As we move forward, we need to take them into account in our planning. Calling them for what they are: a coup, a dangerous insurrection mob who wishes to literally take over the country, is the bare minimum.<p>We need to properly describe the nature of the threat before we can plan against them.<p>They are a coup. They WILL be back. Hopefully we will be ready next time.')
