Item(by='WildGreenLeave', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606164374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191242, text='The Netherlands has a mask rule that doesn&#x27;t even require you to wear them inside with other people around. If I am not mistaken the requirement is that you are required to wear them when you cannot maintain the 1.5M distance, but that of course is just shifting the enforcement to the business owners instead of the government. In any other situation you are strictly recommended to wear them.<p>I don&#x27;t get why the Dutch government and the &#x27;average&#x27; dutch person isn&#x27;t wearing it all the time. People still consider it &#x27;weird&#x27; to wear it and even in the capital city (Amsterdam) people look at me weirdly when I wear it outside. About 10% isn&#x27;t wearing it in stores or even the airport is a place where people still skip out on the face mask. They should just enforce this rule instead of closing other places where it is actually possible to maintain the distance.')
