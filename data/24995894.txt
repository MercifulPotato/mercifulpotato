Push a button, get a prize is not very rewarding in the long run.<p>When I started my backyard growing habit, it was never meant as a self-sustaining venture. It became part of my morning routine, I&#x27;d water the plants and just keep an eye on things. Watching the plant&#x27;s growth from day to day is rather impressive. It&#x27;s amazing how fast different plants grow in 24hrs. I even did a timelapse overnight of a squash plant&#x27;s journey. I also started checking things out with a flash light right after dark. The slug hunting became sport. TL;DR if you honestly think you can have a small raised bed&#x2F;container garden survive with nothing more than drip irrigation, then disappointment is in your future.')
