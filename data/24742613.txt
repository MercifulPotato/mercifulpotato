Apple makes <i>devices</i>.  They <i>sell</i> (not rent or lease) those devices.<p>As such, just as if I were to buy a gun or a knife or a dozen chicken wings, what I do with such a device isn&#x27;t anyone else&#x27;s business.  It&#x27;s mine.<p>If I use that gun or knife to injure or kill someone, is the gun or knife manufacturer involved?  No.  Because <i>I</i>, not the manufacturer, am responsible for <i>my</i> actions.  They have nothing to do with it.<p>If I insert those chicken wings into orifices other than my mouth, is that any business of the restaurant who sold them to me?  No.  For the same reasons.<p>As such, Apple is no more part of the &quot;comms infrastructure&quot; (and especially in this case, as it isn&#x27;t Apple software -- like iMessage -- being used) than the knife manufacturer is part of my circus knife throwing act.<p>This issue is broader than the awful stuff going on in Belarus.<p>Who <i>owns</i> the stuff you purchase?  If the manufacturer (and&#x2F;or other private entities) can unilaterally decide what you can or cannot do with your own property, then you don&#x27;t really own it.<p>And there will always be some folks who object to the use of, well, just about anything.<p>Should the folks at PETA[0] be able to block communications between a group of friends going hunting for deer or quail?<p>In their understanding, that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> the same as a group plotting to kill humans.<p>The situation in Belarus is more complicated, as it pits the the government against the governed.  Even so, I say it&#x27;s not the place of a <i>manufacturer</i> to tell someone what they may or may not do with a product once it has been sold.<p>What&#x27;s more, Telegram needs to decide what happens on <i>their</i> infrastructure and Apple has no business being involved at all.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;People_for_the_Ethical_Treatme...</a>')
