I quite like the incremental regeneration idea in NextJS: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-r...</a> - sounds like it will rerender pages in the background as traffic comes in to them, while serving a stale version to the original request. I guess there are times when this might not be acceptable though... in which case really you just want to be able to rerender the subset of pages a given change affects, but this isnâ€™t always easy to work out.')
