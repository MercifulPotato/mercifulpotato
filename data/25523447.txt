This prevents unintentional misissuance of a certificate, but not deliberate MITM attempts if the CA is actively involved.<p>Their counterpart for browsers are TLSA records, which associate specific keys or certificates with a domain name.  This is the part that actually prevents MITM attacks on the client side (assuming the client&#x27;s getting a complete and accurate DNS response, which is a whole other issue), since it&#x27;ll cause a compliant client to reject any other keys or certificates.  (No idea how widespread the implementation of this is on the client side, though.)')
