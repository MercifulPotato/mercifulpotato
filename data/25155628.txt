My plan going forward is to use an old laptop running Syncthing as my primary source of truth for files. Email is next (but more complicated since I don&#x27;t want to self-host it).<p>It helps me personally to take Stallmanesque approaches to managing my digital life. And if Google continues to get more and more restrictive I have the technical acumen to find or make alternatives—or figure out how to do without. But I&#x27;m worried about the growing number of non-technical users who are increasingly dependent on technology and—startlingly—increasingly less technical. People who only use Google Docs on their phone and a laptop have no reason to understand that documents correspond to files on disk that can be edited by programs running locally.<p>It more and more seems like the future is tech oligopoly with more and more subscription fees.
