Or even worse you might never get started because you get trapped by information paralysis.<p>I know a few people who have taken my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildasaasappwithflask.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildasaasappwithflask.com&#x2F;</a> course and built very successful businesses in less than a year. One of them is making $90,000 &#x2F; month and initially spent like 4 months customizing the code from the course to do what his service needed to do.<p>Note: The TL;DR on the above course is it&#x27;s not a course on how to find a SAAS app idea. It&#x27;s focused on how to build the SAAS app itself using Flask, Docker, Stripe, etc..')
