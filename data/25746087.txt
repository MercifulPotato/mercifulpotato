Seeing that, there&#x27;s also the tantalizing prospect of like-minded peers amongst the enthusiasts for it.<p>It&#x27;s also just kind of neat from a technical point of view that it&#x27;s possible to make the sorts of rigorous promises at compile time that rust offers.<p>Understanding the borrow-checker rules is a famously tricky challenge for newcomers to the language, which perhaps nerd-snipes[1] some of us.<p>Because it&#x27;s a systems programming language (writing an OS directly in Rust is perfectly possible [2]) it has some allure as a &quot;grown up&quot; language.<p>The rust language development community is famously welcoming with good quality documentation and the IDE support is getting there. So it&#x27;s approachable. That helps for sure.<p>Finally there&#x27;s unarguably some evangelical fanboy-ism going on that no doubt boosts the numbers a bit on top of all that.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a rust developer, but I&#x27;m definitely attracted by what it has to offer :)<p>---<p>[0] Alas it was posted on Google+ so the original is no longer up, but there are a variety of mirrors of it out there, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;cornchz&#x2F;3313150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;cornchz&#x2F;3313150</a> - see also meta-discussion here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4365255" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4365255</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;356&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;356&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redox-os.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redox-os.org&#x2F;</a>')
