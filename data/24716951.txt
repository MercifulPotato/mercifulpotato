Cheap and absolutely a blast to drive, particularly if you shifted gears yourself.<p>I&#x27;m sure that many reading this comment will scoff. However, that car was living proof of one of my favorite truisms when it comes to driving cars in everyday traffic:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s more fun to drive a slow car fast than it is to drive a fast car slow.&quot;<p>That Mazda was not powerful by any means, but it rode low and handled like a sports car. Fun to toss around.')
