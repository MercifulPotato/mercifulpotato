A tweak of the algorithm got it down to 0.248 seconds. That tweak required an 4 megabyte array in RAM.<p>I back ported the solution to Turbo Pascal 7, it used a &quot;file of longint&quot; in place of the array which you can&#x27;t do in MS-DOs... it finished in about 10 minutes, because I have an SSD. Otherwise it would have been about 50,000,000 IO operations at 10&#x2F;second  --&gt; 50+ days.<p>We can and do use the heck out of the hardware, but it&#x27;s not infinite, and there will always be orders of magnitude performance to be gained by seeking and using better algorithms.')
