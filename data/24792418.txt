I&#x27;ve found that 0.6mm is more suitable for general use, and that cuts print time by ~50% - it lays down 50% more material, which accounts for a 33% reduction, but the fact that it results in fewer discrete motions accounts for the rest.<p>When I&#x27;m printing something bigger than, say, 100mm^3, I switch out to a 1.0mm nozzle. Larger objects generally don&#x27;t require such fine detail in all dimensions.<p>As for noise, my primary printer is a modified Creative3D Elf CoreXY, and it sits about 5&#x27; from my computer. It&#x27;s quiet enough that it doesn&#x27;t interrupt my flow. TMC2209 drivers and StealthChop go a long way.')
