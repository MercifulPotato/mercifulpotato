Getting rich is just not desirable anymore; technology is only desirable insofar as it helps solve pressing problems for the world as a whole.<p>In 2010 I was the one who would go to parties and young people would be like &quot;Oh, you work for Google, that&#x27;s so cool!&quot;.  In 2014, it was &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re founding a startup to fix unemployment, that&#x27;s so cool!&quot;.  Now when my wife (who works as a professional impact investor) goes to a party with young people, it&#x27;s &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re solving climate change and funding reproductive healthcare and working for racial justice, that&#x27;s so cool!&quot;  Meanwhile, I say &quot;I work in software&quot; neutrally and omit that it&#x27;s for Google.')
