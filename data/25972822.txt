The official F-Droid repository has policies that were clarified in other replies, but it&#x27;s also important to note that you can add arbitrary repositories and manage software from them with the F-Droid app.<p>The &quot;build your own if you don&#x27;t like it&quot; answer is often absurdly impractical, but not here. Someone who feels it&#x27;s important can put up an alternate repo containing clients preconfigured to connect to Gab and even an alternate build of F-Droid preconfigured to use it in an afternoon.')
