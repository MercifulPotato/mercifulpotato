The top of that range is likely to be lower than what many engineers at large companies currently earn, yet higher than what many engineers at startups currently earn. Therein is the leveling effect.<p>Leveling is good if you level up, but bad if you level down. Many engineers at large companies would level down, if they were to join a union.
