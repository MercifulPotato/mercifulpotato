Item(by='rramadass', descendants=None, kids=[24953950], score=None, time=1604111853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945418, text='&gt; cost associated with constructing such proofs ... is too high<p>People assume this is true because it has been repeated endlessly. I think it is an issue of granularity. For example; both Dijkstra&#x27;s GCL and Hoare&#x27;s Triples (fine granularity) vs. Meyer&#x27;s DbC (coarse granularity) can be expressed using Assertions to build Preconditions&#x2F;Postconditions&#x2F;Invariants as &quot;correctness proof&quot; throughout a real-world software system. But their systematic usage is never taught nor enforced; we have to learn it by trial and error.')
