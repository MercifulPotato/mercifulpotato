There was actually some pretty decent smartphones that looked like they came from the future. I remember dreaming about being able to buy a Nokia N95 with a touchscreen and pen. It actually wasn&#x27;t that far off from what an iPhone does. From the N95 wiki:<p>&quot;The N95&#x27;s main competitors during its lifetime were the LG Prada, Apple&#x27;s iPhone, Sony Ericsson&#x27;s W950i and K850. The N95 managed to outsell its rivals. Despite Apple&#x27;s much-hyped iPhone with its multi-touch technology, thin design and advanced web capabilities, the N95 had several key features against the iPhone, such as its camera with flash, video camera, Bluetooth file sharing, 3G and 3.5G connectivity, GPS, third-party applications and several other features.&quot;<p>Apple saw what everyone else was doing and triangulated something differentiated on what they know Apple users want. They will do the same thing with this car. It is much better to be Apple than to be Tesla at this point if your goal is to ship 100k&#x27;s of cars. Most of Apple&#x27;s target market for a car is still driving german cars. Apple has learned everything it didn&#x27;t already know from Tesla, and can now execute on what it does know best to win. Tesla is a Nokia N95 that has the stock price of an iPhone. Short TSLA, long AAPL.')
