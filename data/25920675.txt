An actual packet network, so the connections would be multiplexed just as if you used an IP connection, and routed it at like over a dedicated network. The modem part is an implementation detail.<p>In terms of cost, it was normal at the time to charge per minute fees for services on the big online services, so enabling remote services multiplexed over a network like that would be an opportunity for BBS operators to federate into a bigger network and gain revenue by charging for services, and start out without having the traffic to justify a fixed line.<p>But obviously, just like the big online services, that model became unviable the moment the internet went mainstream.')
