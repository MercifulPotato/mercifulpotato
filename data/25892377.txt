They seem to keep in the refrigerator fine for a couple of weeks.<p>Haven&#x27;t really found a box&#x2F;bag red that I like enough to keep buying. Instead I keep a bottle of some sort of red on hand so I can have a 1&#x2F;2 glass with whatever food I cook that night.<p>Additionally, I order cases of more unique wines from b21 and keep it on hand for special occasions.')
