I <i>just</i> gave another reason - to offset the built-in drivers of disparity. Transfers between wealth and income (i.e. labor) always favor the wealth holder. It&#x27;s the very nature of capital, part of what makes it so great but also with not-so-great consequences that must be compensated for. The problem is not the progressivity of taxation, but the fact that it&#x27;s primarily on the wrong thing - income and consumption instead of wealth.')
