He can and does represent both gay people and bi people in transcending heterosexual norms.<p>Young people sometimes use the word &quot;gay&quot; to express a complex sexuality which doesn&#x27;t categorise neatly with a label. It&#x27;s understood that you can be both &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;bi&quot; simultaneously, or indeed you can be a man who has sex with men who is straight.<p>The only person in this chat who is trying to put strict labels based on behaviour is you (the other commenter only observed some behaviour without labelling), so it seems like you&#x27;re arguing with yourself?')
