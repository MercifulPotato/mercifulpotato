People hardly ever can have one, as the word suggests the tragedy of commons follows quickly upon reaching it. Mutually beneficial status qua don&#x27;t last as somebody always want to get more of the benefit than others, and exploit the situation.<p>People are not born equal, tribes are not equal, nations are not made equal. There are always the weaker, and stronger.<p>Politics is how you get along, and live another day with all above concerned. How somebody weak can live along somebody strong, without having the later kill him simply because he can. Same way, how a strong one can live with peace of mind knowing that if he lets the weak leave, they may well live to grow big, and surpass him in the future.<p>Life is an endless play of king of the hill.')
