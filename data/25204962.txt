As a UI&#x2F;UX designer I am hardwired to think in layers of interaction (created ergonomically by mouse pointer), flow and graphical representation. Look in broad term has an emotional impact and is a sum of lot of elements (lines, colors, whitespaces, iconography, animation etc.). But when we are speaking about interface - functional thinking is the heart of design. There are a lot of principles and usability guidelines that must be present. MacOS Big Sur in this context is breaking those desktop paradigms (which we want) but actual implementation is to much touch oriented (iOS). \nAnyway, this is an open discussion and every point of view counts, so thanks for reply.<p>PS. Emacs is great, and I am thankful that Apple decisions have pushed me to replace Devonthink and start using Org Mode instead.:)')
