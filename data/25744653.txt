You see echoes of that in Witcher 3, I know it caused some controversy overseas because of how uniformly white everyone is. No malicious intent there, just modern Poles projecting their world back in time. Between WW1 and WW2, percentage of people identifying as Poles was less than 70%. Today it&#x27;s 97%.<p>There&#x27;s a point after which you can say there&#x27;s a pattern and not just a bunch of samples. When we&#x27;re talking about populations we&#x27;re talking in terms of averages and distributions, and the average in Poland is much like I described. In my opinion history of Poland is the second state religion, after catholicism, 91% as of 2018. And if you say many young people don&#x27;t actually go to church, you&#x27;re making my point (duplicity and appeasing peer pressure).<p>97% and 91%. Maybe it&#x27;s you who don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about?')
