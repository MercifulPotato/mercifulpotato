There has been ongoing misinformation about Chernobyl and a potential nuclear explosion had the melted core reached the flooded basement, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZKV1piLjoa0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZKV1piLjoa0</a><p>I remember thinking this before I saw the thunderf00t video on this. Misinformation like this sticks.<p>The article is less clear (though they specifically say &#x27;bomb&#x27; further perpetuating the myth), but it opens by referring to the HBO special as if it were fact. I think you&#x27;re probably right (and the author is probably just equally confused as I was previously) but their intent doesn&#x27;t change the fact that misinformation is being perpetuated.<p>I get frustrated that artistic license is taken with stuff like this and end up perpetuating harmful misunderstanding. HBO made a great entertaining show but they probably should have been more careful on this side of things.')
