A company can&#x27;t have a monopoly over its own products which by definition would cover most product&#x2F;service companies.<p>Given iOS market share is about ~25% of the Mobile OS Market, it currently doesn&#x27;t qualify as a Monopoly although it&#x27;s currently under EU investigation &amp; Epic lawsuit which may rule differently.')
