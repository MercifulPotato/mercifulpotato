We need to build lots more housing, yes, but to really solve the problem for good we need to change how we think about housing. Otherwise we&#x27;ll build a bit more and then rest on our laurels until the next crisis.<p>There are practical steps we can take, today, to incentivize building more housing, such as:<p>Eliminating parking minimums: use the building&#x27;s space for people, not cars.<p>Tax land on its ability to house. It should be a tax advantage to build houses over building a surface parking lot.<p>Build and maintain low rise, distributed public housing. Ensure operational costs are covered, not just capital costs. Low rises are easier to maintain than big projects.<p>Rent control -- I know this is polarizing, but I believe housing shouldn&#x27;t be a constant upward pricing until you reach the limits of what the market will bear. People need live somewhere, and if we continue to turn the screws on rent, they&#x27;ll have less to spend elsewhere.<p>There are other things we could do today too, like strengthen tenants unions, improve tenant protection laws, enact right of first refusal laws that require landlords to sell to the current tenants first, and more.<p>I know folks might disagree with me, and that&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;d ask that you bring some good faith discussion rather than just downvoting and moving on.<p>(In case it is relevant, I am a home owner in a hot real estate market.)')
