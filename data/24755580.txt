What other historic facts will you be fined&#x2F;jailed for questioning?<p>When I went looking at things deemed &quot;Holocaust Denial&quot;, I found that they DIDN&#x27;T DENY IT AT ALL (except one). They deny 6 million Jews died, and say it&#x27;s around ONE million. In fact it&#x27;s VERY hard to find ANYTHING &quot;denying the holocaust&quot;. All of the &quot;Nazis&quot; that the book burners make famous (Droge&#x2F;Zundel, etc.) don&#x27;t deny mass exterminations happened..again, they deny the NUMBERS.<p>Calling it &quot;Holocaust Denial&quot; os lying about what is being said.<p>They also ask VALID QUESTIONS that the Jews don&#x27;t seem to want to have asked! For example: Stalin, Churchill and Eisenhower all wrote memoirs and kept diaries. All are public record. NONE of them mention &quot;Holocaust&quot; or even &quot;Mass extermination of jews&quot;. Why does the word itself not show up in the public lexicon until the 1970&#x27;s?<p>Didn&#x27;t know this? How will you find out these things if all the sources are burned.<p>These are VALID QUESTIONS and book burning is NEVER the answer!')
