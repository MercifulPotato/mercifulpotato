It’s really not all about “consent” - we hear that too much.<p>Various data protection authorities have concurred that forced consent isn&#x27;t consent. For consent to be valid, it needs to be freely given, informed, and not tied to the provision of a service, such that provision is dependent on unrelated consent.<p>There&#x27;s also restrictions on consent being used where there are imbalances of bargaining power (so for example, consent isn&#x27;t a valid legal basis for processing data at all in an employer&#x2F;employee scenario due to the imbalance. Another legal basis is needed).<p>One area of interest in future would be how the imbalance of power could be interpreted - consumers generally can&#x27;t negotiate anything with any internet company (unlike negotiation with small businesses), and in many cases companies can hold them hostage until they consent (if Google won&#x27;t let you into your email until you consent to something, that&#x27;s clearly coercive and abuse of power). When regulators finally learn to move faster, it will be interesting to see how widely this can be applied - could it even extent to a company which holds a monopoly status in a market, due to lack of meaningful choice? I think it could.<p>In any case, the smart money is on not relying on consent as a legal basis unless you have no other option - it&#x27;s the least durable basis, and can be revoked at any time.')
