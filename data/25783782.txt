I hadn&#x27;t thought about how the volume of available shared affects the price. Though it feels like market makers would feel this the most? I guess I&#x27;m not sure how much of a stocks&#x27; price is driven by limited availability.<p>&gt;Bezos couldnâ€™t liquify his position in just a day or two even with a good explanation<p>That absolutely makes sense. I wasn&#x27;t imagining a quick liquidation necessaraly - selling $30bn worth of stock over 5 or 10 years would be plenty of fuel in the fire of charitable giving.<p>For reference, MacKenzie Scott just gave away $4bn over one year that, I think, came from Amazon stock and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have hurt the price?')
