They are used in model checking, and also as the foundation for giving a semantics to BPMN, for example.<p>I think it&#x27;s not unreasonable to consider Petri nets as a generalization of automata (finite or infinite) with concurrency. Just like automata, they find applications in many places depending on how you further extend or restrict them.')
