This is a well known fact among factory owners in China.<p>Foxconn is not stupid, they&#x27;ve done such a thing before when migrating manufacturing to China. If American workers were good they&#x27;d take this project seriously too. They aren&#x27;t, and the screw ups are just a result of certain executives not taking the project seriously and not providing enough resources to lower management.<p>This project was done for optics. It has an ulterior motive because it&#x27;s not logical to hire workers in America when you can get better workers in China.')
