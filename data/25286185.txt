Connect with your (potential) customers to get their habits and preferences so you&#x27;ve more ideas and then prototype them through mockups or small models and once you&#x27;ve the feedback from the customers, decide to either go ahead with the version 2, pivot it, or shelf it.<p>Design thinking talks about being empathetic to your users&#x2F;customers.
