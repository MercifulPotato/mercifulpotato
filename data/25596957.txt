I went without a &quot;valid&quot; phone number since first of June this year. Had to tighten the belt for a bit. Starting using a VoIP number. Recently got a new SIM for my phone, but have not provided the number to anyone. Still passing out the VoIP number. Funny thing is, nobody robo calls the VoIP number.')
