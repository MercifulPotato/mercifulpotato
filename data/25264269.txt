We&#x27;re getting this request a lot!<p>&gt; &quot;Peek into &quot;popular channels&quot; without login.&quot;\nSame as the above<p>&gt; &quot;Sign up email comes from a random firebase domain, not the same as the welcome.&quot;\nYeah we know about this, we requested a custom domain but Google is taking its time :D<p>&gt; &quot;Haven&#x27;t managed to post a comment, getting 500 on a `s?l=dataLayer` resource (chrome macOS).&quot;\nDon&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on here, but will look into it.<p>&gt; &quot;Ability to enable notifications (email and&#x2F;or html5) on specific channels.&quot;\nGreat idea!!!<p>&gt; &quot;A monthly or so email about new features, stats, or changes would be nice. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it right now but if it managed to get traction I&#x27;d be up for it.&quot;\nMonthly email update is setup :)<p>&gt; &quot;Maybe: Invite only rooms? Discord style.&quot;\nPrivate channels that are accessible only for people with a token are on our roadmap. :)')
