And it is far better to be dealing with that kind of model than to deal with &quot;unlimited with a million asterisks&quot; or something. AWS is predictable, reliable, and most notoriously has never ever increased their prices, so whatever you calculated will not go up because of Amazon&#x27;s decisions.')
