Because they&#x27;re still very much the lesser evil among the Microsofts and Googles. If Apple does go bad, it&#x27;s ridiculously easy to avoid Apple completely: Just don&#x27;t buy any Apple hardware. Done. Not so easy with MSFT or GOOG, which is what we warn people about.<p>And that&#x27;s something the other side on HN can&#x27;t seem to be able to handle and tries to bury any opposing comments to give the impression of a homogenous echo chamber.')
