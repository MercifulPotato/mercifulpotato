Whenever I look into this kind of thing when I plan ski vacations I find the bussing options outrageously priced (for example from Calgary to Banff or Kelowna to Revelstoke, etc.) and it ends up being more economical for a family to simply rent a car.<p>Back in the early part of the 20th century Vermont had extensive train access to ski areas, apparently. And much of the alps is accessed this way (tho in general European travel by rail is much more of a thing)')
