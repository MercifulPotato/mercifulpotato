My tuition was $675 a semester, or $1350&#x2F;year and the fees were minimal. The NY minimum wage at the time was $3.35&#x2F;hr.   That meant that by working a minimum wage job for the summer, I could pay my tuition and fees for the next academic year, and by working part time during the semester, I could pay for rent and food.  Thanks to this, I graduated debt free.<p>We need to get back to this level of affordability.')
