There&#x27;s exceptions in other countries, but with the potential passive nature of the device, it seems terrifying that you could keep this in a backpack, leave it on when passing a major corp office in the city that cracks their wifi, and get charged with something serious.<p>Go easy on me if I&#x27;m over thinking this or if I&#x27;ve got it all wrong here.
