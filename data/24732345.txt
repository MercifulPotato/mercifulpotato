(Okay, full disclosure: I wrote it through the night before the day it was due. But that wasn&#x27;t anything I hadn&#x27;t done before.)<p>I&#x27;m older than the &quot;digital natives.&quot; I was born in 1967 and went back to college as an adult. This story I&#x27;m telling happened in the late &#x27;90s. But, in retrospect, I really felt my typing speed was faster than my thinking speed. Pencil-to-paper is a much slower process and seemed better suited to wrestling with complicated thoughts.<p>I would say I&#x27;ve since adapted and can write first drafts at the keyboard. (I&#x27;d say I adapted before I got out of college.) But longhand still seems more intimately connected to my brain.')
