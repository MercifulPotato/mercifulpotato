Replicating a single GPU driver would be significantly easier, albeit still a Herculean task. Especially if your main goal out of the gate is simply framebuffer support and maybe some 2D acceleration.<p>At least, this is from my experience dealing with the Tegra X1 on a Jetson board for hobby osdev.')
