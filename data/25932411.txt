And there&#x27;s a good chance that greater fool will be another retail investor just like you. (Leveraged trades which don&#x27;t require a 10,000% price gain are possible, but what &quot;leverage&quot; means is that you can lose more than your initial $100 investment.)<p>It&#x27;s a different story if the stock is legitimately undervalued, of course. But there&#x27;s no coherent argument to be made that GME&#x27;s current price - up 110% since yesterday! - is rational or sustainable. And indeed, if you look on WSB today, you see a lot of people explaining that you&#x27;ll ruin the bubble if you don&#x27;t keep buying lots of GME.')
