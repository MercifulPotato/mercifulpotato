Item(by='andrewzah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604700563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011583, text='I have not played Hades, but I think referring to these types of games on a spectrum is more apt.<p>In The Binding of Isaac, each run starts the same. The difference is playthroughs allow new items to be found, but the main character is not enhanced. FTL unlocks different starting ships, but there are no &quot;upgrades&quot; as far as I&#x27;m aware, just different ships with pros and cons.<p>In Rogue Legacy and Crypt of the NecroDancer, successful playthroughs enhance aspects of the main character. This to me is a hallmark of roguelites. The Binding of Isaac technically has iterations but since only the random item pool is modified, I would keep it in the roguelike camp.')
