RMS initially did not think this would be covered by copyright but after talking with the lawyer Eben Moglen he got the following explanation: A judge would unlikely see it as an objective-C fronted as an independent work that is talking with GCC, but rather just a compiler. That compiler would be the work, and thus a derivative work since it combines the GCC code and the objective-C fronted.<p>Nothing in there is about API&#x27;s. There is also nothing about linking. It just about what a judge would perceive as being &quot;the work&quot;. FSF however do seem to have a policy about enforcing the license at the technical distinction of linking, but that is just a policy decision based on where they think a judge would likely side with them. Apple were free to go to court arguing that it is not a compiler but rather different independent works simply communicating with each other, but they chose not to do so.')
