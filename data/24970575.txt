Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[24971581], score=None, time=1604337880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946884, text='I directly disagree for both King&#x27;s Quest and Space Quest. So much of the worldbuilding and aesthetic value in those games was their animated styles.<p>King&#x27;s Quest was about adventuring through fairy tales, and most of our cultural vocabulary around that has been built by Disney animated movies. I very much believe that KQVII hit nearly the epitome of the King&#x27;s Quest &quot;perfect&quot; aesthetic with its hand drawn art (even if it went sometimes a bit too &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, and some of the embedded 3D effects did not age well) that evoked playing through a darker Disney or Bluth film. (That KQVIII exists right next to it as first-person and 3D stood even then as a stark contrast for why King&#x27;s Quest is probably a terrible fit for first-person 3D, even if Roberta hadn&#x27;t been kicked out of the project and it had tried for a better KQ storyline.)<p>Space Quest&#x27;s aesthetic similarly had a lot of &quot;Saturday morning sci-fi cartoon&quot; in its DNA (such as Battle of the Planets, as one example to mind). Admittedly, part of Space Quest&#x27;s aesthetic was all over the map if they could find a good joke for something they&#x27;d swap aesthetics on they fly for that joke (that&#x27;s a big part of SQIV after all), but the tonality of the series very much never would fit with &quot;photorealistic graphics&quot; at least not for more than a joke or three. (Two Guys from Andromeda&#x27;s SpaceVenture went 3D for cost reasons, but still seems to have settled on cell shading&#x2F;cartoon styling over &quot;photorealistic&quot;.)')
