What pricing do you have in mind? This appears more featureful than USB HSMs (like Yubico&#x27;s) that go for &lt;$1000. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d like to use a RPI for something like this but I&#x27;m guessing that the module could be transferred to another RPI if the first one dies? Does the module have power protection to survive a surge from the RPI?')
