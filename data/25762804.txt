This &quot;us vs. them&quot;, or more accurately &quot;US vs. them&quot; attitude needs to stop.<p>Except they&#x27;re not going to change. You (i.e. us) are just going to lose. How many European students are enrolled in elite institutions in China, India, Middle East, etc, at the host country&#x27;s expense, who will then take coveted positions at foreign firms in those countries? 30%, lol?<p>In the US, they created this backdoor &quot;Opt&quot; work visa (which they&#x27;re desperately trying to expand) that allows hundreds of thousands of foreign students to stay in the US once studies are finished and compete for jobs. Oh, and they don&#x27;t pay various retirement taxes, so companies get an immediate 15% incentive to hire them over American students.<p>Only white Europeans and Americans are told they must bend over backwards to allow other cultures and ethnicities to advance while the rest of the world takes advantage of our self-inflicted stupidity and laughs at us while they surge past us.<p>You&#x27;ve been indoctrinated by various interest groups, none of whom actually have your interests or those of your country in mind.')
