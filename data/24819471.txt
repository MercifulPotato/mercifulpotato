If you want to sign up somewhere, you have to submit a Personal ID that corresponds to such a hash -- the Personal ID doesn&#x27;t get stored anywhere, but it authenticates that you&#x27;re a real human. (Obviously this is a naive solution and something more clever would be necessary, but it&#x27;s just an example.)')
