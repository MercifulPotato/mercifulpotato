I&#x27;m certain that other people in my line of work have the same problem, and could benefit from a convenient solution. The MVP requirements that I&#x27;ve listed out are complex enough (VOIP capability, some api calls, database stuff) that I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;ll be able to do it with an &quot;app building&quot; service or if I&#x27;ll need to learn how to code it, or pay someone to code it.<p>Not sure this is enough information for a meaningful answer, so happy to chime in as necessary in the comments.')
