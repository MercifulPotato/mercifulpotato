Surprises tend to occur in the other direction.<p>With the shift from fossil fuels, additional electrical demand from heating, cooking, and transport demands can be expected.  I&#x27;d have to re-read the book to see if MacKay accounts for these otherwise.<p>Starting with a value for a &quot;moderately affluent&quot; household also builds in the prospect for a general wealth increase, and forestalls opposition based on assertions he is locking in an austere lifestyle, a commmon tactic of opponents to renewable &#x2F; decarbonised energy.<p>I haven&#x27;t tracked PV efficiency trends lately, but recall generally that high teens is fairly typical.  A vendor page supports this:<p><i>The highest efficiency solar panels on the market today can reach almost 23 percent efficiency. The average efficiency of solar panels falls between the 17 to 19 percent efficiency range.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solar.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;solar-panel-efficiency&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solar.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;solar-panel-efficiency&#x2F;</a><p>For single-layer panels, the maximum theoretical efficiency (never practically obtained) is 37%.  Far more expensive multi-layer panels peak at ~85%, and in  practice, results are well below 50%.  Dual-mode (PV-thermal) systems offer greater net capabilities, though the thermal output is limited to low-grade heat, e.g. hot-water pre-heat or seasonal thermal storage as with Passivhaus.  Not inconsequential, but not makjickal pykxsie duste either.<p>An effective 10% efficiency net of shading, spacing factors, degradation, dirt, inverter  losses, and other factors is quite reasonable.<p>MacKay&#x27;s nuclear advocacy is remarkably sober and low-key in a world where proponents freqquently tend to be strident and shrill.  I am not a fan of the technology (and take it you aren&#x27;t either), but his portrayal is a realistic and respectful one.<p>Apologies for misspelling MacKay&#x27;s name repeatedly above.  HN&#x27;s limited edit window is annoying.')
