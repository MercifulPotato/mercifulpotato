Maybe the jobs are hiding under different names, in different places. Who knows.\nTo me, seeing there&#x27;s little jobs and that there&#x27;s a clear decline in Stackoverflow Trends, and that Elixir isn&#x27;t even in the top 50 in Tiobe, this all means something.\nHearing of people saying they can&#x27;t get a job - means something.\nI&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re in one of the major tech cities in the U.S, you could probably land an Elixir job. You can also land a Haskell job. Or Ocaml or anything else under the sun. This means little for most people who don&#x27;t live there.')
