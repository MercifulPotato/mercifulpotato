Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605824639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25154336, text='The SPLC is an extremely tiring institution populated exclusively by people who are entirely too bothered by what other people are doing, saying, and thinking. One never sees them doing anything about &quot;southern poverty&quot;; rather, it seems their entire mission is to simply find any place in which White people are having conversations with other White people about politics that affect them as an identity group, or people who have public commentary on issues like that, and demonize them and try to drive them from the public square.<p>What an incredibly useless organization. Extremely well funded, yet they accomplish nothing beyond bothering people and complaining about things that are legal and expressly permitted by laws older than them.<p>It should come as no surprise for anyone that if you continually deplatform people, eventually a market niche opens for someone who will provide them with a platform. It&#x27;s a free market. If you don&#x27;t like it, you can just go to another website; why do you care?<p>If you care because of a facetious argument like &quot;enabling extremists&quot;, then it is incumbent upon you to also look for extremism and acts of violence in a sufficiently representative selection of other identity politics groups in order to quantify whether this is a specific problem. I don&#x27;t think it is. You can find Black Nationalists, you can find Zionists, you can find Islamic Extremists, you can look at Antifa, you can look at actual militia groups - but no, they&#x27;re looking at comedians and pundits who are &quot;too edgy for Youtube&quot;.<p>Nobody is making you go to that site. Nobody&#x27;s putting you in straps and holding your eyeballs open Clockwork Orange style to make you absorb spicy takes. It&#x27;s never been easier to seal yourself into a hermetic bubble of safe fictional content, reality shows, and officially sanctioned narratives. Yet somehow, that&#x27;s not good enough; it&#x27;s not good enough until there&#x27;s nobody left on the Internet who can say anything that runs contrary to it.')
