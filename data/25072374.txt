Item(by='cyrialize', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605203002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069449, text='Spotify is quite great at the Daily Mixes (I don&#x27;t check the other playlists that much).<p>I go through phases where I deep dive into genre&#x27;s. Each Daily Mix ends up representing one of the genre&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been listening to lately pulling in music that I like and other songs that I may like.<p>That being said, that may be due to the fact that I deep dive into genres that don&#x27;t have that much of a cross over, e.g. Japanese Hip-Hop &amp; Lo-fi beats, R&amp;B, 90&#x27;s indie rock, etc. Still, the Daily Mixes are a great way to listen to music I like separated by genre.<p>Last.fm&#x27;s discovery feature is pretty neat too. I don&#x27;t use it as much as Spotify&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t listen to music on Last.fm but I think the key feature of Last.fm over other music discovery tools is that it has a profile for many artists.<p>Spotify, Apple Music, etc. are limited by what music is on their platform. If an artist isn&#x27;t on Spotify, then they won&#x27;t have a profile. Last.fm isn&#x27;t limited that way so you can find even more artists, including artists that may be more underground or niche.')
