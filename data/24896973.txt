When you say &quot;without an accent,&quot; what you mean is that you are looking for someone with a particular accent that is meant to be free of features that identify someone as coming from a particular region.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s discriminatory, because you&#x27;re saying that people who do not speak your preferred dialect are not speaking &quot;proper&quot; English. Even if they grew up speaking English their entire life.')
