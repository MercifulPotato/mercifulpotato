I am dismayed that you can imagine that the European Nato members can&#x27;t field significant forces, that would be very insular thinking. Sure they don&#x27;t have stealth bombers and super-carriers...<p>My country has also supported the United States in many of its foreign campaigns as an ally supplying manpower and materiel to Afghanistan and several gulf wars for instance.<p>The sub-text is that my country spends a great deal of it&#x27;s 2% on American weapons, which is not true of some of our Nato neighbour&#x27;s. When I hear the USA demanding more this is what I hear,  &#x27;spend more on US made arms&#x27;  not &#x27;build a better army&#x27;. That is why I call it tribute.')
