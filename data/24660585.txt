Restaurants&#x2F;coffee shops&#x2F;clubbing may be cheaper too, children daycare too, even some groceries. And taxes, as already pointed out.<p>Just an example calculation: If you can save $1000&#x2F;month on rent and another say $150&#x2F;month on other living expenses. that&#x27;s $13800 annually. That&#x27;s about $138000 annually net salary right now ($124200 after the cut) to break even, or about $180K-$210K pre taxes and pre cut, living in San Fran. Now, if you move to an area with lower taxes that break even point will only go up.')
