And for one person trying to quickly get the fix ready while he might have an urgent family situation you have 199 devs who can&#x27;t get their stuff in, of which at least 20 are under pressure to deploy their fixes quickly themself. It sounds like creating a hard problem for individuals for solving a mediocre problem for the team.')
