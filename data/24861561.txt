Ex parte Garland clearly covers that.<p>However, subsequent rulings call into question the absolute scope of Ex parte Garland (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.law.wne.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1815&amp;context=lawreview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.law.wne.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?artic...</a>).<p>In particular, in case of dispute, the Court has the authority to adjudicate the dispute. It&#x27;s the authority the Court used to hear Ex parte Garland in the first place.<p>And to my knowledge, there has never been a case that considers the President&#x27;s ability to pardon for all possible crimes that could be filed related to some action. So if a subsequent President chooses to tack on a fourth crime to the list of three Snowden is currently charged with, a Trump pardon would likely not attach. At least, it would be up to the Court to decide if it attaches.')
