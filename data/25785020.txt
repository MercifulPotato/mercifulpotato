Just because something is popular doesn&#x27;t mean people should be entitled to it. It makes no sense that an arbitrary MAU count suddenly rescinds the property rights of the people who pay money to keep the servers running, as well as to develop and maintain the software. Further, I don&#x27;t see any benefit to society in policies that might <i>encourage</i> social media use, and speaking economically when these large platforms boot people off it actually <i>increases</i> competition and <i>decreases</i> their dominance because it creates a market opportunity for competitors, <i>exactly</i> like what happened with Parler. Suddenly, nobody seems to care that a conservative competitor to AWS is getting a <i>huge</i> account, shouldn&#x27;t that be pereceived as a good thing? Why are the people who get banned so insistent on using services they claim are inherently unfair to them? Why not support companies that share your values?')
