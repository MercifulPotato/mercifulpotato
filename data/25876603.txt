It&#x27;s got two layers of fabric, but it was specifically marked as not medical grade. I gather that it&#x27;s considered better than nothing, but not optimal.<p>If I were to receive a mask from the government I&#x27;d happily wear it, and rotate&#x2F;dispose as directed. It may not actually be any better than what I&#x27;ve got on, but I&#x27;d really like to know. I don&#x27;t want to either catch or spread a disease.<p>I don&#x27;t know how fast they could possibly spin up a thing. I was really hoping that vaccines would be available to me within a couple of months. (I&#x27;ll continue wearing masks until things are very clear, if only to normalize it, since those who can&#x27;t be vaccinated will be in danger until the herd is immune and they can&#x27;t tell who&#x27;s been vaccinated.) Could we possibly spin up a national scale production any faster than that?')
