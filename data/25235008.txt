And trying to finish my degree on the side. While I’m doing all of this, these shiftless people were making excuses about kids having to be places, or wives who wanted their husbands home, or people who always seemed to be sick. I didn’t understand.<p>I think Brad Fitzpatrick described in Coders At Work or similar being frustrated about how people would clock out at the end of the day, when all his energy was invested in the company. And that it took him a while to realize that it comes with the territory of being a founder. You have a massive stake in the outcome, that employees aren&#x27;t offered. The incentives are just wildly different, so it would be amazing if the behavior wasn&#x27;t also wildly different. In fact, startup employees are often undercompensated, compared to their brethren at publicly traded firms.<p>&gt; I get what Alexandr is saying, I really do. Except for the CEO bit, I had the same world view 25 years ago<p>Honestly I feel like if you&#x27;re a founder of a company employing 200 people, you should have maybe just enough emotional intelligence to understand the motivations and incentives of most of those 200. Or be prepared to be replaced.')
