We should have about 20k concurrent users daily.  His previous experience has only been with Laravel, and although I&#x27;ve used several frameworks, my main experience has been using Django and Rails, and in recent years I&#x27;ve begun favouring Rails heavily for the development experience.<p>We&#x27;re now trying to come to an agreement on which framework to use.  My main two arguments for going with Rails was that:\n1 - Rails has amazing support for its features (additionally, I&#x27;m not convinced that Laravel has feature parity with Rails as he suggested)\n2 - I&#x27;ve never met a PHP developer who tried Python or Ruby and ever wanted to go back, including myself. (I chalk this up to the development experience)<p>These are not the strongest arguments, but I believe most people think that the choice comes down to preference anyway.  At least, I&#x27;ve never really read an article that made any stronger case than that.<p>So is there a more objective position to take here?  Are there any real reasons to use one framework over the other?')
