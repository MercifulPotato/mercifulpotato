This article is about &quot;fully driverless&quot; rides (rides with no safety driver present) graduating from their experimental &quot;Early Rider Program&quot; (which includes a small group of people under NDAs) to their public &quot;Waymo One&quot; service (which is a commercial service which requires no NDAs, but still has rather limited availability for now).<p>Waymo One has been shut down for a while now due to COVID, but now that driverless rides are an option they&#x27;re re-opening the service with 100% fully driverless rides. Once they get around to installing barriers between the driver and passenger seats they plan to go back to most rides having a safety driver, but with some smaller percentage of Waymo One rides continuing to be fully driverless.')
