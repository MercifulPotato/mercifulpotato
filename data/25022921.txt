These games are iOS exclusive</i><p>FTL and Bastion aren&#x27;t iOS exclusive. Here are links to pages where you can find their Linux versions. Out of curiosity, where did you get the idea that they were iOS exclusive?<p>Edit: I hadn&#x27;t previously heard of it, but googling reveals that Slay the Spire is also available on Steam. The steam page says it has a Linux version. That means that all of your examples of iOS exclusives could actually run on a Linux box, maybe even a raspi. ;)<p>I will counter with the claim that no major, artistically significant games of the past decade have been iOS exclusives. I might even go so far as to suggest that there are no <i>leading</i> iOS-only productivity apps (by leading, I mean better than what you can get elsewhere to the point where there&#x27;s a major platform advantage, a status conferred to applications like Photoshop and Microsoft Office which used to be Windows-only). That&#x27;s a claim that you might be able to refute, but I can&#x27;t think of any at the moment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lutris.net&#x2F;games&#x2F;ftl-faster-than-light&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lutris.net&#x2F;games&#x2F;ftl-faster-than-light&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lutris.net&#x2F;games&#x2F;bastion&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lutris.net&#x2F;games&#x2F;bastion&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;646570&#x2F;Slay_the_Spire&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;646570&#x2F;Slay_the_Spire&#x2F;</a>')
