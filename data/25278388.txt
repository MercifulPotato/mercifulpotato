One of my mentors said something that has stuck with me: &quot;Google found a hose that money pours out of and it&#x27;s name is online advertising. All we do now is desperately try to find another hose.&quot;<p>Google&#x27;s strategy for a long time was: Hire every clever person you can; give them some creative freedom; see if any of them come up with a trillion dollar idea.<p>Only now they&#x27;ve &#x27;grown up&#x27;. 20% time is dead. There is no second hose. They&#x27;ve mostly given up on the idea of a clever person finding a new money-hose. They just focus on the one they have now.')
