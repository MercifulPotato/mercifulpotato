Suddenly they are in direct competition with people who are willing to accept a lower salary because they live somewhere cheaper.<p>A company has a financial interest in paying remote employees based on location. This is the same as opening an office in a cheap location&#x2F;country in order to save on salary costs.<p>The problem is a human one within the team, let&#x27;s call it &#x27;fairness&#x27;, indeed: People may object if some of their teammates (not some distant employee) make more than them simply based on where they live.')
