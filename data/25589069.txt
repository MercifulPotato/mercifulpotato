The world we inhabit has a complex ecosystem, physics, etc; our study of it is far from complete. But every time we learn something about it a technical advance becomes possible.<p>Nobody <i>has</i> to keep the gears turning in this vast society. But someone at some point decided it was worth it to create those gears, without answering all the how&#x27;s and why&#x27;s: basic science doesn&#x27;t tell us how to engineer things, only that we have ways of dong so.<p>So the &quot;accident&quot; of it emerges like a freeway pileup, from different domains of study colliding. And with computing being the workhorse technology for everything now, the crashes are so frequent as to be unremarkable.')
