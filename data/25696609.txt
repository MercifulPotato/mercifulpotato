Big Tech literally has unlimited powers. What kind of media does Trump have? Nothing. You haven&#x27;t thought it through. Every platform will keep banning Trump because of popular opinion. This is a very fucked up precedent. Today it is Trump, tomorrow it can be Biden. It can be Clinton. It can be any President&#x2F;Prime Minister in the World. It can be any Government. It can be any Dictator. Unlimited power doesn&#x27;t discriminate. It is not bloviation but just your inability to think it through as you want your short term issue to be resolved. This is how we enabled surveillance and become accustomed to it. We will become accustomed to censorship as well. Like a frog in slow boiling water.')
