I used a book called Lingua Latina per se Illustrata. It was entirely in Latin but it started off with simple words which you&#x27;d understand due to it being in the Latin alphabet (obviously) which Western language speakers use, and it had illustrations to show you what was happening. People could eventually read larger Latin texts from going through the Lingua Latina series of books.')
