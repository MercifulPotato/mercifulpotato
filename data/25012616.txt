If someone isn&#x27;t doing their job, and they don&#x27;t get better after having a talk about their performance, you find someone else. Watching their every move is not a viable solution.<p>It sounds a bit like you&#x27;re not setting clear&#x2F;reasonable acceptance criteria, and as a result are not getting what you want.<p>&gt; Ever seen a real rich person outsource to another firm, share their idea, and let the firm create everything in their own - that’s a bit fail waiting to happen. And the dev firm knows it and is happy to take as much money from you as possible.<p>Yeah, and they probably deserve every penny. People who want something very specific, but don&#x27;t really know what it is and can&#x27;t explain it, are miserable to deal with. Running a business is a skill, it takes more than just an idea + $$$$')
