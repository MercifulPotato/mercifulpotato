Putting water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen in a bottle and hitting the mixture with energy in the form of artificial lightening, they generated eleven amino acids, as they thought. In fact it was at least twenty including the set that living organisms use. Apparently a lot of other molecules were created &#x27;too complex to resolve&#x27;. Similar experiments have formed RNA and DNA.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment</a> details the results for these and other analogue experiments.')
