It also mentions they&#x27;ve been unable to find another hosting company, though it doesn&#x27;t go into why. The antitrust claim wasn&#x27;t that AWS cut them off. That was the <i>breach of contract</i> claim. The antitrust claim was based on allegations that AWS and Twitter just did a multi-year cloud deal, and conspired to shut Parler down. Section 1 anticompetitive conduct claim. IIRC, the relevant market was microblogging, not cloud infra.<p>The Nadler Committee report Glenn cites puts AWS at 24% of US spend and &quot;close to half&quot; of global spend on cloud services. US courts don&#x27;t typically find &quot;market power&quot; below 50% in the relevant market. The concept of abusing &quot;dominant position&quot;, mentioned over and over in the report, comes from European competition law, not US antitrust law.<p>Anecdotally, I use cloud services and I don&#x27;t use AWS at all anymore. As an attorney who advises on terms of service for cloud services, I&#x27;d also expect every major cloud platform has broad &quot;acceptable use&quot; or similar terms that let them refuse or terminate customers that cause more problems---law enforcement requests, law suits, marketing crises---than they&#x27;re worth.<p>A number of my cloud clients rack their own iron.  Others intentionally seek out providers and services with permissive or aligned activist reputations. Those services often cost more, both because they&#x27;re smaller and because they deal with more warrants, lawsuits, DMCA takedowns, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I personally prefer to patronize smaller, upstart providers. Which is only possible if you don&#x27;t bite the hooks---k8s, vendor-specific APIs, and so on.')
