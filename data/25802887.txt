Currently, I don&#x27;t have to trust the outlet in the wall, since it only has two or three connectable lines, and I plugin my vacuum cleaner, I am pretty sure it will only transfer energy, no data. But in a speculative future with USB type-C connected vacuum cleaners and USB ports installed in the house, I&#x27;ll always wonder whether there is some backdoor somewhere in the house, that infects the firmware of my vacuum cleaner. I know this sounds like paranoia, it is not. I used to know that a sd-card connected to the sd-card reader doesn&#x27;t send key strokes to my computer or uses my network to phone home. In a world where everything is connected via USB type-C those kinds of assumptions are pure speculation. And don&#x27;t get me started on the different kinds of cables for USB type-C.')
