When you time seek a digital video file you don&#x27;t.<p>- It&#x27;s harder to do targeted advertising (since you no longer know if the downloader is also the viewer)<p>- Adverts baked into a video file can&#x27;t be changed out later for newer adverts after the user has downloaded the file<p>- There&#x27;s no way of having users &quot;click&quot; those adverts, let alone report back to Google that they&#x27;ve engaged with it<p>- Some of those aforementioned points might also have a knock on effect with how advertising is charged, which would mean Google would need another pricing model<p>...and all of this is before you even address the technical issues of video files having multiple different bitrates and formats. You could probably generate a new file on the fly but that would be extremely computationally expensive. So they&#x27;d rack up more costs hosting the service as well as lose money on advertising.<p>Honestly, I can&#x27;t blame Google for not supporting a download option.')
