Dijkstra was very specific about advising people to not assign agency to computer programs, nor to rely on operational reasoning. However, the cited examples involve either the explanation of the <i>concepts</i> of programming (rather than reasoning about a program itself), or the very same thing that Dijkstra exhorted us to do... read what the program “says”, i.e. its denotation. Reason about it mathematically and logically, deducing its nature, instead of watching it like a mechanism and abducting various properties.')
