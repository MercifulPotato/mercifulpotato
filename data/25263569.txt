Such a throwback!\nI noticed that some of the characters aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;d expect, any reason?<p>PRINT ASC(&quot;\\&quot;) &quot; &quot; CHR$(92) :  PRINT ASC(&quot;&#x2F;&quot;) &quot; &quot; CHR$(47)<p>47 prints fine, but 92 reveals a symbol &quot;12&quot; in super&#x2F;subscript.<p>Some of the others are also off, e.g. the arrow sequence revealed by\n10 FOR A= 1 TO 255 STEP 1 : PRINT CHR$(A) ;:  NEXT<p>shows down arrow suffering the same.<p>Thanks, can&#x27;t wait to see where this goes next!')
