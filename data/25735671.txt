That&#x27;s great until someone smarter than you comes along and thinks that the test is too easy and too many &quot;uneducated&quot; people are voting. I love history and politics, but I don&#x27;t know everything and I know that there are tests that can be drafted that I can&#x27;t pass. Are you willing to be on the outside looking in, willing to be presented with a test so hard you can&#x27;t pass it and can&#x27;t vote? Willing to be represented by officials that you can never peacefully vote out of office? How long until a narcissist decides that they&#x27;re the only one smart enough to vote? That&#x27;s unfortunately the fate of every country that&#x27;s fallen into a dictatorship.<p>I see that you want an educated electorate but voting tests have been tried before and tons of innocent, smart, well-intentioned people get cut off in the process. Democracy is the only form of government we know of where we can meaningfully and non-violently express our collective opinion as a group. When you take a vote away from someone, they&#x27;re left with a choice between compliance or violence, neither of which are good.<p>Maybe, the paid public education you mention would still be a good idea, just without the voting rights test.')
