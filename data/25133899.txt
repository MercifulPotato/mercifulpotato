Item(by='aleksv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605682394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133898, text='PRVHASH is a hash function that generates a uniform pseudo-random number sequence derived from the message. PRVHASH is conceptually similar (in the sense of using a pseudo-random number sequence as a hash) to keccak and RadioGatun schemes, but is a completely different implementation of such concept. PRVHASH is both a &quot;randomness extractor&quot; and an &quot;extendable-output function&quot; (XOF), however the resulting hashes have security level that corresponds to the hash length specification: the collision resistance is equal to 2^(n&#x2F;2) while the preimage resistance is equal to 2^n, where n is the resulting hash length in bits.')
