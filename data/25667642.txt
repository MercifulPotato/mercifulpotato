Since then I&#x27;ve an aunt and uncle both catch it. All three have recovered just fine, as have my five or six neighbors who also caught it, and nearly everyone in my broader community who has caught it.<p>But yes, me and my cold dead heart killing old people. I&#x27;d personally much rather that than the reality of my grandma being locked in her nursing home without visitors for the past nine months and the whole place still caught the virus. Maybe now with the vaccine coming out she can finally have some comfort in her life instead of sobbing and threatening to run away every day.')
