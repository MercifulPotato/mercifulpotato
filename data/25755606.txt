Phoronix even have GCC <i>faster</i> than Clang at building the Linux Kernel, even in an (according to a comment) biased sample where GCC wasn&#x27;t built with lto enabled. GCC also (last time I tried) does better debug info.<p>LLVM is <i>much</i> easier to hack on, though, although some parts are more similar than you might expect.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=GCC-Faster-Kernel-Builds-Clang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=GCC-Fast...</a><p>You should try and fettle with both to see what works best for your project.')
