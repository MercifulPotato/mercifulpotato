Always. The issue isn&#x27;t they have a voice therefore banning them cannot be an acceptable solution. The large number of people that resonate with those extreme ideas are either in deer life conditions or massively uneducated. Why not start debugging the problem there?<p>Silencing voices is never a good idea. It&#x27;s also quite a shame you allow Google&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;FB and other big commercial tech companies to decide on your behalf what is socially acceptable and what is not. These are the same companies training your brain with their apps to respond to their commercial interests.<p>Also, there is a gigantic space between demanding people to take any type of action and becoming violent. Maybe you should stop all Hollywood productions that involve people threatening&#x2F;killing&#x2F;inciting each other to commit acts of any sort of violence too.<p>Lastly, the American society, does cultivate from early days fanaticism. As a European that lived in US for the last 12 years you cannot not see this. Fanatical support for your local sports team, high school team, university, political party and&#x2F;or faction, city and country is something that is being cultivated and developed from the youngest age. People take pride in bearing a label for generations the label being anything from political affiliation to sport team fans. Continuing the tradition is being perceived as more important than the ideals&#x2F;ideas one stands for under that particular label.')
