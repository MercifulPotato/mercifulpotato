You need an active interposer that&#x27;s larger than the chip to do something like that. 4x HBM stacks means 4096 wires to run between your compute-device and the RAM, that&#x27;s a lot of wires in a tiny area, and only possible with advanced packaging (expensive) methodologies.<p>Second: HBM2 based designs have poor memory-capacity: 8GB per stack means 4x HBM2 caps out at 32GBs under most reasonable configurations.<p>Going into 2021 with a ludicrously expensive 32GB machine seems a bit weak. I don&#x27;t think anyone in the high-end market is targeting that level of memory capacity. Even if we&#x27;re generous and HBM capacity doubles between now and then, I&#x27;m not sure if 64GBs is enough for workstation tasks.<p>HBM works for supercomputers, because when 32GB isn&#x27;t enough, you just buy another node. A64FX, the current CPU-based supercomputer that uses HBM, only has 32GB&#x2F;node.')
