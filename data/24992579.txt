In practice, it does not matter for the wider performance of the code. Is this not evidence to support the assumption that sophisticated register allocation does not matter as much as we thought?<p>When you enable Graal&#x27;s more sophisticated escape analysis algorithms you get real-world speed ups in workloads such as Twitter, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs saved. Is this not evidence to support the assumption that sophisticated escape analysis algorithms do matter?<p>The first is a formal scientific study. The second is not but it&#x27;s still a very large-scale empirical result measured by an expert. They aren&#x27;t falsifiable but as I said I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a realistic expectation, and I think these are enough for it to be more than an assumption.')
