Sorry was this meant to be a criticism?<p>They&#x27;re both great. Get off your high horse. Great cinema is great cinema. If you can&#x27;t appreciate them both, there&#x27;s something wrong with your taste in movies. Sounds like you don&#x27;t like them just because they&#x27;re popular, which is lame.<p>Of course Fincher isn&#x27;t &quot;art house&quot; - although Mank is moving in that direction. But he&#x27;s certainly not a multiplex pleaser. There&#x27;s a lot of different genres and a fan base for all of them. The challenge is finding a model that makes this work.')
