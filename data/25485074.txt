Still gets to the heart of the moderation problem though: how do you moderate a small text file containing a string of characters?<p>I foresee this being used for stolen license keys (and maybe porn, though probably not much - feds would get a warrant and know who it&#x27;s getting cashed out to.)<p>If OP adds Bitcoin as a way of <i>cashing out</i> though, they&#x27;ll probably go to prison as an accessory for the many horrible use cases that would inevitably result.
