I&#x27;m also skeptical of the statistic you mention, since Canonical doesn&#x27;t publish rankings, and download stats need to be retrieved via API on an individual repository basis.<p>Relying on extremely incompetent users to make a general point is a strawman, not to talk about defining PPAs as &quot;random people&quot;, as many software products have official repositories or affiliations (I take you don&#x27;t use PPAs).<p>If one likes to scream about administrative privileges to get attention, they&#x27;re forgetting that any Linux user is giving root access to thousands of packages. So the point is really the web of trust.<p>If we talk about the past and present, there has been no malicious attacks (or in number so small, that it&#x27;s hard to find reports). So much for the &quot;worst of the worst&quot;.<p>If we talk about the future, there&#x27;s no reason why a web of trust can&#x27;t be built. &quot;To reiterate&quot;, lots of PPAs are official, including the OpenJDK one, so if the PPAs approach happened to get traction, it&#x27;d be really a matter of software authors to build their own or to appoint somebody to do.<p>This is really the concept of maintainers and their network, it&#x27;s applying to the distro you&#x27;re using, and it&#x27;s nothing fundamentally different.')
