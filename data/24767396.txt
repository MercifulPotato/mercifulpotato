Everything else from that point is just bonus.<p>Being involved in a VC-backed startup probably makes way more sense if you really, really like wealth and money.  It&#x27;s probably the rational course of action.  I don&#x27;t want a ton of money though, nor be wholly guided by what&#x27;s rational or logical.  I just want to really live.')
