Now we have multiple free, high-quality sources of information that are far easier to access than libraries ever were, for example, Wikipedia or the many sites where people share their literary works for free.<p>Oh, yeah?  Try finding out how to do something in Visual Basic 6 or try finding out how jeweler&#x27;s used to cut accurate screw threads.<p>Knowledge prior to 1996 was in books.  Many of those books have been discarded because they &quot;don&#x27;t circulate&quot;.  I have even tried to pull some of these things via interlibrary loan programs--the books simply <i>do not exist</i>.<p>This knowledge is no longer available to someone without significant resource.  It&#x27;s not online; the books are gone; old periodicals <i>may</i> be online but are behind a paywall.  You <i>might</i> be able to purchase one of these books if someone with an extensive personal library dies--but the book will be expensive.<p>As a child, I could walk into my local university library and pull car repair, machining, Popular Electronics, etc. off the shelves and simply read them.
