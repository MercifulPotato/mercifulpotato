There are two facts that can be true at the same time:<p>- The government often grotesquely overpays for mediocre product delivered by vendors without holding them accountable in a meaningful way<p>- The government process drives up costs to an insane level independent of implementor good faith efforts and strongly selects for companies good at the process rather than execution<p>These are two different problems, and both of them manifest with any large contract. I would make the observation that it is easier to hide mediocre product and execution when you can hide behind a grotesquely inefficient and mediocre government process.<p>What transpired here should never happen. But I know why and how it happened.')
