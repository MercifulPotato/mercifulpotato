(I&#x27;m not a heavy Windows user either so I might not be right.) I&#x27;ve sometimes found Windows to have rebooted by itself, but that might have been because I wasn&#x27;t there to react to the prompt.<p>But no, obviously Fedora doesn&#x27;t force a reboot, nor does it give a prompt you can accidentally reboot through.<p>However, a part of the complaints (which I fully understand) seemed to be about the frequency of the updates, and in the name of honesty I just wanted to point out that&#x27;s not really just a Windows issue.')
