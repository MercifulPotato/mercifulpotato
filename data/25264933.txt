From my limited understanding of how these things are done, I assumed there must have been severe cases in the control group (which would have the same exclusions), and enough of them for some statistical test to show meaningful difference between the groups, for them to be trumpeting no severe cases in experimental group. No? If not, that would indeed to my non-statistician eye seem kind of sketchy. But if yes, thats how it works right?')
