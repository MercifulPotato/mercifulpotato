Their stories can remind you that even after enduring incredible hardships, you can overcome them, even if you don&#x27;t know how yet.<p>I also suggest meditating on death and life. Ask yourself what&#x27;s the worst thing that could happen. Usually it&#x27;s not death, which means you can survive whatever the worst thing is. Then you can ask yourself what good things do you have right now. If you&#x27;re warm, safe, and have food, you&#x27;ve covered all the base requirements! Can you hear, see? Then you can also listen to music and look at nature&#x2F;art. Even when things are falling apart, we usually still have pretty amazing lives.')
