It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s something baked into the laws of math that says your society is required to be a surveillance state (unlike encryption, where the laws of math do say this is always possible).<p>It is absolutely within the realm of technological possibility to build a society with largely decentralized infrastructure that doesn&#x27;t constantly phone home to report on you to the Great Eye. We don&#x27;t live in that world because normal people are kinda retarded. In the words of the creator of the Great Eye itself: &quot;They trust me. Dumb fucks.&quot;')
