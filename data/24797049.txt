There&#x27;s orders of magnitude more people creating&#x2F;restoring stuff on Youtube than there are people destroying stuff.<p>The number of channels dedicated to restoring cars, building dioramas, making knives&#x2F;tools, restoring old electronics, inventing new electronics, cooking, painting, etc etc... it&#x27;s truly awesome (in both meanings of the word) and I personally love that Youtube has brought all this to the world.<p>I don&#x27;t even watch TV&#x2F;movies anymore, I just have 200+ subscriptions to talented makers of all varieties, even stuff I personally have no intention of ever trying, just because it&#x27;s so great to watch.<p>After all that, I don&#x27;t really fault people enjoying some things being crushed, same reason lots of people like seeing big crashes in motorsports or big explosions. It&#x27;s a part of human nature.')
