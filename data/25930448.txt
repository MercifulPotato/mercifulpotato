OP just threw it out there as if it&#x27;s an obvious fact that &quot;people living in poverty don’t have “savings”&quot;. That is such a blatantly false statement. Poor people in developing countries have savings. I can guarantee you that even in places like North Korea, people are squirreling away the little they have, just as my grandmother did.<p>Poor people aren&#x27;t idiots. They think about the future. They plan for the future. If they need to save, they will save.')
