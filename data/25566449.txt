I used to think Apple&#x27;s products were the best and were so joyful to use. I still go back to try the newest macs with the old foolish expectations and walk out disappointed every time.<p>I&#x27;ve tried PCs, they just aren&#x27;t on the same level as Apple&#x27;s hardware and I hate Windows.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some cool customizations of Linux but would really rather not have to spend that time myself to get to a place where I&#x27;m productive. I want something that 90% &quot;just works&quot;, but that&#x27;s also pleasing to use.<p>I really wish there was a solid third option, new tech is so cool yet the options available today seem so boring!')
