They might take a few days to settle, but the authorizations show up in my bank almost immediately. For all intents and purposes they&#x27;re real time.<p>&gt;Alipay provides more agile context by integrating location data real time.<p>The usefulness of this is questionable. Merchant terminals are mostly fixed, so correlating a merchant id&#x2F;name to a physical location isn&#x27;t too hard. Apple pay already has this, where it will show a map of where the transaction happened if you click into a transaction. This works even without location services enabled on your phone.')
