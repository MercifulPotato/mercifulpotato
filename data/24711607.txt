It was supposed to be a public service that citizens took on when necessary for the betterment and representation of their communities.<p>Now like I said I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to get back to that, but even the notion of a revolving door situation presupposes professional legislators. Term limits in general would help the revolving door problem by limiting the amount of influence any one individual could ever have.')
