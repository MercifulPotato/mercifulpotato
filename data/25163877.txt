I&#x27;ve seen both cracking and scraping in the wild. Not as many as I&#x27;ve seen shorted MLCCs, but that would be a tall order.<p>Sure, it could also have been a design failure, but every time I&#x27;ve found one bad resistor in a bank of identical resistors, it has always been a physical problem with that resistor.
