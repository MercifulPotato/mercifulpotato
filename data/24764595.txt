And how does it stimulate them to seek global efficiency?<p>In vernacular, &quot;theory&quot; is completely different from the scientific jargon meaning of a &quot;theory&quot;, which leads to people saying &quot;Evolution is just a theory&quot;.<p>Similarly, the economic jargon term &quot;efficiency&quot; is not at all the same as the commonplace definition you used. The economic definition barely covers anything beyond profit maximisation and cost minimisation and is precisely the reason we see so many externalised costs. Companies are &quot;efficient&quot; only in monetary terms, but that doesn&#x27;t preclude waste, missed opportunities, myopia and environmental or societal fallout.')
