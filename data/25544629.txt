For instance, the App Store version of Elmedia player does not have a video&#x2F;stream saving feature. Other apps like Telegram (specifically, the App Store versions) restrict the user from viewing the channels&#x2F;communities which have been marked as spreading &quot;pornographic&quot;&#x2F;&quot;pirate&quot; content. Needless to say, the app variants obtained from elsewhere pack all the features.<p>Second, I was surprised (well, not really) to learn about &quot;notarization&quot; in the latest versions of macOS, which essentially means signing the app by Apple. These days it&#x27;s not just about scaring the user into thinking that unidentified apps are inherently evil (which the OS does a lot), it&#x27;s also actively preventing the user from actually opening such apps. In Catalina the default dialog for opening an identified app features something like two buttons, offering to &quot;Cancel&quot; and &quot;Move to Trash&quot;. So you have to either go to the Settings and override the security control or know that a control-click spawns the same window with an additional &quot;Open&quot; button being available.<p>At this point one starts thinking, how long will it take before those overrides and control-clicks get taken away for good.')
