I went from pretty good eyesight to +3.25 over a relatively short period of time, but it wasn&#x27;t an option to wait any longer, I had these crazy headaches and did not realize they were caused by my eyesight being off. The initial glasses were +1.5 and made a world of a difference. 6 months later is was +2.0, another six months and it was at 3.0. That&#x27;s when I got scared wondering how bad it was going to get but it actually leveled off and took another year or so to go to 3.25 and I&#x27;ve had these for a year now and no difference. I even bought a couple to not have to switch to different models when these wear out (which they inevitably do, they&#x27;re consumables to me, not something to treat with great care, a couple of hours in the shop and they&#x27;ll definitely fall at least once on a concrete floor).')
