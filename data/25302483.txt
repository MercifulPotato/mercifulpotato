Is the EU also going to come out with the &quot;Right to breathe&quot; and the &quot;Right to go to the bathroom when you need to&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m really frustrated with how the term &quot;right&quot; has been watered down. Rights used to be innate freedoms of the utmost importance, something worth dying for. Now it&#x27;s just shorthand for some benefit the government provides, or something that the government allows you to do (often with lots of stipulations). Rights are no longer something innate to all humans, they are something that the government gives to you when it wants.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurofound.europa.eu&#x2F;observatories&#x2F;eurwork&#x2F;industrial-relations-dictionary&#x2F;right-to-disconnect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurofound.europa.eu&#x2F;observatories&#x2F;eurwork&#x2F;indust...</a>')
