It was originally a configuration language, and in a lot of ways it&#x27;s still more optimized for &quot;open up a text file and plug in some different values for the running program&quot; than it is for implementing actual logic. (That&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;non-programmers&quot; in the other comment.)<p>And static typing is hard to make work when your codebase is made up of a lot of independent snippets of code which run in an environment completely determined by an outside program. You&#x27;d need something akin to TypeScript&#x27;s external type definition files.')
