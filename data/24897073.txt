Still, I think the parent comment&#x27;s analogy is very valid.<p>AFAIK I don&#x27;t know any instances of, say, car companies refusing to sell a car to the KKK or some other neo-Nazi group, and I think a lot of people would be very uneasy if all your purchases, even from private companies, were vetted based on your political ideology. To clarify, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in this instance (as others have noted this looks like a set of pretty standard KYC questions), but I think it&#x27;s very fair to ask why we think certain company behaviors that would be pretty unacceptable in the physical world should be acceptable in the online world.')
