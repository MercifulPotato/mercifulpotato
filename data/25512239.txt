We&#x27;re moving dangerously fast: in the past century we&#x27;ve made more technical progress than in the past 10 thousand years. If anything, I&#x27;m worried that we&#x27;ll make more progress in the next 50 years than we can handle. Where we&#x27;re lacking is the moral side of things.<p>However I don&#x27;t buy into your inequality talk. It seems a regressive ideology that replaces merit with physical attributes of human body. This is literally one step away from dark cults that worship human body.<p>If anything, the today&#x27;s environment is the most favourable to women. The only reason why this safe playground exists is the shell that protects it. That shell is the army &amp; navy made of very aggressive men who keep countries like China, Russia and Iran away. If you figure how to break this shell, you&#x27;ll get to meet the rough reality.<p>The constructive way to promote equality would be to highlight capable women that write books, make music and so on.')
