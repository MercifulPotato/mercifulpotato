I have a haswell workstation (E5-1680 v3) that I find reasonably fast and works very well under Linux. In windows, I get lost. I tried to run the userbenchark suite which told me I&#x27;m below median for most of my components. Is there any good advice how to improve that? Which tools give good insight into what the machine is doing under windows?\nI&#x27;d like first to try to optimize what I have, before upgrading to the new shiny :).')
