In such a scenario, I&#x27;d agree with you that you could do this and not worry about it. But it also means that you&#x27;ve got far more battery capacity than you need, just to cover the two days a year when you need to do this. Using Li would allow you to reduce the capacity, dip down below 50% SOC more often, without impacting battery life.<p>It seems that you&#x27;re suggesting that my Morningstar charge controller might not be one of the &quot;better regulators&quot;. I&#x27;d beg to differ. It is precisely &quot;charge at the maximum safe current&quot; that is what I mean by &quot;tapering off&quot;. You cannot dump 18A @ 13V into lead-acids that are at 90% SOC without harming the batteries. The Morningstar (an MPPT controller) will modulate the current as the battery approaches 100% SOC, which as I said is precisely what you want for battery life, but precisely the opposite of what you want for &quot;gather as much power as quickly as possible&quot;.<p>But yes, perhaps I did make it sound as if the charge controller was at fault for doing this, which is not true. I was describing it more as a kind of unexpected behavior that can oddly impact your battery use. For example, if you&#x27;re somewhere that is very sunny in the mornings and then routinely clouds up in the afternoon, starting the day at say 85% SOC with lead-acids may not get you back to 100% even though there is sufficient power to do so - the charge controller will limit the current delivered to the batteries during the morning (correctly!), then the afternoon comes around and the power levels drop (this happened to me a lot in southern Spain for example). It&#x27;s a somewhat surprising behavior if your mental model is &quot;I&#x27;ve got 500W of panels on the roof, these babies should be recharged by 10:30am&quot;')
