Following conventions makes sure someone else can read your code easily.<p>&gt; In which directory to store files is an incredibly small and minor detail though.<p>Yeah it&#x27;s a small detail, but it is important to me to not get lost in a directory tree.<p>Random example taken from a github search: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gofiber&#x2F;fiber" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gofiber&#x2F;fiber</a><p>Is it really ok to have that much source code at the toplevel? Is the code architecture clear at a glance?<p>For me, it is not, and I&#x27;ll have to put in extra work (I&#x27;m lazy) to understand the code and how it works.<p>I don&#x27;t mind doing that for other projects, but for my projects as I work on them daily, it becomes a pain very quickly.')
