Whether we do or not currently doesn&#x27;t affect the equation when you&#x27;re talking about changing the existing policy to something else.<p>But also, billionaires and international corporations <i>do</i> pay marginal rates higher than the middle class. Their effective rates are lower because they shield most of their income, but what they have is still above the threshold for paying the higher marginal rates.<p>So, for example, a US billionaire makes $5B&#x2F;year, only $1B of which is reported as taxable income in the US, cutting their effective rate by a factor of five. But nearly the whole billion dollars is at the high marginal rate. A piece of legislation that would cause their domestic business dealings to gain a hundred million dollars, so that they would make $5.1B&#x2F;year and $1.1B in the US, would yield the US treasury more than the same total gain going to the middle class, because their marginal rate is higher even if their effective rate is lower. (And this is actually how it works because the shielded income is characteristically from foreign business dealings whereas domestic policy affects domestic business dealings.)')
