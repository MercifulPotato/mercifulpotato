If any finite (computable, as physics seems to be) process has a bounded Kolmogorov complexity, is it correct to assert that infinite complexity can be originated only from an unbounded process?\nThen what about the constituent parts of that unbounded process? Shouldn&#x27;t they have unbounded mass&#x2F;energy and collapse into a blackhole? Equivalenty: shouldn&#x27;t something with infinite entropy collapse into a blackhole per Bekenstein bound?<p>Somehow I feel that this cosmic TRNG is as shady as the embedding of the real numbers in the real world.<p>N.B.:\n- I don&#x27;t think this line of reasoning contradicts Bell&#x27;s theorem.\n- I reckon that, as digital cowboys, we have a bias for finiteness and discreteness<p>I&#x27;m really curious about this, please contradict me. There must be something beautiful that I&#x27;m not seeing.')
