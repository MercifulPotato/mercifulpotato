Nor is it a necessary evil. State is essential to many, if not most, interesting applications.<p>Poorly managed state or ad hoc state machines are the devil. Once you model your system properly as a state machine, many of these issues fall out during the initial design and development (not to say they won&#x27;t happen anyways, but this mitigates many of the issues). If you design your system so that whatever variables define your state are mutated <i>together</i> to ensure your invariants hold, this helps a lot with addressing poorly managed state. And if you can (you can&#x27;t always) use a system which is aware of state machines as part of the design then you can mitigate the ad hoc state machine part.')
