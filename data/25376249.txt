For example, if you have a company with millions of users and Apple decides you are a threat to their business, (or whatever reason they make up), they can ban your apps from the store, (e.g. Epic Games). This is monopolistic behavior. If apple were to allow third party store options, (without jailbreaking required), there wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. The root issue isn&#x27;t jailbreaking, (that&#x27;s still possible and required to install non-store apps), but rather the requirement that <i></i>ONLY<i></i> store apps can be installed in the first place.')
