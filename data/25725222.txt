There&#x27;s a difference between free speech and saying &quot;i&#x27;m going to go down to the capitol and put _______ head on a spike&quot; . That&#x27;s not free speech that&#x27;s a threat. &quot;Let&#x27;s blow up ____________&quot; is also a threat and not free speech. Also facebook, twitter, etc should not host such things, and they decided not to, thus this really isn&#x27;t about free speech in the Constitution and no one really has ever had a right to post such things anywhere unless they have a contract that says it, and such a contract would be illegal anyway. The government didn&#x27;t force AWS to remove Parler.')
