Largely I find them to be the same, the few things that really bother me is the lack of a back button and the lack of having photos sorted in the gallery. Its stupid how my camera photos get mixed in with memes saved off the internet.<p>But the main reason by far I picked an iphone this time is Apple is not an advertising company and therefore doesn&#x27;t have to disrespect my privacy. Its always comforting to open a page on an apple app and see a very plain text explanation of exactly what data the app stores, how it is always kept locally and if shared, apple only requests the bare minimum rights to provide the feature you are using.<p>And then you look at a Google ToS that says &quot;We can and will do whatever we want&quot;')
