(In addition to one by the door of course.))<p>I&#x27;d just have &#x27;the system&#x27; &#x27;aware&#x27; of the switches and current state etc. so that I could have certain automations, logging, etc.<p>The physical switches would either be network inputs themselves (easier implementation but reliability concern) or just report events but be electrically connected to the light still; I suppose also light-side state reporting for ultimate reliability (against missed switch events that did change light state because of electrical connection).')
