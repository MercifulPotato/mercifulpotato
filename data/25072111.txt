Item(by='chunkyfunky', descendants=None, kids=[25074189, 25074820], score=None, time=1605201884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071926, text='Page 150 of &quot;Clean Code&quot; says this about the DIP: &quot;In essence, the DIP says that our classes should depend upon abstractions, not concrete details&quot;. This is very similar to pretty much any canonical definition you can find anywhere else. I&#x27;m quoting it here because the person who coined the principle is the same person whose name is on the book, so I am guessing his definition is correct.<p>If you&#x27;re not using abstractions, you are not using the DIP. What is being described here with low-level modules depending on high-level modules is categorically not the DIP, and I am starting to wonder if this is perhaps part of the frustration that the poster we&#x27;re replying to has experienced with DI, since turning your coupling upside down will have the same problems as just high coupling in general, except everything is upside down now and harder to read :)')
