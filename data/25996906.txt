It&#x27;s entirely managed by the cloud provider, based on their own internal metrics and scaling behaviors.<p>Behind the scenes, their load balancer services don&#x27;t give you indications of how heavily loaded they are - nor do you get to directly control how many&#x2F;big those load balancers are.<p>In some parts you can hack around this by pre-warming infrastructure by generating fake traffic - but that assumes that you have those metrics and knowledge that you even need to do this.<p>This applies to all sorts of things - there&#x27;s hidden caps and other capacity limits all over AWSs platform that you don&#x27;t know about until you hit them.  There&#x27;s even capacity limits that you can know about, because they&#x27;re publicly documented, but AWS lies and won&#x27;t tell you the actual limit being applied to your account - the console and documentation says one thing, but in reality it&#x27;s a lot lower.<p>If that capacity limit resulted in an outage, well, tough luck.')
