They get super upset though when you get down to the bean counting because they think we should revoke an economy for the sake of some greater cause.<p>We all want green power. However we also expect the lights to turn on when you hit the light switch. Every. Time. And at an affordable rate.<p>For some reason many leftists want this utopia of workers rights and high pay along with an equitable distribution of wealth but then forget many of their ideological polices if implemented would be idiosyncratic to each other.<p>Whats the point of having higher wages is proportionally the expenses you dole out are still the same as before? How do higher electricity costs because of green energy help the working class? Leftists treat their beliefs worse than a religion that it&#x27;s sickening to hear more than actual christian garbage thrown around every now and then.')
