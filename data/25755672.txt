That&#x27;s a very strange metric you&#x27;re trying to use. What codec&#x2F;bitrate are you using to determine that amount of spaced used?<p>19 years = 599184000 seconds<p>200TB = 200 * 1000GB * 1000MB * 8bits = 1600000000 bits<p>roughly 375kbps for the bit rate<p>That&#x27;s some crap video quality even for h.265. I for one would not keep a hard drive full of video that poorly encoded.<p>I&#x27;d have been more impressed with how many times the Library of Congress could be stored in that 200TB')
