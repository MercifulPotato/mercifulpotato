I hear it or something like it all the time. Like him or not, he&#x27;s a hugely influential thinker even today. So are most of his critics. It&#x27;s hardly a settled issue.<p>But the idea of MoP isn&#x27;t even part of the controversial parts of Marx. It&#x27;s just a description about how part of capitalism works, as he saw it. The ideas he draws on in that analysis come largely from Ricardo and Smith, hardly &quot;discredited&quot; radicals.')
