Prior to this I&#x27;d tried blocking it entirely, but the problem is that there is sometimes valuable educational content that I benefit from watching (even if only to briefly unwind after a day of work). Ideally there could be an option in the YouTube settings to turn off all recommendations, or perhaps a browser extension to remove them from the page, but to solution I ended up with was quite simple: RSS!<p>I went to every channel with useful educational content that I like to watch, subscribed to their feed (or even indivial playlists) with my RSS reader of choice (Feedly), and the videos get delivered and displayed inline in the RSS reader. No more YouTube binging because I don&#x27;t find myself with the urge to visit the site, and so I&#x27;m never exposed to the recommendations. On the rare occasion where I want to watch an arbitrary video, I open a private browsing session so that the recommendations are uselessly generic.')
