Pay workers higher and they&#x27;re less likely to unionise. They&#x27;re more productive (lest they lose their jobs). They don&#x27;t want to leave. This works for the tech industry because technically they&#x27;re not paying workers higher to be generous, it&#x27;s just a different way to invest the profits back into the business, like how a car company would invest into steel infrastructure. Software doesn&#x27;t need to do that, their infrastructure is employee&#x27;s brains.<p>As it turns out, the more ethical solution tends to work better for businesses, I think. If CEO&#x27;s took a cut out of their salary and the profits and reinvested it into worker salaries I am willing to bet this would make any business more productive.<p>You might say software employees leave and unionise anyway, but they only leave to go to better companies and their unions aren&#x27;t very popular. Time will tell on that second point though.')
