And spy didn&#x27;t automatically mean communist.  In fact, most of our <i>worst</i> breaches weren&#x27;t &quot;communists&quot;.<p>2) The problem isn&#x27;t just saying: &quot;We have spies.&quot;  It&#x27;s finding <i>real evidence</i> on them.<p>The primary problem is <i>finding</i> real spies--and McCarthy had absolutely zero useful evidence to that end.  If anything, he made it <i>easier</i> for the spies by kicking up so much cover.<p>So, McCarthy destroyed a lot of people ... destroyed civil liberties across the board ... and provided nothing useful to actually root out the real threats.<p>And this <i>assumes</i> that McCarthy was doing this to find actual spies and not for political gain.  An assumption which I do not at all credit McCarthy with.')
