Is it one and the same for all passwords? Then two broken passwords reveals it (if someone&#x27;s clever maybe even 1, not sure here). If it&#x27;s different for different passwords, you now need to memorize (or store elsewhere) a list of many, many such horcruxes. Not 7... but maybe a 100 or 200 to be practical for a heavy user of internet apps. Which basically means you need 2 password managers.<p>So where do I store the 100 horcruxes?\nWhat&#x27;s your take on this?')
