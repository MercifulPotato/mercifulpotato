The potential problem with that is that it forces me to always use the same IP for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicenames.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicenames.org</a> because a lot of domains will be tied to that IP. I could use a CNAME, of course, but that&#x27;s actually more complicated for the average user to set up than a straight forward (particularly because if you want to set up a CNAME for the naked domain (example.com), the way you do that differs from DNS provider to DNS provider (some places the feature is called ANAME, and some places it&#x27;s called something different), and some don&#x27;t offer that functionality at all.<p>Compared to that, forwards are very straight-forward (no pun intended) and are offered by virtually all registrars.')
