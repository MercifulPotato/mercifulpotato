It&#x27;s the same thing as Internet Explorer and all those toolbars that it&#x27;s now known for in meme history. Of course people would want a toolbar that lets them automatically search for coupons or whatever it is they want to be notified of. Do they know that the same toolbar is also injecting ads or collecting data and keystrokes? Probably not.<p>I agree with your sentiment 100% (and my issues may be addressed in your TED talk which I&#x27;m going to watch right now) but there needs to be some way to acknowledge what the consequences of those actions are and, for me, I think a technical barrier or entry is the only realistic way to do that. Anything simpler will be taken advantage of.')
