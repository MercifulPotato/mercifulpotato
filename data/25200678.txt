I&#x27;m just tired of seeing some of the points you made pop up in every Amazon topic.<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t had a prime subscription for over 2 years now because every time I order something its a 50&#x2F;50 that I will get a shitty ripoff from China.<p>Were you ordering expensive sneakers and purses regularly? You&#x27;d think if this was the experience of even a minor fraction of their customers (beyond the HN commenters who claim this is wide spread in every Amazon topic), they wouldn&#x27;t be breaking record sales every quarter.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t even scratching the surface on how they treat many of their employees. Who is working in an amazon warehouse right now and actually having a good time of it?<p>Who is doing manual labor of any form and having a good time of it? Amazon to their credit gave a minimum wage of 15 USD to these workers, often ahead of the states they&#x27;re located in, and the workers get full health care and benefits. I&#x27;m not saying they can&#x27;t be paid more or shouldn&#x27;t be paid more, but I&#x27;m going to acknowledge their agency. Over 800k of them picked Amazon over say Walmart or Costco or some other warehouse job.<p>&gt; Amazon could easily automate away many jobs they never wanted in the first place, but sacrificing lower-skilled humans do the last mile of messy pick &amp; place turns out to be more friendly to margins.<p>Companies hire people to do work if it&#x27;s profitable is the essence of this objection? There are complex systems that lead people to accepting these jobs -- America&#x27;s failing education system, the lack of upward mobility and opportunity for many citizens, lack of focus on trade &#x2F; manufacturing jobs in school, etc.. You take the easy route of blaming a corporation doing corporation things.')
