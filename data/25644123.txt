It&#x27;s been a long way since the beginning [1]. We started as a &quot;design to code&quot; tool where we tried to automate the process of design hand-off. We had hundreds of converted projects and worked with great customers like IDEO, Zillow or DocuSign. The problem was that customers weren&#x27;t coming back (even when we delivered the best code possible - we had human intervention to guarantee perfect outputted code).<p>We learned 3 points: 1) it&#x27;s technically extremely challenging to get 80%+ conversion accuracy for all designs consistently; 2) we don&#x27;t want to have a fixed cost (human validation) for every project delivered (we want to be 100% SaaS); 3) we don&#x27;t want to be discardable - after getting the code our customers had no motivation to stay on the platform.<p>At this point we started talking to our customers (mainly web agencies and SMB owners) about what would be the easiest way to publish websites [2]. Many startups have questioned this and built great tools to help solve the problem (Webflow, Squarespace, Wix, etc).<p>This seems like a solved problem, right?<p>It turns out people want something simpler... like the document tool they use everyday for virtually everything [3]. This was the moment we decided to focus 100% on a new tool: a Markdown editor to help you create a personal profile, a landing page to capture emails, or something a bit more elaborate. Fully responsive and free.<p>To be honest the product is still in an early stage. There are basic features that aren&#x27;t implemented (like version history, multi-page websites or collaboration).<p>Even at this stage I think this can help some people, so go ahead and check it out! [4].<p>We can now publish custom websites as easy as writing a blog post.<p>-----<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20624140<p>[2] I&#x27;m happy to discuss our pivot decision<p>[3] We interviewed 33 customers. By the way, I was amazed and completely surprised about this conclusion.<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zecoda.com&#x2F;')
