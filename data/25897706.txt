Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611534711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25896442, text='&gt; There are several definitions for Open Source that come from foundations and other groups<p>...and all of them do so because they really want to pretend that their software is &quot;open source&quot; without actually putting it under an open source license. Like, in the abstract I agree that it&#x27;s weird having the OSI (or any one group) define &quot;open source&quot;, but in this case I&#x27;m okay with it because every single &quot;alternative definition&quot; turns out to be someone just trying to pretend that their source-available software is &quot;open source&quot; for marketing reasons when it isn&#x27;t.')
