But they should not expect any more state support than any other commercial enterprise and they should be expected to bid on the open market for the resources (land, water, rail and road connections, etc.) that they need without relying on state guarantees for the power that is generated not for compulsory purchase orders when someone refuses to sell their house to make way for it.  And certainly the state should not be demolishing sites of special scientific interest in order to build nuclear, or any other, power stations.<p>The same, of course, should apply to wind and solar.')
