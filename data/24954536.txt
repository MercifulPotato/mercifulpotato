I once tried to create a Twitter account but unless you provide them your phone number the account just gets blocked straight away. You then have to give them your phone number anyway to unblock it. Since I didn&#x27;t want to give a random company my phone number I wanted to go to settings and remove the account completely since it was useless and I couldn&#x27;t even follow people using it. Long story short - the website will not allow you to do that despite GDPR laws. I even filed support tickets to have the account removed and the requests were denied &quot;because the account is inactive&quot;, in violation of my laws granted by the GDPR.')
