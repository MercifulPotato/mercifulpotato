Item(by='ricardobeat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606439612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25224220, text='Just bought a Ring device on a whim, so I can get notifications on my phone when I&#x27;m out of range of the doorbell. It arrived today. Spent quite some time wondering why it wouldn&#x27;t finish the setup or work at all... it gets literally stuck in a loading state when you press the doorbell button.<p>I 1) am appalled that connection loss is not dealt with correctly, and 2) did not expect it to stop functioning completely without internet as it does not require a cloud subscription.')
