Item(by='gwd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607362934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332683, text='+1 for induction stoves.  We gutted and redid a house a few years ago, and decided to go with induction primarily to avoid the complexity of running gas to where the new kitchen was.  No regrets.<p>Induction technology has come a long way; make sure to read reviews and get a stovetop that does &quot;simmering&quot; well.  Also make sure to think about the interface -- a lot of induction stoves require two steps to change the temperature (first click several times to choose the burner, then click several times to adjust the temperature up  or down).  We went with one that had a full range of buttons for each burner; only one press required for any one change.')
