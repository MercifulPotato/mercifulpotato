It provides a lot more tools to help you write correct code, and express invariants in a machine-checkable way. This means that they are maintained when the code changes, even when multiple contributors are involved. I&#x27;m must more confident in my ability to ship correct code in Rust and maintain that correctness over time.<p>Any reason for why Rust over Ada&#x2F;SPARK?')
