Generally, being incredulous of the way someone thinks isn&#x27;t a respectful way to engage with them (I&#x27;m sure most of us are guilty of it at times, but usually in frustration with people that we have a personal relationship with). If you&#x27;re going to ask someone something that might offend them, I would suggest starting with a show of goodwill.
