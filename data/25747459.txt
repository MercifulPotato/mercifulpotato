Requires some patience but I think it&#x27;s worth it. Also the emacs mode for beancount is superb.<p>The main advantage is it&#x27;s very flexible, you can track investments, bank accounts, credit cards, pensions and even abstract things like digital currency wallets (e.g. Playstation Network) or vacation time. I&#x27;ve even used it to track RSUs from employment etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beancount.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beancount.github.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beancount.github.io&#x2F;fava&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beancount.github.io&#x2F;fava&#x2F;</a>')
