Important speech got swept into the maw of the Facebook filter—and risky content, like self-harm, stayed up.</i><p><i>The lesson is clear. Facebook’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically. They may never get there.</i><p>Most technical people have guessed that Facebooks AI wasn&#x27;t actually any good. The non-technical world, like politicians, assumed that it was easy for Facebook to moderate. Facebooks magical AI could censor anything that governments deemed offensive. It turns out it can&#x27;t, but Facebooks has done nothing do inform the world that their AI is no good. Admittedly I guessed that it didn&#x27;t actually exists and was simply a keyword filter.')
