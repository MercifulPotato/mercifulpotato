I&#x27;ve always been one to &#x27;just deal with it&#x27; but after a few years of working through school and seeing my younger brothers go through the same thing with medication, I realized that I was essentially just handicapping myself.<p>Now I take medication in the morning before I get to work and it basically lasts me through the work&#x2F;school day.  When I was younger I was perscribed ritalin, and it just made me sleepy so I stopped taking it.  Now I take a more modern medication and it works wonders.  The negative stigma against medication really harmed me in school, and I wonder how different things would&#x27;ve been for me if I had started taking an effective medication at 16 and not at 25.')
