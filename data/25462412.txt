Item(by='apta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608252003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441099, text='&gt; was a time of higher taxes for the rich<p>Correlation vs. causation. The sources I&#x27;ve seen all have said that no one of the rich paid those high taxes, and the same will happen when Biden and his gang will attempt to increase taxes now. There will be loopholes and a million other things the rich can use to reduce taxes.<p>The problem lies elsewhere, but no one seems to discuss it. It&#x27;s not for no reason that Islam, Judaism, and Christianity prohibit lending money with interest. We look around us and see a debt heavy and debt ridden society, because it&#x27;s easy to lend money with interest. The modern usurious economic system is inherently going to favor the rich. Ban interest and other usurious immoral and parasitic practices (e.g. stock shorting) and things will improve quickly.')
