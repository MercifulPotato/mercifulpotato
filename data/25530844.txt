Just something that happened to me once:<p>I was leaving a hotel near the airport in Delhi, and as were waiting outside for an Uber the manager of the hotel told us not to be alarmed if we saw some guys with guns running towards the hotel. Told us the police were running a terrorism scenario to see how the local hotels would react, and whether they would follow the plan for such an event. The guns would be unloaded, but everything else would seem realistic. The manager and the outside security knew about it (because they had to let the “terrorists” into the hotel) but no other staff or guests had been warned. We were only told because we were outside and might see them coming and he didn’t want us to give the game away.<p>Fortunately our Uber arrived before the “terrorists”. It’s possible the manager was just fucking with us, and none of it happened, but it didn’t seem like it and if he was that’s a pretty messed-up thing to do, too. It occurred to us that if they were actual terrorists he might be in cahoots and making sure they got into the building.<p>He also told us how in a real event he told his outside security guys to run away, they couldn’t stop terrorists anyway, and there was no point getting themselves killed.')
