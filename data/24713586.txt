Things like the gRPC reflection, health checks, etc can all be instrumented in tooling with no guess work as to how to directly talk to any API that implements it. No guessing if it&#x27;s `GET &#x2F;healthz` or `GET &#x2F;healthcheck` etc.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of magic you can do with protos. At my current company we&#x27;re even generating forms&#x2F;UIs entirely off of proto message definitions for things like configs. Engineers no longer need to think about how to make something work cross language, manually wiring up a UI, etc.<p>I cant wait to see what doors this opens up for gRPC on the browser as that will bring many more OSS devs into the ecosystem.')
