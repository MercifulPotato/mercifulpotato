Most $1000+ road bikes have carbon frames.<p>Wholesale, a good quality no-nme Al frame is about $100, while an equivalent quality CF frame is about $250.<p>If you are using Shimano 105 or above level quality, a CF frame is a reasonable upgrade.<p>They do ride better than anything but the best Al frames since that can put more stiffness where required and less where bump absorbing is needed.<p>The rest of your comments just shows misunderstanding of the luxury market.
