Item(by='marta_morena_28', descendants=None, kids=[24822500], score=None, time=1603067257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822265, text='So what you are saying is that if we assumed that all particles, including light are magnetic, and everything that has a mass, emits a corresponding magnetic field with a strength relative to its mass, we could not form a similar theory of &quot;general magnetic relativity&quot; in which the frame of reference under magnetic fields would behave in a similar way it does for gravity?<p>That seems kinda odd. What exactly would provide this difference? How is magnetism different from gravity? Is it that gravity doesn&#x27;t have a mass, but magnetic fields do?')
