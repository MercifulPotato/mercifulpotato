A truly empowering experience. I was able to resolve spaghetti code that accounted for 75% of business logic (not all bad paths handled, or good ones either really) and “worked” 90% of the time (certain transitions in certain states not implemented) into a state machine that accounts for all cases and actually works. Without the state machine, complexity seemed to scale exponentially. With the state machine, complexity scales linearly.<p>Since then I’ve thought I’m not sure how I could adopt a UI system without a state charts implementation. Most user interactions aren’t that complicated, but some can be, and really do need to be resolved into state machines unless you are an expert spaghetti developer.<p>So, very glad to see this and hope to see more and more implementations.')
