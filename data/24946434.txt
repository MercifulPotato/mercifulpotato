Not so easy to do, right? Same thing with people who get harassed all the time: It&#x27;s not so easy for them to complain and have anyone take them seriously. Are CoCs perfect? Absolutely not. But allowing decades of harassment to continue unfettered until the most perfect solution is found, is not going to work, either. Of course, the people who hate CoCs don&#x27;t think there have been decades of harassment. Or, if they even acknowledge harassment, they probably believe it is the victim&#x27;s fault in the first place, or the victim&#x27;s fault for not speaking up. I don&#x27;t think minds are going to change either way. Just one more thing in our increasingly polarized world, that tech is actually making worse, not better. (Oh, so many subjective comments here -- how did I do capturing them?)')
