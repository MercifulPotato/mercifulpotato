However these were all for existing viruses (Sars, bird flu), and it didn&#x27;t spark much controversy. Mostly because the external impacts were low. The impacts were low because they were identified in the community and isolated etc in time.  I doubt it was an accidental leak but if it was then it doesn&#x27;t follow how how labs have dealt with leaks before.<p>Leaks have happened in other countries too but I don&#x27;t the consequences.')
