Item(by='radford-neal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610152180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692663, text='&quot;Political speech is practically always incitement to violence&quot;.<p>Yes, but also for a somewhat different reason than you give.<p>What happens when a party gets elected, has control all the levers of government for the next four years, and enacts a law that some people object to?  Well, the objectors may march around the legislature chanting &quot;we won&#x27;t stand for this!&quot;.  What could they mean, since they have no power to do anything until at least the next election?<p>Such protests happen frequently, by people of all ideologies.  Implicit in these protests is the idea that even when a party has control of all parts of government, they still are sensitive to public opinion, just as absolute monarchs are, since there is always the possibility that the people will revolt - either violently, or by lower-level forms of civil disobedience.<p>One major justification for democracy is that it minimizes the chance of civil war, by having the election result mimic the result of a civil war (in which numbers on each side presumably count for a lot), at far less cost. But sensible democratically-elected leaders realize that an election victory does not perfectly mimic the result of civil war (or of less violent forms of struggle), and that even if it did, it may be that their opponents will not judge their chances of success realistically.')
