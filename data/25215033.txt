I live in Mexico City, it&#x27;s basically never hot here. That game was on June 22, and according to WolframAlpha that day had a high of 15C. I don&#x27;t know if that data is accurate, but I can tell you a high of 15C in June is plausible. Even if Wolfram&#x27;s data is sketchy, I&#x27;d bet the high temperature on that day was somewhere between 15C and 25C.')
