That seems pretty &#x27;newspeak&#x27; to me.<p>They are making it so that anyone can post anything unless it&#x27;s literally against the laws.<p>And somehow this is &#x27;authoritarian&#x27; or &#x27;dicature&#x27;?<p>Because it seems just the opposite.<p>My point was, they&#x27;re going to put the EU in an awkward position with this - just as you&#x27;ve put yourself in a little bit of an awkward position by trying to imply that &#x27;freedom of expression&#x27; is &#x27;dictature&#x27;.<p>Now - I don&#x27;t really like these guys one bit - but - the law seems at least superficially very reasonable.<p>We&#x27;re all super suspicious because this came from &#x27;the bad guys&#x27; - fair enough, but it is what it is.')
