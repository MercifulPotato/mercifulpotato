What sort of future are tesla bull envisioning, that is not already priced into the stock? A world in which tesla dominates the car and energy market? How how potential growth is there that justifies it going up so much?<p>This is not like the 90s tech bubble, in which stocks quickly fizzed, such as Microsoft, InfoSpace, Oracle, MicroStrategy,  or Cisco, but tesla&#x27;s gains are much bigger percentage-wise and will hold, whereas 90s tech stocks lost 90% of their value by 2003. I do not foresee a similar collapse for Tesla.  Tesla def. seems to have something special going for it.  Maybe tesla is the company laying the infrastructure for our future  intergalactic type 3 civilization, in which case its potential value is as limitless as humanity.  Same for Amazon, which many also in 2010-2016 also predicted would crash but never did.')
