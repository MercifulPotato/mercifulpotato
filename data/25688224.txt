(which seems scary to me)<p>Agreed - though I find it&#x27;s more of a headache than scary. On end, I don&#x27;t like the fact that increasingly internet infrastructure is acting as a <i>de facto</i> judge in deciding what speech is and isn&#x27;t allowed. I empathize with both parties. ISPs don&#x27;t want to host speech they feel is abhorrent, and I&#x27;d probably do the same thing were I in their position.<p>I&#x27;m much more accepting of platforms like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, et. al. taking down groups and banning members than I am of infrastructure providers doing the same. The former kicks people off of large communities, but people can still put together their own websites. When it gets the the point that I might not even be able to serve plain HTML that I wrote myself, because nobody will even let it go through the wires that&#x27;s when I start thinking utility regulation in ISPs, DNS, etc. is necessary.<p>Cloudflare&#x27;s CEO was very humble when taking down sites.
