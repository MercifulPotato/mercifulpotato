Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607528128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358268, text='I looked for, and didn&#x27;t see, &quot;SSD&quot; in this article (let alone &quot;NVMe&quot;). Maybe because it&#x27;s from 2015? But at any rate, I&#x27;m not sure the logic applies there. High performance SSDs remain much more expensive, so losing major capacity is a much costlier issue, and simultaneously they rebuild vastly faster. I thought about this when making a pool out of U.2 NVMe drives, and with rebuild times measured in minutes and given the cost&#x2F;GB I think RAIDZ2 (or even Z1) vdevs are plenty sufficient for most use cases.<p>By the same token, what does the backup system and unique pool data lifetime look like? If someone is using a very fast&#x2F;smaller&#x2F;expensive pool as a local working space, but it&#x27;s constantly being replicated to a much more heavily redundant pool of spinning rust in turn backing up sufficiently fast to remote, it may be perfectly acceptable to have minimal redundancy (I still like being able to heal from corruption) in the working pool. If the whole thing going kaput only means losing a few minutes of data it&#x27;s totally reasonable to consider how much money that&#x27;s actually worth.<p>I guess a lot of the blanket advice for ZFS rubs me the wrong way. It&#x27;s offers a very powerful toolbox full of options that are genuinely great in different circumstances, and there aren&#x27;t many footguns (dedup being the biggest one that immediately comes to mind) that are hard to reason about. It&#x27;s a shame if users aren&#x27;t considering there own budgets, needs, hardware, and so on and taking advantage of it to get the most out of them.')
