Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older than last time I cared about something this much, but this time I really don&#x27;t have a solution that&#x27;s consistent with any ideology that I have. For most of my adult life, I&#x27;ve leaned towards libertarian. I don&#x27;t see the free market solving this one very well. I&#x27;m also skeptical of a government-sponsored ministry of truth, though. I&#x27;m at a loss for how to &quot;fix&quot; the effects of social media without causing far more damage with censorship. The closest stop-gap sort of damage control I can think of is to do everything possible to remove any barriers in the way of enabling private citizens to sue for damages when social media companies publish harmful material.')
