I will vaccinate my children, partly to protect them (though the risk to them is low, as you say), but mostly to protect me and my wife, and more importantly our elderly parents.  None of the vaccines are 100% effective, and if I can reduce the chances of my kids bringing Covid into the family, I will.<p>By the time the vaccine is available for my kids, hundreds of millions of people will have already been vaccinated, and there will be <i>very</i> extensive safety data.  Part of the requirements for emergency use authorization is extensive monitoring of safety, so if there&#x27;s any problem with one particular vaccine, it will be known by then.')
