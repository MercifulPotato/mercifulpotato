The vague, open ended nature of &quot;support&quot; means it ends up being an unsatisfactory experience. When the only people who need support are the in-house devops team, it&#x27;s a lot easier.<p>Unfortunately there don&#x27;t seem to be good solutions for this. If users aren&#x27;t given choices, they may leave or never turn up at all, but once that pain is over they won&#x27;t be unhappy again (unless you have a major outage). Give them choices and when things blow up they&#x27;ll become an angry unhappy customer with a support contract, which is every businesses worst nightmare.')
