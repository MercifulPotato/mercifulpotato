More specifically though, in the particular system we&#x27;re talking about, gasoline flowing through the main nozzle (which has the same diameter up to the exit) has essentially the same pressure as the ambient pressure. There is an obstruction downstream past the nozzle known as the &quot;splash&quot; which is responsible for bringing the liquid&#x27;s velocity to zero.<p>The linked article invoked the Bernoulli effect to compare the pressure of the pumped gasoline in the pipe to the pressure of the ambient air; the Bernoulli effect is based on conservation of energy and does not apply here because the pumped fuel is not magically transforming into ambient air in an energy conserved way.')
