There is just too much other interesting stuff to read on a daily basis. If Twitter doesn&#x27;t remove this crap and decides to show it to me (because having an audience is a constitutionally protected right or something) I&#x27;m leaving Twitter and going somewhere else.<p>Censorship is a competitive advantage.')
