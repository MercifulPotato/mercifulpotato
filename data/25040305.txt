But the argument that you’re making is a circular one. I have attempted to demonstrate how prima facie “corporate R&amp;D” is often product development, process improvement, or other marginal improvements to preexisting technologies.<p>For example, Apple invests in metallurgy, it has the world’s largest private metallurgical lab, but Apple isn’t seeking to create metamaterials but rather to gain marginal improvements in glass manufacturing.<p>These improvements matter, but they aren’t the ones that drive our technology forward. Iterating on better compound bows wouldn’t have led to gun powder.<p>The places where Apple buys corporate bonds and assets from use those assets not to research breakthrough, but rather fund their growth. This money goes into advertising and other more mundane activities. This does not diminish the value of these activities, but it is a simple statement that humans can’t progress if we keep our gaze focused on such narrow gains.<p>AFAICT, no private or publicly traded corporation has created and ran a particle accelerator to investigate new principles of physics and improve our models of reality.<p>Why not? Because the ROI for that wouldn’t accrue to the discoverer, but rather some future generation. The aristocracy i.e. the feudal form of government + tax collection, the Duke of Devonshire, funded the creation of the Cavendish Laboratory, which funded J.J. Thompson’s discovery of the electron.<p>The Cavendish Lab revolutionized our understanding of matter before the start of the 20th century, and laid the theoretical foundations for the electronics revolution to come.<p>Where is today’s corporate equivalent?')
