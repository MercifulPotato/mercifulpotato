Rather than the empirically-minded who start with cases, and abduce to provisional principles from those.<p>To a aximoatic mind: when a universal principle is violated, the situation is declared Bad.<p>To the case-base mind: when a tolerable situation seems to violate a principle, declare the principle Inapplicable.<p>Of course both types of thought are helpful in different contexts, I suspect &#x27;the management of one&#x27;s life, day to day&#x27; however, <i>should</i> be a matter of case-base reasoning to rough principle.')
