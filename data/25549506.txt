The default cache size is tiny.<p>With a bit of tuning you can get quite decent performance out of SQLite while still having full ACID guarantees, or very good performance for cases where you can compromise on the ACID stuff.<p>I have not yet found a situation where nosql databases like leveldb offer an orders of magnitude advantage over SQLite, and SQLite is so much more powerful and robust...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;file-consistency&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;file-consistency&#x2F;</a>')
