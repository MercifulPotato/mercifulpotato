My plan is to go to the hospital and then declare bankruptcy and hope I don&#x27;t need to go to the hospital again for another 7 years. I deliberately make lifestyle changes to avoid hospitalization. I don&#x27;t ride bicycles or motorcycles. I don&#x27;t play sports. I don&#x27;t do manual labor or work with saws. I don&#x27;t drive at night (not sure if this is any real difference but it makes me feel safer).<p>This is the life I have in capitalist America. I&#x27;m afraid to do basic things like ride a bicycle in fear of it financially crippling me to the point that I&#x27;m incapable of paying rent and becoming homeless')
