If something does not require headsup&#x2F;asap level of attention, I better send it with no sound, as if it was email in old days.<p>Still it is not convenient to hold onto a send button to do that. I wish messengers operated noiseless by default and had a special “ding” button to request attention. It could even be used alone, just to remind your peer that they are blocking the important process and it would be nice to see an update on ETA.')
