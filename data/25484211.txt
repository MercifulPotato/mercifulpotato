He&#x27;s an impressively intense alcoholic, impressive enough to keep up with other epic friends.<p>For an anarchist, he&#x27;s fond of sic&#x27;ing the cops on people. His most infamous stunt was trying to burn down the apartment of some political enemies of his in the 80s, with them in it. Yeah, quite a guy.<p>He&#x27;s a clever writer, if not too deep. His writings are a mishmash of anarchist, primitivist, situationist and whatnot. A lot of his humor is taken from Groucho Marx. Good stuff but still better the first time.')
