Item(by='masswerk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605784474, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148263, text='&gt; These are all examples you can get used to.<p>Actually, no. All these examples are about orientation and how the UI paradigms integrate with the human neural physis. This isn&#x27;t simply changeable by accustomization. E.g., if the primary structure of the visual field breaks (like the one given by the primary horizontal contours), our brain blocks for a full situational update (which takes about 0.2 secs). Similarly, visual orientation is considerably faster than reading lists. Identifying a colored dot on the screen chips just a single bit from your stack of working memory. Aiming at an invisible point target is difficult and requires extra attention. This isn&#x27;t subject to negotiation, it&#x27;s just how we are wired.<p>Edit, another perspective on this: Toys tend to be robust and to grab as much attention as possible. Professional tools, on the other hand, are sometimes delicate, you should know what you&#x27;re doing, and they are also highly optimized to facilitate a trade and not to get in its way. From this perspective, Big Sur progresses on the toy scale. This is good news for a media house that uses this contraption as the primary outlet, but it may be bad news for those who use it as professional tool.')
