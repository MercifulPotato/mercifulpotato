Item(by='jldugger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605853920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147434, text='Goldeneye had a Turok-style control option that I largely used: move with the arrow keys, aim with the stick, trigger to shoot, shoulder to aim.  Circle strafing is simple, as is aiming up or down. Goldeneye&#x27;s shoulder aim allowed players more precision, at a cost of mobility, which has a certain logic to it.<p>Overall it&#x27;s fairly similar to Halo, without the extra buttons for crouch, jump, grenade, or melee. Halo&#x27;s golden triangle would be functionally dead without them. But... the pro controllers exist for a reason -- you can&#x27;t use a fleet of thumb buttons on the controller face if your left and right thumbs are dedicated to moving and looking.')
