Look at how our lives have changed (or not) during the COVID pandemic. Look at the recent debate between 2020 POTUS candidates. We don&#x27;t <i>DO</i> shared norms in the way that would be required to make true&#x2F;complete&#x2F;meaningful privacy a reality.<p>My expectation is that if it&#x27;s on the Internet, if it&#x27;s outside, if it&#x27;s in a crowd... it&#x27;s public (or can be made public). Everything you express can be observed and used, and that sucks. Does that have a chilling effect? Of course!')
