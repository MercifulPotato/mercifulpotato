(ie if you change a 1&#x2F;2 note to a 1&#x2F;4 note, you will be left with an extra 1&#x2F;4 rest with no way of removing it.)<p>I wonder if there is a music notation woftware which allows you to just enter all the notes first, then you can go back and edit the duration- then it will calculate the measures for you.')
