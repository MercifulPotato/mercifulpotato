In this conentious sub-thread, you addressed the root of my comment directly without adding to the outrage, which is much appreciated.<p><i>you would probably benefit from having black perspectives. Otherwise you convey an undertone that outcomes for blacks are for white people to choose. The message we want to teach kids is deeper than racism is bad.</i><p>Counterargument to this: we all have a certain extent of power and influence on those around us. The target demographic for these books is to teach people who aren&#x27;t discriminated against about racism. Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to show a story about a display of personal power and influence to make the world a better place? The outcomes of blacks, whites, and everyone else depends on how we all influence each other, not just how we influence ourselves.')
