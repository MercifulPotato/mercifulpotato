This is one of the hottest topics in astronomy right now. They&#x27;re just not interested in idle speculation about whether or not Oumuamua is a light sail. If there were some measurement that could be done to learn more about Oumuamua, then astronomers would do it, but it&#x27;s a tiny object that&#x27;s quite far away now. Most astronomers simply believe that the most likely explanation for the anomalous acceleration is that there was some undetected outgassing from the rock. That&#x27;s much more plausible than the idea that <i>this one particular object</i> is an alien spaceship - not because there couldn&#x27;t be alien spaceships somewhere out there, but because there are so many rocks floating around in space.<p>The one thing that you really can&#x27;t get funding for is SETI, but that&#x27;s not the fault of astronomers. That&#x27;s the fault of congresspeople who ridiculed the search for &quot;little green men&quot; in the 1990s and barred NASA from funding it. Almost all astronomy funding comes from governments, so a government ban on funding a particular line of research means that that research basically won&#x27;t happen.')
