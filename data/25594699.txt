Project Eddystone allowed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to advertise short urls, that the user could see about them as they moved. primarily used by stores &amp; spammers, this sort of immediate real world linking, to me, is something people &amp; individuals have the best chance to connect &amp; share their world through: a directly advertised link anyone around them can see.<p>third, last, i really hope the semantic web comes about. i want us to begin to interact with the page as more than a giant canvas, a single entity. the data of the page ought express itself. we ought develop tools to surface &amp; interact with data, in-place, where it is encountered.')
