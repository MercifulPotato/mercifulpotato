Are there legitimate positive usecases, either currently or more likely usecases we may never find out about because of bans like this?<p>One answer to the question is that this is a benefit of federalism. Small states (as opposed to a large country) can experiment and other states can learn from it, whether it&#x27;s a disaster or not. Just like Oregon decriminalizing hard drugs.<p>The other side of this is the problem of how outright prohibitions often stick around for far longer than they should, even with plenty of evidence of it being more harmful than good (drug war being the obvious one but there&#x27;s plenty of harmful regulations written in prior eras where it doesn&#x27;t make sense).<p>Again this is where federalism and smaller states may help because it&#x27;s easier to change the law than end the drug war and all the entrenched interests.<p>If it was a federal level ban I would be angry about the implications for sure. Now I&#x27;m skeptical but also don&#x27;t really care because I don&#x27;t know of any positive uses but I do know my local police here in Toronto are already using facial recognition and it scares the shit out of me.<p>But maaaybe something like in prisons it could be helpful. IDK, much about the subject.')
