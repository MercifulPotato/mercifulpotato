Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[24916088], score=None, time=1603863535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914828, text='&gt; What percentage of coders do programming on a turing tape? Is this partial evidence that turing tapes are trash? Does that question even make sense?<p>Yes it is. Turing machine models are very limited, and a programme to let us achieve the things we can do with Turing machines (mainly runtime analysis) with a better model (i.e. a lambda-calculus style model) is a very good idea.<p>&gt; The thing is, almost all of pure math is itself is a bridge between different areas of math. Some of these areas are bridged by category theory, some are bridged by other kinds of math, which have less catchy names.<p>I&#x27;d be equally interested in a programme of doing metamathematics in some non-category-theoretic model that was still &quot;normal&quot; mathematics in the same way that category theory is (and ZFC isn&#x27;t). But I&#x27;m not aware of any such competing effort.')
