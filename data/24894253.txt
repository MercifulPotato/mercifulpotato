Item(by='sigmaprimus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603704239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893536, text='UBI is not the answer any more than the work houses were in the 1800s.<p>Universal health care or a socialized medical system might work along with government supported food banks, housing and education as all of these can be deemed human rights to some degree. Personal wealth or income will never be a human right for very long before the state twists it into a privilege or entitlement that can be taken away from those who do not toe the line.<p>UBI sounds like a good idea until you consider the eventual consequences of such a scheme. I&#x27;m not just talking about the lazy people that won&#x27;t want to work but more the furthering of peoples dependance on the state, and the widening of the class divide for even those that do work hard.<p>The only system that historically has worked is a cyclical system of accumulation of power and wealth then a revolutionary redistribution of the power and wealth typically occuring in the late stages of a capitalist like society, and the only question is which side of the torches and pitch forks do you want to be on?<p>Finally I take great offence to the parsitic attitude that any wealth I procure for my heirs is &quot;unearned&quot; and that it should be taxed or taken then divided among a society&#x27;s people when I am dead.<p>It is not a racist or classist attitude to believe in working hard and saving to provide for my childrens&#x27; and grandchildrens&#x27; future. On the other hand, people who breed like rabbits, live above their means, wasting time and money on drugs and alcohol, vacations, fancy cell phones, video games and the like, all the while accumulating bad debt and then eventually becoming wards of the state who whine about how unfair the world is because they didn&#x27;t prepare for their future or hard times are nothing more than a burden on the people who did work hard, save and prepare.')
