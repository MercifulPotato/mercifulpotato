I guess those aren&#x27;t included in the &#x27;laterality quotient.&#x27;<p>I had always assumed that novel skills could be learned however you were first instructed (left or right), but that writing had some intrinsic property that involves a preference from an early age, maybe because a young child is given crayons to play with before they formally learn to &#x27;write&#x27;, so they&#x27;re not given instruction in that per-se and their natural preference dominates. That fetal orientation hypothesis seems like kind of the same deal.<p>I&#x27;ve cut myself from goofing around with knives plenty of times, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand why you would attribute cutting yourself to &#x27;handedness&#x27; instead of chalking it up to a simple lapse in attention. That anecdote seems strange. The author wasn&#x27;t paying attention so they didn&#x27;t notice they were holding a knife backwards. Maybe I&#x27;m missing some concept that someone else can explain?<p>For all those super-smart famous lefties, I&#x27;m one too, so it certainly isn&#x27;t some marker for creative genius, that&#x27;s for sure.')
