It limits out-of-pocket expenses for any fraud to $50.<p>In practical terms, you notify your credit card company and they just remove the charge and there is no cost and very little hassle or drama.<p>A similar situation is probably car insurance and car theft.<p>I think because we have car insurance, we probably have higher levels of car theft.  It has probably become sort of decriminalized because the harm is likely less and the insurance companies treat it as a cost of doing business.<p>Meanwhile 200 years ago horse thieves, who were probably not caught, did real damage to people even though the penalties of being caught was probably hanging.')
