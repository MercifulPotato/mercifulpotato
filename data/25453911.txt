I remember that HEPA requires a considerable pressure difference which cannot be delivered by an axial fan. You&#x27;d need a radial one which can deliver a considerable differential pressure, at cost of throughput (where the axial fan shine). If you strap a HEPA to an axial fan and seal it, the fan runs effectively &quot;empty&quot;, i.e. it displaces only little air which most likely even doesn&#x27;t pass the filter. That&#x27;s why HEPA filters work in vacuum cleaners since they have radial fans. I am astounded by the results of the post.<p>I tested simply with a laser. In a normal room you can see the laser beam in dark. If you have a good purifier, you can&#x27;t.')
