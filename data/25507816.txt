Besides, dedicated server is an unfortunate term in practice either; I may pay Hetzner for a bunch of dedicated servers, some run a bunch of VMs, some run Kafka without a virtualization layer. My services in containers on Kubernetes in VMs on dedicated servers are still running on dedicated servers, but definitely not what I&#x27;d call bare metal. In my experience, calling the Kafka server &quot;bare metal&quot; is understood by everyone, used by pretty much everyone I&#x27;ve come across and doesn&#x27;t get mixed up with adjacent concepts so easily. Maybe that&#x27;s different in niche&#x2F;research circles where &quot;bare machine&quot; is a concept that&#x27;s actually relevant in day-to-day work, I wouldn&#x27;t know. As far as I&#x27;m aware, the term is very much alive and kicking.')
