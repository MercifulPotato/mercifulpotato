The problem of course is that no form of government can be applied correctly due to human greed and corruption, which would thus make libertarianism a terrible choice.<p>For example, without regulatory agencies, consumers would have to rely on publications such as Consumer Reports to determine which products&#x2F;services are free of dangerous defects, etc.<p>The problem is information overload and the lack of critical thinking skills among the general population.  Just look at the ridiculous things large swaths of the population believes today, even though we have more access to information than ever.  What I&#x27;m saying is it would be very easy to game the system in a libertarian society.<p>Therefore, the best form of government in the real world may be a benevolent dictatorship.')
