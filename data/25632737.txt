For most workers, you&#x27;re right that a union will probably increase wages.  But for me, it will do the opposite.  In most jobs I have worked, I ended up paid significantly more than counterparts in the same job.  I usually was better at my job and put in more hours, so this was warranted.  And for promotions, I don&#x27;t see how this is wrong: most every union of which I&#x27;m aware ends using seniority as a factor in promotions, which I generally resent.<p>I never liked the mandatory nature of unions, either.  If they&#x27;re that good for workers, quit trying to force the whole company to join.  I also hate the idea of being forced to strike.<p>As far as my interests are concerned, a union would end up taking money and promotions from me and giving it to others.  So, I will always vote against them.  If one shows up at my workplace, I will probably move because someone else offers better terms of employment.')
