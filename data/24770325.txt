There were large screen Android phones that were running 60fps in Geekbench before Apple, so clearly the GPU performance and density existed and was shipping.<p>Apple actively advertised (real print ad campaigns) AGAINST large screen phones, they said they were un-ergonomic and too large of a form factor to hold and use single handed. The company had a real psychological opposition resisting large screen phones and gave non-technical justifications for their opposition.<p>Simultaneously, Steve Jobs attacked mini-tablets, claiming &quot;7â€³ tablets should come with sandpaper, so users can file down their fingers&quot;<p>So let&#x27;s just be clear here: Apple creates a PR narrative that something sucks unless they do it, even if that thing <i>categorically sucks</i> (non-one-handed-use-phones, mini tablets).  Specs don&#x27;t matter when Apple devices consistently had inferior performance, and now that Apple Silicon leads, of course specs are front and center.<p>What&#x27;s happened is, after they ship, they ret-con the reasons why it took so long, in order to provide an excuse that they had <i>misjudged the market</i>, that Steve Jobs had been wrong in his intuition about big phones and small tablets.')
