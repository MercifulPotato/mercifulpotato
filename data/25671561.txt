Can you live without electricity? Sure, if you are willing to severely decrease your quality of life.<p>Your ISP analogy is again flawed while the OPs&#x27; is reasonably relevant. A social communication app has a critical part to being relevant to use - the social part. It&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem because if people don&#x27;t use Signal or Telegram or wall, the app serves no useful purpose. The mere existence of a choice does not mean that all choices are equally useful or even relevant.<p>This argument of &quot;you&#x27;re lazy&quot; is (ironically) incredibly lazy and often results in software that is unreasonably hard to use - again, an analogy that i hope folks here would understand. Whatsapp works, is simple to use and has sufficient users to be critical infrastructure. Using &quot;laziness&quot; is a cop out. If something isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.')
