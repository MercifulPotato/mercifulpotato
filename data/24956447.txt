Why would a router consider a packet to be a legitimate SIP REGISTER when it occurs as part of a TCP connection which has already carried an HTTP header?<p>Is the story here that ALG is a crude hack, which works by naively looking at each packet, without trying to parse the whole stream, and so is vulnerable to this kind of confusion? If so, there are presumably endless varieties of ways to fool it.')
