I would (naively) think it&#x27;s ~$5&#x2F;month for a DigitalOcean droplet (adjust for your preferred hosting service) and maybe a bit more if you want a domain name (probably, if it&#x27;s for non-technical family). But I haven&#x27;t looked into it in much depth myself. Still a great goal, though, and I&#x27;d like to do the same at some point.')
