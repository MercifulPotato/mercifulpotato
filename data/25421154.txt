Ride took roughly 10 hours. 6 seats cabine, with people leaving and boarding a couple of times. Never again.<p>Love the concept. But execution needs to be premium (cabine &#x2F; bed for myself, pleasent looking interior) and cheaper than alternatives. Otherwise plane or car are the superior options.<p>Really hoping this will work out well.')
