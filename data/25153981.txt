I just don&#x27;t buy it.  We just saw a press conference an hour ago by the executive office of the most powerful nation in the world allege with a straight face that the recent election was tainted by Canadian election machines running malicious software written by Venezuela, Cuba, &quot;likely&quot; China, and directed by George Soros and (from the grave -- I swear I&#x27;m not making this up) Hugo Chavez.

It&#x27;s just a lie.  It&#x27;s a lie that (1) is tempting for people to believe and (2) that someone is willing to tell.<p>The internet didn&#x27;t make our brains more susceptible to fake news.
