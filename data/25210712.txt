Item(by='forgotmypw17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606320593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206545, text='You claim to agree that accessibility is important in the first sentence, but after that you say everything against that. Accessibility is not just about screenreaders. It is allowing ACCESS to anyone, whether they are vision impaired, hearing impaired, have a slow or older device, slow Internet connection, unable to process long chunks of text, or even unable to read very well.<p>Before I address the rest of your argument, please explain what makes it so difficult to make an app work in IE4.<p>You are the one who added the word &quot;complex&quot;, I never claimed such a thing. I claimed a reasonably functional website, and I stand by my claim that making it work in IE4 is not that difficult.<p>IE3 is a different beast, but it&#x27;s still possible. I find it worth supporting for its beautiful toolbar.<p>You&#x27;re right, golf carts are not supported on highways, but I sometimes see them on major roads, and they do just fine as long as they stay out of the way. Also I see tractors and excavators occasionally scurry across short distances.<p>A Model T is grandfathered in and allowed, and so is a 1940s Buick. There is no reason to disallow them, and there is no reason to disallow IE6, for example, which still has a small install base, except developer incompetence, in my opinion.<p>I did not claim something like Figma should work in all browsers, but I do claim that something like a forum for basic chat should. You are moving the goal posts, and I don&#x27;t appreciate it.<p>Nor do I recall rejecting web apps altogether, where did I ever say that? A web app is just a website with additional functionality, and can work well across many different browsers with progressive enhancement.')
