Around 2000 - 2001, on RedHat 6 or 7.something Sun&#x27;s 1.2 JVM was basically unusable: slow and extremely buggy. IBM&#x27;s JVM (HotJava? - it&#x27;s all so long ago I can&#x27;t remember what it was called) was much better: it was a bit faster and it didn&#x27;t fall over for a pasttime. The 1.3 releases were better but still not much to shout about. I can&#x27;t remember whether the 1.3 Sun JVMs were good enough to allow us to run our software with them at the time.<p>(Topically, at around this time, we were targeting Solaris 6.x and 7.x based systems.)')
