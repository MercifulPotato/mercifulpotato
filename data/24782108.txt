What about basic human decency where a child is being vilified and called a racist without any form of actual verification? Don&#x27;t you down-voters have any shame in siding with these news outlets that are in it just for money and nothing else? They have zero moral compass and would readily use a child for their 15 seconds of viral content. Yet you down-voters support them! So blinded by ignorance! Unbelievable!')
