I took 4 weeks instead of the two I estimated.<p>The customer loved it, it met all the requirements... and was totally impractical as a system. I spent the next year rewriting it in a fairly agile manner working for the Russ, Assistant Plant Manager. He taught me how to make user friendly software in a simple manner... we would pull a person from the plant and say something like<p>&quot;This is Mike... he wrote this program.  [Worker Name], I don&#x27;t expect you to be a computer expert, it&#x27;s not your job... I want you to do X,Y and Z... If something goes wrong, it&#x27;s Mike&#x27;s fault&quot;<p>&quot;Press F1 for Help&quot; was ALWAYS at the top of the screen after the first 5 seconds of the first user trying things and not knowing what to do. I learned an amazing amount about writing software from Russ.<p>One time... he asked &quot;what would happen if I disconnected it right now?&quot;  I didn&#x27;t know, and said so.... I got that taken care of in the next week. You could disconnect at any time, and never lose a record.<p>It was a fun job.')
