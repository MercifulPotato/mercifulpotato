Engineering gets put into the wrong efforts, and cost, efficiency, and repair-ability are all damaged.<p>Modern lcd screens seem to be the worst of this. The screen itself is quite thin, but then the base, and the cables coming out the back mean it’s still effectively 3-7 inches “thick.” The thinness accomplishes nothing, and has made the device worse.')
