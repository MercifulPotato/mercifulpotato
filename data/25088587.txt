What kind of communities do I wish to be part of, and what sort of behavior is required from the members of those communities to maintain the tone that I&#x27;d like to see?&quot;  Then hold yourself to it, and actively seek out communities where the members interact in the ways that you&#x27;d like to be a part of.<p>When you&#x27;ve made a mistake or someone claims you have made a mistake, step back outside yourself and look at your behavior dispassionately.  If you don&#x27;t meet the standards you&#x27;ve held for yourself, then apologize and make things right.  But if after really separating yourself from the situating and thinking about it, you still feel like you acted correctly - stand your ground and don&#x27;t engage.  Or explain why you did what you did and what the consequences would be otherwise.<p>Or if all else fails, give one of those evasive &quot;I&#x27;m sorry you feel the way you do&quot; non-apologies and move on, like corporations do all the time.  This is really a form of boundary-setting, and basically means &quot;I find your needs to be not worth my time and energy, so I will extricate myself from this relationship in as inoffensive a way as I can and devote no further energy to engaging with you.&quot;')
