Since the insurance company was paying most of it, aside from my copay &#x2F; share of cost, they were motivated to provide me a little transparency.<p>To be honest, as a patient, I would have preferred to get the MRI at the hospital; their facility was nicer, cleaner, more modern, and there was better data integration for getting the results to my neurosurgeon and keeping them as part of my holistic medical record. Nonetheless, I went to the cheaper provider.')
