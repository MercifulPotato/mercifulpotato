L2 was available for Pentiums, so it basically trickled to the consumer market.<p>These caches were small: misses were more likely, so optimizing for locality was super important.<p>I remember hearing that same talk in the 1990&#x27;s: you don&#x27;t want linked lists: think of the pointer chasing and cache misses, and the storage overhead for the pointers that wastes your precious little cache space (8K in an 80486).<p>&gt; <i>With regular strings, scanning or copying a string is in order memory access which will take advantage of pre-fetching of the cache.</i><p>The point of ropes is to handle very long strings. Scanning a long string, many kilobytes or even megabytes long, is not a simple memory access, though. If you have to copy the entire tail of the flat string to insert a character, but a rope does not, the rope can win in that case. See the motivating statements in the paper: <i>&quot;Common string operations should scale to long strings. There should be nopractical bound on the length of strings. Performance should remain acceptable for long strings.&quot;</i><p>There are various trade-off levels possible in ropes depending on the chunk sizes: a rope can have a small number of large pieces or a large number of small ones.<p>I suspect why ropes are perhaps not popular is that people don&#x27;t care that much about the utmost performance in string processing.  A performance hiccup in some string processing isn&#x27;t going to make video skip, a game framerate lag, or a CNC cutter spoil a piece. A lot of text processing is batch processing, or else non-real-time interactive (like in a text editor). Moreover, the cases where ropes are useful (huge strings) are a niche within text processing. People often don&#x27;t have long strings so they don&#x27;t feel the sting of bad performance.')
