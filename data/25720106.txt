Before impeachment vote. Pelosi asked the military to ignore commands from Trump. They turned her down. So that tells me they are on his side. But this act is in itself sedition. Media speaks almost in one voice now, \njoined by big tech. I don&#x27;t think Trump would accept beig barred from running in 2024.
