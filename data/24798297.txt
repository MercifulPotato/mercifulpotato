(One of the major issues cited by people for why they switched their opinion on same-sex marriage was knowing people in committed same-sex relationships. Social media makes those things more visible.)<p>As to right-wing populism: it is not fascism, any more than left-wing populism is Jacobinism or anarchy. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a &quot;good thing&quot; necessarily, but predictable and possibly necessary. I think Boris Johnson, for example, is absolutely what the U.K. needed, before it got swallowed up by the EU.')
