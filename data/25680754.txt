So let&#x27;s unpack here.<p>The only cheaper energy source (that include pilotability) would be nuclear. Its not as portable, but it exist. Fission is limited (not really, but minerals will be expensive to mine after a while).<p>So We have Fusion left. ITER will be up before 2028 hopefully. We just found a better way to make our fusion magnetic fields, so this is not a pipedream. BUT even this advance is not enough for sustainable fusion. We have to find an even better way to create our magnetic fields, sustainable under high temperature (probably with high pressure). We recently found a supraconductor that is interesting because it work at &quot;high&quot; temperature (high for physicien is death for people), high pressure. sadly we don&#x27;t understand shit about all those new supraconductor, we don&#x27;t even understand CuO supraconductors yet.<p>If we have fusion in 2080, it will be because we invested heavily for this (and we&#x27;re not). And it is a silver bullet, that we&#x27;re not allowed to miss, or else.<p>We are signing checks without provision unless we find the right tech, at the right time. My guess is that some will have to pay. Most of us here aren&#x27;t to concerned (i know i&#x27;m not, probably only people living close to the Ohio river should be less concerned than me), but people living in Florida and south of Texas will want to buy a climatised suit if they hope to be able to be out more than 10 day a year by 2080.')
