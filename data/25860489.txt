Most subs have SAMs, or manpads.  To pick a classic example, this article on the same site about Typhoon <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hisutton.com&#x2F;The%20REAL%20Red%20October%20-%20Typhoon%20SSBN.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hisutton.com&#x2F;The%20REAL%20Red%20October%20-%20Typ...</a> says there are manpads in the sail.<p>British and Israeli subs experimented with blowpipe slaved to the periscope, which was a truly useless SAM.  Those kinds of details are buried in the articles on that site :)<p>I&#x27;d guess that the idea isn&#x27;t so much to actually sneak up on aircraft, but rather to give them something to evade while the sub tries to make its escape.')
