It is snappy and the lack of a noisy tab bar on the top in addition to TST is actually a huge deal!<p>So my question for anyone from Mozilla who steps in here:<p>when will you start fixing the extension API? I get it the new API is more secure, but there is nothing that prevents making tab positions configurable in a safe way.<p>Also, could someone please fix that nasty UX bug that some UX designer introduced a decade or so ago where - if you select the tiniest thing on the page - the navigation buttons disappear from the context menus. After a decade or more this inconsistency still annoys me.')
