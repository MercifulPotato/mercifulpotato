Drive at exactly 28 mph, and you’d hit the green wave. As my commute was over 50% of my travel, and the pattern was learned in just a few days of observation, I question how valuable this service will really be. In my other commutes, I was stuck in stop and go traffic, and this ‘Green Wave’ detection wouldn’t help. It’s for a corner case of non highway driving outside of rush hour. Yet, I can see how it would appeal to the German sense of proper order and over engineering.')
