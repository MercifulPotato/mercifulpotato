Ever since then, I look at games differently. The most recent example of this is Hades. I played that game very compulsively, and feel that most of the serotonin I was getting out of it was the result of operant conditioning, not something that I really like. That game has an absolutely perfectly designed reward loop, but I wasn&#x27;t really enjoying playing it very much.')
