The resolution for those needs to be quite high (2048px or 4096px) and compiling the shaders into that resolution takes ages.<p>They however do use procedural textures when texturing objects (Check Substance Designer), but having to compile them during playtime would make load times unacceptably high. Maybe even hours.')
