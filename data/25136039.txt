So, it has been &quot;donating&quot; a lot to anti-oil interests in the U.S. so that the oil prices remain high enough for them to justify more oil exploration. As a counter response, the U.S. has been supporting Greenpeace Norway to try to stop oil exploration in Norway.<p>The whole thing is a clown show.<p>The only one who is benefiting from this is China. It produces most of the rare earth minerals required for EVs, makes all of EV parts and makes all the wind turbines.')
