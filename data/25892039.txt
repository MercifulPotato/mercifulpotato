Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=[25892411, 25895694], score=None, time=1611496465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890532, text='&gt; outside the US, almost no one grew up in a big house.<p>Neither suburbs nor detached houses nor private houses are specific to the US.<p>In France, primary housing is 57% individual house, 43% collective (apartments). But that&#x27;s not all: if you consider families (with children), which is what matters when is &quot;where did you grow up?&quot;, individual houses rise to 70%!<p>In UK, flats are a tiny minority, the form that rules there is of course the semi-detached house. But even there, there are still more detached houses than flats.<p>In the whole EU, the ratio is similar to France: flats are a minority with 46% of housing, and amongst the remaining 54%, 2 third are fully detached houses.<p>Another angle. If we take <i>ze</i> city, where almost everything is apartments: Paris. There were 25% *less* inhabitants in 1990 (when a present 30-year old was born) than there were in 1920! People have fled to the suburbs there as well (which doesn&#x27;t mean 100% individual house, admittedly, but anyway a much much greater proportion than inside Paris).<p>&gt; I grew up in an apartment.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make a statistic :-)')
