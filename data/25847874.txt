But I think a blanket opposition to &quot;software used in warfare&quot; is too simplistic. The real problems are when a country starts a war for unjust reasons, and this is a political problem, not a technological one. In many ways a sufficiently powerful military (and warfare, or the threat thereof) is vital to protect safety and basic rights.<p>The development of the atom bomb is how it&#x27;s been used over the decades is something we can have plenty of moral questions about, but the thing is that after the development of physics up to a point, an atom bomb was kind of an obvious thing, and the same technology has also been used for many other non-warfare purposes. Technologically speaking, you can&#x27;t really have one without the other (but you <i>can</i> make a political choice to do so).<p>In short, I understand why people are concerned about these kind of things, but I think solving them on a technological level is the wrong approach.')
