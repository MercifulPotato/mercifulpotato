We were moving and needed a couch and bed quickly and the bay could deliver one reasonably fast. The couch cushions lost their loft in a few months and were covered in pills. Customer service offers no solutions. The bed came with bent slats thst couldn&#x27;t support any weight and the upholstery was poorly affixes to the frame. It took almost 10 hours of phone calls to get them to take it back and another 5 hours for them to tell us the gift cards they sent us couldn&#x27;t be used until we activated them in store. We ended up replacing the couch with one from Urban Barn that only cost 15% (regular price while the bay was a 40% off sale price) more and is much better quality. Everything with HBC is terribly mismanaged and I agree that it really needs to die.')
