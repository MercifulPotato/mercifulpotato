It&#x27;s just hard to see the pointing of fingers at China that&#x27;s happened, especially in hindsight when it&#x27;s unclear if it even began in China (which doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway if it was a naturally occurring zoonotic crossover event) and not somewhere else like Italy, but the west has just rolled over to the threat of the virus in its response. Meanwhile, life in China has been basically normal for a while.<p>It further drives me crazy because I am still disconnected from my family because the U.S. <i>still</i> refuses to allow my fianc√©e to travel back (she lives and works in the U.S.) from the country best dealing with this to to the worst. It&#x27;s just sickening there&#x27;s no support for people like us, and now it looks like it can only get worse in the west.')
