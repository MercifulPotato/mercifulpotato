I hear a more general version a bit like it: There are 2 types of employees Saint Bernard&#x27;s and Hyenas. The Saint Bernard needs to be told what to do all the time. Everything needs to be planned and organized for him. If he doesn&#x27;t have a pen he cant write. If there is one pen in the building all the hyenas can write. If you chose the Saint Bernard&#x27;s, as a manager your job is to make sure all the Saint Bernard&#x27;s stay productive. If you chose the hyena your job is watching them like a hawk because they might run away and take your company (or chunks of it) with them. Early on you should work with nothing but hyenas but at some point they should all be replaced with Saint Bernard&#x27;s. During the transition you have to elaborately compensate the hyenas to keep them in line.')
