I was curious about those littles devices and decided to buy one. \nBack at home, i started to play with my little device (pixl.js) and i was very enthousiast to use Chrome interface to start coding little program in Javascript, uploaded instantly via bluetooth on the device. It was fun, it was entertaining, and after a few keystrokes i was able to monitor room temperature, and display it on the lcd screen (which is totally useless i admit).<p>But the more i played with it, the more i became curious of MCU ecosystem, given the fact that im also a mechanical keyboard enthousiast, where teensy and stm32u2 have a central place in this community (esp. when you want to build your own keyboard).<p>So little by little, my Espruino experience gave me confidence to continue the travel, and after two years, i migrated mostly over ESP32 and RISCV mcu, coding in C, using vscode&#x2F;platform.io, clone tones of github repo, trying to understand all the hardware concept, such as bus, serial, spi, i2c, timer, scheduling, packet radio with lora (running my own ttn gw, or controlling drone with opensource project such as ExpressLRS).<p>Espruino opens to me a new fertile world of MCU, helped me to step up the entry barrier and last year at FOSDEM, i meet again Gordon and thank him warmly for all of this.<p>(signed: a +20 years linux sysadmin, who always wanted to code a little)')
