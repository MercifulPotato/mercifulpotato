The rest of the net has gotten competitive. I do my research on wirecutter&#x2F;reddit, and buy it from manufacturer&#x2F;walmart&#x2F;bestbuy, other niche trustworthy stores.<p>The cash back I get back from my Amazon card usually covers cost of most of what I still buy from Amazon, so Amazon has become my &quot;free goodies&quot; shop.<p>I think this is great. Having &quot;an everything store&quot; that everyone uses always felt like a monopoly ripe for customer abuse.')
