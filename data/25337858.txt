When those come online yes, Starlink should have a latency advantage over most any distance sufficiently long enough to make up their fixed RTT mileage cost with their 40% speed advantage vs standard optical fiber [1]. But for the current and near future deployment Starlink satellites act purely as &quot;bent pipes&quot; connecting terminals to a groundstation, both with LOS to the sat.<p>HFT gets cited a lot but probably one of their biggest bonanzas once intersat links are up will be marine and aviation internet. If you think rural pricing is bad...<p>----<p>1: <i>Possibly</i> with a very few rarified exceptions that use terrestrial microwave links or if someone went to the trouble of using photonic bandgap fiber.')
