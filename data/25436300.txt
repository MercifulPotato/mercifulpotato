Responsive Android is absolutely doable if you design it a certain way, and there is no need to remove features like removable batteries or literally anything else.<p>There is also absolutely no need for it to introduce artifacts into your images. RAW+JPEG is already good enough for this.<p>The actual advantage of an open camera are huge. For example, it would be trivial to adapt the camera to literally any mount, from EF to E to G and so on, which in and of itself is completely disruptive.<p>Phone processors have other aces up their sleeve. For example, unlike the Canon EOS R5, they can actually process 8K video indefinitely without breaking a sweat.<p>As for battery life, you&#x27;re once again very wrong. The biggest draws in battery life in a camera are the processor and the sensor. Using a phone processor would allow for much lower energy usage as the lithography is incredibly more efficient, and all the high-battery-usage parts of a phone would disappear, such as always-on LTE modems, background processing, and so on.<p>For boot, Android with a camera sized battery and no modem can last weeks in standby, months in sleep mode. Your camera already doesn&#x27;t turn off, but instead enters a low-power state. Try removing the battery of an A7 or EOS R, discharging the internal energy storage, and see how long it takes to start.<p>The actual advantage of this is that it allows you to become a camera manufacturer for much lower costs, meaning that you don&#x27;t have to limit yourself to a single mount, and can outsource some R&amp;D externally. For example, you won&#x27;t need to be Fuji to have accurate film sims, you won&#x27;t need to be Canon to have native level EF compatibility, and you&#x27;d even be able to do revolutionary things like autofocus manual lenses.<p>Beyond that, you&#x27;d be able to do things like temporal noise reduction, 3D depth mapping for haze removal, and so on, that can be either used for automatic processing and&#x2F;or made available in RAW format for further editing.<p>Basically, you&#x27;re describing &quot;what if a phone company made a bad camera&quot;. What I&#x27;m talking about at least is &quot;what if photographers made a camera untethered by the restrictions of existing cameras using commodity hardware&quot;. I think the second has the potential of seriously providing value.')
