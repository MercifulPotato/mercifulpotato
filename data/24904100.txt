There <i>is</i> value in second opinions and maybe some very specifically applied machine learning, but modern medicine is far too primitive benefit from large amounts of data per patient. The bigger issue is the complete corruption of American healthcare. The whole system&#x27;s gotta go.<p>The only good thing in the current system is that HIPAA allows you as a patient to access every single of your medical records from any provider you go to. You won&#x27;t be able to do much with these records, but it&#x27;s still nice.<p>Problem: EHR companies like Epic have corrupt leadership and are purely profit driven and intentionally make it harder to share data between provider networks. The Epic CEO Judith Faulkner is evil and directly profits from this. Same with Cerner and Brent Shafer. They have no desire to make data easier to share.<p>Problem: Same for hospitals, many of which are corrupt and make millions despite maintaining non profit statuses. They have an incentive to make it harder for doctors not in the hospital network to access their records. Forget about record sharing and easy healthcare data access.<p>Problem: Most hospitals only care about profits, not patient outcomes and efficiency. This runs deep and leads to inefficient hospitals, including reduced doctor availability. Hospitals also profit from things like billing errors or intentionally sloppy billing. Optimizing for outcomes is irrelevant to hospitals.<p>Problem: Doctors have conflicting evidence of what to do for health outcomes. For example, some doctors still incorrectly think lowering cholesterol will improve cardiovascular disease, and think people with high cholesterol should be on statins. Giving them more data isn&#x27;t going to help fix their poor training.<p>Problem: There&#x27;s corruption among doctors who care more about profit motives than patient outcomes. They have figured out how to game the system (there are many ways).<p>Problem: No one in America wants to see a doctor because of cost. And doctors and hospitals and everyone else in healthcare has gamed the system to make everything as expensive as possible, so the desire not to see doctors is more than warranted. You probably know health insurance companies are totally corrupt and the cause of this, but it&#x27;s also doctors, hospitals (the biggest enemy), the government, medical device manufacturers, non profit health awareness groups, consulting groups like Deloitte, physical therapists, there is corruption at every level of healthcare.')
