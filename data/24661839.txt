Instead of essentially trying to create a meta-distribution, snaps provide a way to run software built for Ubuntu LTS on other distros, at least in theory. They are compiled against Ubuntu LTS runtimes and are built primarily from packages in the Ubuntu LTS repositories. Further, when any Ubuntu based dependencies of snap packages get security updates in the Ubuntu repositories, the owners of said packages are prompted to rebuild their snaps.<p>In contrast, it&#x27;s not clear who is assuming responsibility for maintaining flatpak runtimes like org.gnome.Platform, or what is their support lifecycle. It would be better to promote runtimes based on a well-known distribution&#x27;s packages, since they would get security updates in accordance with that distribution&#x27;s security policy. For instance, something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.redhat.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;introducing-the-red-hat-flatpak-runtime-for-desktop-containers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.redhat.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;introducing-th...</a> looks more promising from a security point of view.')
