That remedy would be grossly disproportionate to the procedural challenges raised<p>My impression is that’s the crux of many of the decisions.<p>⅘ of the states would have needed to flip, so as legal avenues close in states the ROI on pursuing other cases begins to turn negative quickly.<p>Let me be clear: I’m not arguing that any of the arguments are valid or not, just that they weren’t given the time or resources for discovery or developed argument that would provide any type of closure. In many cases the remedy may be worse than the outcome.')
