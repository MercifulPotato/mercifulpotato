It&#x27;s either &quot;you allow all speech or it&#x27;s immoral&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the rub, I think most people also support limiting extreme speech.  IDK that there are many (any?) defenders of someone shouting &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater.<p>That, to me, indicates that the morality of limiting speech is more than just a simple binary choice &quot;any limits are bad, no limits are good&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s what &quot;Free-speech-as-legal-right&quot; is really trying to get at.  It is the law trying to make the moral arguments for what free speech is and isn&#x27;t and when it can be morally curtailed.<p>To me, the law has struck a decent balance.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hugely immoral for a social media company to moderate their own content however they choose.  Are downvotes in HN immoral?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Do people here in HN believe flagged content is immoral or content that goes against the community rules?  I don&#x27;t think so.<p>To me, the only way this would be an issue is if Parler had no method to get their platform running.  That&#x27;s not the case.  They can self host if they so choose.  It isn&#x27;t unreasonable for them to do that (many companies do).<p>That being said, I DO have an issue with ISPs choosing what content their customers have access to.  That is mainly because a lot of people DON&#x27;T have a choice of provider.  There is often only 1 high speed choice in a region.  For them to filter or block content is a major issue.')
