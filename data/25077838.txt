So, he&#x27;s not just talking about &quot;putting heads on pikes&quot; metaphorically, but also doubling down on why execution is a viable tool historically. And Bannon knows that these comments come with the context of Fauci needing 24&#x2F;7 security after receiving multiple death threats.<p>You might come down on either side of the censorship &#x2F; free speech argument, but Bannon knows exactly what he&#x27;s doing with his words here, and it went beyond a one-off bad-taste metaphor.')
