We get our tree from them every year. I paid $60 for the tree and gave the guy who loaded it $5 tip.<p>The cool thing about Quarter Pine is they suspend the tree and drill a hole in the bottom of the trunk. They sell a special stand with a peg you put the tree on. It’s the slickest experience I’ve had with a real tree stand.')
