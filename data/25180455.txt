I think PM &quot;job one&quot; is translating a credible and concrete vision of what a product needs to do to the design and dev teams. A Product Manager primarily interprets the market - customers, buyers, competition - both tactically and strategically on behalf of informing direction of a product&#x27;s development. Analyze, integrate, interpret, explain, communicate, prioritize - all big PM verbs. It is an advantage to deeply understand key customer &quot;jobs to be done&quot;. It is a requirement to communicate  well cross functionally with everyone. PM is an influencing function -- visionwise you can be a little ahead of the rest of your team, so being smart, credible, empathetic and service-to-the-mission oriented all help in that way.')
