People who work with data and their activists are why regular Americans are at all scared of government digital surveillance. On the other side of that, people who don&#x27;t work with data use free digital services everyday and so even if they know those products are built with their data they are more likely to be sympathetic because in their minds it&#x27;s a fair trade for the utility they&#x27;ve gained and even the trades they didn&#x27;t make still serve as evidence to them of how useful doing things this way is. An interesting experiment would be if a single city went all-in on digital surveilance and monetization so that the country could see clearly what was being gained and lost for the participants.')
