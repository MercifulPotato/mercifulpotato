Editing proofs written with tactics is a nightmare - and the main reasons it&#x27;s tolerated are the ubiquity of interactive provers and the fact that you basically don&#x27;t care about which particular proof you get in a prover - unlike code, which rarely has interactive typechecking (Haskell holes come close) and where you <i>do</i>, definitely, care about the specific code you write.<p>Using tactics for metaprogramming addresses all of those concerns, and it will be interesting to see if it picks up any kind of steam. Formalising the existing use of Eclipse-style code templates with a more powerful system should have loads of promise.')
