Without a charter the corporation doesn&#x27;t exist, can&#x27;t be subject of legal action, can&#x27;t own property, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not really convinced that that makes any sense as a punishment (or even that temporary impairment that would be more analogous to imprisonment would.)<p>People can be remediated by that kind of punishment, maybe, but abstractions like corporations probably cannot. Better to either dissolve them or exclude the bad individual actors from them and let them continue.')
