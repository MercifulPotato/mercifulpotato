Item(by='mcguire', descendants=None, kids=[25935102, 25936800], score=None, time=1611782435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927190, text='A 300mm telephoto lens gives a narrower field of view than the standard eyeball, making objects in the field of view seem packed closer together. A 24mm wide-angle lens gives a wider field of view, making objects in the field of view seem farther apart. (&quot;Objects in mirror are closer than they appear&quot;? Yeah, same thing.) Both can be used for artistic effects as well as being dishonest. (I really like a 150-200mm lens for portraits; for one thing not having the camera and photographer nearby makes people look more natural.) A good match for the eye is a 50mm &quot;standard&quot; lens. (All lens sizes are for 35mm cameras; I don&#x27;t remember what the correction factor is for my DSLR&#x27;s CCD.)')
