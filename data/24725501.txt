At least, they ran great for like a minute or two until the thermal throttling kicked in. So given that my HTPC build <i>does</i> have issues, and it has a slightly better GPU and much worse processor, I&#x27;m inclined to think the processor is the problem.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much point trying to get a better processor than that for the old LGA 1150 board, when I could spend only slightly more cash on some DDR4 RAM, a B450 motherboard, and maybe an older Ryzen to be upgraded to one of these Zen 3 ones in a few years when prices have dropped.')
