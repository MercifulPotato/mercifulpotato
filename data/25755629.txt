Both are independent simplifications of the syllabic cuneiform script into &quot;alphabets.&quot; Both are linguistic dead ends, with no subsequent scripts arising from them.<p>The Phoencian &quot;alphabet&quot; is unrelated to Mesopotamian cuneiform. It likely represents another independent invention, but this time deriving from Egyptian hieroglyphs rather than cuneiform.')
