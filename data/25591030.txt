You log on to the server in chrome or Firefox and the browser window basically becomes RStudio and all calculations are done on the server and all code and data also lives on the server which is a huge bonus in terms of data protection. No copies are floating around on peoples laptops and if Johnny is sick and forgot to push his code to git - no worries, it’s all on the r studio server.<p>I don’t now of a nearly as good Python solution. I think Conda suggests using jupyter lab, and while that is a great environment it’s not great if it’s all you can use.')
