Now I buy economy Motorolas, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. The performance is somewhat worse than a flagship phone, but I damage my phones pretty frequently and I&#x27;m so much less worried about it when the replacement cost is $200 rather than $900.<p>Price has been a main barrier to my wearing a smart watch as my expectation is that something on my wrist will get damaged even more often - I do a lot of mechanical work. Certainly my $15 Casio is pretty scratched up. At the $20 price point, though, I might give this a try.')
