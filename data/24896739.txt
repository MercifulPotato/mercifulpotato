Extending bus services is a band aid on a systemic problem. People don’t want to take the bus unless they have to because buses take forever compared to cars. Buses take forever because they have to stop so often. They have to stop so often because 99% of the US is totally spread out with very low density. And that is the fundamental problem. You can’t just tweak the buses or trains or walk more in a city that has built $100 billion of infrastructure around driving cars. Walkability and public transit just aren’t viable alternatives in a country built around the suburb and the highway.')
