Senior management positions are only awarded to ethnic Germans so it&#x27;s quite ironic to hear them complain when they get the same treatment at foreign companies.<p>This mentality is somewhat changing, but very slowly and white westerns are still prioritized. You won&#x27;t see any Indians run German auto companies any time soon like you see them running major US tech companies.')
