I have sympathy for those who can&#x27;t work (or can but only minimal levels) - and I know a number of them. However I also know some who could work but are milking the system (less than the number who can&#x27;t work).<p>Every penny taken out of my income to support someone else is a penny I can&#x27;t apply to my own dreams. My dreams are (in no order - in fact the order changes day to day): retire early, buy more toys, pay for my kids&#x27; education, take more exotic vacations. I have enough to live on, and even by US standards I&#x27;m doing very well, but there is always more, and the money going to someone else is money I work for that I can&#x27;t enjoy.')
