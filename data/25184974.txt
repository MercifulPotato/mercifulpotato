I guess we will know, if&#x2F;when&#x2F;once examples of individual discrimination based on what vaccine people received start emerging (hopefully, never).<p>Regretfully, it would be not the first example of major economies using the current reality as an excuse&#x2F;cover to conveniently push political policies&#x2F;agendas that would otherwise have been impossible to implement (at least not without violating laws&#x2F;treaties and maybe even basic human rights). I have no intention to fear monger, but I believe way too many are too naive about some of the things that are currently happening. That is, mostly people within those major economies, for people in less fortunate countries already learned the hard way how double-faced those major economies turned out.<p>How all this will eventually turn out ... anyone&#x27;s guess is as good as mine. I guess we will all learn, when the immediate emergency of the current situation is over. I would prefer to be&#x2F;remain optimistic, but thus far there appear to be more reasons for caution and skepticism (at best).')
