Though higher price with lower rates, assuming monthly payment is the same, can be beneficial as a larger percentage of your payment goes towards principal. That only holds as a positive if price doesn&#x27;t drop due to interest rate increases.<p>But I&#x27;d definitely rather be buying a house in a high interest rate environment... don&#x27;t like the tail risk given how low rates are.')
