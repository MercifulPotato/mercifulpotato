I recently started a position at a credit union that focuses on serving customers typical banks&#x2F;credit unions won&#x27;t touch. Every week we get to hear feedback from customers who are grateful that we&#x27;ve taken the time to look beyond their credit scores and see how we might be able to help them out of their particular financial distress.<p>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed programming and never had any job I absolutely hated. But I&#x27;ve never really felt excited about the mission of my employer before and it makes such a difference in my daily attitude and motivation. I can really get behind the &quot;teach a man to fish vs. give a man a fish&quot; approach we take. I think it also helps that the results of our efforts directly impact the community I live in vs. a change the world type vision that a large corporation would have.<p>On top of it all, I got a nice raise to come here, especially when you include the benefits package. So don&#x27;t resign yourself to the fact that you&#x27;ll have to take a pay cut.')
