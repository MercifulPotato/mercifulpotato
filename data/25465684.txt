As it happens this was a growth experience for ruby too.<p>However limited their technology choice might have been from a performance standpoint it did give them the adapatability and flexibility to provide the fun and entertaining product that got them off the ground in the first place.<p>It did inevitably lead to the growing pains we discuss but I doubt <i>anybody</i> expected it to get as big as it did.<p>WRT the original comment here ... the main limiting factor nowadays is just getting people to use it. The network effect. Mastodon is a thing, and people do use it but it’s a minnow relatively speaking.<p>The next big challenge I think will be some kind of <i>decentralised</i> twitter based on some kind of blockchain (by which I mean progressive content hashing and consensus) and I don’t mean federated, like mastodon. The mastodon name is ridiculous too .. I’m not going to go into why but if you know you know, and stupid as it is it does matter.')
