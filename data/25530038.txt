I finally saw Hamilton on Disney+ because I could never get tickets for the show or didn&#x27;t want to drop hundreds of dollars on it. I was worried before watching it that it was going to be over-hyped and I was going to be underwhelmed. I was wrong. It totally lived up to the hype and now i wish I had seen it live. Post-pandemic I might still go see it.<p>The show that WAS over-hyped and did NOT live up to it for me was Lion King. I saw it back in 2002-ish and was very disappointed. Sure the costumes were cool but the rest of the production was minimal and boring.')
