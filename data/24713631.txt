Ohanian later wrote that instead of labeling Swartz as a co-founder, the correct description is that Swartz&#x27;s company was acquired by Reddit 6 months after he and Huffman had started.<p>EDIT: This doesn&#x27;t seem to be news though. Checking the Wayback Machine, Aaron Swartz seems to never have been mentioned as a founder on that page. Here&#x27;s what the page looked like in April 2018:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180409192133&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redditinc.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180409192133&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddi...</a>')
