Wether that is by design or by pure luck is incidental to the point that the Young Turks can blame the BLM protests on Republicans with at least some shred of plausibility and evidence. Sure, maybe it’s a cheap generalization that lets Democrats off the hook, but in some areas of the country the blatant segregationist racism of the 60s never died, and in some of those areas Republicans (and Democrats) have made direct or indirect attempts to continue that suppression:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;a-civil-rights-expert-explains-the-social-science-of-police-racism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;a-civil-rights-ex...</a><p>So wether you agree or not, there’s a logical path that can be drawn from oppressor to oppressed.<p>But claiming the 2020 election was rigged or stolen or had massive fraud to a degree that would have changed the election outcome was never demonstrated in any plausible way in any public venue.

If Trump conceded he lost a fair election, no one dies. That’s the difference.')
