Also, you use an awful lot of nasty little rhetorical manipulations in your posts, did you realize that? Actually, that last sentence is an example of one of these tricks you use! Go back and read my post if you&#x27;re interested in learning something, but do not use faulty summarization to misrepresent what I wrote.<p>But aside from your creepy and manipulative way of writing, let&#x27;s get down to the heart of the matter. You wrote: &quot;How much do you value not getting an illness with 99.9% survival rate, vs. living your life.&quot; This is a stupid and fallacious argument. It presupposes that you cannot take cautious, responsible, defensive measures against being infected without sacrificing &quot;living your life&quot;. I&#x27;m currently living in a first world country, living happy, content, and healthy, and also only going out in public places when I really need to, and always masking when I do. It&#x27;s not the SAME as pre-Covid, but it&#x27;s also not painful, difficult, or boring. So taking some simple, possibly inconvenient precautions means you can still &quot;live your life&quot;, it just means that there are some boundaries dictated by your circumstances.<p>Secondly, let&#x27;s say for the sake of really destroying your argument that you can&#x27;t both take these common sense precautions and still &quot;live your life&quot;. Fine, COVID 19 is destroying your mojo during 2020. All you have to do is take a year off. It&#x27;s ridiculously fucking easy. We&#x27;ll have good enough therapies early next year to make COVID not a huge problem anymore, so when you say &quot;live your life&quot;, what you&#x27;re actually taking about not being able to do is &quot;living your life for a year and maybe a couple months&quot;, which is really not a big deal when you consider all the harm you can do to the people around you by being a selfish twat.')
