I think the modern practice of adding milk to tea started with the British, who imported it via Hong Kong. The Taiwanese then added tapioca + sugar which became bubble tea.<p>There are traditional milk teas in other countries though, like India and Mongolia. The Mongolian version is salty instead of sweet.')
