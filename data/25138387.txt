Things like performance analysis, security, etc. that apply regardless of what language or framework you&#x27;re working in.  All that &quot;useless&quot; stuff taught in college that some HNers like to look down on turns out not to be so useless after all since they underlie everything about how software and computers work and evolve slowly.  And if diving deeper into tech areas is not your thing, fundamentals in other areas like business, leadership, etc. also are timeless and valuable tools if you make the effort to add them to your toolbox.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to feel like an impostor, get to a point where it&#x27;s demonstrable, even to yourself, that you aren&#x27;t.  Sure, there&#x27;s always someone better out there but there&#x27;s always someone not better too and with effort, you can make sure that there are more of the latter.')
