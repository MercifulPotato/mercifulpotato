Docks by CalDigit are different docks than OWC, but I think they are all using the same chipset underneath.<p>It also does not happen with Intel Macs, which use Intel TB implementation. With M1, the TB is brand new, so some issues are to be expected. I suspect that with sleep and wakeup, there is some state mixup with previous link training, so it doesn&#x27;t talk to other side the way the other side expects. This might be - or might be not - fixed with firmware updates.')
