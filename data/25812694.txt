Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=[25812943], score=None, time=1610904643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812425, text='It absolutely makes sense to simply ignore articles based on the credibility of the journal, it&#x27;s an effective and cheap first filter (and you absolutely need filters) - there are many predatory journals (like this one) which will publish anything that&#x27;s paid for, they probably even outnumber &quot;real&quot; journals, and it makes all sense to automatically discard them without reading.<p>There is a lot of noise already in &quot;proper&quot; journals - but in the predatory journals, the signal-to-noise ratio is <i>so</i> extremely low, it&#x27;s not worth looking into the credibility of the methodology of the paper because that&#x27;s far more time and effort that the paper deserves. If it was any good, it would have been published in a better venue. If it could pass peer review, it would have been published in a venue that actually does peer review as opposed to these (many) predatory journals who just claim to do so. The authors have strong practical incentives to not publish it there if they can avoid to, and the fact that they chose to do so anyway indicates that no respectable place would publish it.<p>Because of that, if a paper is published in a place like this, is a completely reasonable prior to presume that overwhelmingly likely the paper is very bad, without even looking at the paper itself.')
