If you don&#x27;t get your investors a pop, they&#x27;ll be less likely to buy the next time around. The incentives are a little more complicated than just the underwriting fees â€” and the underwriting banks often both get a % fee <i>and</i> a flat fee, the latter of which is less useful for aligning incentives on pricing with the company going public (but useful for aligning incentives with the investors).<p>That being said, seemingly-paradoxically, despite big pops being bad for the <i>companies</i>, they&#x27;re actually typically good for employees. RSUs will typically turn into shares at IPO time and the entire bundle of shares will be taxed as income according to the listing price; a giant pop means you get higher dollar value shares while paying less tax, assuming you then hold onto them for a year and pay long-term capital gains tax on the difference between listing and pop price rather than selling immediately and paying short-term tax. Waiting a year to sell isn&#x27;t that unlikely, since employees often aren&#x27;t even allowed to sell at all for the first six months.')
