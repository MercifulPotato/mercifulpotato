This is a sad fact of human nature.<p>What gets to me is the &quot;old media&#x27;s&quot; attempt to pin responsibility for all social maladies on &quot;new media&quot;. Call me cynical, but this stinks of WaPo, NYT, Fox etc. fighting to get back ad dollars by getting advertisers to &quot;rethink&quot; their links with these companies by exaggerating claims of the platforms&#x27; complicity&#x2F;inaction.')
