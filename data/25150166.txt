Most of the stuff you are mentioning already have companies that provide solutions&#x2F;products, or at least have them in development. The main constraint is that energy revolution will really be driven by the hardware&#x2F;physics. The software can help, but stuff like battery management or sun-tracking solar panels is existing software, and are really only useful if you have the hardware to work with it. People pay for hardware, the hardware providers will provide software options (look at Tesla). I would think you would not be able make a successful business around the software itself unless you have a novel idea that is built off of some undiscovered or untapped physics principle that greatly increases efficiency.')
