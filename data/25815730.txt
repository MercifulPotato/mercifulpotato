I also got the nastiest bout of diarrhea I had ever had in my life, most likely caused my bad meat (I still remember the faulty kebab...).<p>The locals where very friendly. When I was in the bus on the karakoram highway, we had a brief stop (bathroom break, food, etc). I was chatting with someone who was asking where I came from, when suddenly he snapped his fingers. A can of coke appeared on his hand, and he handed it to me, saying &#x27;welcome to Pakistan!&#x27;.<p>As to the landscape, I still remember it many years later.<p>A truly extraordinary place.')
