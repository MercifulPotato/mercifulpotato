Item(by='__d', descendants=None, kids=[24750182], score=None, time=1602455179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748781, text='Yes, you should quit: the question is not &quot;if&quot; but &quot;how&quot;.<p>Given the current situation, you might consider your runway carefully.  In particular, counting on working through your notice period as a part of that runway isn&#x27;t guaranteed.<p>You&#x27;ll also need to make a decision about what you want your new job to be: a part-time role (perm or contract) makes for a much different job search than a full-time role.   You might want to decide up front that you&#x27;ll look for a part-time role exclusively for, say 2 months, and if you haven&#x27;t found one by then, start chasing a full-time role as well.  Similarly with contract vs. permanent roles.<p>My risk profile is a little different, but right now I think I&#x27;d be looking to have a little more than 4 months up my sleeve, especially given that it sounds like that&#x27;s really just working through your notice period with reduced spend.<p>Get yourself several months of genuine, cash-in-the-bank runway, and you&#x27;re much less exposed.')
