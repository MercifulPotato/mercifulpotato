I think the main reason I won&#x27;t do it is the cost of law school.<p>On top of that, it seems the system is not clear cut and it doesn&#x27;t follow it&#x27;s own rules. I&#x27;ve recently had some dealings with some state troopers, the DA&#x27;s office, local PD, and a few magistrates. The level of incompetence, indifference, and even misconduct (lies in court) is appalling. I&#x27;ve started to become disillusioned by the system&#x27;s integrity, and I don&#x27;t know that I want to be a part of that.')
