Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602032480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702056, text='&gt; In &quot;safe&quot; languages we often talk about how you can&#x27;t ignore errors in return values.<p>It’s pretty important to define what you mean by “error”. We should not conflate state or execution errors with approximation errors, they are very very different kinds of errors. It is quite often not an error condition to have an approximation, and so would not count as a “leak”.<p>&gt; If it only takes 6k lines to provide an API for more precise real numbers, then almost every programming language should have it.<p>There are a <i>lot</i> of libraries in a lot of languages for supporting arbitrary precision, big numbers, and other various representations. I’d venture to say that almost every programming language does have it, if you count a third party or open source library as having it.<p>On the other hand, high precision reals is a performance drain of enormous magnitude if you don’t always need it. Do keep in mind that even with all their problems, 32 bit floats and 64 bit doubles are <i>really</i> fast compared to software number libraries, the IEEE formats have broad hardware support that doesn’t exist for high precision reals.')
