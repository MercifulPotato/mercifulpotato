I was mildly astonished.  I said, &quot;That&#x27;s not what politicians are <i>for!</i>&quot;  To me it seems clear that the primary purpose of politicians is to get out in front of the crowd and justify to ourselves and to the world our crimes, cruelties, and vices.<p>I mean, if people weren&#x27;t wicked would there be any politicians or lawyers?<p>I actually dropped out of high school and was homeless for a few years, in part because of disaffection with society and politics.  I got over it.  Nowadays I tend to believe that most people are doing their best, we just suck.  I think it&#x27;s the aftermath of the Younger Dryas and the invention of agriculture, but that&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother story.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m curious about how other people view the world and (at this point in history) the political class, so thank you.')
