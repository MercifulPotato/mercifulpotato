I have made around 7k USD so far.<p>My take-aways:<p>- Pick a niche you know really well. A lot of sales come through reputation, since there is always going to be other competing products out there. My niche is Vue.js (not that niche).<p>- It is a lot of work. I&#x27;d estimate my profits around 5 USD &#x2F; hour after it&#x27;s all said and done?<p>- You need to build a brand! Start using Twitter and Reddit, interacting with your community. I am NOT a twitter or reddit guy normally, I do it for my professional image and content primarily.<p>- Build an audience first. I collected emails starting in Jan (day I decided to make a course). Around 500 ppl left their email before my launch, which was in June. Majority of my traffic from from my free ebook [0].<p>- Practice screencasting before you make a course. I did by posting free screencasts on my course website to get my skills up and show my content was worth $. [1]<p>- I rolled my own platform, hard to say if it was worth it. I posted my content on both my own platform and Udemy. I made around 5k from my platform, 2k from Udemy, but sold way more courses on Udemy (since they take a cut <i>and</i> they reduce the price based on country.<p>- Rolling your own platform has costs. Dev time, hosting videos (vimeo) hosting content (digital ocean), domain (namecheap) and the overhead of maintaining your stack.<p>- Udemy, while they take a cut, do a lot of marketing for you. Since I have put less time into marketing, sales on my personal site dropped, but Udemy is consistent (around $500 a month - I only spend around 3h answering questions a month).<p>I am now writing a book and will sell on Gumroad. Easy to set up, and they handle payments etc.<p>I will write a more detailed blog post soon on this topic.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmiller1990.github.io&#x2F;vue-testing-handbook&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmiller1990.github.io&#x2F;vue-testing-handbook&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuejs-course.com&#x2F;screencasts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuejs-course.com&#x2F;screencasts</a>')
