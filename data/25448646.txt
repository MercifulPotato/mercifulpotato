Now that the precedent is well and truly set with elections and vaccines having Official Truths, what&#x27;s the next thing on the docket?<p>It&#x27;s not that I even think they&#x27;re necessarily incorrect about their take - it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re putting themselves in place as being the gatekeepers of reality on certain topics.
