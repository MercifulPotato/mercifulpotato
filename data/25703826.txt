I find it mostly amusing, and only slightly annoying.<p>There are probably a dozen, at least.  Here are a couple of examples off the top of my head:<p>For a very long time, when you asked Siri the temperature, if it was above 80Â°, she would add the word &quot;hot&quot; to the end of it.  &quot;It&#x27;s 81 degrees. Hot.&quot;  Where I was living at the time, 81 degrees meant a light sweater was in order.<p>When I lived in Chicago, Apple&#x27;s headphones were worthless in the winter because they were made of plastic that was perfectly bendy in Silicon Valley&#x27;s climate, but would turn into the equivalent of unweildly coathangars attached to your ears in actual winter conditions.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still the case, as it&#x27;s what made me switch to wireless headphones years ago.<p>Even today, where I live in the desert, it&#x27;s not unusual for a current model iPhone to go into thermal shutdown (with the appropriate warning on the screen) on a perfectly normal spring or summer day, even though I don&#x27;t use a case.  But I expect (hope) that&#x27;s about something involving electronics that I don&#x27;t understand.')
