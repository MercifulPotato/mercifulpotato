You can very much use autotools to build modern software for older kernels. That&#x27;s... kind of the point of using something like autotools.<p>Frankly reading this thread I think many people here bark at the wrong tree. If you don&#x27;t care for portability don&#x27;t bother with autotools, just write Makefiles. It&#x27;s much simpler.')
