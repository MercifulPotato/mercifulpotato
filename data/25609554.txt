Anything you say that is slightly controversial will get slammed on Twitter&#x2F;Media.   We need better mechanisms to express disagreements than the status quo <i>without being belittled, insulted, shunned, disrespected and ousted</i>. If you&#x27;re a respected scientist, you can get your career slashed in half. Everyone is human, forgiveness, and being able to discuss politely is only may be on HN.<p>I went on Twitter expressing that the US surgeon general and a bunch of CDC folks shouldn&#x27;t be lying to the public about the following: Masks were initially in intense shortage. What did the leaders do? They lied to the public about how ineffective masks are to make sure there is enough stock for healthcare workers. I tried to expose this and everyone shunned me down by saying that this is a harmful thing to say. Since when is transparency harmful? You could be truthful and say &quot;While masks are effective, please dont horde them as they are needed by the hospitals&quot;. Even if we didn&#x27;t know the exact effectiveness of masks, they&#x27;re not harmful to wear. They can <i>only</i> help. Leaders should have told the public about how to make them at home, which did happen, thanks to a bunch of Youtubers.<p>Here is the deleted tweet (google cache) from the US Surgeon General:<p>&gt; &quot;Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers canâ€™t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk! <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;37Ay6Cm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;37Ay6Cm</a>&quot;<p>There were so many things like this. Ventilators, testing ratio, death rate, etc. Coronavirus pandemic was horribly handled by the entire world, particularly us as Americans. Shame really that this is the best we could do.<p>Edit: Added the official wording of the US Surgeon General Tweet on Feb 29, 2020.')
