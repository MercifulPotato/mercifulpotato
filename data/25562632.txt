I, personally, don&#x27;t believe that a free society should be told what kind of merchandise they can sell or not sell at a checkout line. That goes for literally anything.<p>A business that does &quot;harmful things&quot;, such as stocking chocolate bars next to customers while they are idle in a queue (Shocking! How dare they commit such a heinous act! This is a public health atrocity!), clearly sees a mutually beneficial arrangement in where they put what merchandise. The customer has a need fulfilled (They see something they want and agree to purchase it for a marked price), and the business generates revenue. There is nothing inherently wrong with that.<p>Do you people really sit there and think anyone that buys something because they want it and it&#x27;s readily available is too stupid to know the dangers of eating too much unhealthy food? Do you think that they are being physically manipulated into buying it? Yes, unhealthy foods generally stimulate the brain and create a desire for more, but the same justification can be used to go the full mile and ban them outright if you are so concerned. That&#x27;ll probably happen eventually anyways, and you don&#x27;t want to be on the wrong side of history!')
