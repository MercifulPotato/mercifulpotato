Certainly, some people have tried, but a lot of people question whether those attempts can be successful â€“ indeed, doubting those efforts is one thing that both naturalists who doubt the objectivity of the good, and non-naturalists who believe in the objectivity of the good but reject the idea that it can be given a naturalist foundation, can agree on.')
