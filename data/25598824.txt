It&#x27;s not a sure bet, but China is willing to tolerate it in the event it succeeds. Chins holds the mining power, so they effectively win if Bitcoin takes over. It&#x27;s easy for them to clamp down and control.<p>&gt; This is a pretty funny point because every time I go on twitter and see people talk about crypto, what they&#x27;re essentially having is a discussion about public policy, and often they seem to try to reinvent institutions that already exist<p>The Bitcoin early adopters want to replace the incumbent systems with their own so that they can enrich themselves.<p>Now that Bitcoin has had time to play out, it feels like an attack on USD with way too many downsides.')
