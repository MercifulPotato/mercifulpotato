In general stuff worked ok but little things like the touchpad was goofy and only basic functionality.  webcam had all kinds of problems.  Suspend&#x2F;resume didn&#x27;t really work.  Battery life was terrible.  Screen brightness buttons didn&#x27;t work.<p>So I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cool and people will like it but no, I&#x27;m not paying $5 month for a crappy computer experience.  Good luck though!')
