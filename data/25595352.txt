I’m sure there are other great examples but the PSF was always commendable.<p>PyCon was always meant to be affordable for as many people as it could be - via low prices and financial aid for many. Those conferences helped create many of the relationships that drove key parts of the Python ecosystem. In addition, there are&#x2F;were typically dedicated time for code sprints following the main conference. Important work happened there, often for key parts of the Python codebase or key libraries. While the budget numbers don’t say explicitly “development support” people shouldn’t presume PyCon does nothing for the language itself. Open Source conferences are not like commercial conferences. It’s community driven rather than marketing driven. That difference matters.<p>It was a smaller world when I was involved but it was and still is something special.')
