Once you give away free stuff because you used someone&#x27;s (open sourced) code, now you have to get the PR people involved.  In the future if your devs see some other open sourced code that they want to use, now instead of needing to get legal on board they also need to get PR on board.<p>&quot;Oh, hm, well we don&#x27;t really want to give away free consoles this time around.  And if we don&#x27;t then it will make us look bad because we did last time.  So don&#x27;t use that code.&quot;<p>As a dev, I don&#x27;t really want to have to check with 50 other divisions in the company before I use some open sourced stuff.  And then get denied because of some unrelated PR event is going on.')
