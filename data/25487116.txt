I had to sign up for a new plan. But they also wouldn&#x27;t let me use the new plan promos. Oh, and a month later when I got my first bill at the new rate it still had rental fees. Took about 8 months of calling each month to have the rental fee go away. And then when I finally cancelled because I was moving they charged me for not returning the modem&#x2F;router I returned over a year ago. Fun times.')
