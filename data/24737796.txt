Item(by='oxinabox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602323349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737525, text='no, the comment is the included REPL has it,\nand that most editor plug-ins (of which they exist for vim, emacs, sublime, Atom, VS-Code) intended for julia, add the same unicode shortcuts, as well as the usual syntax highlighting, keyword completion etc.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to use the, but do want to enter unicode, then you can do it the normal way.\nBut I feel like the fact that you want to enter unicode but don&#x27;t want to install a plugin to make it easier is pretty weird.\nI guess it could come up if editting someone elses code.\nAs a general rule most libraries (including the standard libary) make very limitted use of unicode in their APIs, so you don&#x27;t have to use unicode to work with the library.<p>I would go so far as to say if a library requires you to use unicode you should open an issue, and get them to add a ascii alias for that function. (julia standard library had just such an issue opened a few versions ago about the compose operator ∘ and not we have a `compose` function to match).<p>I would also say internally most packages make very limitted use of unicode also.\nEven with the plugins it is still a bit annoying to type.\nPlus often it would be a less meaningful variable name.\nE.g. why say: θ, when you could be saying `departing_assent_angle` or something else that conveys context specific meaning.\nIts nice to have the option for when it is clear, but I think pleasingly people only use it in moderation.')
