For example, the average housing price across the country has outpaced inflation metrics by a little, but if you narrow it to places of economic opportunity, it has drastically outpaced inflation. Any new growth in economic opportunity has been accompanied by even more severe growth in housing costs. The end result is that average housing prices appear flat-ish relative to income, but it has stayed that way due to massive emigration of economically disadvantaged people <i>away from areas of economic opportunity</i>.<p>What has really happened is that America fell in love with dysfunctional markets. Free market prices, but with significant regulatory capture. We&#x27;ve got cartels on housing via hyper-localized land use regulation that decreases the relative supply of housing.')
