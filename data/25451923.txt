Item(by='pengaru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608174272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451724, text='That is not the primary source of wear problems on mazda wankels.<p>What you&#x27;re describing is a challenge on peripheral port (race) engines where very large intake and exhaust ports must be bridged by the apex seals, and in the pursuit of performance their radius is often less than ideal making the transition onto and out of the port area more abrupt.<p>The spark plug hole is relatively small and circular.<p>High-mileage Mazda Wankels typically require overhauling because the <i>side</i> seals become seized in a compressed state (their springs are meager segments of sinusoidal wire, and the motor burns oil by design), resulting in excess blow-by and unintended oil burning.  Once the side seals go, the combustion gases start reaching the oil control rings, baking their soft interior seals into brittle plastic and it&#x27;s all downhill from there.<p>source: a former rx-7 enthusiast with multiple diy engine rebuilds in his past.')
