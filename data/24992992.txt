In many countries, media companies like facebook or Netflix do partnerships with mobile phone operators where the two agree that use of Netflix doesn&#x27;t count against a user&#x27;s quota. Netflix wins because they get more customer use, the operator creates a more compelling offering, and the customer wins because they get a better deal. This is called zero-rating and it flies in the face of net neutrality. There&#x27;s also the fundamental issue of ownership - if someone owns the cables, why can&#x27;t they set the rules? Especially in situations where ISPs can compete? And really, do you want yet another set of regulations set in stone, by a body like the FCC, that&#x27;s vulnerable to regulatory capture in how it interprets and enforces net neutrality? Can you even define &quot;net neutrality&quot; in terms clear enough for a regulator to enforce?<p>Point being, it&#x27;s not just about basic beliefs. There are substantive policy disagreements that don&#x27;t arise purely from social differences. Sure, there are some people who just don&#x27;t like transit. Maybe others think it&#x27;s wasteful. Did you see New York spent 2.5 <i>billion dollars</i> to build less than two miles of subway recently? Reasonable people can disagree on whether that was a good use of money.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;28&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;new-york-subway-construction-costs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;28&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;new-york-subway-...</a>')
