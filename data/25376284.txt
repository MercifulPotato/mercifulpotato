Just like Virtualization and now Containers&#x2F;Kubernetes challenged an entire industry focused on big servers, the ability to safely embed programs into the Linux Kernel w&#x2F; eBPF challenges every incumbent. We&#x27;re seeing every incumbent vendor look hard at the technology and make build vs. buy calculations. New Relic probably compared acquiring Pixie this early to either building internally or waiting to see how things developed for both the market and Pixie. I&#x27;m guessing they made a bet that the longer they waited the more expensive it would be to buy an eBPF based company. It was a good fit so they pulled the trigger, de-risking things  for both themselves and the Pixie team (Note I have no inside info this is all just a guess).')
