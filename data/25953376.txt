Aside from the early &quot;common folks&quot; that cashed out, there&#x27;s also plenty of &quot;rich folks&quot; that cashed out as well[1]. As for the losers, well the hedge funds who were shorted initially definitely lost money, although it remains to be seen whether the &quot;rich folk&quot; hedge funds who shorted this week lost money. It also remains to be seen whether the &quot;common folks&quot; that piled on this week are going make a profit or are just going to be bagholders.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;large-gamestop-shareholder...</a>')
