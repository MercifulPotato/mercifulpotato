The exact cause probably won&#x27;t be known because there&#x27;s been no video discovered that shows that portion of the warehouse and anyone close enough to have known were likely killed in the explosion. It&#x27;s not particularly important though for the purpose of the investigation because the goal was to show establish clearly that the storage was negligent so victims can seek legal redress.')
