There are <i>no</i> direct detection of dark matter <i>at all</i>, so why does she insist that the models particle physics speak of are any worse than the others?<p>At the core of the controversy around Hossenfelder is that from the fact there&#x27;s not been any really _unexpected_ experimental results for four decades concludes that there&#x27;s no point in doing particle physics. There is not really much more to the argument than that, the rest is just quoting the optimistic physicists over the pessimistic ones and pretend they don&#x27;t agree on the need for more experiments.')
