The chance that anyone who makes this claim has actually evaluated enough (or any) JS projects to see why they churn is effectively zero.<p>We have version pinning for a reason. It lets churn exist without forcing the effects of it onto other developers. I don&#x27;t care if a library I use gets updated every week or even every day, I&#x27;m not installing every new version when it&#x27;s released, that&#x27;s silly.
