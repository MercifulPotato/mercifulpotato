There were and are definitetly arguments about the distribution of power between state and federal branches of government and responsibilities.<p>Part of that balance was why the senate was created, and similar structures were adopted by many other democracies in the world and I do see the arguments why it serves a purposeful role.<p>On the other hand the EL was never about that balance, it was always largely about the southern state wanting a disproportionate say without giving slaves the power to vote. I&#x27;m also not aware of any other country adopting a similar system (probably somebody will point out a counter example though).')
