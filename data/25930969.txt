The institutions with Short Exposure are connected to the institutions who buy Robinhood data and perform high frequency trading on those orders. Citadel and Melvin can BUY GME themselves to mitigate the risks. It is likely that a substantial amount of GME is being held by the institutions who had short exposure. It&#x27;s basic risk mitigation.<p>The high frequency traders who have the Robinhood data are making money on every Buy GME order and will make money on every sell when this bubble collapses.<p>It is wrong to present this as a populist uprising.<p>This is an incredible fluctuation, a hilarious anomaly, but it is nothing more than that. It will have no lasting impact.<p>I firmly believe that the hedge funds that held GME short positions have bought into GME to mitigate their exposure. They likely bought in algorithmically using robinhood data and are making money off of retail right now.<p>My message to the people here: &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets is not a gameshark. You are still playing their game. You are still playing a rigged game and you are still losing.')
