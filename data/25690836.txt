Russian embassy isn&#x27;t that far away and I think rioters were in there plenty long (wasn&#x27;t it a couple hours?) for someone to walk over, pay 20 dollars for a trump flag, and walk in unnoticed.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if our embassies and CIA outposts have people ready to take advantage of such situations in other countries.')
