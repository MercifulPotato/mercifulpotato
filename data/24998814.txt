This <i>appears to be</i> an effective <i>long-term</i> treatment for depression and anxiety—much, much longer-term than the direct effects of the drug—the trip, or any euphoria associated with it; in some cases, on the order of months, or even, for some lucky people, <i>permanently</i>.<p>So take your &quot;this is pretend science&quot; and shove it. Just because you don&#x27;t approve of drugs that have been deemed illegal and immoral in the past doesn&#x27;t change their very real benefits to some people—or the fact that depression is not, and has never been, something that can be cured by &quot;an all expenses paid weeklong camping trip&quot; or any other pleasant experience. Mental illness is serious and debilitating, and if psilocybin and other psychedelics can be more effective treatments than what we have now—which <i>very real science</i> indicates is highly likely—then that&#x27;s going to be amazing for millions of people all over the world.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to go take your camping trip and ignore the news about it.')
