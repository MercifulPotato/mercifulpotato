If you want to steal a few dollars you just need a sharp bit of metal and an easily frightened shopkeeper.<p>Of course when you leave, the shopkeeper (assuming you didn&#x27;t murder them) can use a phone to inform the authorities. Then a manhunt begins involving resources like police and their cars, radios, guns, protocols, legal justice system, forensic investigators etc.<p>Is the sharp piece of metal a bug? Is the patch just more force, monitoring and authority?<p>Edit: And is the cost and risk of trusting an algorithm comparable to the human cost and risk in maintaining current securities &quot;authenticity&quot;, which is basically a might is right system?')
