Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[25138133], score=None, time=1605713909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137434, text='Besides the obvious point made by another commenter that two completely equivalent people won&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s not just negotiating <i>skill</i> it&#x27;s more about negotiating <i>leverage</i>.<p>A real example that I&#x27;ve seen: two workers work for the same employer and have been given offers from other companies located in a different State. The single mother in the group had significantly less leverage because she (and presumably her employer) knew she couldn&#x27;t move without potentially affecting the custody of her kids. She didn&#x27;t get a raise.<p>Or to extend your example, someone living in KC has less leverage because they cannot use the COL argument to justify higher pay. If I&#x27;m being courted by an employer to move, you better believe I&#x27;m building COL considerations into my overall salary ask.')
