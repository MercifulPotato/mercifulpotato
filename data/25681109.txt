At some point society has to decide that fair is not a moving target defined by a group with a martyr complex.<p>&gt;Right now its looking like an extreme double standard will be applied with how the BLM protesters were treated and how these protesters will be treated.<p>They are - peaceful BLM protestors faces multiple layers of federal law enforcement on the steps of buildings, yet Trump sprayed them anyways. They did not smash and enter the Capitol, which would have likely gotten them shot. On the other hand, this group tried to stop the lawful counting of electoral votes and overthrow the US government, they broke in to the capitol building and attacked congress, and the police did not stop them going in or going out.<p>So yes, there was a double standard. The right wingers as usual got much softer treatment than black people did.')
