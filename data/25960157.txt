Why stop at electing school boards?  Why not the public water company&#x27;s board, and the animal control office?  Why not elect the janitors at City Hall?  This can be extended until anything but total direct democracy is undemocratic.<p>I live in a jurisdiction with elected schoolboards as well, and I find the notion odd and somewhat anachronistic.  It seems only natural to me that public schools should be handled by the municipality&#x27;s government, or maybe the provincial one directly. (The provinces have, in practice, assumed much of the responsibility anyway.  I understand it&#x27;s the same in the USA with state laws, and state funding, being very involved in public education.)<p>Even municipal elections are marginal enough that many people don&#x27;t take them seriously here.  No one knows anything about the schoolboard elections.  I have to actively research quite a bit just to find out anything about the candidates.  I often abstain out of ignorance despite trying to inform myself!')
