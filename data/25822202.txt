Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610980881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821715, text='&gt;all popular instances have a very strong left-wing set of guidelines<p>Can you point to those guidelines on the top instances? I&#x27;m not sure which of the most popular instances prohibit, say, expression of conservative views. Though perhaps you do have a point - they might be more tolerant of far-left views than far-right views.<p>I also think defederation <i>because of</i> lax guidelines doesn&#x27;t happen as often as defederation <i>because of</i> users of other instances behaving in ways which heavily go against the guidelines - whether it&#x27;s harassment or posting porn the major instance doesn&#x27;t want, etc.<p>Fedi, moreso than Twitter, is what you make of it, and there are many (but just not <i>as</i> many) users on &#x27;lax&#x27; instances (e.g. FSE or SPC or Smug or Weeaboo.space or Gameliberty... you name it) to talk to. I have an account on a major instance, a &#x27;lax&#x27; instance, and my own instance. I have personally found I extract the least value from the local timeline &#x27;lax&#x27; instance.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of the idea that defederation-by-association is as common as another commenter here suggests.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meaningful to say a newspaper is &#x27;censored&#x27; when there&#x27;s another newspaper stand right next to it that shows <i>every</i> paper in full.')
