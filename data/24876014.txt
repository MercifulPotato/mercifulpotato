When we&#x27;re talking about a generation ship, we&#x27;re talking about something a little larger than the Gravitron.<p>Not to mention, they work within Earth&#x27;s gravity. Take a tube and spin it around you in space, it does nothing to you because there&#x27;s no other forces working on you. Nothing putting you in the frame  of the spinning tube.<p>Once you lose the Earth, it becomes a lot trickier to tie you to a frame of reference. Nothing we can make has the mass necessary.<p>The best we could likely do is accelerate a ship at 1G. But that has problems, because about halfway through your journey, you have to start decelerating. And there&#x27;s also the issue of turning.')
