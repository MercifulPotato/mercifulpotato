I can’t see it being a good invention driver for anything other than the category of “tools for lazy people”. How was the invention of the OLED driven by laziness? How about the high bypass turbofan?<p>It&#x27;s proven that &quot;doing nothing&quot; helps with creative thinking. The inventions you are talking about are a product of both hard work and laziness.<p>You can&#x27;t solve a problem by staring at your screen and thinking really, really hard for 10 hours. The solution will come to you a few hours later during a shower or a walk.<p>&gt; &quot;tools for lazy people&quot;<p>1) From the biological standpoint all tools are for lazy people. Lazy animals spend less resources, which in turn could be used for creating more lazy animals.<p>2) Our brain is wired to be lazy. This impacts both how we approach problems (form stronger neural pathways or move between system I and system II to use D. Kahneman&#x27;s example) and how we avoid them (e.g. cognitive biases)<p>3) The distinguishing feature of humans as animals is that we create tools and become dependent on them.<p>On a less serious note, I&#x27;d say that 90% of my programming work is driven by laziness.<p>For instance, I test things in advance or design them in a certain way so I don&#x27;t need to worry about them in the future.<p>This allows me for focus on more challenging problems. These at some point become boring chores. So &quot;I test things in advance or design them in a certain way so I don&#x27;t need to worry about them in the future.&quot; Rinse and repeat.')
