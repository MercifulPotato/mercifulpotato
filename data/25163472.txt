I don&#x27;t possess a deep understanding of Buddhism but I&#x27;ve visited shrines that are dedicated to different gods&#x2F;bodhisattvas like Tara or another one I don&#x27;t remember.  Maybe that&#x27;s different than a temple though, these were shrines up in the Himalya.  And the line between deities and bodhisattvas or humans doesn&#x27;t seem so clearly delineated as it is in Abrahamic religions.  Buddhism and &quot;Hinduism&quot; are intensely complex and interesting religions or sets of beliefs to me.')
