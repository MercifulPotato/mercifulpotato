There&#x27;s no use-case for having 63 bits of pointer and an extra bit saying &quot;ignore the other 63 bits&quot;.<p>As for the value case, I think the argument is pretty similar.  Why store 63 bits of value if the 64th bit says to ignore them?<p>If you&#x27;re not talking memory layouts and are looking at adding an extra field to a struct&#x2F;class.  Take you value field - if it&#x27;s not initialised yet, and null doesn&#x27;t exist, then what is its state?')
