But I think it should be clearly distinguished from the different kinds of lasting benefits that a more solid fundamental education provides, including the flexibility to adapt.<p>I&#x27;m very biased here, having studies Electrical Eng and CS before modern ML was remotely mainstream, and comparing my conceptual understanding and what I learned in school about math and linear algebra with the way things are understood by tradespeople with far more knowledge of modern tools than me. So crotchety old person- maybe, but I&#x27;m happy I went to university.')
