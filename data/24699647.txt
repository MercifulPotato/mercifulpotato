I&#x27;m also ethnically one of the &#x27;model minorities&#x27; so to some people I&#x27;m white, while to white supremacists I&#x27;m assuredly not.<p>Most people in most places are basically friendly. However.\nEven just being recognize you as &#x27;other&#x27; can get old, like being asked &quot;where are you from&quot; or riding the bus in Chicago and having to answer questions about my ethnicity from whoever was feeling tipsy enough to ask them.<p>Here&#x27;s one story of folks being un-friendly: I was at a public event, basically a version of a county fair with my wife&#x27;s family somewhere in the rural midwest. There&#x27;s a stage with small-name bands performing, food vendors, and a small carnival-ride section. As the sun sets we lose track of her parents, and as we&#x27;re looking for them I also got separated from my wife. I felt like the crowd was also slowly changing and like I was starting to attract attention in the form of unfriendly looks.  I find my wife and try to express this, but her face clearly says it&#x27;s all in my head and why am I talking about anything other than how we can find her parents. Just then a physically imposed man walks up, plants himself firmly in front of me, and asks in the least friendly way possible, &quot;how&#x27;s it going brother?&quot; I answer him in unaccented neutral native-born american english (don&#x27;t remember what i said, but likely something like &quot;good how you doin&quot;), and my wife is like, &quot;ok you&#x27;re right, we have to find my parents and leave.&quot;<p>So just to be clear - I can&#x27;t know what might have been, but I strongly suspect that having grown up here and being a native speaker made that evening simpler. And again, I&#x27;m someone who many people look at and just process as &quot;white&quot; so I can easily take my experiences as a shallow sample from the tip of the iceberg.<p>And that kind of &quot;unfriendly&quot; experience is something that happens more often if i leave coastal metropolitan areas.')
