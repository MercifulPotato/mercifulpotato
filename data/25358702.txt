I highly recommend the following both as arbitrary text fields:<p>1. Ask for &quot;Legal Name&quot; if you need it.<p>2. Ask &quot;what would you like us to call you?&quot;<p>If you are displaying users&#x27; names to others then you have infinite choices but they all boil down to &quot;what would you like us to show in this context&quot;. The simplest is just a global name but you could have different display names towards different users&#x2F;groups.')
