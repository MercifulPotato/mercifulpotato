That or something similar. Then the average user would only need very minimal amount of currency but you can only spam if you have considerable capital.<p>Maybe the deposit could also suffer a bit of value loss. Just enough to make spamming not worth it. I wonder what would be just enough here. It ought to be less than what would make it undesirable for almost all users?<p>Edit: I feel like the main problem with social media innovation is that there&#x27;s very little possibilities to experiment. You need a good amount of users to test something out and users will only go to established services.')
