For residential use, you really don&#x27;t need anything from their HD line. I have no affiliation with them other than being a very happy customer. They literally have a device for almost any networking use-case you can think of. You _do not_ need to use their cloud management capabilities, have an account with Unifi, etc to be able to use it (even though that&#x27;s what they really want you to do -- I wanted 100% local management for my own setup, so this was a hard requirement for me).<p>For your purposes, I would highly recommend checking out the Unifi Dream Machine (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.ui.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;routing-switching&#x2F;products&#x2F;unifi-dream-machine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.ui.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;routing-switching&#x2F;products&#x2F;...</a> -- not the Pro unless you already have a network rack). It&#x27;s as close to an AirPort as you can reasonably get these days. You can also get additional Unifi APs if you need more coverage (including any of their outdoor stuff) or use Unifi LTE as a backup conneciton (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unifi-lte.ui.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unifi-lte.ui.com&#x2F;</a>)<p>I&#x27;ve installed just the Dream Machine in several family members&#x27; homes and it&#x27;s a huge improvement over the nonsense that the ISPs provide them with. Personally, I run a Unifi Security Gateway, Cloud key (Gen 1), and the AC AP PRO and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. I like that I can selectively upgrade equipment when needed (for example, I upgraded my AP for better range and speed a couple years ago, but I&#x27;m still using the same USG that I got back in 2014 or something).<p>If you&#x27;re having trouble figuring out what you need and you want to go the Ubiquiti route, feel free to email me (see profile) and I can get you pointed in the right direction.')
