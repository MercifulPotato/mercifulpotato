There is no law of nature that says that conservatives cannot design software or write code. One easy way to solve this is to stop being so obnoxiously anti-intellectualist. English conservatives can do it, and they are not necessarily smart.<p>But that mob behaviour is not left or right; it is totalitarian.<p>&gt; people like Anima leading committees at the top of CS hierarchy<p>Yeah that’s a travesty.<p>&gt; If I was in rural kentucky working in a coal mine, I would be shouting about how the reactionary wing of the right has completely taken over discourse.<p>As you bloody well should. They voted for it, but these people are still getting the short end of the stick again.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m in tech&#x2F;grad-student&#x2F;urban&#x2F;academic circles, so I speak about the bad actors there.<p>As you should, too! But I think you mis-diagnose when you attribute this to leftist tendencies. This is a religious war and the real losers are reasonable people caught in the crossfire. The problem is the cult system, not the liberal flavour of one side.<p>&gt; I was careful to never mention the word &#x27;left&#x27; in my comment.<p>You’re right, sorry. ”liberal” is a centrist ideology, even though apparently some people think it’s communism (which is absolutely not liberal).<p>&gt; This wing of ultra-prescriptive &#x2F; thought-policing &#x27;hyper-liberal&#x27; left is very &quot;North American college campus phenomenon&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t map onto left movements around the world at all.<p>Yes! The contexts are very different. Although this has bothered me quite a bit recently, seeing the same sound bites getting translated for local consumption in several European country. It seems this behaviour is contagious.<p>This is not what liberalism is, though, any more than neocons or the alt-right are actually about conservatism. Liberalism is about individual freedom. Thought police is an aspect that some supposedly progressives imported directly from Stalinism.')
