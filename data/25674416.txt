Every party involved, from the courts, to the (republican) GA government, to the media, to the pollworkers, to me, is telling you this was audited to hell and back, but you don&#x27;t give a shit.<p>Instead you post a video that was actually discussed in the call you&#x27;re so concerned about, where the Secretary of state clearly says the edited version you posted was designed to make it look fishy, and after review of the full footage by auditors and the media, there wasn&#x27;t anything there.<p>You&#x27;re not arguing in good faith.  You&#x27;re either ignorant or intentionally deceitful, and I want no more part of it.')
