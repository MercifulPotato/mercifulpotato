Yes, master of none, but most consumer grade lasers tend not to have copiers&#x2F;scanners or (shudder) fax capability.  The (deceivingly) low entry price for &quot;all that power!&quot; seals the deal.  It also avoids having multiple printers, which is tough in a small room.  So most folks take the quality hit knowingly, even as they don&#x27;t prepare for the companies to change the rules, on an already purchased product, midstream.')
