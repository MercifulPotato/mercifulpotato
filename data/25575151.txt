Yes, it sucks that Apple&#x27;s suppliers are unethical, but what am I supposed to do if I want to Snapchat my girlfriend or talk to my friends, or have a phone that is compatible with itunes&#x2F;apple music?

Why is it my responsibility to save them but business as usual for those that want to exploit me?')
