Item(by='m23khan', descendants=None, kids=[25619223], score=None, time=1609639837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605211, text='Frankly speaking, it sounds the author ended up joining a &#x27;dud&#x27; team where the entire team is well steeped with playing politics rather than actually being productive. It happens in large companies and sometimes in small ones as well. How these unproductive teams survive is beyond me but they do.<p>I hope the Author realizes one thing: Never ever complain to Manager and&#x2F;or HR in any company about other team member UNLESS they disclose themselves to you that they don&#x27;t like that person and ask you for your negative input -- even then, keep it almost neutral &#x2F; slightly negative. And if you do make the mistake of complaining, DO NOT EVER do it over email&#x2F;chat&#x2F;anything written -- a simple call &#x2F; over-the-coffee conversation is more than enough. Based on this fact, its hard for me to fault the Senior Manager &#x2F; Director &#x2F; VP at Apple the Author talked about -- once this kind of thing starts, at any company it is expected outcome from Management.<p>From what I can deduce - the Manager and the violent co-worker were best of friends and Manager was going all out trying to protect that co-worker who was a toxic and non functioning employee. The Manager and co-worker kept on making stupid rules and confrontational policies and the Author kept on thinking she doesn&#x27;t have any choice and is stuck otherwise she will get deported -- I mean, USA (or any other Country) is not a place where you would end up going in depression over for and start popping mental health pills for while contemplating suicide. I would choose my dignity and sanity even if it meant going back to Yemen or Somalia or somewhere similar. The Author could have simply started applying for jobs in lots of countries for some R&amp;D job or post-doc position and should have left Apple.')
