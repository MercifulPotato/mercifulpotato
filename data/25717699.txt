What I don’t have is the ability to reply, retweet, tweet myself or DM. This is a benefit for me.<p>There’s also not the ability to have privacy of networks. Maybe you could generate a unique ID for everyone that follows you then only once they’re allowed access by you, publish to that feed. I’d want the ability to host and share my own content with people I know but not people I don’t.')
