I don&#x27;t understand what confused state of mind leads anyone to assume that any field of engineering, specially software development, doesn&#x27;t deal with one off quick and dirty tests.<p>What really boggles the mind is that any data analyst worth his salt knows very well that he needs to track his inputs to be able to analyse the outputs, thus software development practices are far more forgiving than data analysis ones.<p>It seems to me that the author just wants to make excuses for shoddy work.')
