Given that we both got tested, that $300 seems a bit cheaper than $800.<p>&gt; And if you think you&#x27;re employer just absorbs that cost, realize that the extra cost would be in your pocket as wages if it weren&#x27;t going towards healthcare.<p>lolz. This is quite the assumption. Wages have been holding steady despite massive corporate tax breaks. Why? Because corporations pocket the saved money without passing the savings onto employees. If I didn&#x27;t get health insurance, it&#x27;s quite unlikely that the savings would be passed onto me in the form of wages.<p>And even if I was given the wages:<p>1.) Wages are taxable. My healthcare is pre-tax.<p>2.) There&#x27;s absolutely no way I could get the healthcare I currently enjoy for $300 a month on the open market. The risk pool for my company (Amazon) is so large that it effectively subsidizes my insurance.')
