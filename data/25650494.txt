Item(by='kitsunesoba', descendants=None, kids=[25653339], score=None, time=1609878067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650309, text='I am not a browser developer, but the impression I get is that the issue with the webRequest API is that the amount of overhead that can be added to a function that&#x27;s invoked extremely frequently (loading resources) is unbounded and difficult to optimize. It entrusts a pillar of browser performance to extension developers, which is a dicey proposition.<p>This leads me to think that if Apple were to add support for something like the webRequest API, it&#x27;d likely be via the native half of the extension API and potentially even Swift-only so there can be stronger guarantees on things like execution time. This may also allow users of the API to better take advantage of multithreading for more complex operations.<p>I may be misunderstanding something about how the webRequest API is traditionally implemented that deals with these concerns however, in which case feel free to correct me.')
