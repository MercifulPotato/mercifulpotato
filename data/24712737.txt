Google has made the argument that &quot;this means doom-and-gloom&quot; and Oracle that &quot;this is technically illegal&quot;. It makes sense that they&#x27;re interrogating the parties along the lines of the arguments that have been presented. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a signal that they favor one over the other.')
