This is not a difference of opinion.<p>Further, I specifically mentioned free speech idealism as something that was failing, in the context of people running internet services promising to carry absolutely everything (as the OP was talking about). &quot;Freedom of speech&quot; and &quot;freedom to use other people&#x27;s infrastructure to bullhorn your hate to millions&quot; are not the same thing. You&#x27;re still allowed to speak your mind in your local park even if I decide I don&#x27;t want to carry your bile on my service.')
