Item(by='Nursie', descendants=None, kids=[25835249], score=None, time=1611047337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830681, text='The consequences of unfettered freedom to propagate lies on mass communication platforms under the banner of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; has directly endangered the democratic proces in the US, less than a week ago.<p>So to throw your own phrase back at you - it seems pretty obvious to me that democracy is threatened by what we currently think of as freedom of speech on mass media platforms, just as much as you think it would be threatened by any challenge to free speech.<p>It annoys me that you can look around at the world and decide I&#x27;m talking about limits on &quot;acceptable opinion&quot; when we&#x27;re seeing phenomena like Q, which is based on abject fantasy. This is not a difference of opinion, this is a wannabe coup based on motivated lies.<p>Further, I specifically mentioned free speech <i>idealism</i> as something that was failing, in the context of people running internet services promising to carry absolutely everything (as the OP was talking about). &quot;Freedom of speech&quot; and &quot;freedom to use other people&#x27;s infrastructure to bullhorn your hate to millions&quot; are not the same thing. You&#x27;re still allowed to speak your mind in your local park, or email your weird-ass opinions to your family, even if I decide I don&#x27;t want to carry your bile on my service.<p>Why is it that you think any limit imposed on such mass communications is a democracy destroying limit on ideas? This appears to be an absolutist way of looking at things, in a world where we don&#x27;t currently have absolutes anyway. It&#x27;s not like we have unfettered free speech, even in the US. Is Germany no longer a democracy because it outlaws holocaust denial? Are you going to throw accusations at them of being purveyors of &#x27;acceptable opinion&#x27; ?')
