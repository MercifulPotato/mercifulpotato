Item(by='jjk166', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609361121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575736, text='10 tanker cars all instantaneously emptying directly into a 2 feet deep and 10 feet wide v shaped channel at the same point is not at all realistic. For starters, your V shaped channel is perfectly full when the LNG is spread out over a mile - over the preceding 4 minutes the LNG was spilling over the side of the channel onto the surrounding flat ground, dramatically increasing the amount of ambient heat it would have absorbed.<p>In a real scenario, the cars are going to be spread out over an area, their ruptures will be relatively small orifices that the fluid must flow through, it&#x27;s going to spill out rapidly in all directions from that point, any area where a train is passing through is going to be decently wide and flat, worst case scenario probably a 50 foot wide street.<p>You can look up pictures of derailed tanker cars, for example [0], and see the area where the liquid spills over. By the time the contents of a tanker car have spread over an area of 1 acre, the fluid is only 1in deep, even if none of it vaporizes it&#x27;s limited in how far it can meaningfully spread. The spill of a cryogenic fluid will by necessity cover less area. As you can see, the spill of 322,000 gallons of flammable liquid affects an area comparable to that threatened by the derailed train cars themselves. That fire lasted 36 hours, wouldn&#x27;t it be great if all the fuel evaporated in 36 minutes?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.progressiverailroading.com&#x2F;federal_legislation_regulation&#x2F;news&#x2F;NTSB-Ethanol-train-derailment-underscores-need-for-safe-tank-cars--56009" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.progressiverailroading.com&#x2F;federal_legislation_r...</a>')
