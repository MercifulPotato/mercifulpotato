Item(by='frits1993', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603363096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24856610, text='Manual account activation because the &quot;please click this link to confirm your email address&quot; email somehow does not end up in my user&#x27;s inbox, is one of the most frequent support requests I get.<p>I built an API (private for now) which offers a solution to these scenarios, and may work as an alternative to passive email validation.<p>Instead of receiving an email, users are asked to send an email to a unique email address to confirm their email address (this - by the way - also filters out temporary receive-only email addresses)<p>A proof of concept can be found here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;confirm-email.progresso-ict.nl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;confirm-email.progresso-ict.nl</a>. I can imagine the API to be used for account creation, password recovery, signing up for newsletters, etc.<p>Even though, with a clickable mailto address, the amount of steps are equal or similar to receiving a confirmation email, my girlfriend tells me the method is cumbersome.<p>So, what does the HN community think? Other questions I still have to investigate are mainly security-related. Emails are spam-filtered by Amazon SES, yet have to test for spoofing.')
