Item(by='book-sandworm', descendants=None, kids=[25570146], score=None, time=1609239386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564666, text='Kind of disappointing to read the comments here. The introduction talks about semantics of teaching. How phrasing can demotivate the students.<p>He goes over some rough edges and explains why they might be rough. He uses the word unfortunately here on purpose, to distinct it from bad, or weird or whatever.<p>Concluding he writes about how some of the unfortunate parts are needed to make typescript great.<p>That is confusing to me, he&#x27;s talking about teaching, and using these examples for future teachers to think about in their field. Reading the comments here, they all seem to discuss the examples. I&#x27;m sitting here, thinking did I missing something, should I be discussing the examples? As someone that written many lines of code in different language. I can ignore the idiosyncrasies. But when you are new, it&#x27;s really hard.<p>Similar that is why I&#x27;m always in awe of clojure&#x2F;lisps. It&#x27;s so minimal and predictable. you don&#x27;t have to learn 100 million different syntaxes or exceptions. S-expressions, maps bools, data and go.')
