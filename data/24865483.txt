For example, Dell&#x27;s UP2716D has 4 inputs (2 HDMI, 2 DP).  Dell&#x27;s other professional grade monitors have similar numbers of inputs.  The downside is that switching inputs is mildly awkward using the monitor controls but the inconvenience is relatively minor.<p>- As for wireless audio, physically wire up your audio sources to a 3.5mm audio switch or even a tiny mixer (search for &quot;mini audio mixer&quot; on Amazon) and connect it to a Bluetooth transmitter.  Pair your headphones with the transmitter.<p>If you use the monitor for switching video sources and can configure your machines to output audio over HDMI&#x2F;DP, then the BT transmitter can be connected directly to the monitor&#x27;s soundbar output, saving you some wiring.<p>- That leaves you with needing to switch your USB devices but switch boxes for USB are plentiful and cheap.')
