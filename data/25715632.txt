I&#x27;m not saying their won&#x27;t be another crash. It&#x27;s just that anyone claiming they know when it will be is either lying or a 1-in-a-million genius who could make a fortune working for a hedge fund but for some reason is giving the information away for free on HN...<p>I have a share portfolio that&#x27;s 70&#x2F;30 stocks&#x2F;bonds because that suits my age and risk appetite. If it crashes I can live with losses, if the market goes up I can live with the missed opportunity.<p>I have some &quot;gambling&quot; money in a separate account that I buy risky stuff with. If I lose it all, cest la vie.<p>That&#x27;s all anyone can do really.<p>(Edit, I should have been clear: my portfolio is in index funds, not individual stocks. The &quot;gambling&quot; money is in individual stocks ONLY because its gambling money not a real investment. Index funds are where 95% of us should be with 95% of our case IMHO.)')
