Thus,\nwe propose the use of the following\nthree-part number as a metric\nto gauge advancement of future\nsemiconductor technologies: [DL,\nDM , DC ], where DL is the density\nof logic transistors (in #&#x2F;mm2), DM\nis the bit density of main memory\n(currently the off-chip DRAM density,\nin #&#x2F;mm2), and DC is the density\nof connections between the main\nmemory and logic (in #&#x2F;mm2).\nAs an example, today’s leading edge\ntechnologies that are published in\nthe literature [15]–[17] can be\ncharacterized by [38M, 383M, 12K].\nAs another example, 3-D stacking of\nmultiple logic and memory dies can\nincrease DL, DM, and DC .</i>')
