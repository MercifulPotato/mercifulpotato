I&#x27;m not proud of these seedy days, in fact its something I think most of us are ashamed of entirely and would prefer to be solely known for tech, beaches and sunshine. But it isn&#x27;t true, and it baffles me as a person who lived through that to see many people claiming this the worst CA has ever seen. It&#x27;s definitely bad, and perhaps underscores why California should be its own Country in my opinion.<p>But we&#x27;ve been here and done that and to a much worse degree then proceeded to make a place for outsiders to come when it all went well, and they then jacked up the cost of living and made it a worst place to be and raise children only to flee in hard times so many times we should be used to it, but it still sucks to see California like this after all we did.<p>I&#x27;ve lived and worked all over the Western World, but California in the 90s was a magical place despite all the crazy stuff that actually would instill resilience and problem solving skills out of necessity in me since I was a child just to survive. Skills that I know I would have gotten if I grew up in Zurich, Vienna or Bavaria or some other placid place.<p>I just hope we get to see it once more as every time I go back it looks further and further away from the place I knew and loved.')
