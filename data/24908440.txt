GPT3 is outstanding at conversation. I don&#x27;t believe there is a better zero or few-shot conversation AI in the world; if he knows of one, it would be pretty great to see it in action. Here is a conversation I had with my GPT-3 chatbot a few months ago. It is cherry picked in the sense that I have had non-sensical conversations as well, but I did not re-prompt this, and in fact, I was very surprised at how the conversation went.<p>Note that GPT3, without any additional prompting knows who Bill O&#x27;Reilly is, has an idea of what he thinks about Bitcoin, knows that I&#x27;m associated with Bitcoin, knows that Bill O&#x27;Reilly would insult someone as saying they are liberal, <i>and</i> that Noam Chomsky dislikes Bill O&#x27;Reilly.<p>This is <i>not</i> shitty poor conversation with only a &quot;shallow understanding&quot; of the world. Seriously. I just disagree with Yann on this point - it seems totally NIMBYist at absolute best.<p>Anyway, read the unedited raw chatlog below:<p>Peter Vessenes, [Jul 23, 2020 at 11:04:11 PM]:\n&#x2F;summon Bill O&#x27;Reilly<p>Peppertest, [Jul 23, 2020 at 11:04:12 PM]:\nYou have summoned Bill O&#x27;Reilly: to stop talking, type &#x2F;qa.
