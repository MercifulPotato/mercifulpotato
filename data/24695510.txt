I was introduced to them through Andy Wingo&#x27;s blog wingolog.org and ported some call&#x2F;cc benchmarks to use delimited continuations tomlearn howmto use them (and how they differ). Then I went head first into the source code of guile-fibers, a parallel concurrent ML implementation for guile that uses delimited continuations. It implements a full CML system as a library, which really is a testament to the power of delimited continuations.<p>There is a lecture by Matthew Flatt held at Microsoft research about delimited continuations where he uses a web server to show the differences of delimited vs undelimited continuations somewhere in YouTube.<p>Edit: btw the speed difference with regards to overhead between call&#x2F;cc and call-with-prompt was something like an order of magnitude for simple things like generators and the rather well known fibcc benchmark.')
