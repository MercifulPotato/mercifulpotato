Methylphenidate gave me these zombie like spacing out symptoms. I later switched to Amphetamine and didn&#x27;t feel the negative side effects of Methylphenidate.<p>Methylphenidate is the only authorized substance for ADHD treatment here in Germany. I had to pay for my Amphetamine treatment by myself. I had the impression that the pharmaceutical industry doesn&#x27;t have an interest in getting an authorization for amphetamines as that substance can be produced by a local pharmacy on site. Even thou I can confirm that the side effects are much less with amphetamines.<p>Now age 35 I haven&#x27;t taken any medications for ADHD for 8 or 9 years. It was good to help me with school and university but now I don&#x27;t need to put myself into a position where medication could be helpful. Still wouldn&#x27;t want to work in an open floor plan office. Not sure if that is an medical condition.')
