If you short the stock, you act to reduce the price excursion and potentially help the eventual victims.<p>Suppose it&#x27;s not a pump-n-dump, but rather &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;---people buying a stock and raising the share price for non-economic reasons. Short selling applies alternate pressure on the stock price, reducing the effects of a subsequent correction.')
