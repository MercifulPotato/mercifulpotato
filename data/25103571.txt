Maybe pre-seed-stage startups pay much less, but I really haven’t run into any issues around feeling like I’m missing out on significant salary benefits, so FIRE seems to still hold.<p>External validation and PR — eh. My own experience differs, in tech and outside of tech. Personally, way back when, I turned down multiple Ivies to attend a small liberal arts college relatively few have heard about and have absolutely no regrets — people who have actually affected my life <i>have</i> heard of it, and I think it’s gotten me to where I am much faster and easier than going the conventional route.')
