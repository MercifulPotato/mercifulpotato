I spent a month in lockdown not able to access the things I&#x27;d left in my car&#x27;s boot (trunk) which can only be opened when the battery-powered central locking is available.<p>Anecdotally, once some modern car batteries die in this way, they fail to hold a charge at all, so classic jump-starting doesn&#x27;t work.
