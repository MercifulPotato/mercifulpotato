A well built tool like this, meeting standard expectations (i.e. table stakes), would hit &lt;50ms for the end user - the vast majority of the time. A &quot;dream world&quot; would be more like 10ms.<p>You should be targeting &lt;200ms for 99% of user-facing interactions. That is the baseline standard&#x2F;minimum expected.<p>This is why people are saying the company needs to make a major shift on this - you&#x27;re not just out of the ballpark of table stakes here, you&#x27;re barely in the same county!<p>It cannot be overstated how far off the mark you are here. There&#x27;s a fundamental missetting of expectations and understanding of what is acceptable.')
