People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.”\n–Daryl Zanuck, co-founder of 20th Century Fox, 1946<p>“There is practically no chance communications space satellites will be used to provide better telephone, telegraph, television, or radio service inside the United States.”\n–FCC Commissioner T.
