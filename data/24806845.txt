One can also overshoot in an attempt to be (&#x27;brutally&#x27;, common qualifier) honest.<p>There&#x27;s situations that are simply ambiguous, contradictory, and where honesty is more an attempt to defuse or clarify than well, actually honest.<p>For example there are a lot of people who always attempt to be honest, and then tend to hand out advice to people without really knowing what the other person is actually about.<p>I think there&#x27;s a reason lying or at least omitting things exists and it&#x27;s not just being a coward, it can also be legitimate deferral and in a way humility, I can&#x27;t assume that I always have all the facts and simply opine on an issue.')
