A 2005 federal study demonstrated that while injuries from right angle or T-bone crashes decreased by 16 percent at red-light camera intersections, injuries from rear-end collisions increased by 24 percent.</i>&quot;<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;red-light-running" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;red-light-running</a> &quot;<i>When it comes to crash reductions, an IIHS study comparing large cities with red light cameras to those without found the devices reduced the fatal red light running crash rate by 21 percent and the rate of all types of fatal crashes at signalized intersections by 14 percent (Hu &amp; Cicchino, 2017).</i>&quot; (Referring to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;bibliography&#x2F;ref&#x2F;2121" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;bibliography&#x2F;ref&#x2F;2121</a>.)<p>&quot;<i>Previous research in Oxnard, California, found significant citywide crash reductions followed the introduction of red light cameras, and injury crashes at intersections with traffic signals were reduced by 29 percent (Retting &amp; Kyrychenko, 2002). Front-into-side collisions — the crash type most closely associated with red light running — at these intersections declined by 32 percent overall, and front-into-side crashes involving injuries fell 68 percent.</i>&quot; (Referring to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;bibliography&#x2F;ref&#x2F;1510" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;bibliography&#x2F;ref&#x2F;1510</a>.)<p>&quot;<i>The Cochrane Collaboration, an international public health organization, reviewed 10 controlled before-after studies of red light camera effectiveness (Aeron-Thomas &amp; Hess, 2005). Based on the most rigorous studies, there was an estimated 13-29 percent reduction in all types of injury crashes and a 24 percent reduction in right-angle injury crashes.</i><p>&quot;<i>Not all studies have reported increases in rear-end crashes. The review by the Cochrane Collaboration did not find a statistically significant change in rear-end injury crashes (Aeron-Thomas &amp; Hess, 2005).</i>&quot; (Both referring to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15846684&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15846684&#x2F;</a>.)<p>&quot;<i>A study sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration evaluated red light camera programs in seven cities (Council et al., 2005). It found that, overall, right-angle crashes decreased by 25 percent while rear-end collisions increased by 15 percent. Results showed a positive aggregate economic benefit of more than $18.5 million in the seven communities.</i>&quot; (Referred to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fhwa.dot.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research&#x2F;safety&#x2F;05048&#x2F;05048.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fhwa.dot.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research&#x2F;safety&#x2F;05048&#x2F;...</a>.)')
