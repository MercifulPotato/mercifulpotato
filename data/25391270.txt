I agree there is risk of larger technical improvements not happening enough if you only measure the number of changes.<p>Maybe a few things are happening:<p>1. Some large technical improvements can be shipped in multiple changes that add value.<p>2. Most companies do more large technical changes than is optimal.<p>3. Engineers are motivated to make the large technical changes since they are interesting and make their future work easier so they will prioritize them despite the measure.<p>4. GitLab is having fewer larger technical improvements than optimal.<p>5. Our dual career structure ensures that there are engineers who can do these larger technical improvements without being below average themselves because they are more productive than others.<p>6. We are not pushing very hard on this metric since we do it in a group setting instead of per individual.')
