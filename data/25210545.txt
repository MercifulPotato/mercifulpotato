Probably they tried to steal it right then and there, thieves don&#x27;t like to return to a crime scene.<p>For Tesla, if they really want they could pry open the frunk and remove the 12V power from the low-voltage battery, then winch the car onto a flatbed. That would disable the GPS tracking and allow access to make money parting out the car. Although not the motors, which are locked to the VCSEC and the owner&#x27;s configured keys, and bypassing that is still an open problem AFAIK.')
