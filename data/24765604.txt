Integrators seek to monetize consumers to the maximum extent.<p>I think this hits the point on the head here. The most recent example of this is Disney setting the rental price for their new Mulan film at $30. Keep in mind, that&#x27;s $30 _on top_ of whatever you&#x27;re paying for your Disney Plus subscription.<p>Quality issues with that film aside, the fact that Disney was able to charge _so much_ above the market norm for rentals ($2-$5) forecasts a future where streaming companies slowly increase their prices as bad as the cable television companies of yore.')
