I browsed WSB a ton in 2016&#x2F;2017, while in college. Doubled my initial investment (not much) in a year, and most importantly, learned a ton. I&#x27;m still trading now, but don&#x27;t browse there as much and still have success. I guess maybe I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones? I have a friend who  browsed the sub back then as well. He bought some of the meme stocks at the time (mostly AMD) and has been holding since. AMD was ~$7 then and is now ~$94.<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of dumb crazy bets on there, and it has become a bit different since options trading started on Robinhood, but it&#x27;s still a great place to learn things and get investment ideas.<p>Most of the meme stocks have seemed to perform well (outside of biopharmaceuticals they memed about back then).')
