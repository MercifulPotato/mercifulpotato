To make matters worse, the neuron then converts the uptaken dopamine into hydrogen peroxide, which is VERY toxic to that part of the neuron (the axon terminal), which then causes it to fizzle away.<p>I recall a way around that (other than by just not taking MDMA at all, obviously) is to take an SSRI (like Prozac) at some point after rolling, which would bind to the reuptake transporters, preventing dopamine from doing so.')
