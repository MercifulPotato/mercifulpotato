So far every study I have found — linking micro-plastics to physical harm done to multicellular organisms — had the phrase &quot;potential&quot; (or a derivative) in it.<p>I dislike plastic as much as the next guy, but I slowly get the feeling: the harmful effects of plastic have the same level of scientific proof as harm caused by radiation of mobile phones — inconclusive to likely _none_.')
