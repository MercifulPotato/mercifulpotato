Item(by='studius', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1609770113, title='Tell HN: Proposal for Mod Strikes', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I propose a notion of mod strikes to combat voting-related problems, to better address a problem in HN that so far has been addressed via a comment within the HN guidelines and FAQ:<p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.&quot;<p>With the ability for either a user or mod to &quot;flag downvotes&quot;, a mod could more easily see problematic downvoting <i>and</i> do something about it via a new action called a &quot;strike&quot;.<p>This would give users a way to react quietly to what may have been a negligent downvote and give the mods a way to address it.<p>Note that comments about voting that go against the existing guideline would still be flaggable as they are today.<p>Some additional thoughts on how this sort of downvote flagging could be handled:<p>Downvoting could only be flagged if the comment has zero points or less, and must happen within 13 days of the comment&#x27;s last update.<p>When a downvote is flagged, a copy would be made of the original downvoted comment along with a link to the comment, unless one existed already for the same comment text at the time of downvoting, in which case the tally of downvote flags would be incremented.<p>This list could be made available for review by the mods for up to 13 days beyond the last downvote flag action. Mods could mark a flagged comment as addressed, which would move them to the bottom of the list with indication they were addressed by that mod.<p>Mod strike = loss of 13^N karma points, defining N as the total lifetime mod strikes for that user.')
