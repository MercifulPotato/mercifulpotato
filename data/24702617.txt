I just get a bit weary of the &quot;free market will fix it&quot; attitude, because it&#x27;s only really free market if all involved parties are free to set the terms of the transactions, and most consumers of healthcare do not actually have much power to do that (or even to know the terms before &quot;purchase&quot;).  So the &quot;free market,&quot; to the extent that it exists, optimizes for those participants who <i>do</i> have that power, to the detriment of the end user.  In my opinion, of course.')
