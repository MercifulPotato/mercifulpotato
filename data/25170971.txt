I brought in an inexpensive mechanical keyboard, a nice mouse, some decent speakers and a headset, then requisitioned a second monitor from the surplus room. Granted, I had my own office so the noise bothering other people wasn&#x27;t an issue. I would wager many places wouldn&#x27;t allow bringing in your own equipment, but unless it&#x27;s explicitly prohibited, I would happily spend a few hundred for a day to day quality of life improvement.<p>Software is another big thing overlooked by a lot of companies, in my experience. I&#x27;ve bought a Jetbrains account to use for my development because the effective $12.50&#x2F;month I spend on it is nothing in comparison to the productivity benefit I get from it.')
