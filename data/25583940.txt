The trend also shows that the US is losing the capability to manufacture high-end products such as iphones, planes ( 737-max), and trains.  The manufacturing jobs which are returning tend to be making the same things that were made 3 decades ago with both inferior wages and quality to what those workers did previously (see American Factory).<p>While lifting billions of people out of poverty in China and the developed world is a laudable achievement, and the realization of competitive international products was nigh inevitable - the elimination of domestic manufacturing in the US was largely the result of policy choices which enabled businesses to move out of US environmental and labor regulations while still selling into the US market.')
