Never ordered anything from them.<p>The last time I checked, their website looked very counter intuitive and also down right ugly. Many products are seemingly garbage or counterfeit, the review system is bad and the workers and sellers are not treated well or properly respected... and I could go on.<p>I don&#x27;t want to lecture anyone about ethics, but it&#x27;s astonishing how little personal responsibility anyone takes when it comes to using services from such a company. Doing business with them is just completely off-putting to me.')
