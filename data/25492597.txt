They do not even have to know how to code. Give them a link to the leetcode problem list or similar, tell them to filter the page by &lt;your chosen difficulty&gt;, and select a problem at random and message you the link. Solve the problem in front of them like you would in a real interview.<p>I created a small cheatsheet for my friends who did this for me, as non of them were professional programmers. My cheatsheet was essentially<p>Step 1: I will read the problem back to you, probably paraphrased in my own words and then ask you to confirm some assumptions. You can say &quot;yes&quot; to every assumption I ask you.<p>Step 2: I will verbalize my thought process to solve the problem. This may involve writing a tiny bit of code to layout the task, but there should not be much code or any yet.<p>Step 3: I will start actually coding the solution. If I write code for more than 30 seconds without verbalizing my thoughts, alert me. If I&#x27;m not writing code but silent for more than a minute, alert me. You don&#x27;t need to understand what I&#x27;m saying or writing, just make sure I am almost always talking.<p>Step 4: I will try to walk through my finished code step-by-step and make sure it works. Again, you don&#x27;t need to understand what I&#x27;m saying, just make sure I&#x27;m always saying something.<p>--<p>One last thing that may help ease your mind a bit. Maybe I&#x27;ve just been very lucky with my interviewees, but I&#x27;ve found that communication skills and being able to lay out very clean code as my final answer is just as helpful as actually being able to quickly solve the problem. I&#x27;ve needed a hint from the interviewer a lot of times to solve my question. Simply asking for a hint is obviously not good, but saying something like &quot;This code won&#x27;t work in the case where all 3 points make a parallel line, and I&#x27;m trying to come up with a solution for that... I feel like there&#x27;s another way I can visualize this that I&#x27;m not seeing right now&quot; is better.<p>Good luck, coding tests suck. But you gotta do what you gotta do.')
