Women can be managers as well.<p>Edit: I understand other languages might have gendered nouns for words like Manager, and when learning English it can be difficult to break these habits.<p>In English, we have gender neutral pronouns to use when were talking about &quot;generic people&quot; where the gender isnt known. Managers are not just male, so when a sentence is gendered like that I struggle to parse it because I think I&#x27;ve missed a the reason why this hypothetical manager is male.')
