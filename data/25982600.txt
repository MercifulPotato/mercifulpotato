The question is then, &#x2F;where&#x2F; should one draw the line when trying to prove certain properties of code; which properties are worthwhile proving?<p>Are you &#x2F;seriously&#x2F; suggesting that one should use Agda or Coq for most code?<p>EDIT. The original comment was suggesting as though dynamic and static type-systems are a dichotomy. I was pointing out that it is a sliding scale from nominally-typed ala Go, all the way to dependently-typed languages; and that&#x27;s not even including model-checkers!')
