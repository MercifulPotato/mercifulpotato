The guys who stockpile food, water, ammo, etc. that they&#x27;ll likely never use but might. They deliberately optimize for the 5% or 0.5%, rather than the 95%. They assume independence will eventually be needed (running water may one day be unavailable), where the author is willing to risk relying on inter-dependence (car rentals and hotels will always be available). The survivalists firmly espouse the &quot;when I need it, it&#x27;s there&quot; point of view. I don&#x27;t know if one view is right or wrong, but they are clearly opposite approaches to dealing with tail risk.')
