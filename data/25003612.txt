The theory allows you to take two quite different stacks of changes and interleave them in a consistent way. It does not rely on low latency or a centralized server. The choice of arbitrary tie breaker vs. manual resolution in the case of conflicts is an application domain choice not mandated by the theory. Obviously in the case of Docs the tie breaker makes more sense.')
