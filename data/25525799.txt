It’s the complete opposite of the simple &amp; clean interfaces clients ask us to design.<p>I’ve spent some time thinking about why these Fantasy UIs are so fascinating despite the fact they seem not very user friendly.<p>My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts (dancing banana gifs) and you had to figure out the navigation on each website you visited. Today, everything looks and feels the same and we lost the creative spirit of interface building.<p>Figuring out the interface might not be best practice. But at the same time, I remember sharing websites with friends purely based on how fun the navigation and overall controls were.<p>We lost the Art of interface building and turned it into a complete science. There are arguments for both sides.<p>My wish is that... Hopefully.. one day, someone will contact us with a project that allows us to build the first fantasy UI for a real-world SaaS product.')
