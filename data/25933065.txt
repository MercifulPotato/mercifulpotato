Before, elasticsearch and&#x2F;or kibana were usable together with (A)GPL licensed code. That’s no longer the case, neither under SSPL nor under the elastic license.<p>The fact that most users use the basic license may well be explained by two things:<p>A) Your website offers it as the primary download.<p>B) Elasticsearch without the basic licensed modules lacks severely when it comes to security features. It doesn’t even offer basic auth, let alone TLS or similar.')
