It seems like mostly just people using facebook as a proxy for real world interactions.<p><i>Twitter</i> on the other hand is just pure toxic garbage which seems made to intentionally divide people and incite hatred and eventually violence.<p>I think there is a simple explanation for this: the people writing these articles are twitter users, and the people who use facebook are their outgroup.')
