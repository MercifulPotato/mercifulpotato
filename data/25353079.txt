With mainstream publications and members of government attacking “lefty lawyers” and “unelected judges” simply for doing their job, which is to uphold the law, we need to take the rhetoric we apply to these situations seriously. There need to be serious consequences for credible threats of violence against people, even when made by people in the public sphere.<p>Furthermore, I hear a lot of people say things like “how can lawyers defend people who do such horrible things”. I think it is an important part of our education to understand civics, and why we are entitled to a defence, rather than just subjected to the whims of an inquisition. Having a well-resourced defence for alleged criminals (and other legal aid in civil cases) means that we can be certain as a society that we get the right person for crimes, and ensures the system runs as intended.')
