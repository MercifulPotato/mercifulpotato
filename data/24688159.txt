However, I guess my point is:<p>- If someone is reliant on the government for basic necessities of life, should they ideally work to reach a state where they can provide for themselves using their own income&#x2F;skills&#x2F;etc. and wean themselves off of government aid?<p>- If the answer to the previous question is &#x27;yes&#x27;, how can we subsidize&#x2F;incentive getting off of government aid? It seems to me that it&#x27;s easy to get stuck in an inter-generational trench where the government provides your food, shelter, etc. I&#x27;m interested in how to help people help themselves.')
