From community college, you can transfer to a good state school. The mechanism exists to take kids from mediocre schools, get the ones who are interested up-to-speed in a less chaotic environment, and put them into a state university, without them being super-geniuses or 1,000% intrinsically motivated or something.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s a government program that gets millions and millions of kids who&#x27;d rather be playing Fortnite or hanging out at the skate park to at least learn the bare minimum in a somewhat standardized way.<p>The socioeconomic limitations on kids trying to progress through that system is a different thing, and that&#x27;s a hurdle that I don&#x27;t know that we have functional systems in place to deal with.')
