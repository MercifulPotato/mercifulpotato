It&#x27;s a pretty big poster, about a square meter of paper. Every pore and protein&#x27;s function is represented. The Kreb&#x27;s Cycle is in a corner of this thing. All the chain reactions are there, with lines trying to vainly connect it all together. The font on it is ~9 pt., I think. And it&#x27;s double sided. I can&#x27;t find a good link on Google, but other biologists will know what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>That poster is the result of ~70 years of hardcore work and blood and sweat of ~10k+ people on the human mitochondria. That poster alone is worth billions of dollar of research and will likely save billions of lives. And it&#x27;s just the normal functions of the human mitochondria. One of <i>many</i> organelles in a &#x27;typical&#x27; human cell. I&#x27;m not aware of any attempts to produce such a thing for something as complicated as the ER or the nucleus.<p>Our understanding of bio is <i>very much</i> limited. But I want to stress that Bio is complicated much more beyond what anyone thinks it is.  There is a good quote to help grok the ocean we are looking into:<p>Imagine a flashy spaceship lands in your backyard. The door opens and you are invited to investigate everything to see what you can learn. The technology is clearly millions of years beyond what we can make. This is biology.<p>–Bert Hubert, “Our Amazing Immune System”')
