I had the privilege of working with old school netops people who took one certification, duplicated everything on AWS like they did on prem and ended up costing the company much more money in resources and not saving money by using other AWS services. Once I learned about all AWS had to offer besides what lift and shifters knew, I realized how much money there could be if I learned about the other services instead of thinking of AWS as just a bunch of VMs. The same could be said for Azure and GCP I just fell into AWS.')
