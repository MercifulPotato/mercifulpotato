He drops out super Tuesday (IIRC). You no longer have any say in the Democratic primary. If we switched to a more representative electoral system, these people can still have their vote count.<p>These people could still put Yang during the general election, while still having their vote count for the candidate with the better chance to win.<p>There is also no reason for our multi state primaries to occur over many days. This ensures the media has maximum influence on the results.')
