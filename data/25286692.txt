If accelerated learning or tutoring over following semesters can bring them up to speed, that is what is needed so the high academic achievement can be met without a doubt.  Then they can transfer to an opening at the most challenging school and pick up the track toward post-graduate efforts themself, and graduate from that recognized high school at the same age as if they got in the first semester.<p>If the recognition from that school is so strong, it would even be impressive to come from behind and graduate a year older than your middle school classmates, if that&#x27;s all it took to come from badly disadvantaged to recognized young scholar.<p>Something like they used to do before they invented public school.<p>It&#x27;s real life, and some places are outstanding because they don&#x27;t let just anybody in.<p>And these are the kind of colleges these kids need to be prepared for.<p>It&#x27;s only fair.')
