Docker works with all programming languages and that&#x27;s it.<p>If you are full stack or work with multiple programming languages there is no need to learn the &quot;equivalent&quot; of virtualenv everywhere else.<p>Also with docker there is no setup&#x2F;installation involved. You just pull the image and that is it.<p>Also virtualenv requires that you already have pip&#x2F;python installed. Docker requires nothing (apart from itself). So you can instantly launch Java&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Erlang&#x2F;Haskell whatever without any SDK&#x2F;libs installed.')
