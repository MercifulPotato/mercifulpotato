But they share some objects. If I get updated data in a request from one panel, I&#x27;d like to see that update in all panels, without triggering more requests.<p>Side note that a magic layer to have each of those components combine their requests into one would actually hurt performance, since it&#x27;s better to load the requests in parallel. And manually merging them into one would be quite a chore.')
