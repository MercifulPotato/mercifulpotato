Your assessment is incorrect. [...] Shopify has done a good job on defining clear interface boundaries between various parts of the monolith [...] they’ve invested significantly in developer tooling to make developers more efficient. It’s not perfect and there’s always more to do...&quot;<p>sushshshsh: &quot;This is a good post because it details to me how horribly broken Shopify&#x27;s process and culture are.&quot;<p>In my work I&#x27;m exposed to many different online store and POS applications. Shopify is in a unique class. They have a diverse third-party apps community, and a documented API.<p>For my needs, their app community allowed me to extend Shopify reporting to suit my firm&#x27;s particular requirements.<p>Other companies have their product and if their design doesn&#x27;t fit your needs, is missing a feature in a report, or whatever, you&#x27;re just SOL.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth noting these details when reading about this person&#x27;s experience. There might be a hint of it from the article: &quot;Working on [Operation HOPE] was the first time I’ve ever really interacted with an outside organization from inside Shopify.&quot; (as near as I can tell this program is a drive to put more stores on the platform, and not including US based black owned _developers_ in their App Store).<p>Other comments here note the author does not identify their position (as developer), either.')
