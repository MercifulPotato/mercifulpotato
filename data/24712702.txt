And the SAG rules aren&#x27;t unreasonable IMO. But a union is not replacing the existing rules of your workplace, it&#x27;s a second group of people who can add rules.<p>Yes and no.<p>1) Rules aren&#x27;t interchangeable, undifferentiated things.  An employer&#x27;s rules are meant to mostly benefit the <i>employer</i>.  Rules a union adds would be to mostly benefit its <i>members</i>.<p>2) A union can get employer workplace rules changed in its negotiations, if its members objected to them and they have enough negotiating power.<p>3) That &quot;second group of people&quot; could possible include you as a union member, and if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a group you would have <i>far more influence over</i> than company management.')
