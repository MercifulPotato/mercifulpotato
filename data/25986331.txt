To be waited on hand and foot while a culinary expert prepares me an amazing meal.<p>Preface: I&#x27;m a former chef and cook, in addition to my foray in finech, with a background and a short stint as a private chef while traveling in Europe during the off season: why don&#x27;t you just hire a private chef?<p>I&#x27;m wondering if their will be a push for an app that functions much like task rabbit model for chefs, wherein you could fill your day with &#x27;gigs&#x27; as in &#x27;Breakfasts at the Jones&#x27; 8-11am,&#x27; &#x27;Lunch and Dinner at the Wang&#x27;s 1-10pm&#x27; kind of format.<p>California also has relaxed laws on using private residences functioning as kitchens for business (Cottage Food laws, that varies by County) but this format could be done again and not have the pitfalls of other attempts that were easy to take down and could even be done at scale. Some restaurants on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder are just refurbished homes and this model can function with the right incentives.<p>I personally retired for the last time, with no desire to ever go back at this point, but I would gladly consult to see something like this happen since so many BOH and FOH workers will likely never be able to go back to work as the Industry is completely wrecked in the US.<p>As you said, you want to go back, and the truth is we cooks masochistically  like our role in that model, but where we really all think we thrive in best is utilizing our creative skills in a smaller scale where the entire menu is your own and you can see direct feedback from a smaller crowd&#x2F;family.<p>Edit: Damn auto correct!')
