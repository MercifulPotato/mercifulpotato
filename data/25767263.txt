In most cases an absolute waste of life time and that makes it even worse to me. Oftentimes low impact and low priority work. It doesn&#x27;t makes sense to me. Often tried to reach out to my colleagues but they can&#x27;t let go. Even time spent with doing nothing at all seems time spent better.<p>I decide in the morning when to quit work in the afternoon. I am forced to manage my workload properly. And I adhere to the KISS principle at all times. I dislike mental overhead. Not everything works well but it is what it is and next day brings other opportunities.')
