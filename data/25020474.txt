You&#x27;re very clearly not going to get any substantive replies.<p>Biden won because people have legitimate issues with Trump. Deride it as &quot;the propaganda machine&quot; and other nonsense all you like. But this administration has a mind-boggling amount of documented fact-checked lies, clear nepotism, a history of censoring government agencies and intimidating federal employees who disagree, and putting out some of the most absurd propaganda we&#x27;ve seen in this country in modern history. It&#x27;s astounding that this administration&#x27;s chief complaints about the other side are always exemplified by the administration themselves. And people mindlessly repeat it without a shred of irony.')
