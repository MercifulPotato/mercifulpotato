Urgent and important tasks are the only types of tasks that really go into the category of &quot;real priority.&quot; Todo lists are best used to manage tasks that are important, but either aren&#x27;t as urgent as the most urgent tasks, or are blocked by some outside factor that you can&#x27;t control.<p>It&#x27;s important to finalize insurance plans for the upcoming year, but waiting until it&#x27;s &quot;urgent&quot; may result in not having enough time to find the best plan.<p>Granted, maybe you don&#x27;t have a problem keeping track of all important tasks -- in which case, that&#x27;s awesome!')
