No track bike will be re-sold as a road bike, especially not something as serious as a CBR 1000RR. Once they&#x27;re set up for the track with no headlights&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;brake lights, race exhaust, rear seat&#x2F;pegs&#x2F;brackets removed, number plate holders and various other brackets removed, slicks fitted, fairings painted etc etc they&#x27;re too far gone to b re-sold for the road. No to mention most guys with dedicated track bikes are pouring thousands into them, not penny pinching on $35 headlight blanking panels.')
