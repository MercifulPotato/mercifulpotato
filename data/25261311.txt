DNA doesn&#x27;t synthesize proteins.<p>Roughly: Protein descriptions are &quot;read&quot; from DNA into mRNA, which is then used by ribosomes to synthesize proteins. An mRNA vaccine adds additional mRNA with instructions to synthesize the vaccine-specific protein to the cells. So it uses some of the same mechanisms that are also used to generate proteins <i>from</i> DNA, but does not involve DNA itself.')
