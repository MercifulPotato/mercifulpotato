I know three Canadian SWEs whose parents could have easily bought them a nice house or condo in any major Canadian city, if they had wanted to stay.<p>One of them explained it to me this way: the quality of employers, coworkers, and the overall software engineering work you&#x27;ll do in Canada just doesn&#x27;t compare to the US. Even if pay&#x2F;finances were exactly the same, going to the US would still be the better career choice, because that&#x27;s what everyone with talent and ambition does. The people who stay behind aren&#x27;t people you want to work with, if you can help it.')
