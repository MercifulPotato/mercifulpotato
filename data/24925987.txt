I&#x27;m working on a system where a user uploads a single document that corresponds to several documents we already have I&#x27;m the system (and we know which documents those are) and we are supposed to map pages from the single document to pages in the other know documents.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time finding literature on problems like this. I think the closest thing it&#x27;s like is the stable matching problem, but I&#x27;m not sure. My current algorithm doesn&#x27;t allow for missing or reordered pages.<p>Does anyone have magic words I could google to find pertinent research&#x2F;algorithms? I think if worst comes to worse I&#x27;ll have to try to model the incoming page stream as something like a bayseian ... graph? It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve done something like that (5 years), and that was in school.')
