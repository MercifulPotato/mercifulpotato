I used to spend a lot of hours on social music sites like thisismyjam and the like, where I would stumble across a gem every 1 in 50, but with spotify it feels more like every 1 in 20 or 30, so I&#x27;m happy with that and it&#x27;s also less work not switching between multiple services<p>other people I know have nothing good to say about discover weekly so I dunno. maybe I just have low standards!')
