When it&#x27;s only being used by 5% of the PC userbase, maybe you don&#x27;t bother doing that work. If cheaper GPUs can push that up to say 20% of PCs next year, you still might not.<p>But when every PS5 and XSX has raytracing hardware, suddenly it makes sense. That&#x27;s going to be helpful for getting it supported in PC titles sooner.')
