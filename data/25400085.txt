So in the worst case, the computer needs to copy the entire array to a new space where it can get continuous memory.<p>But this answer says that in javascript they are not continuous:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;20321047&#x2F;how-are-javascript-arrays-represented-in-physical-memory&#x2F;20323491<p>&quot;Worst case is the indexes are just hash keys, so the second array item at index 1 is located using hash key &quot;1&quot; in the object&quot;\nSo the arrays in javascript are actually hash dictionaries?')
