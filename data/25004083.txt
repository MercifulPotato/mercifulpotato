The requirements for a server are very different from those for a dev workstation, so trying to do both on the same machine is just asking for trouble.<p><i>&gt; You need somewhere where you can install not just random Python packages but also random databases, task queues etc. during development.</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s what a dev workstation is for. But trying to do that on the same machine where you also have a server, which doesn&#x27;t want all that stuff, is not, IMO, a good idea.<p><i>&gt; I guess &quot;accept that your dev box will always be flaky and poorly understood</i><p>It will be as flaky and poorly understood as the code you are developing and whatever it depends on, yes. :-)<p>But again, you don&#x27;t want any of that on a machine that&#x27;s a server. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to have a server on a different machine.')
