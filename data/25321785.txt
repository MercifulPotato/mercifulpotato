For example, I live in unincorporated San Mateo County. By your hypothesis, I live in an area that is not heavily populated. But it&#x27;s a regular suburban neighborhood that is 3 miles from downtown Palo Alto and downtown Menlo Park. I have lived in both NorCal and SoCal, and this is common in both areas. Where do you live, and what makes you so certain that unincorporated areas in California are not populated?<p>Separately, do you really think that if the OC Sheriff says &quot;we are not enforcing Newsom&#x27;s rules&quot; that the deputies are going to enforce those rules in cities within their patrol areas? If a Sheriff has decided not to enforce a law in his jurisdiction, why would he direct his deputies to enforce that same law in other parts of his patrol area?')
