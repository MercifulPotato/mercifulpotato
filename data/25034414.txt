I mean they can achieve a lot of it already on earth (and have, with simulated moonbases and the like), but there&#x27;s nothing like doing it the hard way.<p>I believe we need a moon base first before attempting to send people to Mars. Both are super dangerous, but at least you can reach and return from the moon within days if need be. I&#x27;m afraid the first mars missions will be one-way trips - and the astronauts will be aware of this as well.')
