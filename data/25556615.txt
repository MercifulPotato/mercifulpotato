I&#x27;ve been focusing on a different type of user for the 1.0.0 (the user who wants to paste in a single script tag), and there are still some last experience improvements I want to make for those folks, but I completely recognize the value of self-hosting code like this and want to build something into Stork that will fill that niche, as well.<p>For now (and I haven&#x27;t tried this for self-hosting, so use at your own risk) -- the whole project (incl. the final JS file and the WASM blob) can be built from source. Tweaking the build a little bit would probably get you most of the way there.')
