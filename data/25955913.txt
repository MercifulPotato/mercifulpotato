Thanks for pointing that out.<p>[EDIT] - Is it reasonable to assume that maybe TD and Fidelity have a venue that the others <i>do not</i> have and that&#x27;s the reason? When I compare RH, WeBull, Fidelity and TD I see UBS Securities, LLC as the standout difference.<p>Was UBS choosing to route the orders (I guess they have none of the shorts on their books? or they properly managed their risk?) while the others didn&#x27;t touch it?')
