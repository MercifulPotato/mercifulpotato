There are many here (including you) that conflate the idea of 1st Amendment &quot;freedom of speech&quot; and the general idea of censorship. You even use the word &quot;censorship&quot; to provoke a knee-jerk reaction as if censorship is automatically evil and we ought to have some inherent right to not be censored. We do have such a right, from the 1st Amendment, and it doesn&#x27;t apply to YouTube.<p>Companies censor, as they often should. They should censor against violence, exploitation, DDOS attacks, and much more. They should censor to protect their viewers and their brands. If you want to spew hate speech, exploit some vulnerable people, build a devoted following of uneducated people then do it on your own dime.')
