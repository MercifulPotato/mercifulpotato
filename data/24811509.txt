The better argument will prove persuasive.</i><p>Wrong, wrong, wrong! Free speech is pessimistic as heck. It&#x27;s saying that good ideas don&#x27;t necessarily win, but if you allow authoritarians to engage in arbitrary censorship then bad ideas will <i>always</i> win. Censoring free speech is not just a &quot;crude authoritarian&#x27;s&quot; move; it&#x27;s what <i>all</i> authoritarians do whenever they feel they can get away with it. And censorship won&#x27;t save you from propaganda either: there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of crude propaganda in every totalitarian regime, happily coexisting with censorship of every other point of view!<p>Free speech is NOT a problem: it&#x27;s a very real safeguard against critical threats. If you treat it like one, you haven&#x27;t seriously engaged with the issue.')
