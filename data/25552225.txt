Tell them you like the life&#x2F;people&#x2F;culture in country X better and they get upset, defensive, angry even, like you wronged them by calling attention to the reality that its not actually a very nice place to live, and they know it, and they know they are stuck there. More than anything, I believe this essential truth about American character explains things like this $2.5K &quot;fee&quot; and the spineless response from the embassy you got. It&#x27;s all just to fuck with you, cause you got away and don&#x27;t have to live around those people and their crazy anymore.')
