It is not that easy to find, so, for your convenience, I&#x27;m reposting it below. While it talks about &quot;checks and balances&quot; point, I think that exactly the same argument can be made about &quot;common ground&quot;. I hope that it makes sense to you.<p><i>As for your argument on checks and balances - yes, generally, it is definitely a very good thing. However, when one side uses their position of chamber majority not to collaborate and compromise, but to throw a wrench into &quot;wheels of democracy&quot; and gridlock the Congress (especially, considering the voting record of the current majority in the Senate and essentially zero breaking ranks history), which might be extremely unproductive and even damaging to the lives of the American people, that IMO does not represent the &quot;checks and balances&quot; that you&#x27;re talking about.</i>')
