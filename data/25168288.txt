Green or red points are usually accepted as traffic lights (often no need to click the whole traffic light) and anything white painted on a street is usually accepted as a crosswalk and so on. Skipping&#x2F;verifying the second task without even bothering to look at it (i.e. immediately after clicking &quot;next&quot; on the first one) usually works well, too. The AI based on the ML at work here seems not to be very sophisticated.')
