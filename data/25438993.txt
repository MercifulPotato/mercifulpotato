Something like get 6 months free for each new account that you refer when they sign up for a year.<p>All it would cost to implement is a carefully worded email and messaging in the user&#x27;s dashboard and the time to build in how you want to track the referrals - whether your users each get an individual coupon code they can share with family and friends or have a built-in  function (personally I find &quot;share with a friend&quot; emails to impersonal and more likely to be ignored).')
