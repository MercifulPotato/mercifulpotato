They just lower the probability of being overshadowed by the others.<p>If somehow trees could agree on how high the trunk should be at most they could limit this waste.<p>Instead they literally grow trunks as long as the physical laws allow.<p>Instead of tons of in your face advertising everywhere you could have just one goverment manager directory of stuff and services. Where companies could register their products, services, pricing.<p>Of coure there would be law breakers and positive publications about brands paid for under the table but I think overt ban would lead to economy wasting much less money on advertising to outcompete itself.<p>I don&#x27;t think such a drastic change will ever happen. Large percentage of our culture is created directly for the purposes of advertising. So advert free society would be different in so many ways. But I would bet it wouldn&#x27;t be worse. And if it was, we could just lift the ban and see trunks grow back.')
