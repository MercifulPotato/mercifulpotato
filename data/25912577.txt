Item(by='bdowling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611635672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25912409, text='The standard that a court uses when considering a motion to dismiss (e.g., Rule 12(b)(6)) is to first <i>assume all of the facts alleged in the complaint are true</i>. The judge then decides the motion as a matter of law. That is the exact opposite of weighing the evidence, which doesn&#x27;t happen until trial.<p>Edit: I think we&#x27;re in agreement that &quot;on the merits&quot; here is being conflated with a trial that considers the probative value of evidence. They are not the same thing.')
