You can frame it that way, but value need not come into it at all. Business owners are capital owners; they have power which arises from the fact that they own a business. They can offer jobs, which everyone needs, but no individual employee is necessary to them. It&#x27;s a buyer&#x27;s market, and as a result, the business owner has a lot more power to set wages. This leads to the bulk of the money flowing up to the business owner.<p>What we wind up with is a system where business owners have substantially more money than workers, purely as a product of the fact that they can use their power to make this happen. If someone uses their power to divert money into their own pockets away from people who need it more than they do, they&#x27;re exploiting others.<p>It&#x27;s not the fact that the organization Amazon exists to coordinate labour that we have a problem with. It does increase efficiency. It&#x27;s the fact that Jeff Bezos has total control over it &amp; uses that power to massively benefit himself at the expense of all his other employees, who have a much greater need for the money.<p>If George Washington had argued that, by virtue of having been the one to found the country, he was entitled to rule it as a dictator, we would take issue with that. While he may be a competent leader, he must still be accountable to the public, lest he use his power to benefit himself at the cost of the public well-being. Hence, democracy. It&#x27;s strange to me that people are so unwilling to apply the same analysis to corporate hierarchy.')
