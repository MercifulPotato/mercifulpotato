To me that means:<p>&gt; you get this today or tomorrow<p>as opposed to:<p>&gt; you get this some time in the next several weeks depending on when the next boat from China docks, or if there&#x27;s already some buffer; also returns are going to be marginally more of a hassle, but still better than most other websites')
