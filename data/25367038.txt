There have been just as many protests by pro-Trump&#x2F;anti-lockdown&#x2F;stop-the-steal groups as there have about BLM&#x2F;count-the-votes protests. Both have attracted varying levels of police action (BLM the most by my assessment), and both have had various levels of pro&#x2F;anti discussion&#x2F;criticism in the media (depending on which you read). On the last point, freedom of assembly does not equal freedom from criticism.<p>EDITED: to fix formatting.')
