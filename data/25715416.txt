Maybe there is an argument for banning the opposition, but &quot;They say evil stuff&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like a good one to me. In adherence with Godwin&#x27;s law, I&#x27;ll point out that very few people actually read Mein Kampf. If more people had, it might not have been such a surprise when Hitler started doing exactly what he said he was going to do. If you want to succeed in suppressing the opposition, anything short of gulags and secret police, (which do work, but obviously have no place in a democracy), is just going to enrage them. History has shown that the best way to change minds is to expose the baddies, not to force them underground to conspire outside the public eye. I could be wrong, but to me it just seems like bad strategy.')
