Item(by='Imnimo', descendants=None, kids=[25292273, 25292396, 25292168], score=None, time=1607017756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290928, text='The supply of capital-B Bitcoin is 21M, but at any time, anyone can create Bitcoin2, which is an exact clone of Bitcoin but with a fresh chain.  Any Bitcoin2 token has exactly the same utility as a Bitcoin token in principle - the only difference is that, for now at least, lots of people are mining Bitcoin and no one is mining Bitcoin2.  If there comes a day when a lot of people think there should be 42M bitcoins, instead of 21, what would stop them from just starting a second chain?  Granted, these &quot;a lot of people&quot; are not a &quot;central authority&quot;, but is there really a difference when it comes to the question of bitcoin&#x27;s total supply?  As long as those people have enough compute they&#x27;re willing to put to work mining Bitcoin2, there&#x27;s nothing stopping them from creating more tokens that are just as useful as original Bitcoins.<p>And, of course, they could freely choose to make Bitcoin2 have a trillion tokens instead of 21M, or whatever number they want.')
