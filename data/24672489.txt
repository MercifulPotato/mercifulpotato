(I know a guy called Sasha. His parents wanted to name him Sasha, but were told that isn&#x27;t an approved name, it&#x27;s a nickname. So his parents named him Alexandre, and everyone who knows him calls him Sasha.)<p>Given that in the US, at least one boy whose parents named him Marion grew up and subsequently preferred to be known as John, I&#x27;m not convinced having the list is a substantial infraction on parental rights.')
