The HIPAA Security Rule is a joke. The HIPAA Security Rule requirements are extremely basic things like &quot;users must have their own login username rather than sharing an account&quot; or &quot;data should be encrypted where appropriate&quot; (and it&#x27;s left up to the company to decide where they think is &quot;appropriate&quot;. There&#x27;s also zero requirements around the type of encryption or implementation around it.. you could use a Caesar cipher and probably pass a HIPAA audit).<p>Yes, as the other commenter mentioned, hospitals do &quot;take it seriously&quot; in the sense that they put a lot of importance on passing HIPAA audits... but passing a HIPAA security audit is a checkbox exercise for security controls that are a decade+ outdated. It means absolutely nothing about an organization&#x27;s <i>actual</i> security maturity.')
