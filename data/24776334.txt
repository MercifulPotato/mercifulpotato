The shows mentioned are 8-10 episodes per season (both the canceled shows and Stranger Things).<p>This is more about Netflix throwing shows against the wall so fast they never get to see if any of them stick.  Which is silly - many of the best shows out there took a few seasons to hit their stride.  Look at season rankings for Seinfeld or GoT - few people rank the first season of either as the best.')
