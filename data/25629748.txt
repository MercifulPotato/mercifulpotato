There are patriarch, family and their slaves. As a foreigner one ends up in the slave group. While cutting your salary because of difficult economic situation patriarch orders a new Mercedes. That was so surreal.<p>I wasnâ€™t that lucky with American company. I ended up in one with American brand on the building and rotten hostile culture inside. Local patriarch is hostile towards Americans and the family insults new American owners on every occasion. Luckily I am leaving this show in 7 months for my own startup experiment.')
