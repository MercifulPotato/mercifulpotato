At least I don&#x27;t know how to otherwise explain the widespread indifference toward those things, often even among developers.<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t know either, and I think yours is a very good hypothesis.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a windows project after spending  four years exclusively on Linux, using mostly vim and Eclipse. Visual Studio feels now way worse than it used to. You get more conscious about the time you&#x27;re wasting.<p>And, most interestingly, the same happens to users. It&#x27;s not a matter of being text based, it&#x27;s a matter of getting useful stuff done, and fast.<p>Users can and actually enjoy using the keyboard. Users don&#x27;t want to be delighted with our stuff (speaking of the enterprise here), they just want a system that helps them to get their job done and, after that, get out of their way.<p>Designers and more and more developers seem to forget that animations, complex colorful screens, all this stuff has to be built, tested, processed by user&#x27;s hardware which is already having a bad time supporting windows. So, instead of shipping something fast, something we are able to build and fix and test quickly, we deliver something detrimental, in many ways, to user experience.')
