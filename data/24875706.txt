This path is also enhanced by frontscripts and backscripts (code placed in the path either before the initial object or behind the stack).<p>So well-organized code does not have to be scattered among 100s of objects, but is instead centralized and placed in the most appropriate location.<p>In 2016 &quot;script only stacks&quot; were introduced.  The normal stack is a binary file containing code and GUI elements.  The script only stack is a text file, meaning it can be diffed and put under normal version control.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livecode.com&#x2F;script-only-stacks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livecode.com&#x2F;script-only-stacks&#x2F;</a>')
