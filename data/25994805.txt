I actually hate the idea of only carrying CarPlay and not Android Auto or vice-versa. You should carry both. I don&#x27;t get locking people into an ecosystem to use a car or making people have to replace the head-unit just to use their phone with their car properly, but then you lose all of the benefits of the head unit as it goes with the car (like A&#x2F;C controls, etc?) It makes no sense.')
