A lot of people supported BLMs pre-violence protests because they wanted police held accountable. And a reasonable person can discuss whether the violence would have escalated if the police hadn’t been so aggressive.<p>Compare that to the Capitol insurrection, where the goal was to overturn the results of an election. To overturn the government. Where the people inciting the violence were in the same tent.<p>There was never good intent on the side of the insurrection it’s, and they escalated to violence on their own.')
