Not just software but also hardware.<p>MI100 finally brings hardware accelerated matrix-multiplication to the table (bfloat16, FP16, and even FP32 matrix multiplication).<p>Now that MI100 has matrix-multiplication units, now comes the part where that is distributed to the software. (Hooking up TensorFlow to use them).<p>--------<p>Without Matrix Multiplication units, there was really no point even writing software (aside from maybe preparation of the eventual rise of AMD&#x27;s matrix-multiplication routines).<p>But 6800 XT won&#x27;t have matrix-multiplication units. Only the CDNA architecture has those. So I&#x27;m not entirely sure if 6800 XT would even be an adequate competitor to deep learning applications, even if ROCm supported it entirely.')
