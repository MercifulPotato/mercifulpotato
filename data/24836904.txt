Not only it&#x27;s massive, but swaths of American urbanization are shaped around cars as a basic necessity, especially with the adoption of suburbs. Most of the US outside of big cities are car-first towns both in infrastructure, planning, and services.<p>In turn, having a car for many Americans is more than an efficient way to get around, it is the only way to move safely and reliably.<p>Many parts of the US have no public transportation, no reliable ride-sharing, no safe way to bike (both the roads and the culture are hostile towards cyclists).<p>For more information, I&#x27;d suggest reading on the phenomena called &quot;Automotive city&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automotive_city" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automotive_city</a>')
