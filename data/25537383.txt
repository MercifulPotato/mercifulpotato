That&#x27;s how they are treated on most of the Linux distros out there.<p>Android has opted instead for tightly coupling the certificates to the system itself. That&#x27;s a very bad design decision that, either intentionally or unintentionally, makes a device useless 4 years after the latest system upgrade.<p>One more reason for either ditching Google&#x27;s Android in favour of better supported and less abandonware-prone systems - Lineage is an excellent choice for those who don&#x27;t want to give up the commodities of Android, but don&#x27;t want to run the risk of throwing away their $1000 phone 4-5 years after the purchase just because Google decided not to push certificate updates to it anymore.')
