There is no way to set up a server that easily, even in principle.<p>I partially agree, but I think we could get a lot closer than we are now. It feels like the main reason this isn&#x27;t possible is because you need to go through a registrar to get a DNS name, and that&#x27;s tricky to do as part of a FOSS project. Maybe you could integrate with the APIs of a few registrars, but... it&#x27;s not ideal.<p>As far as the &quot;run thing on server&quot; side of it goes, though, projects like Sandstorm[0] have gotten really far re: making it a simple process. I stood up this instance of Etherpad with a few clicks on a web UI, for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandstorm.terracrypt.net&#x2F;shared&#x2F;aR2HXaoLSkLuXLhhAQono_89zWJkE7bHnyCYp5YoQRY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandstorm.terracrypt.net&#x2F;shared&#x2F;aR2HXaoLSkLuXLhhAQon...</a><p>Sandstorm in particular doesn&#x27;t quite work for mail servers just because the software is heavily oriented towards webapps, but there&#x27;s no reason a similar system couldn&#x27;t work in principle.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandstorm.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandstorm.io&#x2F;</a>')
