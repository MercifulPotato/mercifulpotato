It is not an existential threat for Bob to think there was election fraud during the Trump election anymore than Ted the Bernie supporter to think the election was stolen from him twice.<p>Spreading the idea that the US government can afford to give $1200&#x2F;mo UBI to each of its citizens by simply taxing the rich is more dangerous to the stability of the government&#x2F;economy than some dipshit thinking the earth is flat.<p>Finally, as for climate change, we have the facts and people don’t care. They didn’t care in 2002, they didn’t care in 2012, and they didn’t care in November. At this point, convincing Bob has not worked, and frankly it doesn’t matter because it’s not a problem that can be solved through individual actions.<p>The solution is to legislatively fix it with intelligent people from both sides of political spectrum if it needs to have staying power (ala cap and trade). Or, if the Democratic Party is very confident in not losing the majority in the next 8 years or so, just ram a non-market approach down everyone’s throat (ala oil&#x2F;coal bans) and call it good.<p>There are way too many people who still take the Bible&#x2F;Koran &#x2F;whatever seriously to clutch onto the notion that correcting people with facts is going to actually fix anything.')
