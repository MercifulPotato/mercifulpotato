It&#x27;s literally apply restriction to SaaS that impossible to comply with.<p>Also it&#x27;s not some &quot;everyone, but Amazon license&quot;. Terms they use are very fuzzy and can easily apply to more than just SaaS companies.<p>If Elastic wanted to stay open source they would use BSL: proprietary for N years and then code became GPL &#x2F; APLv2.<p>Anti-SaaS clause of SSPL is here:<p><pre><code>   &gt; The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   \n   &gt; The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#x27;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n</code></pre>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mongodb.com&#x2F;licensing&#x2F;server-side-public-license" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mongodb.com&#x2F;licensing&#x2F;server-side-public-license</a>')
