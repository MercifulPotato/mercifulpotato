We ban accounts that do that. I don&#x27;t want to ban you because you&#x27;ve posted good comments in the past, but could you please review <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and stick to the rules, regardless of how wrong others are (or you feel they are), or how frustrating a situation is? We all have to do this because if we don&#x27;t, the inevitable result is a downward spiral.<p>It&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;ve been through a lot and you&#x27;re of course welcome to share your experiences. But it needs to be done without attacking others, without stoking flamewars, and so on.')
