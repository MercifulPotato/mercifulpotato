I&#x27;ve observed the same behavior in the MATE environmment, both on Fedora and Pop! OS. I&#x27;d install Teams, it would autostart on login, I&#x27;d remove it from my list of startup items, then the very next time I fired up Teams it would reinsert itself. The only way to disable it was inside Teams&#x27; own preference dialog, which I found to be an extremely tone-deaf mechanic.')
