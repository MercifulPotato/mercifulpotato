He&#x27;s still getting 2-3x as much food out of the space. Most importantly, I believe (and he agrees), when you monocrop you go for broke. If something goes wrong, you have very little to sell at the end of the year. If it&#x27;s a bumper crop year, prices will be depressed if it&#x27;s a good year for everybody. In either scenario, the dealer (bank) always wins.<p>With six crops, the standard deviation between good years and bad years is reduced, which makes farming less of a trip to Vegas. That he gets more out of the same land brings up his average expected income. It&#x27;s more work, yes, but he points out that many farmers have to take a side job to make ends meet, and he theoretically doesn&#x27;t (he speaks and consults), so he can invest that time into increasing his farm&#x27;s productivity.')
