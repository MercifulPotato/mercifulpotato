Those deals are not how Google became ubiquitous, neither in search nor in advertising.<p>Once again, do you think Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have the same money as Google to pay for default search placement? Or do you think Apple or Mozilla won&#x27;t take their money? I&#x27;m sure Microsoft has the money. They just don&#x27;t want to spend it on this because they don&#x27;t earn as much money from their search users as Google does, so Google outbids them.<p>You keep talking about <i>generalities</i> of Google&#x27;s monopoly position, but I&#x27;m not disputing that their monopoly position is problematic and should be reigned it.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that this particular lawsuit succeeding will at best be a wash all things considered, and at worst will entrench Google&#x27;s moat even further if it kills off Mozilla.<p>Or, if you don&#x27;t think so, what kind of court-imposed solution do you think will come out of this lawsuit?')
