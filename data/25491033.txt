I have totally opposite experience. It takes single click of a button for me to build, test, deploy a code change using on premises and rented hardware.<p>I did cloud as well when it was mandated by client and it did not feel any simpler, faster etc. More complex and way more expensive it sure was but since it was not me paying the money I could safely ignore that part (not for my own projects and servers though as I do count my money).')
