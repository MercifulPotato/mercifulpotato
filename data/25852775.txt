What is different now is that Twitter, Facebook, etc. are &quot;monetising&quot; web usage, any sort of usage (e.g., purely recreational, non-commercial usage), by selling web users out to advertisers, not to mention political campaigns.  Imagine if all Usenet usage had been carefully surveilled with all possible deomgraphic and behavioural data collected whereupon the people doing this surveillance proclaimed &quot;we are a startup&quot; and tried to &quot;services&quot; to advertisers or political organisations.<p>&quot;Centralisation&quot; makes surveillance much easier, hence &quot;decentralisation&quot; is percieved as a panacea.  It also helps to curb the viral spread of low quality information.  As long something makes surveillance and data collection more difficult, it is helpful.  Because when the surveillance is no longer easy, the profit motive should decrease.  The data collection frenzy should start to fade.  We can close this ugly chapter in business and get back to real work.<p>Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. want centralisation.  They need sustained, heavy web traffic, lest they could not make money.  They <i>still</i> do not have a legitimate, viable &quot;business plan&quot; outside of surveillance, data collection and perpetuating an online ad circus.<p>The smart way to deal with all of this is to pass laws regulating the collection and usage of data on web users.  Unfortunately leadership today is at crisis levels, corruption is on the rise, so this may not come anytime soon.  In absence of legal protections, web users must fend for themselves.')
