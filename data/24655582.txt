It does not enable immediacy; it creates difference.”<p>I don&#x27;t buy this argument. I feel like the reason these upscaled videos are going viral is because it makes the events in the footage feel like something that actually happened, rather than an old-timey silent movie.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m not always a fan of upscaled historical footage. I think the best argument against it is that it&#x27;s a distortion of reality. Regular people don&#x27;t have the technological sophistication to understand that what they&#x27;re seeing is the result of a machine filling in the gaps and making a &quot;best guess&quot;. They assume all the new information they&#x27;re seeing was already hidden somewhere in the original image and just had to be pulled out. I think if everyone was on the same page as to what these videos were, there wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.')
