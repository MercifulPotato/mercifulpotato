A 20-something guy&#x27;s dad beat him repeatedly with a log (3&quot; diameter with the rough bark on doesn&#x27;t really count as a stick) because the 20-something said something mean to his (the 20-something&#x27;s) wife.  The 20-something needed <i>some</i> kind of reprimand, but I wouldn&#x27;t accept that kind of violence in trade for higher &quot;respect&quot; for elders.')
