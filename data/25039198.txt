The last time something like this was promised (by the previous Harper government), they made most of their progress by redefining &quot;high speed&quot; to be a barely usable speed, something like 3mbps if I remember correctly. \nLooks like the CRTC has updated the definition again to be 50mbps down&#x2F;10mbps up. Not ambitious at all compared to eg. South Korea and some European countries. But it is enough to eg. do video conferencing. So hopefully we can see some real progress. Northern communities experience a horrific digital divide due to their unusable internet speeds.')
