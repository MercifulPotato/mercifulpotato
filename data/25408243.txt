In the case of BTC though, the &quot;melt over time&quot; I&#x27;m not sure quite applies yet. It&#x27;s still be fairly volatile, and if you&#x27;re leveraged to make those purchases then there could be a risk of the loans getting called in if the asset plummets. I&#x27;m not anti BTC, but I think it  needs a few years of stability before it represents safe asset in that respect.<p>Secondary is that in order for me to really consider it &quot;money&quot; rather than an asset, I think the ability to spend it as such needs to improve. Until then it strikes me as little different than any other security that you need to sell to convert into negotiable currency. Though I don&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s a distinction without (much of) a difference.')
