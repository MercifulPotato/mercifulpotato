Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612111735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25976080, text='&gt; Everyone who has been on WSB for more than a week perfectly understands that it is a gamble and you can lose it all.<p>On the surface, yes, but they&#x27;ve also been fed a lot of misinformation about how they&#x27;re more likely to get rich than to lose it all. They think the odds are stacked in their favor, but that&#x27;s definitely not true for the late entrants.<p>&gt; Also, vast majority of WSB users (at least up to the last few days) are buying GME not to profit (according to their own words).<p>WSB isn&#x27;t a democratic subreddit. They will downvote or remove any posts or comments that don&#x27;t support the pump. They upvote any post or comment that encourages people to buy stocks they own.<p>It&#x27;s a pump group. They gain financially by pumping the stock. They&#x27;ll gladly upvote any narrative that encourages more people to pump the stock.<p>&gt; And all these events obviously will leave a large mark on stock market and probably introduce some new regulations which is a good thing.<p>This topic keeps coming up, and I keep asking people: <i>What</i> regulations do you want? Or expect? Specifically, what regulations would help here?<p>If anything, we&#x27;re going to see more regulations on retail investors after we see how vulnerable they are to falling for mass pump-and-dump schemes with the widespread availability of margin accounts.')
