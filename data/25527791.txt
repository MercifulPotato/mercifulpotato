In the UK numberplate info is public, you can look up the make, model year and colour of a car just using it&#x27;s numberplate, and anyone can do this.<p>Using that info it would be trivial to detect a BMW car that was older than X years old. Where X is number of years the normal non-extended warranty is. You then just assume that any car older than the non-extended warranty doesn&#x27;t have an extended warranty and display the advert.<p>Then the only thing the advert would be giving away is that there is a BMW nearby that older than X years. Which anyone with a pair of eyes could figure out because the numbers of UK numberplates encode the issue year (thus the age of the car), and well, BMW&#x27;s are pretty easy to identify just by looking at them.')
