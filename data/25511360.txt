Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608671903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25510364, text='&gt; WiFi seems to exceed the price&#x2F;performance of hard-wired<p>WiFi absolutely does not. This is a test in lab conditions, with a single, stationary device and no stats on packet loss. Unless you&#x27;re happy to use your device in these conditions (but at this point why not use a wire?), this does not represent the real-world conditions in which you&#x27;d be using the device.<p>If he tries again with people moving around and moving the devices around, with more people using the wireless network at the same time, he&#x27;d see much more different results especially when it comes to stability.<p>Stability is the main problem with Wi-Fi. It&#x27;s relatively easy to get a huge speed test, it&#x27;s harder to maintain a stable latency and no packet loss. It doesn&#x27;t help that operating systems aren&#x27;t good at reporting this information to the user, so the Wi-Fi always <i>appears</i> to work (with decent speeds) until it totally craps out when you launch an interactive application (like calling or multiplayer gaming) where low latency is paramount and the error correction&#x2F;retransmission algorithms can&#x27;t do their thing fast enough).')
