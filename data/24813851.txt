No, we should design our CPU’s to accommodate our slow, bottlenecked language!”<p>Asking for CPU features to speed up Python is like trying to strap a rocket to horse and cart. Not the best way to go faster. We should focus on language design and tooling that makes it easier to write in “fast” languages, rather than bending over backwards to accommodate things like Python, which have so much more low-hanging fruit in terms of performance.')
