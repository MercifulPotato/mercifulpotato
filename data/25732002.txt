Who gets to decide what&#x27;s reasonable discourse?<p>I personally don&#x27;t think the whole rank and file of establishment press jumping over each other to get in line behind the US state and starting two truly godawful wars is reasonable.<p>If I was in charge of distributing news to people in the early 2000s, I&#x27;d have simply disallowed all of it and made sure people only heard opinions about how the USA is the world&#x27;s leading terror state. How would you like it if I did that? Luckily, you&#x27;ll never have to find out because I don&#x27;t have the power Amazon et al now have.<p>&gt; Just don&#x27;t cry when big American business wants nothing to do you with.<p>This is a deflection. I hate these idiots. Most reasonable people do. They&#x27;re dangerous (not as dangerous as the US military, but I still wouldn&#x27;t cross them). My objection is to the structural&#x2F;cultural development of a tiny handful of companies amassing for themselves a huge cultural and epistemological power. They&#x27;re increasingly able to shape reality in ways 20th century culture industry couldn&#x27;t even dream of.<p>Cheer it on at your own risk!')
