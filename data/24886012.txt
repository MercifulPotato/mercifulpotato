The unifying principle tends to be (a) semantics based on definition and substitution of values&#x2F;expressions (e.g. no ambient state&#x2F;context) and (b) &#x27;direct&#x27; evaluation strategy for expressions (e.g. no search, like in logic programming).<p>&quot;Functional language&quot; is less concrete; it&#x27;s just an informal way to imply how easy or awkward it is to use these techniques in a particular language (e.g. bash is &quot;less functional&quot; than ML).')
