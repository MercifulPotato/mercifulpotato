Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=[24828134], score=None, time=1603116896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825065, text='Oddly this leaves out what I would consider the most &quot;elementary&quot; proof, starting from Bernoulli&#x27;s definition of e and requiring only the squeeze theorem.<p>You begin by writing exp(z) = lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} (1 + z&#x2F;N)^N. Note that in this limit we do not need the analytic continuation of powers: N is an <i>integer</i>, so the function y^N is single-valued on C. This gives a definition of the exponential function that is immediately entire and does not rely on calculus.<p>Then we can write exp(ix) = lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} (cos(arctan(x&#x2F;N)) + i sin(arctan(x&#x2F;N)))^N ⋅ (1 + x^2&#x2F;N^2)^N. (note that sec(arctan(t)) = 1 + t^2).<p>It is easy to show that lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} (1 + x^2&#x2F;N^2)^N = 1 for all finite x, so we find exp(ix) = lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} (cos(arctan(x&#x2F;N)) + i sin(arctan(x&#x2F;N)))^N. It is not necessary to apply L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule since neither of the factors approaches zero or infinity -- we can simply split the limit.<p>By induction we can then show that (cos(x) + i sin(x))^A = cos(Ax) + i sin(Ax) for all integer A. We apply this to the previous expression to conclude that exp(ix) = lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} = cos(N ⋅ arctan(x&#x2F;N)) + i sin(N ⋅ arctan(x&#x2F;N)).<p>Therefore we only need to find lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} N ⋅ arctan(x&#x2F;N). Consider the triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (1, x&#x2F;N): its hypotenuse intersects the unit circle at (N &#x2F; sqrt(N^2 + x^2), x &#x2F; sqrt(N^2 + x^2)), subtending an arc of exactly arctan(x&#x2F;N). A similar triangle inscribed at this vertex has a short side which is necessarily less than the arc length. We therefore have Nx &#x2F; sqrt(N^2 + x^2) &lt; N*arctan(x&#x2F;N) &lt; x. The left and (trivially) right limits both equal x, so by squeezing lim_{N-&gt;\\infty} N arctan(x&#x2F;N) = x and therefore e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x).')
