That mRNA then goes to a ribosome to be turned into proteins. The mRNA is the &#x27;message&#x27; to other cellular machinery of how to make proteins.<p>This is the &#x27;central dogma&#x27; of molecular biology: DNA &gt; RNA &gt; Protein.<p>The viral part is that some viruses will just be mRNA in a little molecular capsule. When the virus docks with a cell, it injects the mRNA. This free floating mRNA may get picked up by the cell and then turned into the proteins that it codes for. In the case of a virus, that will be proteins to make more viruses.<p>I&#x27;m unsure what you mean by a unit test in terms of biology. If you are asking if the ribosome complexes will check to see if some mRNA is a viral one, then no, they do not. These proteins are too small and chaotic to really have those kinds of things.<p>I&#x27;m also unsure of what you mean by tech debt here. The virus, once successfully copying itself, will almost always cause cell death and lysis.<p>To be clear, this process is <i>very</i> complicated and caveats abound to everything I&#x27;ve told you. But this is a HN comment section, not a full four year set of courses on virology.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Messenger_RNA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Messenger_RNA</a>')
