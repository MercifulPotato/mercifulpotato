Item(by='gurkendoktor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610216228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702521, text='Facebook and YouTube don&#x27;t target me with political disinformation, but their ads are often for malware like MacKeeper, or Bitcoin scams using fake celebrity endorsements. Even when they&#x27;re for seemingly harmless merchandise like clothes, they&#x27;re for Chinese online stores that will keep your money and disappear (wife fell for it once). Maybe my ad situation is so dire because I&#x27;m avoiding trackers at all cost, but man it&#x27;s bad.<p>I&#x27;m amazed that people still act surprised that these platforms are used for hostile disinformation when that&#x27;s basically their business model. (At least YouTube lets you pay to get rid of ads, although you lose even more privacy on the way.)<p>Edit: And to add something constructive, I think the only way out is for the EU (where I&#x27;m based) to fund a free, public, encrypted messenger service to free its citizens from WhatsApp, and maybe more services later. Social media has become the public space, for better or for worse, and at the very least it needs to be regulated like a utility.')
