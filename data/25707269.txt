Simply put, the society has to become more militarized to survive.<p>I also have doubts that the &#x27;mass invasion via a few possible beaches after 3 weeks of obvious preparation which allow Taiwan ample time to mobilize its reserves&#x27; is the only relevant invasion scenario. At the very least, paratroopers can play a major role, and I can think of a few other ideas to spice it up. These can be defended against if Taiwan is seriously motivated - that&#x27;s the big question mark.')
