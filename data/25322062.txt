The problem is that without it my mind - a bright one - goes absolutely blank. It actively refuses to cooperate unless what I want to do is <i>extremely</i> interesting. Without the stimulants I feel like \na train cart being taken to a different direction by the rail tracks, pushed or pulled against its will by the train. I was unable to go clean my teeth, eat, or clean my flat; and I didn&#x27;t do anything fun too (except for porn and weed). I was a mindless drone for most of my life. Stimulants have put myself in the foreground, and made me <i>actually me</i>.')
