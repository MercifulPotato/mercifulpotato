HHGTTG originated as a radio show, and while they&#x27;re fun, they meander, almost a loosely connected series of vignettes rather than novels. The 2 (+1&#x2F;2) Gently books are more cohesive narratives, complete with themes and motifs and such, and perfectly stick the landing (besides the last one, which was tragically unfinished).')
