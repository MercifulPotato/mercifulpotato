It&#x27;d make the handshake heavier, but on the other hand, it&#x27;d also make it much harder to distinguish from the regular TLS traffic. On the contrary, ESNI&#x2F;ECH seems to be easy to detect and block, and some countries (China, for instance) have already announced that they&#x27;re going to do that.')
