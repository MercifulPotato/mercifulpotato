Item(by='montagg', descendants=None, kids=[24821470, 24821553], score=None, time=1603057575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821356, text='I believe (from my limited knowledge from <i>Interstellar</i>) that it’s the opposite: higher gravity environments move slower relative to lower gravity environments, which enabled the “go down to high gravity planet for a couple hours and come back and it’s ten years later” plot point in the movie. So if you’re in intergalactic space, time is actually passing very quickly in the higher gravity environment of a galaxy.<p>But a person’s experience should always be the same, no matter what reference they are in. They will perceive time as passing at the same rate in all environments, but it will be different from people in other environments.<p>Caveat: IANA physicist, and this is not physics advice.')
