Got retested, and I was no longer prediabetes and cholesterol dropped to normal levels.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve continued to lose another 40 lbs and am no longer considered overweight.<p>The reason I&#x27;m sharing the anecdote is to share my surprise that almost all of the improvement in blood test came from the first 10 lbs (the extra 40 lbs I lost maybe improved numbers a bit more, but 90% improvement came after the first 10 lbs)')
