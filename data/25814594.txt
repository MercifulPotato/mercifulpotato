The probability of being able to win due to time&#x2F;a blunder is quite high.<p>I even saw an IM vs. NM bullet game the other day where the NM was in a losing position but stayed in to grab a stalemate: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;chess&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kwoikt&#x2F;im_not_a_gm_levy_rozman_swindles_a_stalemate_from&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;chess&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kwoikt&#x2F;im_not_a_gm_l...</a>.
