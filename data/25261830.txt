Item(by='easde', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606791907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261523, text='The study compares how many people in the experimental group and control group develop symptomatic COVID-19. In this case 11 people in the experimental group developed COVID-19 versus 185 in the control group. Thus the vaccine is approximately 185 &#x2F; (185 + 11) = 94% effective, assuming both groups behaved similarly.<p>If the control group intentionally avoided exposure more than the experimental group, then the vaccine is even more effective than the study result. This is a blinded study though, so participants don&#x27;t know which group they&#x27;re in unless they go out of their way to find out (eg. taking an antibody test).')
