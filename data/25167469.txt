A news story came out that a pipe bomb came in the mail addressed to Olsteen&#x27;s Dad and a clerk in the office opened the package, it blew up, she suffered burns and shock, but did not kill her. Apparently, there was some &quot;bad blood&quot; between Olsteen and some of the other Mega churches   . . . competition.')
