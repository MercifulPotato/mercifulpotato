Lots of companies like that: developers who only know how to develop, managers who only know how to manage, human resourcers who only know how to… resource. Lots of people who know the cost of everything and value of nothing.<p>Bear in mind too that the average employee, regardless of rank, is more concerned about what’s in their own best interests than what’s in the company’s. It’s only when you’re a director and major shareholder that these are one and the same, and even then you’re not magically immune to making really stupid decisions.<p>As for “Gust”, my sympathies are severely limited. He remained in a job where he knew his employers were taking the absolute piss out him long enough that he turned toxic himself. I get that changing jobs has its own set of costs and challenges, but thinking that your employer owes you for all your “loyalty” is a fool’s delusion.

I don’t stand my own shite either.)')
