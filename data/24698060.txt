Google Web Search is effectively unusable via Tor.<p>I used to be able to do some interesting analysis through automated commandline searches on Google, looking at the estimated results count (see, e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3hp41w&#x2F;tracking_the_conversation_fp_global_100_thinkers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3hp41w&#x2F;trackin...</a>), with some ... <i>very</i> creative rate limiting.<p>Because of how Google restricts information, that analysis took about 10k searches (1 each per term per site), conducted over a week or so.<p>Last I looked into extending those analyses that route was utterly broken --- non-JS, plain-HTML results simply aren&#x27;t produced, let alone rate-limiting and bot detection.  Scripted search doesn&#x27;t contribute to ad views. (Though neither do adblocked ones.)<p>DDG by contrast has its &#x27;liteâ€˜ search.  Unfortunately for my research uses, no result set counts.<p>There may be APIs for these or other services, I&#x27;ve not yet looked into that.')
