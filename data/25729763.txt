For those who write for a living, the productivity boost over something like an electric typewriter was that big.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be offensive, but I am guessing you&#x27;ve either never written much with an electric typewriter, such that you would be capable of making the comparison to writing (and more importantly - revising and editing!) with a word processor, or you&#x27;ve never written much period.')
