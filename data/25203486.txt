No joke - you have to pay to attend residency and work.  And this isn&#x27;t covered by student debt&#x2F;government assistance programs.<p>I know of several doctors who are in _significant_ debt despite working for the public sector for years.  Their loans are forgiven, but the residency sits and accumulates interest that they can&#x27;t quickly pay off because that same public sector work doesn&#x27;t pay as well.<p>It&#x27;s not-quite slave labour.')
