Find one person saying something, or one company doing something you can take the wrong way, use it to tell your audience they&#x27;re under attack; lather, rinse, repeat. Growing up in it, I&#x27;d hear about this stuff in youth group, in chapel in school, even in not-officially-religious classes like History. Before the internet, it wasn&#x27;t easy to escape that bubble if your parents were deep into it.<p>Or do posters here really think there really are a lot of people out there trying to eliminate Christmas?')
