I&#x27;d be interested to see any evidence you have to the contrary.<p>Something I think people confuse is the concept of &#x27;a bitcoin&#x27;. There is no thing that is transferred around like a physical coin or note. A bitcoin &#x27;transfer&#x27; is just a change in the balance of two accounts, not an actual transfer of anything physical or digital. There is no change of ownership of anything.')
