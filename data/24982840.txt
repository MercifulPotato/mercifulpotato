They have more than enough fans to support them. Why can&#x27;t i watch a movie in the app of my convenience (e.g. Popcorn Time) and still be able to pay for it? Why is there no such &quot;virtual ticket&quot; option. I know they want to package their products in specific ways, but they demand that the entire internet infrastructure bends to match their favourite way and that&#x27;s just insanely egocentric. Hollywood is not the center of the universe anymore.')
