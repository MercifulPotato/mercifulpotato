In retrospect the fixed-depth buckets probably added more complexity than they saved, and using a linked list or open addressing would have probably been much easier since it&#x27;d clean up some of the resizing and traversal code. Plus, the load factor was in general fairly poor, the final table (when I ran it on my Downlods folder) had just over 8 million buckets of depth 5 allocated and only  about 600k got used at all, and of that 570k were filled just once.<p>Oh, and here&#x27;s the results on my Downloads folder:<p><pre><code>  514464 Developer\n  425236 Xcode\n  386616 saagarjha\n  386075 Users\n  361324 Library\n  337374 build\n  333056 Wno\n  306758 WebKit\n  302892 DerivedData\n  296179 eugbibmfmfphgbhczsxiimkhynol\n</code></pre>\nI have a couple WebKit build logs that dominated the results…')
