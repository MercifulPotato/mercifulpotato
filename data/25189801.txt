IMG were fools to rely on apple so much but this isn&#x27;t a new development.<p>Apple have repeatedly done this same process to a number of suppliers. There was a good website that listed all of the offices apple opened near suppliers before cutting them off, but it went offline :(<p>IMG should have been much more careful but instead went all-in splashing the cash they got from apple and acting like it was forever. Pretty dumb.<p>Apple can rely on the media giving them positive coverage. At the time I was amazed at even how much benefit of the doubt even the BBC gave them (US company bankrupting a UK one you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d back the UK one eh?)<p>I was also amused to be &#x27;inside&#x27; a story discussed on HN, and unsurprised at how far off many were. Tons of apple rationalisation syndrome as usual and lots of &#x27;how dare IMG be so arrogant&#x27; etc.<p>The reality is Apple are extremely ruthless and have been trying to take control of everything for quite some time now.')
