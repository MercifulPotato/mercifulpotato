Item(by='t0mas88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604265512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961218, text='Pilots don&#x27;t really care about where the bend is because it only shows up to 15 knots and it becomes mostly relevant for limitations at higher speeds. Most relevant visually is the general direction, changes in direction and whether it&#x27;s half inflated or full, that&#x27;s enough precision from a glance.<p>The strength and gusts are also reported by the tower, they&#x27;ll say something like &quot;Wind 270 at 15 gusting 25, runway 23 cleared to land&quot; which means the wind is coming from 270 degrees (West), at 15 knots with gusts up to 25. Then you have a general idea of the crosswind on the runway being about 12kt gusting just under 20ish from the right. Accurate enough to figure out whether a limit needs to be calculated.')
