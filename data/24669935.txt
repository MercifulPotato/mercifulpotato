It&#x27;s about everything that goes before you submit your first PR. Reading mailing lists. Actively participating in discussions with the maintainers. Reading the docs.<p>I&#x27;ve only had 5 or so PRs accepted[0], and all of them have been tiny bugfixes for broken tools. I have no goddamned idea how to get an actual feature merged, because maintainers never comment on the proof-of-concept PRs I put up, even if they have tests and documentation updates. Maybe it&#x27;s all about mailing lists and out-of-band communication.<p>[0] not for Hacktober, just in general')
