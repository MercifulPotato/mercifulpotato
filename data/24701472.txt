Also, I&#x27;m no expert on politics, economics, or healthcare, so I&#x27;m open to any corrections. I&#x27;ll try to remain as neutral as possible.<p>People have different thoughts about economic policy with regards to healthcare. Additionally, there are some cultural concerns.<p>For one, conservatives feel that liberals are too idealistic and don&#x27;t have a good plan for actually paying for socialized healthcare. This is most commonly used against Bernie Sanders. Liberals argue that &quot;competition drives down cost&quot; is equally, if not more, idealistic.<p>Second, in places with &quot;socialized&quot; healthcare, health is thought of as society&#x27;s responsibility, not the individual&#x27;s responsibility. This conflicts with the American notion of individuality. Conservatives argue that the US&#x27;s culture makes socialized healthcare infeasible without costs ballooning out of control, because people are selfish and don&#x27;t care to protect their health. There is plenty of debate on this matter.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that healthcare is not the most important reason that conservatives vote Republican. Although it seems like a huge issue, there are other issues that might make someone choose one side over the other, even if they disagree with their side&#x27;s healthcare policy.')
