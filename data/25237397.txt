When Huizu went to convey his condolences, he\nfound Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and\nsinging. &quot;You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew\nold,&quot; said Huizu. &quot;It should be enough simply not to weep at her\ndeath. But pounding on a tub and singing - this is going too far, isn&#x27;t\nit?&quot;<p>Zhuangzi said, &quot;You&#x27;re wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn&#x27;t\ngrieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time\nbefore she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time\nbefore she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the\ntime before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and\nmystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she\nhad a body. Another change and she was born. Now there&#x27;s been another\nchange and she&#x27;s dead. It&#x27;s just like the progression of the four\nseasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.<p>&quot;Now she&#x27;s going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to\nfollow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don&#x27;t\nunderstand anything about fate. So I stopped.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zhuang_Zhou" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zhuang_Zhou</a>')
