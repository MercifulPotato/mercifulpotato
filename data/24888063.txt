If they had not had this side-project 8080 that they considered absolutely uninteresting, when the memory business collapsed, there would be no Intel, and Andy Grove would not have become a big cheese.<p>Also, that self-aligned gates, depletion loads, the 8008 and 8080 were all Faggin&#x27;s projects.<p>It is an enduring mystery why the 8080 was designed into so many systems. It was such a bad component: it couldn&#x27;t do <i>anything</i> without a bunch of other support chips from Intel. And the ISA was so bad: half the instructions in a program were just to correct for the other instructions that didn&#x27;t do the right thing.<p>People insisted it was <i>great</i> that it had these support chips, that you didn&#x27;t even need for other CPUs. I thought it was because Intel had sharper sales people, but apparently not. So it remains a mystery.')
