I know that&#x27;s kind of sad but often Bazel wants to load large graphs into memory. Combined with the fact that the graphics are stealing part of main memory, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to be happy with 16GB. I ordered one anyway, but I don&#x27;t expect to be too psyched about the reality of it when it gets here.')
