The virus is basically re-purposing then melting a bunch of cells. The body&#x27;s immune response is killing the viral structures and turning whole areas into the cellular equivalent of a battleground, killing off anything that is or is likely to be controlled by the virus.<p>Many of the worst symptoms aren&#x27;t related to the presence or absence of the virus itself. If someone is turning blue from lack of oxygen, it isn&#x27;t that the virus is doing anything here and now. It is that their lungs are non-functional from damage that the virus already did (note: past tense). You could remove every trace of active coronavirus from them and while they&#x27;d probably not get worse they also wouldn&#x27;t get better very quickly. New lungs don&#x27;t grow overnight.')
