You might just consider some of those things &quot;meaningful&quot; if people have been valuing them for a very long time (like coins or other physical items which represent a standardized currency) or if the reason people value them is closely tied to features of nature which we aren&#x27;t likely to change in the imminent future (like requiring scarce things such as food and shelter to survive). But at the end of the day, people are still <i>choosing</i> to value those things and that is all there is to it.')
