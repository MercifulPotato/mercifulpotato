It&#x27;s good to examine one&#x27;s beliefs.<p>&gt; I absolutely don&#x27;t believe the penal system makes people safe after they serve their time.<p>Fair, and understandable.<p>&gt; If a person killed someone without a damn good reason, why would I think they wouldn&#x27;t do it again?<p>Why would you think they would do it again? Given that someone spent over a decade in prison, shouldn&#x27;t it have deterred them from killing again?<p>You&#x27;d have to actually look into recidivism rates to see how this works out in reality, unless you believe that for psychological and moral philosophical reasons that such a person who&#x27;s committed murder is both willing and <i>likely</i> to do so again.<p>&gt; I think if you intentionally murder someone without a damn good reason you should spend life in prison. Right now, second degree murder can include that and often is not life in prison.<p>Okay, so your personal standard is that murder does not have to be premeditated to deserve life in prison. That&#x27;s fair. But I think that goes beyond discomfort with working with such a person who has been through the prison system; that&#x27;s believing that such a person shouldn&#x27;t be out of the prison system at all.')
