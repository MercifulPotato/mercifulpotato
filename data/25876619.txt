I think we have this false causation between pushing ourselves and achieving something.<p>In fact, I think we often would rather push ourselves in an all out burst of max effort exhaustion, than put dedication and consistency behind a goal.<p>Pushing yourself just a little bit more, but sustainably, consistently, and actually taking your progression slower, giving yourself more time to achieve your goals, but making sure that you&#x27;re constantly moving little by little closer to it. That&#x27;s what worked best for me. It means the journey feels easy as well, it just becomes a routine of excellence.<p>I think what often happens is that we&#x27;re too impatient, probably because we&#x27;re anxious about the thing we&#x27;re trying to achieve, we&#x27;re stressed about it and would like to get it over with so we can be stress free again, so we give a big push, and you know what, most of the time that push does nothing, and you get more stressed but also exhausted. At that point, flight is often the only recourse left.<p>The only exception to this might be short little events, like sure if you have an exam, a bit of stress and a last all out effort can help. If you&#x27;re competing in some athletic event similarly. But for most other life goals, I&#x27;m not so sure.')
