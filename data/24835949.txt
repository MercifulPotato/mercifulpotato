Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603191477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833206, text='You seem to be implying that the home alternative of public schooling doesn&#x27;t also accomplish these goals as well.  Home schooling has a curriculum and standards just like public school does.<p>I&#x27;m not gonna blindly advocate for home schooling but I think anyone who cares enough about their kids&#x27; education to look into options other than public school probably also cares enough to pull it off if it&#x27;s the option they wind up choosing.<p>&gt;School is probably the best public invention to systematically distribute knowledge to the masses. Some like to point out &quot;dropouts&quot;, &quot;self-taught&quot; geniuses or the &quot;lucky few&quot; as models instead of exceptions to the rule.<p>The further your kids are from the mean student the crappier the job the public school situation will do.  It&#x27;s like the difference between registering a new car at the DMV and bringing in a pile of papers to prove chain of custody on some junk that&#x27;s only able to be street legal through some arcane technicality.  The first transaction is painless.  The latter is not.  When you ask the system to do something it&#x27;s well practiced at doing you get shit service.<p>&gt;School&#x27;s purpose is not to teach obedience or even getting a job. It is there to teach us critical thinking, and consequently, how to be a good citizen.<p>And if you think it&#x27;s successful at that for any reasonable definition of &quot;success&quot; then you&#x27;re clearly living in a different 2020 than I am.<p>Look through history, even before widespread government funded schooling everything was just as crap as it is today.  You had just as many popuist leaders, pants on head retarded popular culture movements, witch hunts, all the same crap we have today.  The only thing that&#x27;s changed is that as society have become more advanced and richer we&#x27;ve become more able to avoid pain and violence.<p>Also, school is very much about obedience to an arbitrary system.  They don&#x27;t overtly state it but it&#x27;s pretty damn obvious if you look at how the carrots and sticks are set up.<p>&gt;An educated population is also less prone to fall into totalitarianism. Ex: Nazi Germany and Mao&#x27;s China burned books and persecuted the educated (1984 style).<p>Sure.  But it&#x27;s pure lunacy to conflate what&#x27;s good for society with what&#x27;s good for any specific kid(s).  There&#x27;s definitely a lot of overlap but there&#x27;s also a lot of non-overlap.')
