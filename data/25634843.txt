The most obvious sign of any investment skulduggery is the promise of an abnormally high investment return. ...<p>I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s no promise of any investment return. Bitcoin just allows the transfer of money nearly instantly.<p>2. Guaranteed returns. ...<p>There are no returns since it just a currency to be used.<p>3. Consistently high performance. ...<p>Bitcoin isn&#x27;t a stock, it&#x27;s a currency. If you&#x27;re using it to invest, you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.<p>4. Vague business model. ...<p>Not a business, just a currency.<p>5. The need for more investors. ...<p>There is no need for anyone to invest in Bitcoin, there are plenty of hedge funds putting their money into it.<p>6. Pressure to reinvest. ...<p>You can go in and out of Bitcoin as you please.<p>7.
