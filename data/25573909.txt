Given that asymptomatic and presymptomatic people are the main spreaders, it&#x27;s certainly not a given.<p>Vaccinating front line health and care workers does make sense for two reasons<p>1) Far more likely to catch it<p>2) Far more problematic if they catch it and are off ill because of it<p>Other front line workers like police probably less important -- less likely to catch it, and not as problematic if large numbers are off ill as the people who fix it. Saving lives and reducing load on hospitals by vaccinating the over 70s is likely more beneficial.')
