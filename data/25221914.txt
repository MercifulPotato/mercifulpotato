I&#x27;ve searched for several of the changes introduced by the 8.0 version, and I could not find them. For instance, the page titled &quot;Function arguments&quot; does not mention the existence of named arguments.<p>The last time I wanted to submit a ticket about a documentation bug, I saw that the ticket was already created months ago. I&#x27;m surprised the PHP process can introduces changes without the related documentation update.')
