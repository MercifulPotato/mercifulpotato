In college (and for a year or so right after), I had the same answer.<p>A few years later, I&#x27;ve finally realized that any code I write at 2am almost always needs to be fixed--often substantially--soon after. I miss things. I write stupid bugs. I don&#x27;t see the requirements clearly.<p>I&#x27;ve found writing things down (sometimes a few words, sometimes a few pages), sleeping on it, and reviewing those notes first thing in the morning--before email, before showering, before anything--to be a much a better strategy.<p>YMMV, of course.')
