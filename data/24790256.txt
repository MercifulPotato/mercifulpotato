Keep clicking through the suggestions and in hour you will be on some extremist nonsense.</i><p>Could that simply be the inevitable effect of Youtube being filled with garbage? It seems that suggestions linked to the current video by some keyword match (or whatever) <i>but otherwise random</i> would have this problem.<p>E.g. if you pick a good political YT video on some topic, and then randomly select half a dozen other YT videos on the same topic, they are probably garbage.<p>So while the selection process isn&#x27;t blameless (it could be improved to promote quality videos) much of the fault lies with the quality of the available material.<p>How would the selection process promote quality? How does the machine know that? You can&#x27;t tell from the likes and dislikes; such populist metrics would promote garbage all the same. It seems that it would require a large team of workers to curate videos.')
