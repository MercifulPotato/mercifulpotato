So if someone only wanted to allocate $100 towards dating apps, bumble would be the best economic decision if their area is active with bumble users they find attractive.<p>I like the idea of that one time fee compared to the monthly IAP through tinder&#x2F;hinge.<p>However I can’t provide any anecdotes on the paid stuff, I prefer not to spend money on those things.<p>Ya I feel like it was until recently that dating apps attracted normal people. Now references to ‘swiping right’ are common in pop songs.<p>I know many girls that will share their dating app experiences with their parents, which I find odd.')
