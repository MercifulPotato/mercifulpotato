Item(by='powersnail', descendants=None, kids=[24748987], score=None, time=1602443735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748016, text='I&#x27;m sure this is highly subjective, and people get fun or boredom in their own ways.<p>I just find that I cannot enjoy something if I have too much doubts. I may enjoy doing it once or twice, but if I&#x27;m constantly caught in failure&#x2F;exhaustion, it&#x27;s no longer fun.<p>I used to be into composing and improvisation, but each time I attempt at it, the result was to &quot;meh&quot;. I walked the keyboard but knew nowhere to go. The fun was basically an initial passion plus a little curiosity, which in me, tends to die quickly if no fuel is supplied.<p>Meanwhile, my friend who actually studied Jazz, can sit in front of a piano and just play, fully enjoying every second of it, while entertaining everyone else. Comparing with my randomly walking on the keyboard, it&#x27;s a higher level of fun as he attempts to weave the harmonies and melodies, and it&#x27;s more lasting and more complex.<p>Again, it&#x27;s a quite personal thing, as I also have a friend who literally doesn&#x27;t do anything new. He neither dabbles nor learn seriously; has no hobbies apart from having dinner with friends; but still, he seems to be really happy.')
