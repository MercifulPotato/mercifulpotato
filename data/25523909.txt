Maybe the rest is reasonable, but first...<p>When sharing to colleagues you get to choose if you allow them to edit&#x2F;comment&#x2F;view. That, to be honest, is the first thing I check when I share docs (be it Google Docs, Quip or Notion). I won&#x27;t rely on the defaults of the software because it&#x27;s too costly to not get it right.<p>Second, you don&#x27;t have to lock the document. As long as you disallow editing, you as the owner of the document still can edit the document. Am I missing something?<p>Third, notifications shoot as soon as you enter colleague names. I get this might be annoying at first. But don&#x27;t many great UX stuff need some kind of getting-used-to? When switching from Windows to OSX, I was shocked that you get to rename a folder when you hit ENTER, rather than open it. Guess what? I got used to it. I have my alternative to opening a folder and it&#x27;s not slower. In this notification case I&#x27;d then just see entering the colleague names as the last step. Problem solved.<p>All the first three bullet points are not inherent bad UX issues &quot;built into the DNA&quot; as claimed by OP. Notion is great. It&#x27;s more powerful Google Docs and easy to use in general. The article is written in a way as if the author has not had any positive experiences from using Notion. That&#x27;s unfortunate.')
