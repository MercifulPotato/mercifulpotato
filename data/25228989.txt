A faraday cage is meant to block electromagnetic fields; it won&#x27;t do anything to stop leptons.<p>In my university labs I remember an experiment where we were detecting cosmic ray muons that would travel through a series of stacked lead plates. You didn&#x27;t have to wait long before recording an event. These particles are big and fast and you need quite a lot of shielding to block them.')
