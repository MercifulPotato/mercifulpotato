I surely spent less time on that than would have been necessary for chess, but it is amazing to see what progress is possible.  I could play level 9[heart] without an end (in infinite play mode) or up to high 3 (6 rows of waste on bottom).  When moving a brick to the left or right edge, the gameboy would make a long beep instead of individual blips.  No idea how I could move my fingers that fast.<p>It is fun.  For chess in contrast to Tetris, there is even a good chance for it to stay fun -- Tetris is a bit too simplistic for that, I think.')
