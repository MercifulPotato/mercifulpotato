We had an (admittedly more complex) monolith application for customer contracts and billing. It wasn&#x27;t ideal, and was getting long in the tooth (think Perl Catalyst and jQuery), so the powers that be wanted to build a new service. But instead of decomposing the monolith into a few more loosely integrated services, they went way overboard with 20+ microservices, every DB technology imagineable (Oracle RDBMS, Mongo, MariaDB), a full message bus via RabbitMQ, and some crazy AWS orchestration to manage it all.<p>What could&#x27;ve been an effort to split the existing service into manageable smaller services and rewrite components as needed turned into a multi-year ground-up effort. When I left they were no where near production ready, with significant technical debt and code rot from already years out of date libraries and practices.')
