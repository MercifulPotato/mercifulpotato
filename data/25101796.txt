Want a laptop that can last all day, edit 4K, and be operated as an appliance, not a passion project? You’ve got Windows and Apple. I have run Linux forever, from day one, and while it can run the services we need for the whole internet, it’s not desktop viable in the ways Windows and Linux are.<p>In this argument, I’m not sure that level of product development can be dismissed. I wish Apple had implemented this better, I just bought a Windows machine so I wasn’t dependent on one platform, I’m trying to move towards Linux again (to be aligned with my own values), but the engineering this community wants, and the readiness of the platform &amp; product we can buy any day of the week at Best Buy ... doesn’t exist.<p>So I, personally incentivized to give Apple a bit of a pass on this one, and hope they iterate this solution in the right direction, and definitely hope they don’t turn the Mac App Store into the iOS App Store.')
