I think people need to be invested if they want to learn, because otherwise there&#x27;s always other day job or life stuff that&#x27;s way too easy to be distracted by. In a way it&#x27;s very similar to adding user stickiness to a product you&#x27;re selling, except in this case you are your own user and you have to add your own stickiness.<p>If you&#x27;re doing a CRUD thing, I&#x27;d suggest supporting <i>both</i> JSON and HTML representations of your responses (and Yesod works great for this). I think the art is in the details between the language parts you know and the libraries you end up interfacing with. Once you start doing this for real, <i>that&#x27;s</i> when the details you learned in isolation in the beginning all begin to fit together.')
