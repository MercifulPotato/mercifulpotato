In my state (MN) it&#x27;s not unheard of to rent an apartment in a desirable (aka good athletic) school district to play for that team.<p>My sister was an elite athlete and spent a few post college years at a specialized training academy. Multiple professional athletes trained here in the off-season.<p>She had multiple classes of middle school children to run training sessions with. Some of these middle schoolers even paid for 1 one 1 training with her for even more money.<p>Replace &quot;Admission test&quot; with &quot;varsity tryouts&quot; and you have basically the same system, with the same gamesmanship and money being spent.')
