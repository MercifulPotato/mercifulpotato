This is only one of the recent bizarre legal changes (there was another recent one on consent being impossible to establish.)<p>There are so many things wrong with intruding into the home:<p>1) As mentioned in the article, this creates a pervasive surveillance state similar to the Stasi, where on average, there was a spy in each home in the country. The standard tip payment to inform on your relative was a pair of jeans.<p>2) A law like this further erodes the nuclear family as the foundation of a nation. We are already seeing the impact of that in the USA, with a rapidly increasing number of single-parent households, mainly due to family courts intervening into families. There is a tipping point where you regulate families out of existence, and we&#x27;re a lot closer than you think.<p>(US Black leaders have warned other groups that they&#x27;re on the same path to family destruction as they already followed in the past 2 generations. That should be a wake-up call for everybody.)<p>3) The law can be used against domestic partners in family court. Already unsubstantiated domestic violence claims are allowed, next there will be unsubstantiated racial claims?<p>The only way to protect yourself is to video-record all family interactions. Is that what we want?<p>4) Who is to decide whether a statement is hate speech or not, or what the intent is? If you ask different generations of Americans what hate speech is, you get widely varying answers that vary from things that are obvious, to simply not  meeting any standard. Yet there&#x27;s one law for all, despite varying personal standards.<p>(One of the most public examples was Ben Affleck calling Sam Harris a racist when discussing Islam on television. In fact, Islam is an ideology&#x2F;religion, not a race at all. So even adults prepared for a debate can&#x27;t get their viewpoint across accurately. Do we arrest all of the participants in that debate?)')
