Still, fast growing companies and enormously large corporations do it on a regular basis.<p>Wealth extraction is something you can do when there is enough for everyone. Smaller communities, such as families, small businesses and so on understand this very well. But parasitic behavior is apparently accepted in larger communities as it can hide behind abstract notions of hierarchy and ideology.<p>Taking large risks is something you can do when you are punching up or when you charter into unknown territory, truly innovate things. Just because a business uses software doesn&#x27;t make it innovative though.')
