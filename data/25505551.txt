A purely random number - including the output of SHA2 - is going to have long consecutive strings of 1&#x27;s or 0&#x27;s.<p>Here&#x27;s a simulation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;_eNAI3inGyQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;_eNAI3inGyQ</a><p>The results show that ~0.35% of all SHA2 outputs have &gt;=15 zeroes in a row! Which means that ~0.7% of all SHA2 outputs have &gt;=15 runs of the same binary digit in a row. As stated in the blog post, it&#x27;s uncommon but it&#x27;s not so uncommon that it should serve as a red flag.<p>If you change the code to look for runs of 9 in a row or greater, you&#x27;ll see that ~40% of all SHA2 outputs have runs of ones or zeros that are greater than 9 in length.<p>Uniform randomness means that you will get long strings of ones or zeros on occasion. And it&#x27;s more common than most human intuition would suggest.')
