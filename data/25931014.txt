I think that is the global number.<p>That represents a substantial lead, and as others are commenting, they combine it with a nice user experience. I don&#x27;t see how it will be particularly durable though, there isn&#x27;t really a bottleneck for deployments of other charge stations, just not a lot of investment in it. Fixing the experience is harder, but gas stations provide a hint that other parties will at least get it down to swiping a card.')
