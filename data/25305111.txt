But, at what point should employees outright refuse to be connected to work on personal time?<p>I get that people whom have families that depend on them have limited choice in how far they can rebel at work, but perhaps we need young people to be a part of a new culture of work-life balance where interacting with work during <i>any</i> unpaid hours is seen as optional.  Only those who have little to lose can stand up to corporate and make a difference.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t work for an employer that wants free time from me.  If that means I don&#x27;t make a lot of money, that&#x27;s fine by me.  Time has value.<p>Having regulation around this issue can help with professions like the legal profession where the real way up the ladder is by overworking in whatever way possible.  For people such as myself, an engineer, where overwork and brown-nosing don&#x27;t have a 1-to-1 relation with a bigger paycheck or greater job stability, they have more leverage over what their employer can or cannot do to them.')
