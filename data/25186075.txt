This outsourcing surprised me. Toyota was known for keeping some fraction of all work in-house, like battery production, explicitly to prevent this kind of organizational dysfunction. I&#x27;d like to know why these systems were handled differently. And what org changes they&#x27;ve made since.<p>Per Sandy Munro and the Autoline pundits, Tesla develops all of they own systems in-house. While I&#x27;m aware of their struggles, long term I think this is the better strategy.<p>Thoughts?')
