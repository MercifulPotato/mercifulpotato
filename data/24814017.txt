It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern &quot;knowledge&quot; is that it is wrong. The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. &quot;If I am the wisest man,&quot; said Socrates, &quot;it is because I alone know that I know nothing.&quot; the implication was that I was very foolish because I was under the impression I knew a great deal.<p>&gt; My answer to him was, &quot;John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.&quot;<p>&quot;Truth is hard, let&#x27;s go Postmodern!&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid conclusion. It&#x27;s an escape hatch, a refusal to make a best effort and, when it&#x27;s about something that matters, a horribly dangerous practice which essentially cedes the field to the idiots who have no such scruples. &quot;VACCINES BAD! VACCINES AUTISM!&quot; is idiocy, it&#x27;s dangerous, and it must be countered, not implicitly allowed to pass because what is &quot;Facts&quot; anyway, man?')
