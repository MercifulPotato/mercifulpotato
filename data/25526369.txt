Don&#x27;t like the misery salary? Look at the queue of people looking for the job willing to work for less.<p>It is middle and lower class workers who hate competition from low income workers. The miserable salary in the &quot;rich&quot; country is being rich in a poor country.<p>It is the middle and lower class those that suffer from the higher criminal rates because they are the ones who are being stolen or their houses occupied.<p>The rich live isolated in good places, with private security.<p>There are additional problems like the cultural one.
