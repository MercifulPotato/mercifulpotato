The logic board fried when waking from sleep after a battery replacement. There are no official replacement batteries. I&#x27;m trying to find a suitable computer to switch to.<p>2014 MacBook Pro:<p>+ Repair parts are easy to find<p>+ Skilled repairers can fix the logic board (e.g. Louis Rossmann, Paul Daniels)<p>+ Retina screen, good webcam<p>+ Full size USB, HDMI, SD card slots.<p>+ SSD upgraded to 4 TB, currently possible up to 8 TB, presumably more in future.<p>- Original batteries swollen. Replacement batteries broke 3 logic boards in a week due to power surges when waking from sleep.<p>- Not sure who to trust in order to replace the battery safely.<p>2016-2020 Intel MacBook:<p>+ AppleCare would allow me to have it fixed for another 3 years.<p>- No full-size USB, HDMI ports.<p>- I can&#x27;t upgrade the SSD, or remove the SSD and recover data elsewhere<p>- Important chips for repair, e.g. ISL9239, are not available. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gmRd9IVE6dc?t=490" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gmRd9IVE6dc?t=490</a><p>- No MagSafe<p>2020 ARM MacBook:<p>+ M1 chip is very fast.<p>+ Good battery life<p>- Cannot boot into Linux or Windows, which I will need for work.<p>- No more Target Disk Mode<p>- Cannot sync iPhone over USB (contacts, calendars, music, bookmarks, photos)<p>Non-Apple:<p>- No Time Machine<p>- Software compatibility: AppleScript, Office, Keynote&#x2F;Numbers&#x2F;Pages, Skype<p>- Cannot sync iPhone over USB (contacts, calendars, music, bookmarks, photos)<p>- Generally heavier, worse webcams, non-replacable batteries<p>- No leaked schematics, boardviews, parts, iFixit guides for repairers.<p>Even though the repairers (especially Rossmann) say many terrible things about Apple, I still think the documentation and parts are easier to find for old Macs than for average PCs. \nIt&#x27;s been 6 years though, and I don&#x27;t think Apple are going to change their mind. I want to be able to move away, but it&#x27;s really hard to find a decent alternative.')
