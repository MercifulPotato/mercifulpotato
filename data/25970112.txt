Increasing that peak is very expensive.  However, because most of the grid is fixed-cost.  The marginal cost of generation is between 1&#x2F;2 and 1&#x2F;3 the cost of electricity.<p>California is moving to variable electricity prices (so-called Time of Use).  Electricity is more expensive between 4-9 PM when it&#x27;s more expensive to provide electricity.  So, if people charge their EVs when it&#x27;s less expensive to do so, we&#x27;ll be fine. But regulators will need to continue to align electricity price with electricity cost.')
