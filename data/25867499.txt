Was deplatforming anyone but blatant white supremacists even a conversation before 2017?<p>Most mainstream conservatives operate accounts on Twitter without an issue and a fair amount of libertarian and conservative-identifying individuals have used Twitter for years without being banned for their views. Framing this as a problem with political viewpoints doesn&#x27;t do much besides serve a false narrative.<p>If you read Twitter&#x27;s rationale for banning Donald Trump it didn&#x27;t have much to do with his viewpoint. It had everything to do with implying and promoting violent acts. Putting deplatforming in terms of &quot;censorship of political views&quot; is a seductive argument but it falls apart when you recognize the content of those viewpoints have less to do with a matter of policy opinion and more to do with an unhinged ideology based around waging civil war against your opponents.')
