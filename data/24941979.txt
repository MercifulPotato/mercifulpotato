My wife and were trying to buy a home in Toronto.  We bid on a home that had no movement all summer and made an offer.  Later that evening the selling agent found a mysterious second bidder, who they were also representing and that buyer kept overbidding us. Our agent wasn&#x27;t privy to the bids we were making but I am sure that agent was sharing them with their buyer.  They tried to get us to bid almost 20% over asking but but we walked away after 1%. I don&#x27;t see how it is ethical for an agent to represent the buyer and seller in a home selling situation but I suppose if they ban it those agents will just get someone else in their company or some sort of friend to do the same thing.')
