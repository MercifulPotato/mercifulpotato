Item(by='Bresenham', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609770334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25630942, text='&gt; it is going to be significantly harder to start steering the company&#x27;s product direction and social responsibility efforts than &#x27;just&#x27; representing the employees during e.g. benefits and compensation negotiations.<p>Unions with a very limited focus on their member&#x27;s compensation negotiations tend to be either short-lived or so weak it is like they don&#x27;t exist.  Just for survival, unions want wider unionization in their own industry and then other industries and then internationally.<p>Actually FAANG was already organized against employee compensation in the secret pact between Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt etc. which courts found illegal.<p>Are corporations and their majority controlling shareholders just representing the employers &quot;during e.g. benefits and compensation negotiations&quot;.  No.  In 1938, the American Enterprise Association (now called AEI) was formed by Chrysler, General Mills, Paine Webber to push corporate hegemony.  Their website is one screed after another attacking progressive values.  If these companies think it important to spend money attacking, as you call them, progressive values, why should unions limit themselves in not defending them?  It makes little sense to start things out with one hand tied behind the back.  AEI is just one front of corporate America&#x27;s many fronts.')
