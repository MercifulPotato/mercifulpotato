The authors’ attribution&#x2F;specific call-out to circadian rhythms is a bit odd to me, since it doesn’t seem like they tested&#x2F;measured those specifically.<p>Edit: case in point: “ We also did not have data at the individual level regarding each player’s internal circadian timing, and therefore individual differences in circadian disruption could have differed between players and affected team outcomes.”<p>I don’t think circadian rhythms should have been mentioned in the title of the article at all.  It should be about travel which is more broad and accurate to what they were measuring.')
