If you approximately separate renaming from editing, it seems to work very reliably for me.)<p>There&#x27;s also nothing stopping anyone from writing a git history browser that caches the calculation.  The point is that it&#x27;s ephemeral &#x2F; derived state, not authoritative state.<p>One problem with the name-based systems is that developers don&#x27;t actually use the VCS rename operation.  They just delete and add, and then you&#x27;ve lost the diff under every system I know of.  Another problem is importing from other VCSes -- the metadata is often messed up subtlely.<p>Git keeps it simple.  And they can and have improved the algorithm over time without making your repo data obsolete &#x2F; incompatible.')
