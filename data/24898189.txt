If I have a computer, typing is faster, if I have a phone, which we almost always do, it&#x27;s faster to trigger the command or type.<p>Speech is competing against every other tech item trying to be convenient, from laptops to phones to watches... the only space where I&#x27;d want it is something like baking or cooking when I can&#x27;t interface with a computer.<p>(edit) and what about the response back? A visual interface I can confirm at a glance whether my input was accurate, a voice one I have to listen to the whole thing. I even don&#x27;t like maps directions in the car as half the time I know the next direction already and don&#x27;t want the interruption to music or whatever I&#x27;m listening to.')
