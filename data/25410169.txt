I was driving on a three lane, 45 mph road in the middle lane, and as I passed a slowed right turning car in the right lane, the cyclist rode his bicycle out into my lane, from the front of the right turning car,  perpendicular to the flow of traffic. I had maybe 10-20ft to slow, and hit him at probably 20mph, if not more. His home insurance ended up paying for my damages.')
