If you want students to answer a problem with any practical application (e.g. money&#x2F;finance, statistics), or more complex problems where the point is to follow the logic, being able to use the calculator in your pocket is great.<p>A perfectly reasonable assigned problem might be: add the 7.1% sales tax to this ticket price, do you have enough cash?<p>And secondly, number sense is easier to teach without depending on particular algorithms.<p>This is the same complaint as people grumbling about &quot;common core&quot; math, or saying we should go back to the basics of just rote learning times tables and long division.<p>Students are learning about number sense by different routes now - routes that don&#x27;t end up with most students blindly trying to follow a particular algorithm with no sense of what is actually happening.')
