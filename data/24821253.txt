Our mistake was to let the virus into our elderly homes. I don&#x27;t really see the evidence that we should have had lockdowns. As OP says the are a lot of precautions set in place already and even more earlier in the pandemic. Most worked from home and followed safety precautions given.<p>That said I am open to changing my mind and think it is good that the authorities are stressing more precautions again. People have been getting a bit careless again and infection rate is increasing. It hasn&#x27;t resulted in rise in death yet but we have to be vigilant.')
