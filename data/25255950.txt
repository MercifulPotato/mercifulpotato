I went straight from my CS degree into software development and have spent the last 18 years coding, and (hopefully!) getting better along the way.  I&#x27;ve sometimes felt I&#x27;ve been the best programmer on a team, but certainly not always.  If I had to take a SWAG and put a broad number on it, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m a 60-70th percentile programmers.<p>I recently changed jobs and became the third member of a team.  The existing members are an older team lead who seems to be an ok coder, and someone about my age and experience level, who is the office rock star.  The rock star eats, sleeps and breathes Java and the related technologies.  He cranks out a lot of code, and he works a lot (he seems to have little else to do during the pandemic).  He considers the system we&#x27;re working on &quot;his baby&quot;.  The 2-person team had already been doing code reviews before I arrived.<p>I&#x27;m not a Googler, but I&#x27;ve read and try to stay somewhat close to their &quot;How to do a code review&quot; guide.  One item that sticks with me from their guide is &quot;Look at every line of code that you have been assigned to review&quot;.  I try to stick to that and not just scan and rubber-stamp reviews, but man is it hard when you log in in the morning and find 3 new MRs with a total of about 3000 lines to review.  Especially when that feels like a common occurrence.<p>The reality is, as the new person on the team, I&#x27;m certainly not going to deeply understand the implication of every change.  But I feel that it&#x27;s my job to dive in and look for any issues I can find.  The issue here is that code review is taking up an inordinate amount of my time, meaning I&#x27;m not making what I consider to be ample progress on my coding tasks.<p>Does anyone out there have pointers for how to do effective code reviews in situations like this?')
