Isn&#x27;t the proper way to evaluate what data is being shared to assume each app exploits its permissions up to the level of trust you have in the company that provided it? Eg. if you worry Facebook is stealing your contact list, then if their app has that permission, you should assume they are stealing it. No need to bother checking if they actually are. They might do it when you&#x27;re not looking anyway.<p>As for data being sent from your device to 3rd parties, again, if you don&#x27;t trust the app&#x27;s developer not do to that, you also won&#x27;t trust them not to be sharing it from their end where you have no way to look at the traffic.')
