So their were being held to a higher standard than some of their competitors, who had much higher profit margins by putting multiple customers on one machine.<p>So I think he is justifiably happy that Apple created a fair competition by clearly spelling out the legal rules for everyone.<p>The fact that Apple&#x27;s official rules are close to what they were doing adds additional credibility to this interpretatio, because it suggest that they were following Apple&#x27;s guidance before it became legally easy to enforce<p>I wouldn&#x27;t put any blame for how these rules look like on MacStadium, because if Epic cannot negotiate with Apple on eye level, I&#x27;m confident that MacStadium never will. It&#x27;s probably more like they received their future laws as dictated by their fruit-shaped God.')
