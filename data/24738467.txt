Then my friend &amp; collaborator on the project (Chris Rutter) died at the age of 19, then I finished college, had to find work and lost most of my RISC OS connections &amp; nostalgia.<p>There was definitely a rich seam of RISC OS software in 2000 that Linux desktop could have used - great text editors and word processors and Sibelius.  But Linux got most of that pretty fast.<p>Also I don&#x27;t think RISC OS would have escaped the trap of most desktop OSes - that a desktop OS with native applications became a niche, expensive taste.  By 2010 most desktop computer users were looking for a host for a web browser, and RISC OS itself is still spectaularly unsuited to that - hostile code, multithreading, support for proprietary blobs (at least in 2000) etc. etc.<p>That doesn&#x27;t stop me missing it though!')
