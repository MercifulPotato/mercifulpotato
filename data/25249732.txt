In 3D there is a one-to-one mapping between vectors and oriented areas (feel free to think of it as a plane along with scalar denoting an area of the plane). When I learned about vector calculus, this one-to-one mapping was used liberally and implicitly, even though the vector a×b behaves differently from the vector a and the vector b.<p>Even if you take the magnitude of a×b to get a scalar |a×b|, that scalar does not behave the same as e.g. the scalar a ⋅ b. The SI system cannot distinguish between a scalar torque Newton-meters and scalar work Newton-meters, though they are different.<p>Geometric Algebra makes the difference explicit. For me, it&#x27;s not about giving a meaning to a×b after the fact, but rather to ensure it has meaning by construction.<p>I think it&#x27;s valid to assume the operation a×b and then figure out what it means (or doesn&#x27;t mean, or call it a weird tool). But Geometric Algebra gives one way to think about it more clearly. It&#x27;s not about fundamental beauty for me. It&#x27;s about having a consistent and clear system to operate within.')
