I&#x27;m by no means professional at any of these things, but it isn&#x27;t the tools holding me back.<p>I don&#x27;t see any reason not to use Excel or Numbers or what have you on an iPad with the keyboard. I&#x27;m sure it would work fine.<p>I know a couple professional music producers who do the bulk of their work on a tablet now.<p>What hasn&#x27;t made it to tablets is coding environments. Codea and Swift Playgrounds feel like toys to me.<p>But it&#x27;s only a matter of time. I think &quot;decades, if it ever happens&quot; is entirely too pessimistic, it&#x27;s more &quot;now, if you want it&quot;, for most of those things.<p>And it&#x27;s definitely not &quot;literally no one&quot;. It&#x27;s more people than you think.')
