Item(by='bremensaki', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605858112, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25158064, text='I can&#x27;t read dark themed stuff at all for any length of time, and my tolerance is getting worse as I get older. More and more sites seem to be going dark by default and many don&#x27;t offer any way to switch it off.<p>If there&#x27;s an exact opposite version of this extension, I&#x27;d love to see it. I&#x27;ve even tried looking quite recently, but any search for terms like dark&#x2F;light theme tend to throw up nothing but results for making things dark, not light.<p>Tranquility Reader helps a lot, but I&#x27;d like something that focused more on colours than style, leaving the page design mostly intact.')
