The act of conjuring up these desired scenarios while not being in such a situation &#x27;creates&#x27; the feeling of loneliness. So the sequence as I see it is: person likes company, person has free time to ponder and imagines social situations, then feels lonely. I also recall interactions and play out future possible situations or memories. I don&#x27;t however long for them, rather it&#x27;s usually more analytical as what should I do if that should come to pass or what could I have done differently&#x2F;better. It&#x27;s not that I want to be in those situations. I do miss diversity of activity alone or socially.')
