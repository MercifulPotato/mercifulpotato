For painting: literally; for other arts: figuratively-- because, without this humble appliance, you can&#x27;t know where The Art stops and The Real World begins. You have to put a &#x27;box&#x27; around it because otherwise, what is that shit on the wall?”<p>— Frank Zappa<p>I think this “grammar of frames” uses the word too loosely. A frame is more than just a constraint, it’s what denotes the boundary between the subject and the world it is contained in.<p>Brands don’t have a frame. Brands are not the art used to identify them. I think of brands as reputation, trust, and emotions connected to a company. The brand is an idea, not logos and advertisements.')
