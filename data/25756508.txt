The idea behind it was that the electors in each state would have to vote proportionally to the popular vote <i>within that state</i> while not changing the number of electors granted to each state.<p>Because of the small number of electors in some states, rounding issues can be quite significant in some situations, and I believe the proposal required fractional electoral voters, representing a tenth of a percent of the state popular vote.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;past_attempts_at_reform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;past_attempts_at_reform</a>')
