Here&#x27;s something I was thinking about recently:<p>1) I also started programming very young, maybe eight or nine years old.<p>2) My first language was Python and I still program in Python today, the programming language with the motto &quot;there&#x27;s only one way to do it&quot;. At some point I had to write Perl for a summer job and it&#x27;s TMTOWTDI attitude and many symbols nearly broke my brain, I hated it for most of the summer.<p>3) I used vim and then emacs for a very long time, and recently started using Visual Studio Code and Pycharm. This made me realize that one of my favorite features of any editor was actually the minimap VSC provides on the side by the scrollbar (which Pycharm does not by default provide). Not having it, having it, and then not having it again made me realize I utilized it a surprising amount even though it&#x27;s a seemingly trivial feature compared to, say, code completion or syntax highlighting. It was just very fast for me to jump around a large file by clicking on the minimap; I knew where to click to jump to the function or class I wanted.<p>4) I am a vicious style guide zealot. I got poo-poo&#x27;ed once by a coworker for submitting a large commit where the only changes were renaming things to snake_case. But the code just looked <i>wrong</i> to me, I had to do it. I write C&#x2F;C++ in K&amp;R style and find it difficult to read code not indented as such.<p>I was sitting on my lunch break and all these things kind of crashed together into a great epiphany - maybe the reason I program in this specific way is because the code has to <i>look</i> a certain way in my head. Like I&#x27;m literally imagining a sort of minimap in my brain and if the syntax, conventions, order, spacing, etc. are wrong it screws up my very visual model because it literally <i>looks wrong</i>. The more rigidly the code follows the rules, the more visually consistent it is and the easier it is to structure.<p>Your comment makes me wonder if there really is some semi-visual, semi-textual model that certain programmers form of their code, which is ever-present but really hard to express in other ways. I also wonder if this is a common thing, and if it helps or hurts when programming.')
