You need a driver that is alert and monitoring the vehicle because it can return control to the driver without warning.<p>* Waymo has launched limited L4 pilot in the &quot;easy&quot; Tempe, AZ area. They have remote teleoperation &#x2F; monitoring but no driving in the car.<p>* ATG has prototypes that run with safety drivers<p>* Cruise has prototypes that run with safety drivers + they are working on tele-monitoring &#x2F; teleoperation.<p>* Comma.AI has a consumer-available L2 driver-assistance device that you can add to your car to do ACC and lane keeping.<p>* Aurora has prototypes that run with safety drivers<p>* Zoox (bought by AMZN) has prototypes that run with safety drivers<p>* Smattering of other companies that are working on the tech, but are no where close to a product launch (Lyft, Toyota, Argo etc)<p>In general, there was a bunch of hype and bunch of money poured into the industry in 2016-2018. Others saw people pouring money into it and assumed a breakthrough was close and so they poured more money in. The cycle continued to spiral into huge multi-billion dollar investments into technology that is still IMO quite far away from a public launch. Turns out that several years later, it&#x27;s really hard and no one is actually that close to useful AVs.<p>Waymo has a publicly available product launched, but I&#x27;m confident they are running that program at a significant loss.<p>Cruise has struggled to hit the milestones set in their funding deals to unlock the next levels of funding.<p>In my opinion, Comma is going to crush it in the next 2 years, Tesla will keep refining their AP tech, but still won&#x27;t be FSD. I think autonomous robotaxis will be the norm eventually but not until after 2025.')
