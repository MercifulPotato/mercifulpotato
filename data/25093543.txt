Because the cell isn&#x27;t really battery tech in that pedantic sense either. If you&#x27;re going to say the things that make batteries functional in their applications aren&#x27;t part of the tech, then you&#x27;re left with defining batteries merely as the chemical reactions that take place. It&#x27;s like saying the glass housing isn&#x27;t part of light bulb technology because it&#x27;s not the element that actually gives off light. That the legs on a chair are not pair of chair technology because it&#x27;s not the part you actually sit on.<p>You cannot divorce the things that make something  function in any practical sense for the concept of that area of technology.<p>You seem to be taking issue with this topic because some articles imply it&#x27;s the cell that&#x27;s been innovated. You have a point: The articles should be clearer. But the failure of those articles to properly make that distinction doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not part of battery technology.<p>Let&#x27;s make this simpler: There is battery <i>cell</i> technology and there is battery <i>management</i> technology. Both are part of high tech implementations of <i>battery systems</i>.')
