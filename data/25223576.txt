This way of approaching our history is frequently used in what is effectively woke propaganda, as well as propaganda in support of Chinese authoritarian style government.<p>Regarding your claims specifically:<p>Americans did not hang witches &quot;all the time&quot;. Prosecutions for sorcery and witchcraft occurred in the USA in the late 1600s, that&#x27;s true -- but they all occurred all over Europe into the late 1600s.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_England" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_England</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_the_Netherlands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_the_Netherland...</a> (ended trials exceptionally early)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_Finland" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_Finland</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_Denmark" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_trials_in_Denmark</a><p>In England, the last person prosecuted for witchcraft (thankfully not executed) was Helen Duncan in 1944:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helen_Duncan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helen_Duncan</a><p>Most European kingdoms did not have slavery in Europe; it&#x27;s in the colonies where all of them established slavery. The US was such a colony. It&#x27;s perhaps unusual in being a place where slavery was abolished as a result of a war between the ruling inhabitants, as opposed to a slave revolt or something like that. The British followed a more orderly process, though, abolishing slavery in the colonies and then compensating the slave owners out of the treasury.<p>Slavery was abolished in the English colonies in 1833. That&#x27;s 32 years before it&#x27;s abolition in the United States. That might not be the &quot;much longer&quot; that you had in mind.')
