The company had an almost 4-star average review and the first three pages were glowing 4 and 5 star reviews.<p>My first week at the company was nothing like the great workplace describe on Glassdoor. I&#x27;ll spare the details, but suffice to say it was the most abusive workplace I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>Later, I realized that all of the 4 and 5 star Glassdoor reviews started after a specific date and arrived in a short burst. If I went back far enough, the reviews were consistently 1 or 2 stars.<p>I tried to leave a fair 2-star review using the most dry and basic facts without any exaggeration or hyperbole. It stayed up for a month before disappearing without explanation.<p>Glassdoor is not a place to find honest company reviews.')
