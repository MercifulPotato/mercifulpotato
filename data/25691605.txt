I used to be into building model solid-fuel rocket engines. If you have certain two common household ingredients and a stove on hand, you can make a sizeable one in a couple of minutes. And the difference between a rocket engine and a crude pipe bomb is whether you stuff the resulting mixture into a plastic pipe vs. metal pipe, and whether you seal it off on one or both ends. So I can easily imagine some amateur pyrotechnician constructing a crude explosive in the heat of the moment (that doesn&#x27;t excuse it in any way, though).')
