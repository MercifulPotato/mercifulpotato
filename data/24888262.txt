I was born wealthy, and some people are born homeless, purely based on IQ. This is patently unfair, but you can&#x27;t address that if IQ isn&#x27;t real. I think people deny the validity of IQ because they are afraid if IQ is real then our society is structured in a way that is very unfair to people with low IQ.')
