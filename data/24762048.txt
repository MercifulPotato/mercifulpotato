Software, in many cases results in what is essentially a rental without the advantages inherent in rentals, and lots of downsides.<p>Right to repair is a matter of growing importance.<p>Now food?<p>Frankly, I would much prefer do it at home get a broad exemption for self sufficiency reasons, if nothing else.<p>Arguably, nobody needs this food.  I won&#x27;t have anything to do with it.<p>Fine.<p>But the EULA will spread.  Clearly someone has thought it time to maximize revenue in this way, and if they are successful, more will follow.')
