These cases do definitely happen in English-speaking countries -- not that I understand your argument here in the first place (Signal is available world-wide and has been translated to many other languages, what does language have to do with anything?). Not to mention that Signal themselves don&#x27;t warn you about this behaviour at all.<p>(Yes, you could argue that an abusive partner has many other avenues through which to discover that you&#x27;re asking for help -- but that isn&#x27;t a defense of providing more avenues for an abuser to discover you&#x27;re asking for help. Again, Signal <i>actively notifies all of your contacts that you&#x27;ve started using Signal</i> -- which is above and beyond the transparent upgrade from SMS to Signal messages you mentioned.)')
