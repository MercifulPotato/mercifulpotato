Is ability to produce the occasional Mark Z or Jeff B &quot;success&quot;? Or is success just an upward slope on broad economic indicators like GDP?<p>I think the picture looks quite different if you look at things like quality of life indicators— and then it&#x27;s (surprise!) nations like Denmark and Switzerland which top the list. I suspect it would be even more stark if you were able to measure class mobility— the number of people who have at least +x% inflation adjusted net worth over their parents at the same age.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s a little bizarre (and a very US-centric view) to just assume that &quot;success&quot; on a national level and socialist policies are mutually exclusive.')
