With every example I come across, I get a more and more clear idea of the limits of current mainstream approaches in AI.<p>When it comes to predicting or achieving human-level general behavior it seems to me that the SOTA is reaching a hard limit that lies far below actual AGI.<p>I&#x27;m not a researcher in this field, so this opinion should be taken with more than a grain of salt, but if I&#x27;m right, 10 years from now we&#x27;re still gonna be stuck at GPT-3-ish levels of clever mimicry.')
