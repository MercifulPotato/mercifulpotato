He shares his thoughts on why he dislikes Facebook so much and how MeWe stands to be different. I was surprised to learn that Sir Tim Berners-Lee is an advisor of the company. I like the positions MeWe is taking. I feel they are approaching social media in the right direction. One of the most important aspects of this is their business model. MeWe is ad-free. They make their money on in-app purchases and a premium subscription service. I also like the fact that feeds are in chronological order and only show content that you actually choose to follow.')
