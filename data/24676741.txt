I&#x27;m able to focus on tasks long term AND even if something bad happens in my life I&#x27;m able to keep right on track<p>That sounds amazing. I can&#x27;t even imagine that.

Things going bad still derails me significantly.<p>They&#x27;re fairly conservative with meds in my neck of the woods, but I&#x27;m going to persist with my doctor to try them all to find what works.<p>The struggle to push through actually going through all the phone calls, emails and appointments necessary to get to that point is very un-ADHD friendly. So many times I considered just to give up and forget about it.')
