More people watch the superhero drivel than the arthouse films, for sure, so perhaps it would all balance out, but it&#x27;s unclear.<p>Secondly, while I broadly love Terrence Malick, if I&#x27;d paid £20 for &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; (which was dire), I would have to think very, very hard about parting with another £20 for his next film unless the notices were very good.  I think you&#x27;d end up with a minuscule audience if you started marking up arthouse films in this way.<p>Unrelatedly, I have to admit that &quot;Mank&quot; sounds really boring and I&#x27;m not eager to watch it, even though I have a Netflix subscription and I&#x27;ve enjoyed many of Fincher&#x27;s previous films (hell, I even liked &quot;Alien 3&quot;).')
