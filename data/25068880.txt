If their CPU&#x2F;IC design segment were its own company, the M1 would never have seen the light of day. Period.<p>Furthermore, this chip is not meant to be a retail product. It&#x27;s optimised for the exact requirements that Apple&#x27;s products have. The whole reason why they&#x27;re able to beat Intel&#x2F;AMD is because they don&#x27;t have to cater to the exact same generic market that the established players do, but instead massively optimise for their exact needs.<p>I genuinely don&#x27;t understand how can anyone who wishes to break up Apple not see that these things?')
