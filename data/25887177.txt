When Starcraft 2 came out, I went hard on the competitive ladder. Then I got my first management job, and overnight I felt like I had no energy to play strategy games anymore. I found I needed to play FPS games to relax, which I had never done before. It was comical how immediate the switch was.<p>In the past year, I&#x27;ve taken a sabbatical from work in a conscious attempt to slow my life down. When the Stardew Valley 1.5 update came out, I tried to get back into it, having fond memories of the game years ago. I found it to be the most stressful experience. I couldn&#x27;t handle playing something with such loosely defined goals.<p>The more time I spend analyzing what games hit and why, the more I feel like this is a poorly understood phenomenon that typical game design analysis cannot comprehend. 2020 saw many games hit purely because they complemented quarantine life well, for example. Among Us and Animal Crossing exploded in ways they wouldn&#x27;t had we not felt like the world was chaotic and isolating. Stardew, I think, has a similar appeal that goes far beyond its game loops.')
