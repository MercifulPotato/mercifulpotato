See both #7857 (comment) about CI infrastructure and #7857 (comment) about GCC for details.<p>Tbh it’s kind of weird to me that Apple didn’t sponsor the work needed for this, and would ensure that it happened sooner.<p>I mean, Apple work closely with Adobe and other software companies to ensure a good experience for the end users. At least I think they do.<p>And there are quite a lot of people using and depending on Homebrew.<p>Take myself for example, an Apple customer. I use an iPhone and a MacBook Air. But many of the tools available through Homebrew are so essential to me that without Homebrew I likely would have stuck with Linux and FreeBSD for my laptop too like I used to instead of using a MacBook Air at all.<p>And it’s not just one laptop either. In the future when I can afford to I am going to buy more Apple computers.')
