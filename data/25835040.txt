Item(by='sterlind', descendants=None, kids=[25835115, 25835111, 25835604, 25835107], score=None, time=1611073510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834823, text='Fwiw, those aliases you mention all exist. I always do &quot;ls&quot; and &quot;cd&quot; for example. But what really annoys me is that there&#x27;s no aliases for arguments. So &quot;find . -name foo&quot; becomes &quot;ls -Recurse -Include foo&quot; which makes my carpal tunnel just a little worse.<p>It&#x27;s a shame because the rest of Powershell is so good.')
