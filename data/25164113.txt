If you want to do the high skilled welding that pays well, you need to essentially support yourself for years as you develop those skills on your own - and most people who have the means to do so have better opportunities in other fields.<p>Realistically, employers need to eat the cost of training new people if they want the pipeline to open back up again, but it&#x27;s more economical to poach a good welder after some other sucker puts their resources into them, so you get a classic tragedy of the commons.')
