Does the attacker have the screen lock? Or is the screen unlocked but they don’t have the screen lock factor?<p>Does the attacker have the ability to inject code into the running OS, or only to read memory contents?<p>Etc.<p>I’m not saying this is unreasonable, but it seems like your design philosophy is sort of “belt and suspenders”—-i.e. layer on any defense you can.
