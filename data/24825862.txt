Because that&#x27;s absolutely not true for many countries, where seasonal flu is routinely reported by the press as creating overloaded hospitals. Here are some examples:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healio.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;infectious-disease&#x2F;20190205&#x2F;bad-flu-seasons-test-us-hospitals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healio.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;infectious-disease&#x2F;20190205&#x2F;bad-...</a><p>&quot;Bad flu seasons test US hospitals: Hospitals in the United States have implemented new policies based on last year’s severe influenza season, but infectious disease experts agree that America’s health care systems would still be seriously challenged by another bad influenza season.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;home-news&#x2F;nhs-winter-pressure-flu-season-capacity-patients-corridors-a-e-vaccine-a8136231.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;home-news&#x2F;nhs-winter-p...</a><p>&quot;NHS winter pressure: Hospitals report 99 per cent capacity over festive period as flu season looms&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;health&#x2F;article-5279685&#x2F;California-hospitals-looks-like-flu-war-zone.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;health&#x2F;article-5279685&#x2F;Californi...</a><p>&quot;Flu drives hospitals into &#x27;war zone&#x27; conditions: Tents on the street in California, &#x27;state of emergency&#x27; in Alabama, and Boston is using GATORADE to plug shortage of IV drips&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.fr&#x2F;20170111&#x2F;french-hospitals-stretched-to-capacity-as-flu-spreads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.fr&#x2F;20170111&#x2F;french-hospitals-stretched-...</a><p>&quot;Hospitals in France at breaking point as flu epidemic spreads&quot;<p>etc. Reports like this are common across the world. Partly it&#x27;s that the press like reporting crisis stories and in any large medical system they can always find health workers willing to give them dramatic quotes. Partly it&#x27;s that surge capacity is always inherently limited.<p><i>every single post mentioning COVID is full of these shallow armchair analyses that seem to think rejecting all prevailing wisdom is an inherent good</i><p>I&#x27;ve not seen anyone claim that rejecting all prevailing wisdom is inherently good. That seems like a strawman. The posts arguing about COVID aren&#x27;t rejecting panic just for the sake of it, they&#x27;re arguing about it because they disagree that the severity of the problem supports the consequent social policies.<p>HN is also full of people posting comments decrying the awful people who double check what government officials are claiming against data, facts and logic. Those are equally aggravating to those of us who don&#x27;t see a problem with critical thinking: especially when the &quot;prevailing wisdom&quot; is a subjective assessment of who thinks what. One that&#x27;s being seriously distorted by media hype and censorship, to boot. The &quot;wisdom&quot; many governments are listening to is sadly very far from wise.')
