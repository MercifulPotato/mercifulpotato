Programmers are the exclusive consumers of the Application Programming Interface, while users don&#x27;t have to know about it. It is true that &quot;programmers are users, too&quot; but this is like saying that tomato farmers also eat tomatoes; the farmer and the chef have different concerns.<p>The point is that conflating these cheapens both disciplines. A good API may last decades, a good UI can float across multiple APIs.')
