It took up a ton of space in the drawer but pieces kept spilling out of their bins and getting stuck. After many hours of tedious design work, I placed an order for a 3D-printed cutlery organizer that would perfectly stack forks and spoons. It was a huge success - it takes up a fraction of the space and is much easier to use, both when unloading the dishwasher and when setting the table. Now, I&#x27;m trying out offering it as a product for sale.
