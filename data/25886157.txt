HLA-B27 is an indicator, but you can&#x27;t diagnose definitively without seeing joint deterioration on X-Ray or MRI. Typically for Ankylosing Spondylitis it&#x27;s the SI joint that has the most damage, which for me is fine so far.  The problems I have are more peripheral joints, and  the only changes I have on X-Ray are bone spurs at the insertion point of several tendons which can result from overuse so it&#x27;s hard to attribute to a rheumatological condition with any certainty.<p>Most recently a rheumatological told me some people are just &quot;bone formers&quot; which might be true, but is still frustrating to hear as it kind of came across as very hand-wavy.')
