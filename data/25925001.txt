In part, though, they play because that&#x27;s how they can build what they want to build. I think it&#x27;s a misunderstanding of the mindset of these people to think they somehow desire the suffering and poverty of others; that&#x27;s incidental. Not that that&#x27;s really ok, but if the technology existed to implement The Culture I think they would honestly prefer that to their current positions.')
