Since I am a federal employee, I tried <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sprintrelay.com&#x2F;federal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sprintrelay.com&#x2F;federal</a> at first when we had dial-in conferences but it was hard at first - I requested that people start their sentences with their name and to whom they were talking like so: &quot;This is Alice here, Bob, did you..&quot;.<p>We moved to Zoomgov and it was hard at times to get captioning scheduled so I moved back to using my phone (which is what I used pre-covid at our in-person meetings) with Live Transcribe. We have the host with OneNote open and everyone has submitted notes so we know the topics that are going to be covered and can use it as sort of meeting minutes for anyone else that missed the meeting or to review what topics were covered.')
