Item(by='jaclaz', descendants=None, kids=[24969132], score=None, time=1604330267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968803, text='Not an expert in the matter, but from what I have seen here on HN news the visibility is usually due to three things:<p>1) timing, if you post it at certain times of the day on certain days it might be more visible[1]<p>2) exact title of the submission (the HN algorithm is <i>somehow</i> influenced by the title)<p>3) sheer luck<p>[1] there are - search for them - related threads, I seem to remember working days tuesday-thursday are better and time should be something around mid-day in the US (but I may well remember incorrectly)<p>I will add (hopefully constructive) my personal comments on the thingy and its site.<p>The site is very well done (simple, relatively responsive) but it is exactly the same as any other site attempting to sell &quot;vague&quot; IOT devices to consumers, lots of pictures of people (all beautiful, young and IMHO <i>senselessly</i> happy) and (as well &quot;vague&quot;) promises to save money, be more in control, <i>whatever</i>.<p>The copywrite is so &quot;standard&quot; that makes me want to cry, with this notable exception:<p>&gt;Your car is now connected to your phone all the time! Can your friends say the same?<p><i>Seriously?</i><p>The thingy is - from what I can understand - an ODB or ODB2 key with (possibly) a GPS and cellular&#x2F;SIM connection, and accompanying app+portal.<p>We don&#x27;t know <i>anything</i> about the firm, who produces it, where it is produced, how exactly the (seemingly) worldwide coverage is achieved, heck we don&#x27;t even know if you are US or EU (UK) based (or somewhere else), from the privacy policy you seem like US based:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cargenta.com&#x2F;privacy-policy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cargenta.com&#x2F;privacy-policy&#x2F;</a><p>but who knows?<p>Little pet-peeve of mine: in my car the ODB connector is under the ashtray, so that thingy cannot be installed, more generally you will need a (flat) cable extension to allow mounting on a number of cars.')
