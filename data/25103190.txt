Why are Lamborghinis allowed to be sold despite emissions easily going into hundreds of grams of CO2&#x2F;km? Because legislators have correctly recognized that the number of Lamborghinis sold each year, and the average amount of miles they are usually driven is absolutely negligable and has close to no impact on climate change. That&#x27;s why small car manufacturers who produce few thousand cars a year have an exemption from the new emissions regulations enforced by the EU from next year - they just don&#x27;t matter at all.<p>Once the market gets to a point where the sales of ICE cars are around few percent out of all, maybe even less - then there&#x27;s no point in banning them at all. Clearly only people who absolutely need them are buying them, because no one else does. So....why ban them? And it looks like the market is absolutely heading towards that point anyway, with truly draconian fines in the EU introduced soon and general apetite for electric cars showing strong growth in the car sales. We&#x27;ll be there in 10 years, full ban or not.')
