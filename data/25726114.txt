They&#x27;re not done trying to burn the existing system down, they think Trump is acting against that system, and they reject the other establishment &#x2F; system candidates (of which there are few regardless in a locked two party system that just practices flipping sides every few years). They also widely believe Trump would have enacted a lot more policies they view favorably if he hadn&#x27;t been thwarted by the opposition.<p>And he did take a few steps to fix issues, including on criminal justice reform and eg his executive order on healthcare pricing (how was something like that not in the ACA?). A pittance for sure. However if you&#x27;re drowning and grasping at straws, those will do. The way the system attacked Trump for four years also makes them believe even more so that he represents the anti-establishment, that he would tear down the existing system.<p>Trump voters also liked his economy until the pandemic crashed it. They think he was at least partially responsible for it. Wages for the bottom 2&#x2F;3 were rising at the fastest pace in two decades. That wasn&#x27;t courtesy of Trump (it was due to a very tight labor market, which would have happened in that term regardless), however as President he gets the credit for it, that&#x27;s how it always works politically. Absent the pandemic, Trump would have easily sailed to a second term via the electoral college.<p>Why did Bernie Sanders voters come back and vote for him so voraciously again after he (maybe) lost last time vs Hillary Clinton? Because they reject the Hillary Clinton &amp; Joe Biden status quo, the never-ending cycle of sticking to the types of candidates and policies of the recent past that have failed.<p>Imagine an alternative election without Trump as a Republican: vote for system status quo conservative candidate (Jeb Bush clones at best, maybe we&#x27;ll get some more war out of it), or vote for Joe Biden, one of the guys that put us into Iraq &amp; Afghanistan for two decades, represents everything wrong with the past 50 years of American politics (which he was an important part of), is a pure establishment candidate, represents the entrenched political elites, and sponsored the human rights smashing 1990s crime bill. One helluva choice Americans get. Death by this, or death by that. Besides, people largely vote by partisanship (which is how you get prominent Democrat Congresspersons that will say Biden is guilty of sexual assault, and they still support him for President; or how you get his VP calling him a racist one minute and then gleefully joining forces with him and pretending he&#x27;s not a racist the next minute; that&#x27;s the nature of being a partisan). The vast majority of voters on each side will stay on their Republican &#x2F; Democrat side; so if you&#x27;re a Republican, your choice is Trump or a likely return to something akin to Bush&#x27;s various terrible policies (the Bush money machine likely would have handed Jeb the Republican nomination in 2016, absent Trump). So as I said, flail it is.')
