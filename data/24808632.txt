Sagan is eloquent in describing his fears, but the concern for <i>Beavis and Butthead</i> was &quot;ok boomer&quot; even at the time and an extremely bad look now. Even in B&amp;B Judge is clearly worried about the same things Sagan is, the difference is Judge&#x27;s belief that the intelligentsia aren&#x27;t going to be any help for us either. (And they weren&#x27;t! And still aren&#x27;t!)<p>It&#x27;s not so prescient. The same quote was often raised  15-20 years ago during the Bush Jr. years with similar praise for its foresight. But the economical transformation was well underway when Sagan wrote it, and even today it hasn&#x27;t been <i>that</i> long (25 years) since it was written. In some sense it&#x27;s horribly myopic - concern about 10-30 second mass broadcasts rather than 20 paragraph conspiracy theories from your uncle is quaint!<p>It&#x27;s not a good context for it. Sagan would have detested Kassam and Rubin, holding them up as prime examples of the media, political, and intellectual failings he&#x27;s describing.')
