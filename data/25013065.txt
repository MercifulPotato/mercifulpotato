So at 15 pages per $1 this is like buying cartridges at $13 a piece, except way more complicated and obnoxious.  Cartridges normally cost around $20 so it is still a slight savings if you&#x27;re willing to deal with the hassle of counting your pages every month.<p>For me however, I give that whole plan a giant middle finger.  That&#x27;s way too much headache and hassle for a $7 savings.')
