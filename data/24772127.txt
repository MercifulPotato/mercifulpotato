Moving or not, the employer could always find a new employee abroad if supply was indeed plentiful.<p>The company tolerating remote workers changes the supply to the company.<p>The people moving immediately are seeing the first effect here, but if it becomes permanent, the people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> move will inevitably get the same paycut.
