It decidedly requires a middle class lifestyle. Also, parents need to have something of their life together beyond just financial resources.<p>But people overestimate the competence required of a parent to teach. Probably the biggest thing I learned was learning how to learn, and in particular, doing that on my own. So reading the textbook in college was hardly a shock. If my parents didn&#x27;t understand a subject, they could learn it with me, or find the resources I needed (including community college, online courses).<p>Unschooling, however, I am not too sympathetic to. You need some structure.')
