Some are great, and some are clearly at the bottom end of the distribution, but most are just OK. They can get the job done, they can do good work given a good team to lean on, but they&#x27;re not force multipliers or anything special. My experience is what you might expect given an normal distribution of skill levels.<p>If you&#x27;ve come away from <i>lots</i> of technical interviews thinking the candidate can&#x27;t code I reckon it&#x27;s more likely due to you. Perhaps you can&#x27;t put a candidate at ease and find areas where they can talk about their ability in a positive way. That seems more likely than &quot;<i>many</i> engineers with years of experience who couldn&#x27;t competently program&quot;. I guess it&#x27;s also possible that you simply work somewhere that good candidates don&#x27;t bother applying to though. Either way, I don&#x27;t think your experience aligns at all with mine.')
