Thank you for your work. I&#x27;m sure your users appreciate it.<p>I wonder if the problem is just that the barrier to entry is lower now than it once was? Eternal September, Sturgeon&#x27;s Law, and all that.<p>I mean, there&#x27;s plenty of &quot;shiny (or rusty) new tool&quot; posts on the machinery forum, but folks usually manage to turn any such thread into a nerd-fest regardless. That seems to promote a culture that dissuades shallow interaction. I&#x27;m going to contradict my previous point and wonder instead if part of the issue is growing a community at a rate that allows new users to take over the culture without understanding the existing norms.<p>But hey, I&#x27;m talking out my butt here. I&#x27;d love your take from the admin side.')
