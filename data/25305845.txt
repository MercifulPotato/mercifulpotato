I think the fact that this has been the de facto way of interviewing at the top tech companies during the time that tech has absolutely exploded in ways never seen before, I&#x27;d say yeah, it&#x27;s working pretty well. I think you&#x27;re seeking an explanation where one is not owed. If it wasn&#x27;t working well, it would be changed, just like the brain teaser questions of the early 2000s pioneered by Google.<p>And look, I get it, it&#x27;s frustrating. I share in that frustration as someone that wants to switch companies but knows that I will have to put in the effort outside of work to prepare for that. But I still think the process is much more meritocratic and predictable than virtually every other industry.')
