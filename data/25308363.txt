In other jobs workers are give 10 vacation days and 10 sick days.<p>To compare, this is how I have it, in Slovakia:<p>* 35 days paid vacation -- by law<p>* sick days as much as needed, <i>with</i> doctor&#x27;s note -- by law<p>* 6 sick days <i>without</i> doctor&#x27;s note -- company benefit<p>There is a limit for the extra sick days, that you can&#x27;t take more than 2 in a row. You usually take them if you hope that the sickness will be over in a day or two, for example if you get a cold on Friday; or if for some reason you do not want to visit the doctor during the first day of sickness, perhaps because that&#x27;s when you feel worst.')
