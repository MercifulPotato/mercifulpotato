Worldwide, cases number in the thousands. Granted, biases and discrimination aren&#x27;t proper diseases, but they come close given they spread with misinformation.<p>Isn&#x27;t an expectation that we can 100% eliminate all that ills us irrational? Doesn&#x27;t that make this question you ask a leading one?<p>A panacea for the human condition is not a thing. Suffering exists because of impermanence and will continue to do so through at least next week. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not worth fighting for, but I think any expectation that it can be &quot;eliminated&quot; puts us on the wrong footing for improving things over time.<p>At the least, it blind us to other truths which may be more evident, such as corporate greed and misuse of the technology we all carry around in our pockets now.')
