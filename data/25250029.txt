Item(by='stubish', descendants=None, kids=[25250206], score=None, time=1606701613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249360, text='&gt; All of which raises a question: if renewables can’t cheaply power Germany, one of the richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world, how could a developing nation like Kenya ever expect them to allow it to “leapfrog” fossil fuels?<p>None of the problems claimed to affect Germany are applicable to Kenya. Indeed, the lack of existing infrastructure in Kenya probably tips the balance way in favor of renewables, using localized power generation rather than centralized and the massive grid projects Germany is claimed to be having problems with. You can bootstrap power in remote regions much easier with renewables by plonking down a few solar cells and a battery, and it scales right down to a single cell tower. Unlike fossil fuel, where you need an energy grid or trucking in fuel.<p>And are renewable energy plants still killing more birds than alternatives? I thought that argument lost validity about 30 years ago and is now just a bullshit flag?<p>Sorry about Germany if the problems are true. In other parts of the rich western world things are going fine and in a few regions 100% renewable and exporting power. Suggest to the author to learn from the successes, not just the failures.')
