Looks like Model 3s are significantly more expensive in Europe than in the US (the base model in France is 51k Euros&#x2F;61k USD vs $38k USD in the US, before tax rebates, which can knock off a significant chunk of it). Which is also part of why the quoted prices for the ID.3 seem so expensive to us in the US (49k Euros&#x2F;59k USD for the 340 mile version in France). That&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> to pay for either of those cars.')
