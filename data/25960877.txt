Item(by='prepend', descendants=None, kids=[25961646, 25962009], score=None, time=1611946525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960040, text='&gt; CDC director is still telling people not to wear N95s<p>This is an interesting point. The statement I read from her is saying that N95s are hard to wear for long periods of time, so people will wear them improperly. So the overall adherence is higher with cloth coverings and have a net higher benefit.<p>She’s not saying “don’t wear n95s” she’s saying “we don’t recommend it because...”<p>This is an important distinction.<p>Also N95s have to be fit tested to be effective. So randos buying N95s and wearing them will frequently not work.')
