There&#x27;s no fun in it, when the &quot;things&quot; are built by companies, connected to their servers, and they&#x27;re just products designed and controlled by someone else.<p>But recently, I started discovering how I can build my own &quot;things&quot;. That completely changed my view of what&#x27;s happening in this field.<p>There&#x27;s a thriving ecosystem of affordable micro-computers, controllers, sensors, a wide range of components; and people of all ages building all kinds of things with what&#x27;s available in the market. As a sibling comment mentioned, the excitement is similar to the early days of the web, or what the early days of personal computers must have been like.<p>For me the joy comes from exploring the building blocks, technological marvels that are accessible to the public now, and learning how to build what I imagine in my mind. It kind of brings me back full circle, (re)learning C and electronics, controlling hardware directly, like I was doing in my childhood&#x2F;pre-teens - but with all the advancements made in the last few decades.')
