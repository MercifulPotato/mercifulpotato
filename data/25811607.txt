Both sides in this case are dirty. As an active Floridian, I&#x27;ve followed the Covid numbers closely, and at first her story was deeply worrying. But her actual data arguments are idiotic. She doesn&#x27;t understand data analysis at all. Meanwhile the State acts like the Mafia. Ron DeSantis has been one of the dumber governers we&#x27;ve had, and that&#x27;s saying something. Regardless of her, I&#x27;d love to see him impeached over this.')
