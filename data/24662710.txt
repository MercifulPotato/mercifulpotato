Item(by='treis', descendants=None, kids=[24663236, 24666184], score=None, time=1601647484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24661551, text='&gt;If I was flat out telling my family I didn&#x27;t like race X and wished that religion Y could be outlawed, and then shared in the public realm that racists are terrible and that freedom of religion for all is paramount...shouldn&#x27;t someone be able to call me out on it?<p>I think this goes to the heart of the problem with the article in the OP.  Everyone knowing everyone&#x27;s business leads to a lot of good things.  Like if you knew a subordinate was beating their wife you&#x27;d probably fire them.  But since they beat her in the privacy of their own home they get away with it.<p>More broadly, if everyone knew everyone that smoked pot or was homosexual or cheated on their taxes there would be pressure to change some laws and follow others. Social shaming is a powerful tool.  Like any tool it can be used for good and for evil.<p>The assumption that privacy is protection against anything isn&#x27;t supported by history.  The Nazis, the Soviets, the Chinese, the Khmer Rouge, along with many others all conducted their reign of terrors without the use of modern surveillance.  Privacy was no shield then and would be no shield now.  The only real protection is not letting people like that into power.')
