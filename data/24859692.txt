There was a transaction between me and state A, not state B.  Just because I live in state B doesn’t mean they’re entitled to the sales tax.  They were never a party to the transaction, they’re just of the belief that I _would have_ bought it in state B if I didn’t have the option of going to state A.  This isn’t a morality issue, it’s the state government being mad that I have options to cut them out of the loop.')
