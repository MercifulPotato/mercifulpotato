(Still have some insecurity about losing that job, can&#x27;t deny.)<p>As outlined in more detail in another sibling comment, I had a lot on my plate in my personal life during the gig and I couldn&#x27;t pull through in time (in their eyes at least).<p>I am glad and proud that I managed to overcome literal dozens of obstacles -- most of which with tech that&#x27;s extremely hard to master, with Kubernetes at the top spot --  but I still wish I could work with them again.
