There is plenty of blame to go around.<p><i>However</i>, I&#x27;m not going to let you get away with lying by omission.<p>Quoting your article:<p>&gt; &quot;In response to the backlash, U.S. President Donald Trump (falsely) pinned the blame for the child-separation policy on his predecessor, Barack Obama.&quot;<p>&gt; But then Trump also attempted to deflect outrage over photographs of immigrant children being kept in “cages” by asserting, “Obama built the cages. I didn’t build them. Obama built them”  That portion of Trump’s commentary was true.<p>Obama may have built them, but Trump is the one who imprisoned children in them.')
