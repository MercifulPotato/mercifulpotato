Not to mention that if you&#x27;re typing on your machine during a meeting it&#x27;s assumed that you&#x27;re not paying attention. Even just recording everything can be good so you can go back later to review critical decisions.<p>&gt; People don&#x27;t really want to be fully remote at a company where most of their co-workers go back into the office most of the time<p>At least from my perspective, I dread this idea because, as employees who were already mostly remote found out a long time ago, employees at the office will typically neglect remote coworkers. Be it through not meeting in an accessible format, not sharing important decisions, or similar oversights.<p>I&#x27;ve personally experienced great improvements in terms of team coordination due to WFH: we&#x27;ve scheduled meetings in advance, we have notes for key decisions, there are proper documents for inter-team coordination (instead of relying on memory and ad-hoc discussions), etc..<p>&gt; people mostly don&#x27;t want to go back into an office where it&#x27;s mostly just teams having all-day meetings now and then.<p>Do you mean the scenario where employees come in a limited number of days for meetings? Or where everyone is in the office 100% of the time with certain days that are all meetings?<p>Personally, I think the former makes best use of in-office time. This does vary per person, but I think the best use of the office is as a collaborative space; it&#x27;s the main feature everyone seems to be lamenting. So use it for its advantages.<p>So get the collaborative benefits and then let everyone else get their work done. This is much more personal, but I absolutely hated people dropping into my team neighborhood and interrupting me with questions&#x2F;trying to locate someone. If you want some of my work time, that&#x27;s OK, but you can&#x27;t do it whenever you feel like it; schedule time and stop pre-empting my tasks.<p>---<p>WFH in general seems to require more structure than in-office work. This adds some overhead for individual employees, but likely will result in massive gains long term. If your meetings are scheduled, there&#x27;s more time to prepare. If everyone is taking notes, then there&#x27;s less need for meetings to understand decisions made elsewhere.<p>Ancillary communication tools were severely under-used before WFH. I&#x27;d be happy if we went mixed-office after learning how to coordinate more effectively, but I consider it likely that in the rush to get back people will drop the ball and work will reset to in-office vs WFH.')
