It talks about things that are falsifiable.<p>If there is an idea that so far has not been falsified, it becomes the established scientific fact.<p>However, someone else may come up with a better idea.  Do we prevent them from talking about it or collaborating with people?  It may take some time and lots of communication and collaboration to get to the bottom of it.  Years or even decades.  Do we ban them from youtube in the interrim?<p>Youtube can do what they please, but what they are doing is against liberty, against science, and it is un-american.')
