Your phrasing &quot;too ambiguous&quot; is a little off to me. Ambiguity (in the sense of utterances having multiple possible interpretations) is the norm in natural language, and it combines with our ability to effortlessly pick the intended one based on context to make natural language work.<p>Even sentences that on their face are strictly propositional will, in actual situated language use, have implied meanings (a pragmatic level). The canonical example is where one person says &quot;It&#x27;s cold&quot; (at it&#x27;s core a statement of fact), after which another person closes a window, or hands them a jacket, or follows with &quot;Let&#x27;s go home, then&quot;. If you want to give an account of natural language meaning that&#x27;s even remotely complete, you cannot stop at what&#x27;s in the sentence at the surface, you absolutely have to look at why it&#x27;s being said.<p>Indeed, if you think of an actual situation where someone would say &quot;do you want to eat pizza or pasta?&quot;, I think you&#x27;d find that it does, in fact, imply that the two are exclusive in that context - say if you&#x27;re at a restaurant where they only expect you to order one main course. But this is not a problem at all, it&#x27;s just how language works.<p>(And personally, on the subject of logic and language, I&#x27;d even go as far as to say that logic is based on natural language rather than the other way around, but I think that might be tough sell to the mathematically minded.)')
