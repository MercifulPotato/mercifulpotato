Look it up if you don&#x27;t believe me. I can&#x27;t cite a link, because there&#x27;s nothing to cite. The penalties are in statutes, but the actual definition isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s illegal because it&#x27;s just assumed that it is and courts have made the definition through case law.<p>It&#x27;s become less necessary to cite over time for obvious reasons, but court decisions from England from before 1776 are still valid opinions to cite in American courts as the source of law as well.')
