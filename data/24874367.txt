Most of us don&#x27;t (professionally) get to work in Lisp or other non-batch compiled languages. In those cases, the separation (in sane language implementations) can lead to <i>much</i> faster compilation time. But they also help to work with teams at scale, and make it easier to substitute implementations without having to recompile the entire thing (though you&#x27;ll still usually have to relink it).')
