Any language or framework has cases that don&#x27;t fit its golden path, and any (useful) one will have these trap-doors so that those cases aren&#x27;t totally impossible. Another (more extreme) one that Rust has is unsafe { } blocks. Rc&#x2F;Arc&#x2F;RefCell move guarantees to runtime; unsafe { } removes them completely. And this is well and good: real-world requirements are messy and varied and rarely fit neatly into a predetermined model. But heavy use of trap-doors is a code smell, and may be an indicator that you&#x27;re using the wrong language or framework for the job.')
