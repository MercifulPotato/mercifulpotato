Clearly monotremes are similar to other mammals in many respects but very different in others.  In trying to determine whether or not platypuses are mammals, you&#x27;re really question the nature of the manmade discrete category of &#x27;mammal&#x27;, not the nature of platypuses themselves.  Platypuses remain the same no matter how we choose to classify them.')
