Item(by='leokennis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604488528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985764, text='I sort of disagree with this article, except the fact that inkjet ink is overpriced.<p>I have a 5 year old basic consumer grade Canon color inkjet with a scanner built in. It&#x27;s wireless, I can quickly print a photo on photo paper (no waiting multiple days for a printing service), any BW document I&#x27;m likely to print in 2020 (and let&#x27;s be honest...how many documents do you really need to print in 2020?) come out at 10 pages per minute or so. It prints in duplex. Ink is about €50-€75 per year. I&#x27;ve had one paper jam in 5 years, solved by pulling one handle and removing a crumpled piece of paper.<p>I have way more issues with my €1500 laptop or my €800 phone than with my €100 inkjet printer.')
