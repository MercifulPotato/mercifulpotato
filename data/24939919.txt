It is once again an attempt to make things seem equal.  Unsubstantiated stories like this get no news time - and yet the fact that the opposite is undeniably true - Trump&#x27;s children have not only been actively involved in the administration but have been coordinating deals for Trump&#x27;s businesses, making millions of dollars, and even receiving international quid pro quo such as Chinese patent approvals - is ignored and treated as nothing.  If Trump is anything less than an utter disaster, it&#x27;s seen as a success.  If the democratic nominee (Biden or Clinton before him) does anything less than perfect, it dominates the news cycle for weeks.')
