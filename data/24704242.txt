The emissions are essentially locked in by government policy, although it&#x27;s very aggressive.<p>I think this is better though. It doesn&#x27;t rely on consumers being conscious of their externalities, because regardless of their choices the aggregate carbon efficiency will be improving steadily by the exact same amount year over year.<p>The program is clearly creating a vibrant BEV market and forcing economies of scale that will eventually make them profitable outside of compliance. It&#x27;s a major win.<p>Buying an EV, buying its certificate and not letting anyone use it would mean you&#x27;re not also allowing 10 ICEs to be sold. But that would really be going above an beyond.<p>And I don&#x27;t think Tesla (as the only auto maker that could have this program)  wants to draw attention to the dynamics at play.')
