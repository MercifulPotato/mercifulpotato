AFSCME), because of first amendment concerns (the state is forcing you to pay money for union lobbying).<p>This hasn&#x27;t resulted in a drop in membership, in no small part due to many unions adopting freakishly Byzantine opt-out measures, e.g. the ones where there&#x27;s a certain window of 10 days a year that you can leave (computed relative to when you signed your union card, never advertised by the union â€” and if the employer even mentions these rights the union might attempt legal action under California law which forbids their employer from doing anything to &quot;deter or discourage public employees from becoming or remaining members&quot;).')
