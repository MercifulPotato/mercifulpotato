The idea of using &quot;rewards&quot; as a primary learning mechanism and a path to actual cognition is just  wrong, full stop. It&#x27;s a wrong level of abstraction and is too wasteful in energy spent.<p>Looking at it from CogSci perspective it is essentially an offshoot of behaviorism, using a coarse and extremely inefficient model of learning as reward and punishment, iterative trial and error process.<p>This &#x27;Skinnerism&#x27; has been discredited in cognitive psychology decades ago and makes absolutely no biological sense whatsoever for the simple reason that any organism trying to adapt in this way will be eaten by predators before minimizing its &quot;error function&quot; sufficiently.<p>Living learning organisms have limited resources (energy and time), and they cut the search space drastically through shortcuts and heuristics and hardcoded biases instead of doing some kind of brute force optimization.<p>This is the case where computational efficiency [1] comes first and sets the constraints by which cognitive apparatus needs to be developed.<p>As for actual cognition models a good place to start is not ML&#x2F;AI field (which tends to getting stuck in local minima as a whole), but state-of-the-art cognitive psychology, and may be looking at research in &quot;distributional semantics&quot;, &quot;concept spaces&quot;, &quot;sparse representations&quot;, &quot;small-world networks&quot; and &quot;learning and memory&quot; neuroscience.<p>You&#x27;d be surprised how much knowledge we gained about the mind since those RL &amp; ANN models developed in the 1940s.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Circuits-Mind-Leslie-G-Valiant&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0195126688" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Circuits-Mind-Leslie-G-Valiant&#x2F;dp&#x2F;019...</a>')
