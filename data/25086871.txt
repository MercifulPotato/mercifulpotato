The only time you&#x27;re at or below 2000 RPM in a Fit is during cruise, deceleration, or creeping along at 15mph in school zones on flat ground.  Just going up my quiet residential street with a slight grade at 20mph, I&#x27;ll run it out to ~3500rpm.<p>Also, that torque curve isn&#x27;t as relevant as it used to be -- a new Fit has a CVT, so the engine will continually operate at that peak power RPM when at WOT.<p>Operating on a grade will have a significant impact on that top speed.  You can probably do a 65mph highway in the slow lane as long as the road doesn&#x27;t have a grade and there is significant merge area.<p>The first gen Prius actually had this problem in San Fran.  In reverse, they only use the electric motor, and it was not strong enough to go in reverse up some hills.  It had a 40hp electric motor.')
