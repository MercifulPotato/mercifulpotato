That rather depends on the thing varying and whether it&#x27;s important or not. Further variation can act to obscure rather than improve things that are interesting. For example having a thousand unique leaves under a tree is probably not interesting in a game where they are incidental. Likewise having a thousand slight variations of orc isn&#x27;t really purposeful. And having a thousand very different looking creatures that all act the same is boring and confusing. Which is why I talk about meaning.  For an example of proc-gen variation with purpose look at things projects like Ultima Ratio Regum.<p>2. I&#x27;m not sure these examples are skin deep to be honest in that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just the visual variation that makes these comparisons interesting. There&#x27;s some underlying meaning being glossed over.<p>For me the majority of AI generative&#x2F;artistic projects just create facsimiles. They lack the spark of human input and often only really create mild interest when they get it through hand curation.')
