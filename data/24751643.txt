Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602480360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751479, text='&gt; But the reason I specifically mentioned him is because he has many overtly Christian themes he actively portrays in his novels but I never feel like he is banging me over the head with obvious allegories.<p>Even outside of _Narnia_, Lewis is known for rather heavy-handed and direct allegory. I mean, I guess it might seem to not be hitting you over the head if you compare it to something that goes beyond allegory to direct interpretation, like the _Left Behind_ series, but...<p>&gt; Tolkien may be a better example. You can easily read Lord of the Rings without picking up any Christian symbolism.<p>That&#x27;s because, while there is considerable inspiration from Christian morality and mythology in LotR, Tolkien was <i>actively opposed to</i> allegory and thus did not write it or use the kind of direct symbolism associated with it.')
