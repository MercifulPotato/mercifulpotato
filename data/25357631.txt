If it became common and they did, I could inspect the script using automated tools that check for obfuscation, etc.<p>I think it’s not about eliminating, but making a little better. With lots of this stuff, it’s just about being faster than the other guys that the bear is chasing.<p>It’s kind of moot because all this is solved by “don’t download and run scripts from strangers.” Then you just have to worry about someone rooting homebrew.<p>I don’t like this line of thought because it ultimately gets us to a Microsoft world where everything is signed and there’s still tons of crap getting through.<p>I’d rather have it where scripts can be individually assessed and run without lots of expensive stuff in the middle. Even if that means some risk.')
