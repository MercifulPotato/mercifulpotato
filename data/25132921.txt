First it was slow for me, if I wasn’t wanting to try it out I may have closed the tab, but I did a search for a question I recently googled (that was an example of an annoying google search.) I searched “Python arcade sprite opacity“ and while the first three results were the same as google the fourth was a github link to the project itself and brought me to the answer (which wasn’t on page 1 of google for me, although it was on page two.)<p>So you need to speed it up, but it does look good for searching documentation at least.')
