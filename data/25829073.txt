Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=[25829172], score=None, time=1611021334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25827952, text='&gt; <i>Intentionally or not, Phil Katz achieved &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish&quot; with the .ARC format.</i><p>I recall a text file circulating BBSes when I was a kid, around the time of the move from PKArc and PKXArc, to PKZip, supposedly detailing the visit of the lawyer to Phil Katz&#x27;s house.<p>IIRC, the file said that some evil corporate lawyer came to PK&#x27;s house, PK was out, his mom didn&#x27;t know why the lawyer was there, served him tea or lunch or something while they chatted, and then at the end, evil lawyer surprises the mom or PK with evil legal papers.<p>At some point, PKZip appeared, and then downloads on BBSes started switching from `.ARC` to `.ZIP`.  (There were a bunch of other packaging&amp;compression formats, and you&#x27;d have a collection of the tools to extract whatever the download you found and got was in.  But, IIRC, for awhile, `.ARC` was the most popular on free BBSes that I used, and then `.ZIP` became the most popular.)<p>I don&#x27;t know whether the stories of the legal action had anything to do with the move from .ARC to .ZIP, but I could believe it, on the free BBSes.  They were generally run by hobbyists who could afford the computer and a phone line, and the time to give the BBS a character, and I got the impression that just wanted to make something and share.  As far as I know, there wasn&#x27;t any implicit subtle self-promotion, career development, etc., like there is in many things today, and a lot of corporate behavior that we consider normal within tech today, I think wouldn&#x27;t have been considered acceptable.  So, especially given the stories circulating about ARC vs. ZIP, it&#x27;s really easy to imagine a &quot;f-word those SEA guys&quot; reaction from the altruists running BBSes in their dens.')
