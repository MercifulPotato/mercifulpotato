Solid analysis! I&#x27;d say that we&#x27;re better at building tools than websites so I&#x27;ll add some extra information here.<p>1. Text based netlists are ok for digital heavy circuits like you said, and we agree the schematic is important (which is why we&#x27;re generating one). It&#x27;s hard, but quality of results is constantly improving. The schematic is modifiable by the way - we can keep human modifications to the aesthetics in lock step with the generator.<p>We do go a bit further than text based - the design code is parametric all the way through to low-level packages and symbols. It&#x27;s not just typing out the same information that&#x27;s in a schematic - it&#x27;s about levels of hierarchical reuse that build on each other.<p>2. Right now we can do a good job automating the selection of parts that are fully defined by a set of parameters i.e. the jellybean parts like resistors, capacitors, inductors. Moderately useful by itself, but if this was the only part of JITX you used you may just be just saving yourself a few hours of digikey searching and spreadsheeting. The more interesting part is that it lets us write circuits that are more reusable. As designers, we key in the attributes that are important for the circuit and leave the rest of the constraints open for optimization.<p>We do more automated simulation and validation than I&#x27;ve seen in other tools, which helps with component selection (and other automated flows), and inspires a bit more confidence in the design than just saying &#x27;here&#x27;s your part, trust me&#x27;<p>I agree that guided design space exploration is the end game of automated component selection. We want people to have a conversation with the tool and rapidly evaluate &#x27;what if&#x27; questions. It won&#x27;t be fully automated and that&#x27;s not our goal. We think tools can automate the low level work and leave the creative bits and the intangibles up to the humans.<p>On the programming language aspect - JITX is currently embedded in Stanza (the same language we wrote the compiler in). We use an Intermediate Representation for the language (like LLVM, or FIRRTL if you&#x27;re familiar with Chisel), so other language front ends are possible. What would your top language pick be?')
