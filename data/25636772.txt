Space colonization &amp; Interplanetary space travel top my list of problems that are worth solving &amp; problems that I am really interested in. I am just fascinated by space. I&#x27;m not sure how can I break into this industry though, I am a Software Engineer by trade and a Computer Scientist by education.<p>I can&#x27;t work for SpaceX as I am not American. I&#x27;ve an Indian passport if that matters. There are probably exciting space companies in India, and other places that allow Indians to work. Maybe there are some open source projects that I can contribute to in my free time, along with my day job.<p>I am guessing there are plenty of other devs on HN that are interested in space too but don&#x27;t know what to do with this interest. I am guessing they feel things are slow and feel powerless too. I am hoping there are people here who have broken into the industry and are making an impact and can tell some of us how they did so.<p>If you are running an open source project that helps solve space related things, I am happy to contribute, please share a link. I am fluent in Python and good at Java &amp; GoLang. I&#x27;ve written CPP &#x2F;C in the past for work and I am happy learning new languages. Regardless of the language, I am guessing other devs on HN might be interested too.<p>Longevity is another field that interests me, mostly because it allows me to spend more time alive working on space. No idea how to break into this either.<p>Somethings that I can think of<p>1. Work in a space company &#x2F; space research lab<p>2. Start a space company<p>3. Donate to some organizations &#x2F; research labs that work on these problems<p>4. There are probably companies in indirect industries that help space too, probably some boring CRUD applications that make life for Aerospace engineers easier.<p>5. Contribute to open source projects that work in this field<p>6. Make a lot of capital doing something else and then pour that into a space tech company.')
