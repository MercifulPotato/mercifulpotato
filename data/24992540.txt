In 2020 it has reached a new low. One of the reasons for this is because mainland Chinese people feel that the western world doesn&#x27;t judge them fairly, that the western world will never accept them.<p>Your comment is a good representation of what they&#x27;re thinking of. Your comment basically comes down to &quot;China can do no good&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t matter what China&#x27;s concrete actions are — in the end, an interpretation for those actions will be found in order to fit the narrative that China is sinister. You are in your full right to do this. But such an attitude has implications for the other party.<p>Why should Chinese people support western opinions, if they will never be accepted no matter what they do? Sometimes, China is willing to concede on a few issues in order to gain improved relations. But if improving relations is impossible, no matter how many concessions, then why should they concede anything? If one is treated like an enemy anyway, then one may as well become a real enemy, since there is no reputation to be gained.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve been arguing for a while that one of the reasons why they went ahead with the Hong Kong National Security Law after a year, is because they realized that they can&#x27;t gain a better relationship with the US by <i>not</i> introducing the security law, so may as well do it and gain more social stability. But many people can&#x27;t comprehend this idea because they&#x27;re too stuck on the &quot;China bad&quot; narrative.<p>I am not arguing that China is all good — of course it isn&#x27;t, China has lots of issues. But being skeptical of <i>everything</i>?<p>In this context, excessive cynicism is dangerous. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. I fear that some day all this leads to increased polarization, and a hot war.')
