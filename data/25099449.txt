I&#x27;m a first generation immigrant who barely speaks their &#x27;mother&#x27; tongue, but I still have a greater affinity for my parent&#x27;s birth nation than I do for the USA. If I were a billionaire or otherwise influential, I would 100% use that power to further the interests of my mother country, even at the expense of the USA. Jews are just better educated and better organized so they accomplish what I and many other ethnic&#x2F;religious minorities would undoubtedly attempt in their position. I do not think it is antisemitic to point this out. I would argue its more hypocritical rather than racist of other minorities in the USA to criticize of American Jews over this issue. As for the &quot;native&quot; American Whites, I cannot comment.')
