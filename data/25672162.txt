Of course that is what lots of people have said previously about similar incidents coming from the left but calls for prosecution and stronger police tactics were dismissed in favor of the less-than-peaceful actions because &quot;reasons&quot;.<p>Personally I&#x27;m exhausted at trying to &quot;score&quot; the actions of two teams when in fact I really don&#x27;t want either team to win. It has become an absurd attempt to decide which team is less awful while each side fools itself into thinking it exclusively represents political virtue.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that events don&#x27;t escalate further and that perhaps there is some opportunity for the emergence of some alternate political parties and more thoughtful political leadership in order to let the existing parties fade into history.')
