It sucks that you have to build everything when you build one thing :(.<p>The issue I was specifically thinking of is how slow an untuned JVM can be for startup times and to get to peak performance (It HAS gotten better, but is nowhere near as fast as rust or even python).  The default for these JITed languages is to pass everything through a non-optimized code path and only optimize later when the various methods are exercised enough.<p>Rust has an advantage here in that it doesn&#x27;t do any sort of runtime analysis to improve performance.  It simply is as fast as it always will be.')
