I went from a movie theater projectionist making minimum wage (8 years), to tech support(2 years), to customer service&#x2F;qa at a startup(1 year), to an iOS developer(5 years), to now being a lead iOS developer at an established tech company. I don&#x27;t particularly want to be an iOS developer, but it&#x27;s the path that got me to where I am at and it pays very well. Not once during my last interview cycle (10 different companies) did anyone ask about a degree.<p>I think the grind and knowledge gained in multiple sectors was worth it, but it was a long road. I&#x27;ve been programming on and off my whole life so I think it really depends on the person, but not having any degree it is doable. Would I do it differently after looking back? Absolutely, but I doubt I would get a CS degree.<p>Moral of the story, if you want it bad enough and go out there and make it happen, you can find a place in this industry with a high school education. Just demonstrate knowledge and keep on learning.')
