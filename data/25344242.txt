This information should be stored, encrypted, and be almost impossible to decrypt. You need a dead mans switch (which is tried and tested) to destroy any and all data. In fact, you could have a system where if you don&#x27;t visit a URL within a few hours, it destroys a part of the method to access the decryption mechanism (or something similar to this, which works in &quot;real time&quot; and acts a nuke. If you&#x27;re in jail for 24+ hours you have the safety to know your system will work and destroy password.txt&#x2F;keyfile on a server somewhere and make it harder to access your records).<p>Storing this data in plain text, on a partition that can be decrypted within seconds is negligent and both parties are at fault. You need to ensure both systems meet strict requirements before you start communicating in any medium (digital, face to face etc)<p>Snowden knew what was going to happen to him, so he had the good sense to somewhat plan ahead. These people are not your friends, and you should assume as much.<p>You make the wrong person angry and you will end up in a ditch somewhere. Make preparations, retain a lawyer and for gods sake practice good sec ops; if you have privileged information it&#x27;s vital you make it as hard as possible for both you and the state to access it.')
