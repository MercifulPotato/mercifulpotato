In this, a single field could have a different data type in different circumstances. For example, the resources field can be an array when requesting a single access token, or it can be an object when requesting multiple named access tokens. The difference in type indicates a difference in processing from the server. Within the resources array, each element can be either an object, representing a rich resource request description, or a string, representing a resource handle (scope).<p>This is horrible.')
