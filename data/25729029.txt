It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve left rational calm thought at the door.<p>You keep saying typical left winger this, typical  left winger that, without saying anything useful at all.<p>The less words I spend on you the better.<p>-<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legal.parler.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;guidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legal.parler.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;guidelines.pdf</a><p>These legal guidelines allow hate speech.
