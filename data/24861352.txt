If an algorithim spreads any information and cannot classify it (if you have a general purpose algorithim which can know all truth apriori what are you doing here instead of creating a singularity!). Then &#x2F;design&#x2F; which implies intent and effectiveness. Otherwise if I burn a Trump Voodoo doll I will have designed something with the &quot;intent&quot; to kill the President. Even if Fox News would be very offended by it nobody sane would take it as a serious assassination attempt.')
