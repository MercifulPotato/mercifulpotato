The extra 100-300mhz at the top end is a huge impact to power.<p>Check out for example the per core power charts that Anandtech does: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16214&#x2F;amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested&#x2F;8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16214&#x2F;amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-di...</a><p>Compare for example the 1 core power numbers between the chips. The 5600X 1 core result is 11w @ 4.6ghz, whereas the other two chips boost higher and hit 4.8-4.9ghz 1 core turbos, but it costs 17-18w to do it. Huge increase in power for that last 1-2% performance. So you really can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t compare more power-concious configurations with the top end desktop where power is infinite and well worth spending for even single digit percentage gains.<p>And then of course you should also note that the single-core power draw in all of those is <i>vastly</i> lower than their TDP numbers (65w for the 5600x, and 125w for the 5800x&#x2F;5900x).')
