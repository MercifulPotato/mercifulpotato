Their popularity seems to be driven primarily by exclusive access to CUDA APIs and windows gaming. Nouveau is OK for accelerated 2d but is hardly in the same ballpark as the AMD drivers.<p>That said I just picked up a quadro (not my choice, came with a prebuilt NUC) and I&#x27;ve been pleased to find that it &quot;just works&quot; on freebsd (I use it to realtime transcode video), so clearly great experiences are possible and I don&#x27;t want to be needlessly harsh.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m dying for a discrete intel card. I can&#x27;t recall any hiccups with intel chipsets, ever, and that matters WAY more to me than raw performance.')
