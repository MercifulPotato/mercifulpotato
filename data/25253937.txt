For me, programming was always just a tool, a job, a means to an end. Sure it&#x27;s kind of interesting, but there&#x27;s far more interesting ways to spend my time.<p>Also, I hate bosses, performance reviews, bullshit non-producing jobs who make up the majority of your tech peers, commutes, forced social small talk with people you don&#x27;t like, etc. So even if I 100% loved what I did everyday, I wouldn&#x27;t like all that BS that comes with it.<p>Now, being able to spend my time as I please with full autonomy - that is where the incredible boost in my happiness has come from')
