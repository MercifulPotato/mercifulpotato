Given these two feedstocks there are then two main routes to fuel production: reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol or ethanol, which can then be &quot;upgraded&quot; to heavier fuels, or reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, which is used along with the hydrogen to feed a Fischer-Tropsch reaction producing a variety of fuels directly.  My understanding is that in either case production costs are dominated by the cost of acquiring the feedstocks, which are in turn mainly driven by the cost of energy.<p>What the article describes is a technique that modifies the Fischer-Tropsch step of the process that uses it, which would perhaps bring costs down somewhat for that step.  Additionally, and more importantly, carbon monoxide is not needed as a separate feedstock as CO2 is apparently directly reduced by this new catalyst - this is where significant cost savings could potentially realized.<p>I&#x27;m no expert in any of this but for what it&#x27;s worth I did go through a process of estimating what &quot;air-to-fuels&quot; fuel might cost to produce and came up with a cost of about $1300 per metric ton.  If the technique described in the paper were applied to the process I investigated, the $1300&#x2F;mt price could potentially decrease to around $1000&#x2F;mt.  For comparison, Brent crude oil is currently about $380&#x2F;mt and aviation fuel is about $430&#x2F;mt.<p>[EDIT] Forgot to include a link to my analysis: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;34JTCFm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;34JTCFm</a>')
