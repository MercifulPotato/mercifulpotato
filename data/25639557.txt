They want the ability to scale without building their own infrastructure, they don&#x27;t want to deal with the personnel, they want to be able to lock-in only the capacity they know they will use and get a discount. The problem is that unlike cloud computing which can automatically scale, manufacturing as a service is all about people.  You have to remove people from the equation to the point that the only people are debugging the machines.')
