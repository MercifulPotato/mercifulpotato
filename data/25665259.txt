Item(by='PontifexMinimus', descendants=None, kids=[25665721], score=None, time=1609979580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664900, text='&gt; Freedom of Speech !== Entitlement to a Platform<p>As it happens I wrote an essay on this yesterday: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pontifex.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;google-censors-talkradio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pontifex.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;google-censors-talkradio</a> , in response to an other act of corporate censorship.<p>My argument was that because of network effects there are only a few dominant platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc) and that when these platforms take down content, they are in practise preventing that person&#x27;s message from getting out, i.e. censoring people.<p>This gives them a lot of power: power to decide which ideas can be disseminated, power to decide which politicians can get elected. So if you favour democracy, you have to be against the power of big tech platforms to shut down discussions they don&#x27;t like.<p>(My favoured solution would involve mandate interoperability using ActivityPub and similar protocols, which breaks the dominance of big platforms due to network effects).')
