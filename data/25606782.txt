I have done contract work for small companies that build &quot;second type&quot; code for large companies. One doesn&#x27;t need Jira for that. As I said, one needs good client relations, but that can certainly be accomplished without a lot of top-down mangerialist claptrap. Indeed, it&#x27;s my experience that things are better that way. They don&#x27;t need metrics. They need their problems solved. Those two sometimes go together, but they&#x27;re quite often opposed.')
