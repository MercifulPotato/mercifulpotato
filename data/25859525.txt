Either political theories, or game-theoretic. Transaction cost economics is the closest thing I&#x27;ve seen, and maybe some of Stuart Kauffman&#x27;s stuff on the adjacent possible and the CEO&#x27;s job being to &#x27;recut&#x27; the company into different divisions. But I&#x27;ve never seen anything along the lines of -  if I have a changing fitness landscape L and a set of communicating agents A with different sets of knowledge, and they can use their knowledge to extract value from the local landscape, or they can make tools to increase the value of that knowledge or they can communicate or they can listen, then in what situations should you take different actions. The extremes are easy ( local changing landscape, high comms costs, then don&#x27;t listen to anyone else; static similar landscape, cheap comms, listen to the cleverest agent); Maybe there is some biology stuff with ants or some agent-based modelling work ?')
