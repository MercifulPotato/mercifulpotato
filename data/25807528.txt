Calling composition less powerful than inheritance could be seen as subjective and debatable. I mostly like composition over inheritance, but Rust for example has problems with up-casting of trait objects (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2765) that inheritance&#x2F;vtable based languages (e.g. C++) do not have.\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s not a bad comment, and I suspect you mostly just got piled on due to human error&#x2F;bias. Or maybe some poor soul got confused and thought you were trying to explain Rust to the poster above you (who may not need much explaining).<p>Don&#x27;t take it personally, you seem to have a good grasp of the language. Please keep on learning :)')
