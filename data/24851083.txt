In order to mine asteroids in a worthwhile way, we&#x27;d likely need to invent <i>autonomous</i> technologies to do so, otherwise we&#x27;re likely not going to be able to do so effectively&#x2F;efficiently.  That will include the ability to autonomously build autonomous mining&#x2F;refining&#x2F;manufacturing facilities.<p>1a. If we&#x27;re able to do that, we&#x27;ll then have the technologies available to efficiently build space-based and planet-based habitats and manufacturing facilities.<p>2.  Assuming we&#x27;re able to accomplish (1), the obvious route would be to build <i>more</i> mining&#x2F;refining&#x2F;manufacturing facilities.  This would allow us to create a space-based industrial base.  However, it&#x27;s not clear if such a base can provide materials and finished goods for those (pretty much all of us) living in a gravity well.<p>3.  As such, I think the greatest benefit from learning how to mine asteroids will be in applying the autonomous technologies required on the Earth.')
