They don&#x27;t actually map 1:1 to each other. Whatever &quot;I go first&quot; means to speakers of Mandarin, we might only be able to approximate what that means in English.<p>An example that comes to mind is the oversimplification that happens when people say that the word &quot;aloha&quot; means &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;. It only sort of does because that&#x27;s how it is sometimes used. Really it&#x27;s a whole concept that is unique to Hawaiian culture that would more accurately translate to &quot;beloved&quot; or &quot;cherished&quot;.')
