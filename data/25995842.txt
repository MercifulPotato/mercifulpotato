Does Opstrace? Or is it just a CLI&#x2F;API based tool?<p>If you actually have a UI element to your product you’re doing a huge disservice to yourself by not actually showing this anywhere...<p>EDIT: I don’t mean to sound negative, I’m wondering if positioning this against Datadog is going to create immediate, potentially incorrect, expectations in people’s minds as to what this product might provide.<p>From first impressions I’d say this is much closer to Prometheus (which does have a UI but it’s so basic it may as well not - but then the UI is not the point of Prometheus).')
