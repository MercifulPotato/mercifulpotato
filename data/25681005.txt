I really don&#x27;t get the complaints.<p>For private email consolidation, I&#x27;ve been running fetchmail for probably 20+ years now without any hiccups or complaints whatsoever. I haven&#x27;t had to touch my Fetchmail+Postfix+Maildrop setup in like 15+ years, except for the postfix part in the sense that nobody accepts emails from dialup IPs any longer, so everything I _send_ goes through the proper mail server, instead of my own.<p>My actual email provider (that I&#x27;ve also used for 20+ years, i.e. no, it&#x27;s definitely not and never will be GMail) does throttle connections via POP3 or IMAP to 3 connections per 5 minutes. That&#x27;s completely fine. I really don&#x27;t care whether I get an email now or in 5 minutes from now. I check it way less often than that and I do definitely _not_ have notifications turned on for my email client. And when I do care (coz you know, some &quot;2FA&quot; BS email, I check via my provider&#x27;s app or log into my server and start a `fetchmail`.')
