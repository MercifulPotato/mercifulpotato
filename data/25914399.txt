You&#x27;re &quot;physically&quot; moving bytes of data around (that&#x27;s where most of the heat comes from), doing operations on them, etc. Nowadays you generally can&#x27;t get them to destroy themselves but in the earlier history you absolutely could tell the machines to tear themselves apart in the same way you can tell a 3D printer to tear itself apart.<p>This is wrong. It&#x27;s not what &#x27;unsafe&#x27; means for C or C++. You could have 100% safe hardware for your code to run on, and your code could very well still be unsafe. The phrase you&#x27;re looking for is Undefined Behavior.')
