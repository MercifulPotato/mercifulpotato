If spending all your waking hours in front of a computer writing commercial software is how you want to spend your life than sure work at a small company that will become your identity. Or write plumbing, get paid well, and live a well balanced life, one thats not dominated by work.(I think the language to describe the scenario emphasizes the spin on the scenario)')
