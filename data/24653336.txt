This is a 42 page report.  Second, I could not find any statistic in that report that comes even remotely close to describing that “most” violent offenders will commit another violent crime.  Some states have recidivism rates approaching 50% (for ALL offenders, violent and nonviolent) but those numbers include technical parole violations and new non-violent crime.<p>Please indicate the page where the data supports your statement.')
