If you go down this road, then smart criminals will just take steps to avoid carry location tracking devices. What do you do then? Force everyone to carry and maintain a GPS tracker? Arrest them if they fail to charge it properly, because they could use that window to commit a crime without being tracked?<p>&gt; We can&#x27;t hide behind lack of capability to police said crimes, but still label them as such.<p>Most laws are written with the implicit assumption it’s not possible to perfectly enforce them. That provides some natural wriggle room to interpret the laws, avoids the need to write a long list of when it’s ok to speed for example.<p>Perfect enforcement breaks all of that. A knowledgable police officer could almost certainly stop you on any day the week and find you guilt of some obscure and ancient crime that’s no longer relevant.<p>&gt; For all we know, if we lived in a society where we had such strict enforcement of laws as I suggest, we&#x27;d potentially have greater churn and change in our laws to match the opinions of society as it changed and evolved.<p>How do you imagine society would evolve its opinions and change them in a world of perfect enforcement? How the gay community show the world there nothing wrong with their way of life, if they simply couldn’t live it?<p>How would society change its views on smoking weed, if it was impossible to smoke it?<p>It’s impossible for a society to change its view on existing laws, if it’s completely unable to experiment with ignoring, or re-interpreting them.<p>It would be like expecting a child to ask for food they had never eaten, and never seen anyone else eat. How could they possibly know it existed, much less if it was good or bad for them?<p>&gt; I disagree. I&#x27;m not seeing it. There is just way too much going wrong today in 1-st world countries whilst we have really good privacy for it to be the case. We&#x27;re downright descending into totalitarianism and thought&#x2F;opinion control territory, all whilst our &quot;privacy&quot; is mostly maintained and respected<p>Hahahaha, seriously. You complain of thought control, but advocate for world where the government can watch your every move, and perfectly enforce every law. Have you read 1984? I see little difference between world in that book, and the one your advocating for.<p>&gt; Are you saying we need more of it? What would that look like to you?<p>Yes I am. How can you control someone’s though and opinions if you don’t know what they are? How can a totalitarian government rule with an iron fist if they don’t know where their citizens are, or what they’re doing?<p>Totalitarian governments come into existence because people want control and order, and they’re great if you fit into that governments view of what control and order look like. If you don’t, we’ll there are plenty of genocides that can be studied.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;amp&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;7&#x2F;21169533&#x2F;florida-google-runkeeper-geofence-police-privacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;amp&#x2F;2...</a>')
