But I don&#x27;t necessarily buy the &quot;evil&quot; version here. In fact, Adriano Olivetti had a relationship with CIA officials. [0]<p>2) Olivetti could have been the Italian Intel or HP or IBM, if Adriano didn&#x27;t die. In fact, they opened a research center in Silicon Valley, and were poised to lead the desktop computer revolution that happened starting from the late 70s and early 80s.<p>I can&#x27;t find the article I had in mind, but this one at least gives you some perspectives on how great, and ahead of its time, the Olivetti company was. [1]<p>3) There should be a much, much better book to investigate and tell the story.<p>4) If you think the Google campus was innovative... Adriano Olivetti created a better version of it in the late 40s and 50s in Italy. He was also a prolific writer, his &quot;La citt√† dell&#x27;uomo&quot; (the human city) was at the center of his views on how industry, society, work, life could be interpreted [2].<p>5) Finally, there are several people from the Olivetti labs that ended up doing great things at other silicon valley companies.<p>Again, I can&#x27;t find much (or perhaps I am not spending enough time doing it), but this could be a good start [3].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;readingroom&#x2F;document&#x2F;cia-rdp80-01446r000100050006-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;readingroom&#x2F;document&#x2F;cia-rdp80-0...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;455328&#x2F;this-italian-company-pioneered-innovative-startup-company-in-the-1930s&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;455328&#x2F;this-italian-company-pioneered-innovat...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;cities&#x2F;2016&#x2F;apr&#x2F;13&#x2F;story-cities-21-adriano-olivetti-ivrea-italy-typewriter-factory-human-city" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;cities&#x2F;2016&#x2F;apr&#x2F;13&#x2F;story-cities-...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindthebridge.com&#x2F;giacomo-marini-mindthechat&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindthebridge.com&#x2F;giacomo-marini-mindthechat&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: (and thanks to user @Rochus) I am talking about people like Federico Faggin.
