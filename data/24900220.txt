If a woke straight person heard me saying that I support equals rights but don&#x27;t like the &quot;prides&quot;, they would call me a homophobe. Because it is known -- among the woke straight people who support gay rights -- that all gays support the &quot;prides&quot;.<p>Similarly, an Indian person probably wouldn&#x27;t be offended by finding out that I practice yoga (they might actually be happy about it), but a woke white person might sic a Twitter mob on me for the sin of cultural appropriation.<p>&gt; Again, even if you&#x27;re personally the whitest, straightest, cis-est, male-st person possible, what&#x27;s wrong with standing up for the rights of others?<p>Nothing, unless I appropriate their cause in service of signaling my wokeness and attacking people I don&#x27;t like.<p>For example, when racism is used as a weapon in fight between two groups of white people, who already had another reason to fight each other, but used this opportunity to make their attack more socially acceptable.')
