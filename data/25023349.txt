It says:<p>&gt; No ballot for the 118-year-old Mr. Bradley was ever requested, received or counted.<p>Yet, the voter registration site clearly showed that a ballot was requested, sent to, and received from the elder Mr. Bradley. I&#x27;m skeptical that they would have detected the error had this particular case not gone viral. If they had the means to detect the error, then why didn&#x27;t they do it before sending the ballot? Or, even better, remove the defunct registration in the first place?')
