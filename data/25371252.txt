There&#x27;s a near infinite amount of ways to &quot;encode&quot; the letter A. Same thing goes for any data. the more complex the more ways to represent that data.<p>Importantly none of the representations <i>are</i> A. A is a concept and doesn&#x27;t exist as a real tangible thing in the way paper, bits, or other encodings do.<p>The map is not the terrain.')
