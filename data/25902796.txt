If your accountants are lagging by almost 3 months without filing an extension, you owe it to your donors. Blaming the accountants is fine, but in the end, you picked them, and you chose to stay with them.<p>(The value in the overcharge is really just that you&#x27;ve got a big bullseye you can throw darts at when accountability is required. This doesn&#x27;t resonate with most entrepreneurs e.g. here on HN - as the greyed out comment alludes :) - but it does with more established firms largely for this reason.)')
