Which is a good thing, given that the government has in the past done things like that.<p>Perhaps, but there is now firm legal precedent that greatly limits their ability to do it again.<p>&gt; None of this stuff is exclusive. Feel free to try and stop government consequences some other way. But regardless of that, anonymity still helps some people avoid some consequences for their speech, which is good.<p>Some people should not be able to avoid the consequences of their speech. For instance, people that harass, slander, and threaten others online. Additionally, people that use their speech to obtain money under false pretenses shouldn&#x27;t be able to hide behind a veil of anonymity. Police officers that enforce the law by day and joke about how much they hate black people and jews while squirreled away behind their keyboard at night should have to own their opinions in the public square.<p>&gt; Lots of people have pretty effective ability to post speech anonymously.<p>It&#x27;s possible with enough tech savviness, but tactics like VPNs are more frail than most people believe.')
