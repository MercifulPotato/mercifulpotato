Well, at least in theory.<p>In practice, parents take photos of homework and send them to teachers via Whatsapp completely ignoring a formal system maintained for that purpose. Poor teachers have to save the time to upload files from their phones&#x2F;computers to the system later and keep things organized from school&#x27;s internal perspective.<p>I thought about proposing to school&#x27;s IT that they changed the process, allowing parents to email files to a certain inbox, which an app would collect the files later and push them into the system automatically. I ended up not going ahead with the proposal because I already knew their reaction to me: &quot;Whatsapp makes the process simpler&quot;.')
