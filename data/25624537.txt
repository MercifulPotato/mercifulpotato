The issue at Google&#x27;s scale is they had to spend thousands of person-hours implementing in software what they would have gotten for &quot;free&quot; with ECC RAM. Lacking ECC (and generally using consumer-level hardware) compounded scale and reliability problems or at least made them more expensive than they might otherwise had been.<p>Using consumer hardware and making up reliability with redundancy and software was not a bad idea for early Google but it did end up with an unforeseen cost. Just a thousand machines in a cosmic ray proof bunker will end up with memory errors ECC will correct for free. It&#x27;s just reducing the surface area of &quot;potential problems&quot;.')
