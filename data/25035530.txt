I&#x27;ve been on more than a few projects where we wanted to use an open source product&#x2F;tool to help build an application and it was roundly rejected by the security team. After two back-to-back requests were rejected, we were told corporate policy was 100% against using any open source tools or products in anything we did.<p>The ironic part is this monolithic, hulking corporation is losing chunks of market to smaller, more nimble companies who can get their product to market in three months. Whereas, it takes us 18 teams and 100 people and two years to get the same product to market. Their solution? Just buy the technology instead. We&#x27;ve had dozens of acquisitions over the past year or so.<p>Which now creates another new set of problems I&#x27;m sure you can already see. . .')
