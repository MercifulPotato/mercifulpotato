It&#x27;s worked really well for me.<p>The sluggish performance you&#x27;re getting is honestly probably related to CFS (the default linux process scheduler). Windows does an AMAZING job with scheduling for UI applications. You almost never feel like your computer is struggling because anything UI related gets scheduled first.
