I mean, you could pick up a shovel and clean up the front of your house, but where would you throw those trash you just shoveled if there is no garbageman picking up trash every week? Chance that you&#x27;ll just dump them across the street and burn it and the wind will pick up some bits of trash and spreading them again throughout the neighborhood, completing the cycle.')
