I found out about the $2.5k and cannot pay that while I’m not in a great financial situation to afford giving away that much. Also I suffered conversion therapy in Michigan against my will. So I greatly despise the idea of the US ever getting a dime from me. Luckily my name is different between citizenships and I’ve not disclosed being a US citizen to banks. Anyway I’ll be dead by cancer in the near future so I’m not that concerned but I wanted to share my experience. I contacted the US embassy by email about not being able to pay but greatly wanting to drop US citizenship because of past trauma that effects my health. The agent just sent an email that looks like a template explaining all must pay 2.5k and he didn’t respond to any following responses I sent. It feels like extortion and really should be considered unconstitutional. I’m writing from a hospital bed on my phone so I apologize for the bad grammar mistakes')
