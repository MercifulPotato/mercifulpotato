It was a simple &quot;pip install --user ofxtools&quot;. After that, I read some of the docs for ofxget and configured these with the settings from ofxhome.com and I&#x27;ve got automated ability to pull in my transactions for credit cards, checking accounts, and even long-term investment accounts. It&#x27;s really cool to interact at this low level because there&#x27;s so much control compared to QuickBooks&#x2F;Quicken.')
