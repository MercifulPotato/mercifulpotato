It does not matter that I did it for myself - in fact, that is always how it starts - but I personally feel that it&#x27;s a waste if I end up passing on before I declare it ready to show to the world.<p>I believe this indicates a problem in my line of thinking: desperation to affect the world or get someone to care. My belief is that if I keep everything I do to myself, then I have not &quot;affected the world&quot; in any way, and this is not good. My accomplishments will die with me and nobody will ever know what kind of a person I was, and all my life boiled down to was essentially finding a way to be independent and survive and then participate in solitary hedonism for the rest of it. For whatever reason I find this a suboptimal use of my own life. I am in a position in the midst of failed startups and college applications and poverty to have enough time and capital to work on my ideas, to do nearly anything, and I can squander it in any number of ways. I lose the game every day knowing this and only remembering it if someone publishes a life advice article but ignoring it the rest of the time.<p>It feels as if my worth is tied to other people irrespective of what I tell myself otherwise, because of my desperation to have someone to confide in, but not in a way that is effortless. I keep believing I have to spend a lot of effort working on skills to deserve the kind of friends I want to know that have also worked very hard to hone skills. I don&#x27;t really understand why, except maybe I don&#x27;t know anyone that fits into my perfectly idealized view of the world. My family wasn&#x27;t pushing me to overachieve either. My standards for people and things are just too high.<p>Do I enjoy creating things? Not necessarily, but not creating enough things that pass my arbitrary filter before I die is supposedly worse. But this is only a vague ideal and not a concrete goal. It just looms over me constantly, as if I should have a constant reason to criticize the way I am living as &quot;not what I really want.&quot; But I still believe the vague goal if I end up writing it out concretely. I don&#x27;t want it to go away, or I will miss wanting, even mildly, to become &quot;that kind of person.&quot;<p>I understand this is discouraging me and I have to work on it somehow. Maybe getting the recognition from someone that I can accomplish things I set my mind to and that there is a path to what I want to do would clear out most of the issue. (But I don&#x27;t mean people telling me them over Internet messages or therapy sessions just because I asked. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I can tell all of these things to myself, but for some reason I can&#x27;t personally believe them until someone wiser than me can confide in me enough to recognize and confirm them through what I actually do, not what I say.)')
