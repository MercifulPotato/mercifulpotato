This would give you 100 possible combinations, rinse and repeat for more account and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve exhausted all possible combinations rather quickly. You can also create more accounts programatically.<p>The mitigations does make it negligible harder for someone to swoop in and take control over domains that currently have misconfigured name servers.
