It&#x27;s not that i want to abolish the app store - for non-technical users, the appstore is fine as it is.<p>But there should be an option to side-load an app. There should be an option to hook into a separate store like how android has f-droid. The store-front can compete on features, rather than by apple&#x27;s decree.<p>The 15%-cut in app-royalties apple takes is a red-herring. It gives apple an &quot;out&quot; when discussing this issue. It prevents further conversation of opening up the device for competing app-stores.')
