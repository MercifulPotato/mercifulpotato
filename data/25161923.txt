I figure that 20,000 people have had this and haven&#x27;t had serious complications. So probably a better than 1&#x2F;20k change that if <i>I</i> get this I&#x27;ll be okay. And I&#x27;ll have a much better idea of this by the time I get it since I&#x27;m unlikely to get the first round of vaccines anyway since I&#x27;m not in an elevated risk group.<p>Meanwhile, out of a 23,359,180 males in my age group (25-34) in the US, 1,144--or 1 in 20,418--have died [0]. And obviously, the death rate is significantly higher than 1 in 20,418, because not every 25-34 year old has had COVID.<p>If I get the vaccine and I can go back to living my life normally, that alone is worth the low risk to me. And sure, there&#x27;s the (remote) possibility that the vaccine has some long-term side effects, but I have to weigh that against the (in my mind higher) possibility of COVID having some long term side effect.<p>Given that I can&#x27;t practically isolate myself completely for the next 8 months, I&#x27;m getting this vaccine as soon as possible.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid_weekly&#x2F;index.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid_weekly&#x2F;index.htm</a>')
