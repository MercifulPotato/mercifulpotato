The staff cuts are among the least offensive things done under the Mozilla name.  Much more value was created earlier by unpaid volunteers who were rewarded by having their project hijacked by a Valley-inspired corporate mania concerned with breaking into the mobile market (with a strategy that would be generous to even refer to it as DOA).  The size of staff at the time of the cuts is something that only came about because of the absurd growth of the corporation that has became the new face of Mozilla over the last 10 years.  Mozilla is an incompetent, bloated organization in need of further cuts still.  So it&#x27;s hard to seriously consider the cuts to be either unfortunate or tragic, particularly given the obnoxious tendency of those on staff to &quot;other&quot; non-MoCo employees whose contributions and involvement predated the layer of corporate sleaze that has come to be emblematic of the modern day Mozilla.  Should we feel sorry?  The fact that we&#x27;re even talking in terms of <i>cuts</i> and <i>layoffs</i> means that those affected at least got paid at some point for their role in Mozilla&#x27;s descent.<p>The only bad thing about the layoffs is that Mozilla leadership was shitty enough to do it during the middle of a pandemic.  At this point though, keep it coming.  It&#x27;s been a bittersweet experience watching the tide turn against Mozilla over the last year, as the popular perception of it has only just now begun to align with how unworthy of an organization it has been for years already.')
