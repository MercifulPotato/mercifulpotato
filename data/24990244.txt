When you turn 65, you have the option to enroll either in &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, which is what we usually think of when we talk about &quot;single payer healthcare in America&quot;, or you can enroll in Medicare Advantage (aka Medicare &quot;Part C&quot;), where the premiums that would go to the CMS instead go to private insurers like Humana, United, Oscar Health, and Clover. These plans replace Original Medicare, also cover Part D prescription drug benefits, and often include supplemental benefits that Original Medicare doesn&#x27;t already cover. The supplemental insurance you&#x27;re talking about is &quot;Medigap&quot;, and that&#x27;s for people that choose &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, but wish to fill in the gaps with private insurance. Today, Original Medicare only covers 80% of costs, and does not cover Part D drug costs. It does NOT apply to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, which is what I&#x27;m talking about in my original comment.<p>36% of Medicare beneficiaries are on private Medicare Advantage plans instead of the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot;. This number has been growing so rapidly, that we expect by 2025, more seniors to be on a private plan than the public one. There&#x27;s also great variance by State. In Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Alabama, Hawaii, and Connecticut — over 40% of beneficiaries are on Medicare Advantage[1].<p>For most beneficiaries, Medicare Advantage costs about 39% less than Original Medicare[2].<p>Medicare Advantage plans are, on average, of higher quality than the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot;[3].<p>In Urban areas, Medicare Advantage costs less per capita to administer than Medicare [4] — and that&#x27;s not including the extra Medicare Part D insurance that you would have to buy if you&#x27;re on the Original Medicare plan. From this same research, public &quot;Original Medicare&quot; is still cheaper in rural areas, but not by a whole lot.<p>Disclaimer: I write software for claims processing and payment systems.
