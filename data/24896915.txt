There are no restrictions on building guided-missile-shaped pixels. If it were shown that the technology could be deployed in a real missile, it&#x27;d be ITAR real quick, and the person (like yourself) who were the one to show that it could be deployed in a real missile could be guilty of providing technical assistance to a foreign agent via a github release and public comment.<p>Not that I think that&#x27;s the case, but it&#x27;s really best to tread lightly around these things. You don&#x27;t want to find out that a bunch of small-time terrorists bought a hobby rocket, and uploaded a kerbal mod, and downed a jet full of tourists or ignited an oil field.')
