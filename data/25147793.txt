Around 400 AMX variants too. Russia has around 300 known T90s, which are the real threat that matches a Leclerc. The rest are T80s, T72s and older, which, while absolutely dwarfing the french numbers, forgets about a tiny thing: they are absolutely _awful_ tanks compared to modern stuff. A Leclerc will happily shrug off T72s.<p>Additionally, Rafales are more than a strong contender to Russia&#x27;s Su35. A dozen Reapers too, for good measure.<p>France isn&#x27;t the world&#x27;s fifth military power and one of the biggest seller of weapons for no reason.')
