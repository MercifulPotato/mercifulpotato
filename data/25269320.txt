Sometimes it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t have the money, sometimes its because they know they lack the domain expertise to choose appropriately, and sometimes it&#x27;s just because I think they&#x27;d enjoy whatever it is (usually books, movies, or meals).<p>People seem relieved that they don&#x27;t have to buy me anything on &quot;special occasions&quot; and don&#x27;t seem to mind that I don&#x27;t buy them anything either. Although there probably was some resistance to that at first, I&#x27;ve been doing it for so long that I don&#x27;t remember.')
