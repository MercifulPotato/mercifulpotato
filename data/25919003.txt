For example, one could just as easily use green&#x2F;red in reference to traffic signal colors.  Ask yourself, would it bother you if we used blue and pink for allow and deny?  What if we used blue or white as synonymous with deny?<p>Two good reasons exist to change our habits, basic manners and clarity.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use the terms blacklist and whitelist from time to time out of accumulated habit.  But there&#x27;s no reason for me to cling to those terms. Being gently reminded to use objectively clearer terminology shouldn&#x27;t engender hostility on my part.  I try not to be an unpleasant person, part of that is when someone tells me my behavior has a negative impact on them, I try to listen to what they say and modify my behavior--while actually effecting change can be hard, the underlying concept is pretty simple.')
