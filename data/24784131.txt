Item(by='troydavis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602728336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783554, text='&gt; I also have some doubts that the OP has removed some bigger publication names (maybe afraid of getting sued? No idea).<p>Just for completeness: I have not. This is everything I have near-certainty of. I omitted 2 or 3 possible authors who I&#x27;m not sure of because I&#x27;m not willing to accuse someone with less than near-certainty (where certainty would be their admission). If I knew anything else, I&#x27;d have posted it.<p>Maybe more importantly, I don&#x27;t have any reason to believe publishers knew this was happening, and have every reason to believe the opposite. Many of these blogs take transparency and disclosure really seriously.')
