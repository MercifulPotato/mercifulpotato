The three restrictions are spectrum&#x2F;telecom licenses, ground stations, and satellite orbits. They only have licenses in the US right now, the satellite orbits favor high latitudes, and the first ground stations are in Washington state.<p>They&#x27;re actively pursuing licenses in many other countries including Canada and Australia. Coverage will come to lower latitudes as they fill out the satellite constellation and build more ground stations. But truly global coverage (e.g. over oceans and the poles where there are no ground stations) will have to wait until they launch their v2 constellation with cross-satellite laser links.')
