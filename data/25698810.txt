Whatsapp is at it&#x27;s peak; it can only decline at this point. Most users don&#x27;t actually care about features, they care about reaching each other. Whatsapp provides that. You could argue that whatsapp was never about the features. It&#x27;s always been a somewhat bland and bare bones UX. It&#x27;s simple and easy to understand. That kind of is the whole point.<p>But Whatsapp got where it is through 1 simple feature: it discovered other whatsapp users through your phone book so that made it easy to start using it. Install the app, and others would find you. That feature has since been copied by world + dog. Telegram, Signal, etc. do the same. Now that both are getting to the hundreds of millions of users (telegram got there ages ago), that safe moat that whatsapp enjoyed is not so safe anymore. I know non technical users that are very eager to escape Facebook&#x27;s clutches that already deleted their facebook profiles and installed alternative chat clients. Moving over is easier than ever.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m old enough to remember reluctantly joining the msn network because a lot of people I knew started using that. ICQ, AOL, MSN, Yahoo Messenger, etc. all used to be popular and now are pretty much gone. Whatsapp can easily join those ranks. There&#x27;s nothing inevitable about its perpetual monopoly on communication. Nothing whatsoever.<p>If anything, Facebook seems in a hurry to blow its feet off with misguided&#x2F;dubious decisions on privacy, user hostile actions, and increasing likelihood of having to deal with anti trust legislation in multiple of its markets. It&#x27;s not helping their case. Every time they are in the news it seems to have a negative tone and some of their users act on it. Facebook is being arrogant.<p>Signal is a breath of fresh air in this space. Structured as a foundation, OSS client and server (unlike most other things out there). Apparently, Elon Musk recommending it the other day caused a nice influx of users.')
