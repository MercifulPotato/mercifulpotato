Item(by='npongratz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610736189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25793004, text='DS Lite, with something like a SuperCard [0] (or whatever is being sold these days).<p>DS Lite directly supports both DS and GBA cartridges, has great battery life, and its battery can be easily replaced. And I love its form factor, folds nicely compact.<p>A micro SD card mounted in the SuperCard can be loaded with good emulators for NES, SNES, GB, Sega, and probably others. It&#x27;s plug-and-play, no hacking of the DS Lite necessary.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eng.supercard.sc" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eng.supercard.sc</a>')
