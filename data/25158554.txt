Item(by='pizza234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605862074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25158398, text='&gt; My original motivation was preventing bitrot, but I&#x27;ve since seen that rationale called into question[0].<p>The article is interesting in his contrarian view, however, when it comes to bitrot, it counters anecdata with other anecdata:<p>&gt; One bit flip will easily be detected and corrected, so weâ€™re talking about a scenario where multiple bit flips happen in close proximity and in such a manner that it is still mathematically valid. While it is a possible scenario, it is also very unlikely. A drive that has this many bit errors in close proximity is likely to be failing<p>I detected bitrot once or twice, and in neither case the drive was failing. This is anecdata though - is it valid? Who knows.<p>I&#x27;m personally skeptical about blanket statements (which the author makes) without seriously backing data.<p>I have a ZFS setup, and it&#x27;s arguable whether it&#x27;s a hassle in itself. At least for RAID-1 setups (I have two), once installed, it&#x27;s not inherently harder to maintain than other FSs. Installation is manual, and that&#x27;s definitely a hassle, but users are definitely intended to be advanced ones.<p>Regarding SMART: it&#x27;s not as easy at the article author states. I have a laptop that periodically pops up with new instances of a certain error, but the SMART guides says that this is not an error one needs to consider, so I&#x27;m confused. Additionally, the smart-notifier of Ubuntu (at least up to 18.04) is broken. I agree that SMART is important to consider, but it&#x27;s not straightforward as it seems.')
