Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607560546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25366613, text='No, Walmart pays for <i>nearly all</i> the products on their shelves, except for new products which might be sold on a consignment basis.<p>Companies paying for product placement does not change the simple truth that Walmart has paid for the product (in the legal and financial sense, even if they haven&#x27;t actually forked over the cash in the actual&#x2F;economic sense), and the supplier is paying for product placement through discounts or other non-cash consideration.<p><i>If wal-mart is anything like the pharmacy I worked at, magazines and greeting cards are similar (only pay for what is sold, credited for the rest, and a rep probably takes care of stocking things).</i><p>No, Walmart and Target are not like the pharmacy you worked for. Target and RiteAid were former clients, I know exactly how they paid for their inventory.<p>Moreover, the market for books, magazines, newspapers, and other printed material is different from other products. With print material, publishers provide discounts or credits for unsold copies against newer books&#x2F;issues because the value of the unsold periodicals rapidly drops to zero after the period passes, and book stores that get burned with unsaleable books generally refuse to stock new books from that publisher if they are not provided incentives (by the publisher) to do so. Note that publishers will usually not credit book stores for best sellers like Harry Potter, etc., because the threat to not carry future best sellers is more likely to backfire on the bookstore than it is on the publisher.')
