Lol.<p>Wayland may not fit with everyone, which is fine, no one is taking X away from you. But allow the vast majority of users to have their scaling displays and multiple monitor setups, which is far more common than your requirements. I&#x27;m sorry Wayland hasn&#x27;t come far enough yet to cover you as well, but it&#x27;s far enough for the vast majority of users. You bring up xdotool in everything thread as if it&#x27;s something that Grandma uses Linux for. It&#x27;s not.<p>&gt; And BTW, this all presumes that a distro installs Xorg at all. If not, you&#x27;ve gotta dive into the package manager, which adds an additional barrier since you need to know what to look for and install.<p>So be honest what you&#x27;re arguing for. You, as an accomplished unix user, want distro defaults to be tailored to your use case. That&#x27;s not what distro defaults are there for.')
