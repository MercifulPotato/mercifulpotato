Item(by='cmiller1', descendants=None, kids=[25931564], score=None, time=1611760687, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928971, text='Yup, there are people working in all sorts of industries that have their own biases and it gets reflected in their work.<p>It goes the other way too, there are plenty of professionals (female engineers, male primary education teachers, etc.) who get harmed by the biases of the general public.<p>Really tangential story but I was calling <i>large supplier in my industry</i> looking for an application engineer to help me figure out how to set something up.  I first asked for one and got put on hold until someone picked up, I started describing the problem and was told &quot;oh, hold on, it sounds like you need an applications engineer, I&#x27;ll go get one&quot; so I get put on hold again.  The next person picks up and the exact same thing happens.  Finally I&#x27;m getting a little flustered and a woman picks up the phone and because of what just happened I say &quot;Am I speaking to an applications engineer?!?&quot;  She sighs and responds in the positive in an annoyed voice and I finally get my questions answered.  This stuck with me for a while because I felt really bad knowing she assumed my initial incredulity was because it was a female voice on the line, and I certainly don&#x27;t blame her for thinking that either.')
