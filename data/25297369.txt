My sister is&#x2F;was dyslexic so with a bit of help from my older brother (who would have been in first year of computer science at the time) I wrote a spellchecker for her. It think it might have been a Christmas present, so I had probably been programming for less than a year at that stage, and only in the afternoons after I got back from school.<p>It read the whole document into memory (not the English dictionary, which was too big) in a tree structure. Pointing out that I could use a binary tree and teaching me how to use pointers was my brother&#x27;s contribution. Then it read through an on-disk copy of the English dictionary. It wasn&#x27;t a complete dictionary, so I didn&#x27;t do any compression on the storage, and then asked the user (my sister) to review each word that wasn&#x27;t in the dictionary, sending any issues out to the printer with a line number and the word in bold.<p>So if a kid with very little experience could do it, professionals would have had little trouble back then.<p>Writing a spell-checker on the computer we had before that though (the ZX-spectrum with 16KB of RAM and the only bulk storage being a cassette tape)... that would have been hard. We&#x27;ve definitely progressed since then.')
