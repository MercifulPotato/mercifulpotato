Full retina feels extremely cramped for a modern computer.<p>So similar to how color calibration on the web doesn&#x27;t matter so much because all the users screens are calibrated all over the place I don&#x27;t think and obsession over pixel perfect Retina matters so much when almost no one is running their Macs at a non-scaled resolution and isn&#x27;t there even some weirdness in scaling with the phones running at &quot;3x&quot;?')
