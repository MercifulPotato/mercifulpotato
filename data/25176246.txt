Processes had very small and hardcoded VM size caps in the kernel, and some algorithms that worked okay with 1 or 2MB of RAM were scaling poorly with the massive 4 or 8MB systems showing up.<p>Despite being meant as a research system, Mach2 was <i>effectively</i> 4.3BSD with a good, fast, and scalable VM system. I imagine this had to play a role.<p>(The Mach VM would be reabsorbed into 4.4BSD and inherited by all the *BSDs -- it&#x27;s since been replaced in all AFAIK, but still interesting)')
