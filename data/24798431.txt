What is the functional difference then? The framing? I expect neutrality, because it shows the ability of an author to distance himself from his own convictions. A necessary step to describe events. Similar with authors that shouldn&#x27;t marry their protagonists, although for different reasons. I have no problem that an author adds his opinion in a clear and transparent way, I actually prefer that. If you are 26-something and a journalist, most readers expect a certain political affiliation already for that matter.<p>But we currently see many issues where crimes are hidden or exaggerated depending on political affiliation. Of course people start to look for alternative sources and that is exactly because writers took sides.<p>You aren&#x27;t doing anyone a favor moralizing climate policy. It is far easier to convince people that tackling the issues is in their own interest. Otherwise opposition suddenly makes sense.')
