I&#x27;m working on a 10k lines rust application with 74 direct and indirect dependencies and the resulting static binary is less than 3MB in size (less than 1MB xz-compressed). That would&#x27;ve been a significant amount of storage in the 90s but it&#x27;s almost negligible nowadays.<p>And given that shared libraries need to be installed and updated separately and they have to ship the entire code of the library (whereas a static binary can be link-time-optimized to get rid of unused code) it might not always be a win in terms of total bandwidth.')
