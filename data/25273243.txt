In JavaScript, for instance, awaiting an object is equivalent to calling .then() on it, passing a closure which, when called, continues the function that awaited.  In other words, JavaScript’s await <i>is</i> call&#x2F;cc.  It just uses .then() instead of a direct call, and has some extra complexity in the form of the ‘rejected’ callback.  Other than that it’s the same thing.<p>Edit: Well, except for the part where you can’t call the resume function more than once (I think?).  Which is apparently also the case with this Swift version.')
