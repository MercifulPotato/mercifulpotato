I understand why it&#x27;s there and the attacks it defends against, but most people just want Facebook to stop stalking them and don&#x27;t worry about a dedicated, nation-state attacker targeting them, so the PIN here actually reduces overall security &amp; privacy by introducing extra friction compared to malicious alternatives such as Facebook.<p>Same thing with backing up&#x2F;restoring chat history. I guess there&#x27;s a security argument to be made there, but it doesn&#x27;t apply to most people. Are you leaking state secrets? By all means, crank all the security options to 11. Are you using it just to not have Zuck spy on your family conversations? Then bulletproof security doesn&#x27;t matter that much and feel free to backup your chats.')
