As it currently stands the mediums use provocative and authoritative language to convey the opinions of their writers and editors. They need to start using phrases like &quot;we hope&quot; and &quot;to the best of our knowledge&quot; instead of presenting a system of decision making that categorically supplants all others. I&#x27;m specifically referring to pieces that should be opinions but are not advertised as such; I&#x27;m not suggesting they start doubting well established facts.')
