Doing the work of implementation is a dime a dozen. Getting quality RFCs and prior alignment on solution architectures is at least an order of magnitude more difficult, more valuable and more rare.<p>Cocksure senior engineers who think, “RFCs are easy, this’ll be quick” are the single biggest source of money-wasting errors that I have to navigate.<p>I’ve implemented huge distributed applications serving machine learning predictions in global scale ecommerce products, real-time image processing, eventually consistent and SOX compliant billing applications and dozens of other similar solutions in my time as an individual contributor.<p>Being a manager responsible for not wasting hundreds of person-years on the wrong architecture is <i>way</i> more challenging. It’s not even the same sport.')
