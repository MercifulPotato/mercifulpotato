Look no further than his last tweets as of right now. He is denying that he has lost and is insisting that there are illegal things happening (I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t, but I will go the extra mile and say he has lost it and that only a manchild would say otherwise -- this manchild).<p>I could not go to bed with a clear mind knowing that I voted for a lying disgusting piece of trash, even if that meant that I was voting for the one whose policies I &quot;agreed with the most&quot;.<p>I guess I _get_ it if you view politics as sports. Sports fans (in the EU) will support their club to death. The president of a football club can be corrupt and they will still probably back them so that they can back the club.<p>In both cases, these are twisted, unhealthy stances.<p>I really cannot fathom how so many Americans can vote for this piece of trash human being. I don&#x27;t think all these people are bigots, racists or idiots; I simply cannot understand how someone can be comfortable with having a piece of shit as the face of the country.<p>I used to love America and the idea of going to it. I used to think it was lead by hardworking (albeit maybe _too_ hardworking) people. I used to think that maybe healthcare wasn&#x27;t &quot;that&quot; important because it was _AMERICA_. I can&#x27;t think like that anymore because a very significant part of the country chooses to be portrayed by an _objectively and openly racist, sexist bigot_.<p>Heck, I think I&#x27;m right leaning on most stuff in life, but I could never ever carry a straight face knowing I contributed to this disaster.<p>I would rather vote blank (I&#x27;m a strong believer in doing just that), against the system, than vote &quot;for&quot; a pig so as to not &quot;vote&quot; for the opposition (a typical argument used by trump &quot;non-supporters who vote for him&quot;). At least the opposition wouldn&#x27;t put America to shame in such a magnitude. In my country America is now used as an example of what not to be, what not to do. We tolerate its undeniable leadership in the world; we no longer worship it or look at it as somewhat of a better society. It used to be the other way around. What happened, America?')
