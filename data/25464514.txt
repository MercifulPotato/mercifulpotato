Both make sense in different circumstances.<p>Higher pricing for flexibility, elasticity - avoiding lock-in while scaling up or down (maybe to 0) or moving location. Price transparency.<p>Network effects, brand recognition, standardised services and high quality &quot;overlays&quot; to spaces like wifi, printers and presentation equipment that works everywhere.<p>Social networks - in physical space, and improved discoverability of spaces themselves and related business clusters.<p>There is also a scale play where you get big enough as an intermediary to beat up suppliers - because you can control and direct demand. Usually a landlord gets to extract surplus value from a location but as WeWork&#x27;s overlays &#x2F; brand &#x2F; network grow powerful they have a stronger negotiating position. Consider the situation where WeWork is huge, and having one near other properties you own (housing, food, retail, etc) raises the value of those.<p>You could take this further and who knows if WeWork will be the ones to do it, but there are definitely value improvements to be had over &quot;negotiate with an agent and commit to an n-year lease, then do a fit-out&quot;. Serviced offices are a thing but scaling that idea _could_ be something else again.')
