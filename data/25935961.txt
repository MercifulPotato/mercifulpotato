Of course these experiments were unethical, but I have seen nothing since that disproves the outcome and I firmly believe that a large percentage of people will happily kill other people or commit heinous crimes when some authority tells them to and they can convince themselves it it not their responsibility.<p>The think I took from it was that I am always responsible for anything that results from my actions. So in my career I always tried to consider what work I do, what customers I work for, and what might come from the things I do. In a business environment that is often not easy, most people work from a mindset that anything profitable is good as long as it&#x27;s not illegal.')
