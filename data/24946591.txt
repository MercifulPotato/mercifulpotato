Item(by='jrockway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604089864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945645, text='Yeah, I think you just need to invest a small amount of time to set up your clients and servers, and you reap the benefits for a long time.<p>I use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;opinionated-server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;opinionated-server</a> as the foundation of my server-side apps.  I thought about monitoring, tracing, and logging once... and then get it for free in every subsequent project.  I explode the app into my cluster, and traces are immediately available in Jaeger, I can read&#x2F;analyze my logs, and it&#x27;s all a pleasure to debug.  I think everyone should just have their own thing like this, because it&#x27;s definitely a pain to do it more than once, but a joy once you have it working.<p>(My thing specifically is missing some things I now need, though, like multiple loggers so you can turn on&#x2F;off rpc tracing at runtime, support for auto-refreshing TLS certs from a volume mount now that everything is mTLS, etc.  Will be added when I am less lazy ;)<p>While I&#x27;m here I&#x27;ll also plug <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;json-logs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;json-logs</a> for making the structured logs enjoyable to read.  You can query them with jq, it understands all the popular JSON log formats, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  It&#x27;s the only client-side app I&#x27;ve ever written that passes the &quot;toothbrush test&quot; -- I use it twice a day, everyday.  Recommended ;)  (Someday I will write docs and an automated release process.)')
