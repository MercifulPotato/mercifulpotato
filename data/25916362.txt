Item(by='astrostl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611672856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903647, text='Ages ago I used &quot;Bigfoot&quot;&#x27;s <i>free email forwarding for life</i>. Which turned into a subset of email with limitations, fees, ads, and eventually shutdown.<p>Later I had my own domain, and did the address-per-site thing. Which was an absolute nightmare to undo when I sold the domain (grepping thru the raw self-hosted mbox and logging into and changing my email on hundreds of sites), although it was a great excuse to get going on using a password manager.<p>At this point I could use &quot;plus addressing&quot; at Fastmail (e.g. amazon+me@domain.com), but I find the endeavor pretty pointless. My spam is low, and I never once found it especially valuable to be able to identify or isolate an offending domain.<p>I don&#x27;t expect that Firefox will go &quot;full Bigfoot&quot; on this one in terms of ads and fees but shutdown is a PITA risk. I would personally only use this kind of stuff for genuine one-offs where anonymity is paramount (read: probably not at all).')
