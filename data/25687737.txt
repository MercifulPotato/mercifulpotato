The cost is negligible.   Even <i>if</i> you make the process slower.  They can just scale out or wait it out.  If it takes 1 hour vs 2 hours to do their payload there is no real difference to them.  They have also already built in the filtering as a % that fails.  They are looking for less than 1-2% success which is all they need.  The frameworks are no longer some simple script hacked up in VBS.  They are packages they can buy from other spammers or rent the bot net with the proper libs built in.')
