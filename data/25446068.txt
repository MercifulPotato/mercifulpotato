Many want direct relationships with their customers, for a start, and if you want that, the App Store is right out. And I can&#x27;t think of a single developer who would say they &quot;would have much more control over updates&quot; if they delivered them through the App Store. (They&#x27;d say &quot;oh, honey, <i>no,</i>&quot; after they finally caught their breath after the laughing fit.)<p>As for &quot;Apple doesn&#x27;t really care about the high end hardware Mac platforms,&quot; well. It&#x27;s possible that they rolled out the Mac Pro just last year as an elaborate ruse to distract us from how much they don&#x27;t care about the Mac Pro, but it strikes me as relatively unlikely. (And if you think the &quot;graphic designer&#x2F;video editor&quot; crowd, either users or developers, is on board with moving everything to the App Store, oh, honey, <i>no.</i>)')
