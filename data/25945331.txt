By convincing themselves of this, they are able to believe that they deserve everything they have and poor people deserve to be poor, and, being inherently superior, it is therefore ok to exploit their lessers.<p>This thinking is a hallmark of prejudice. White supremist have long held that black people and other races are genetically inferior, less intelligent, lazier, more prone to violence or criminality, etc. to justify their position. I have less experience with it, but it seems the same sort of rationalization is at work with the Indian caste nonsense too.<p>P.S. While your question seems to be meant in the objective sense of &quot;why would one expect that intelligence and entrepreneurship are correlated?&quot;, it is apparently being interpreted as &quot;why should society function such that entrepreneurship is a path available to anyone with enough intelligence?&quot;.')
