If you get 10 structural engineers working on a bridge, only single one will sign off on the project. This person needs to be licensed and is liable. But all 10 could have worked on the project and did engineering work.<p>However, your processes mutate so that the liable engineer can reasonably sign something and not get hung out to dry.<p>This means reviews, engineering change orders, signoffs, etc.--ie. all the bureaucracy that software programmers love to complain about gets turned up to 11.<p>&quot;Agility&quot; and &quot;Liability&quot; are directly conflicting goals.')
