And I support right-to-repair.  However, I agree with everything you are saying.  Your cellphone example is excellent.  I grew up in the 70&#x27;s and recall how HUGE anything electronic was.  Sure, they had piles of discrete, reparable parts, but there is no way anyone would go back to that old tech.   It&#x27;s a wonder how cheap the modern stuff is today... I remember the $4K 1Gb HDD... and now it&#x27;s pennies.  People want cheap and easy and small.   The form factor these new things come in form a huge part of their general utility...it&#x27;s not just good enough to <i>work</i>... it needs to be small, and portable, and pretty, and cheap.   In the end, I think some things (like the lawn mower or compressor) can be optimized to be fairly easy to fix...and building them otherwise is just assholery.  Some things...well,  they are gonna stay disposable. Vote with your wallet people.')
