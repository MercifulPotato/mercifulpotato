Essentially they are setting an affiliate cookie to make money from anything you purchase on Amazon, Walmart.com, Ebay, etc. This cookie will override any other that was already set. So if you clicked a link to a book from a blog post and then clicked on a tinyurl, they would get the affiliate referral money and not the blog.<p>It&#x27;s an easy way to make money because it doesn&#x27;t involve a long sales process with major advertisers.
