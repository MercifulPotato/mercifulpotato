The transmitter can always predict exactly what the receiver will decode, so the correct amount of data to send is the amount of data that makes the receiver see what I want. If that means I send 0.1mbps key point data and 1mbps diff pixels then that’s what I want to send.<p>Is that how this works? Because it should be how it works...<p>Not sure if this is a viable way of compressing the video stream or if a transmission of the “diff” would be too costly. If this method would give 1&#x2F;2 the original bandwidth I’d think it’s more impressive than cutting 3 orders of magnitude via “avatars”.')
