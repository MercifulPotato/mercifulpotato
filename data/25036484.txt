Generation stuck around. At the time when you&#x27;d expect to start seeing Silent presidents, Reagan won election as the then-oldest person to have ever been elected president and was popular enough he had two terms and got his VP elected afterwards. If Reagan&#x27;s first term had flopped (or maybe even if he&#x27;d never run at all, though that&#x27;s really speculative), we would&#x27;ve gotten President Mondale in 1984. Or we might have seen a Silent as early as 1980 if Ted Kennedy won his primary challenge.<p>I think we&#x27;re starting to see a similar phenomenon with Generation X being pushed out by long-lived Boomers and even a couple of Silents, but at least we had Obama (born 1961, so he barely counts) in between Boomers.<p>With that said, it&#x27;s not for lack of trying that we haven&#x27;t had a Silent president. Aside from the aforementioned Mondale and Kennedy&#x27;s attempt, we&#x27;ve also had Michael Dukakis and John McCain as major-party nominees, the only third-party candidate who had a chance in Ross Perot, plus Bernie Sanders was a major contender and runner-up for the Democratic nomination twice.')
