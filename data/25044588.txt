But, there is a good interactive tutorial, and I don&#x27;t think that learning Emacs to the equivalent of a beginner&#x27;s level of competence takes very long. A few afternoons perhaps, and one can go extending from that.<p>And if you forget things, it is because you do not need them that often. This is also a kind of economy in there. Maybe other things are more important.')
