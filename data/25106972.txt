How common that is will depend on how often an end user accidentally tries to create duplicate files (if that&#x27;s infrequent then a completely case-sensitive system would also only cause issues infrequently), and in the proportion of programs using the different windows file apis.<p>I think you&#x27;re right that we would expect that to happen only rarely, but it seems implausible to expect that there&#x27;s an entire windows file api with zero usage.<p>Side-note: I don&#x27;t think explaining &quot;Cookie recipe.txt&quot; and &quot;cookie recipe.txt&quot; being different would be thaat hard -- if they look different then they are different. As long as granny doesn&#x27;t have to worry about zero-width whitespace or other garbage in her file names then that&#x27;s a good enough rule of thumb.')
