Some people want it to come quick. Others care about other things. I doubt 100% of people place 100% priority on delivery speed.<p>In particular, I personally don&#x27;t use Amazon much. Granted not in the US so maybe the site is different etc. But to me they are like an &#x27;ebay&#x27; in terms of my trust in what they deliver, when sometimes I want a &#x27;department store&#x27;. Now not everyone is like me but I suspect enough people are that Amazon isn&#x27;t going to take over all shopping.')
