I definitely agree with OP that the stuff that we do on the web today would have been impossible even in 1995 when the web was at least available, but that&#x27;s because browsers were limited, not because programming was limited.  In terms of programming, nearly everything that is done today could be <i>programmed</i> back then using the tools available, we&#x27;re just dealing with larger volumes and higher latencies today.')
