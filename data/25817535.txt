You’re not in the least being open to the possibility that I understand the subject matter but have omitted exhaustive detail because I’m typing on a phone in comments on HN. But if there’s something you think I haven’t considered feel free to show a use case, and I’m happy to work with it to show an API I think improves on hooks but accounts for it. Let’s collaborate.<p>&gt; I could provide a complex example for you and then re-write it in your example, and you&#x27;d see how hooks is far more elegant, and maybe I will, but to be honest there&#x27;s a million examples on the web.<p>Please provide an example. Let’s have a conversation, not... this.<p>&gt; And algebraic effects are a FP concept, go look at OCaml which has been pioneering them, so your appeal to FP purity doesn&#x27;t even hold.<p>I didn’t appeal to FP purity at all. I explicitly appealed to impurity! I appealed to interfaces that embrace it and clearly delineate it.')
