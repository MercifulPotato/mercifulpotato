I&#x27;ve tried seriously using Emacs (Spacemacs) for a year or two, but something always doesn&#x27;t work as intended, code completion and static analysis is extremely hard to configure, especially you have some non-standard project setups. Then switched to a mix of vim for simple stuff or clion&#x2F;pycharm in vim mode for rust&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;python... BUT, subjectively, Magit is the best git client ever created; Magit in evil-mode easily beats all of the 20+ git clients I&#x27;ve used. So I keep emacs&#x2F;spacemacs on every machine now solely to be able to use magit.')
