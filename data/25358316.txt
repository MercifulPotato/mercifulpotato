I keep meaning to put some of it online but still haven&#x27;t yet. There&#x27;s some personal stuff in there also that I&#x27;m not sure I want to or should share that I have to strip out, and some of these projects I&#x27;m not sure I want to share all my ideas about publicly the instant I record them, way before I start looking for publishers. Not that those ideas are likely to be taken or anything, but still. I&#x27;m not always the fastest at getting my games complete, I keep bouncing from idea to idea.<p>I have started working on a proper personal site again, but it&#x27;s not ready enough to release yet.<p>That being said, the game I&#x27;m referring to (I&#x27;ve simulated mechanisms for other games using simulations, but this is the whole game, because it&#x27;s tiny), I submitted to a contest (in which it wasn&#x27;t selected), which required a rules document. In that rules document I included a section for Analysis where I discuss the simulation I made, and I also included a link to the Repl script I made for the simulation.<p>I highly recommend checking the rules for how to play the game before checking out the script, but I&#x27;ll include links to both here:<p>Rules: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1ukL_uPt_NEzt_tLmWJw6y7-ejjia9j4NHt-cl4bCCvw&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1ukL_uPt_NEzt_tLmWJw6y7-e...</a><p>Simulation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;@bacable&#x2F;EvenTheOddsSim#main_for_manual.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;@bacable&#x2F;EvenTheOddsSim#main_for_manual.py</a><p>I&#x27;m also working on a web version for this game, made using Phaser, but it&#x27;s also not ready for release yet. It&#x27;s playable, but I&#x27;m still working out some bugs with the Minmax implementation and it needs more UI and polish. But I don&#x27;t have that online yet either. Need to get on that.<p>But technically, if you have 7 colored wooden cubes in each of 6 different colors, you can play the game yourself. It&#x27;s how I tested it :)')
