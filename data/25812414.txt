When you read stdlib code, you can be confident that nothing is there by accident. Every decision was made for a reason. When you&#x27;re learning, that&#x27;s invaluable, because it means you can &quot;dig&quot; anywhere and be rewarded for it, whereas &quot;digging&quot; into most codebases will often be a waste of time.<p>Also, I would advise actively <i>avoiding</i> the big names you have heard of. A lot of products are successful despite having garbage code. And even more of them are successful despite having only decent code, full of stuff not worth emulating.<p>Try to identify people who have a lot of experience and a strong command of the language, then look at their most recent projects.')
