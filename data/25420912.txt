The conspiracy required to pull it off is mind-boggling, and keeping that a secret essentially impossible.<p>Ironically, Biden supporters have a better argument for believing in fraud conspiracies, given that Trump over-performed significantly compared to expectations in both of the last two elections.  One man&#x27;s &quot;oh the polls must all have been wrong&quot; is another man&#x27;s &quot;there were millions of illegal votes.&quot;<p>This is a scary time for the country.  I sincerely hope this is just a personality cult and will fade along with Trump.  Garden variety issue politics are at least halfway rational.')
