The only plural form that makes sense in English is &quot;viruses,&quot; mostly because the Latin form actually <i>has</i> no plural. [0]<p>That doesn&#x27;t stop people from writing &quot;virii,&quot; however. Both &quot;octopi [1]&quot; and &quot;virii&quot; are examples of linguistic hypercorrection [2], in which a speaker misapplies a known linguistic rule that seems to fit, but does not.  Neither of these examples are attested in the source language the word derives from; people literally use them just to sound smart, most of the time.<p>Other examples are using &quot;whom&quot; in places where the correct word would be &quot;who,&quot; not using a preposition to end a sentence or clause with [3], and to not split infinitives [4].<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;virus#Etymology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;virus#Etymology</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypercorrection" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypercorrection</a><p>[2]: I kinda like &quot;octopodes&quot; myself, but that may just be me.<p>[3]: Winston Churchill is frequently quoted saying something like &quot;this is the kind of nonsense up with which I will not put.&quot;  This is most likely apocryphal.
