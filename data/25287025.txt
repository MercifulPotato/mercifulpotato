Once upon a time some lottery jackpots would occasionally exceed the cost of buying every ticket. But then crime rings cottoned on to that and bought thousands of tickets. Now lotteries take that probability into account and cap the highest rollover amount. Some even have schemes where if there isn&#x27;t a winning ticket the prize jackpot trickles down to the next highest tickets -- which is a great way to sell massively more tickets and keep the jackpot low enough that it doesn&#x27;t exceed the ticket price.')
