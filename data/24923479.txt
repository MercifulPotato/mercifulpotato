Item(by='MithrilTuxedo', descendants=None, kids=[24923937, 24925324], score=None, time=1603915315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922899, text='I&#x27;ve done it before.<p>I asked if I could pay with BTC and my bank passed it up until they got word back from Fanny Mae that it was okay so long as you can demonstrate X years of ownership. I think they made a public announcement about it. It was shortly after BTC hit its peak a couple years ago. Coinbase let me export something that satisfied the bank and government that I wasn&#x27;t money laundering (I&#x27;d bought the BTC many years before for less than $10k with money for a bank account I still owned, so I could show the transactions there too).<p>For my taxes, Coinbase has a tool for exporting that calculates that sort of thing. You just select the time range and it gives you all the transactions and how much they appreciated from when you last bought that much.')
