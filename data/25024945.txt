That’s on normal text. Previously I was reliably above 100WPM, but I’ll keep at it. Honestly it’s less that so much as the sense of flinching whenever I open up a terminal and have to do something complex. Much of that is muscle memory obviously, but for example the X-Bows I just think is irreparably bad for coding or terminal use. There’s just too much for a programmer’s right pinkie to do in many of these layouts, I find. I will admit my previous style probably wasn’t great, in that I’d mostly use pinkies for just shift, enter and caps-as-ctrl, thumbs for space and alt, and the remaining six free ranging as you would on a piano. Acknowledging this might not be good for long term joint health was part of the reason to evaluate something new, but I didn’t have any specific issues beyond bad alt placement.')
