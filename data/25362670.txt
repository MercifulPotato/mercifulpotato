This article quotes a tweet from somebody who presumably has something to do with promoting Texas. He writes:<p>&gt; Texas is the best state for business. Texas has no state income tax, while Californiaâ€™s is the highest in the country. It just got better because Texas made an income tax unconstitutional.<p>Can you explain what he means by that last sentence?<p>I&#x27;m not asking for a political exegesis, unless there&#x27;s no way to explain it without. I&#x27;m just curious for a technical explanation of what he&#x27;s referring to. I suppose part of what I don&#x27;t understand (as a non-American who knows little) is how a state can rule anything unconstitutional in the first place - isn&#x27;t the constitution a federal affair?')
