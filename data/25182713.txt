Caught it very early in the year.  Just unfortunate time and place.<p>Short story?<p>Was down hard for a few weeks.  Still struggling with a general lack of energy that has slowly been improving.<p>Brain fog is a thing.  Better now, but during and for the few weeks after Covid?  Rough.  Would walk into a room only to realize I had no idea why.<p>Again, all improving, but for some of us Covid has a longer term impact beyond possibly losing a month being sick.<p>Very true.<p>Valuing this risk properly seems to be the major disconnect.<p>With it valued reasonably, the extra head count makes perfect sense!<p>I wonder why people don&#x27;t just work in the opposite direction?  Rather than run too lean, run properly, risks managed as they should be.<p>Then be opportunistic!<p>Every so often, when things are favorable, take work that matters an nail it for a nice payback!<p>Works about the same over a longer period, and the big costs are totally off the table.')
