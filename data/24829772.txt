I say this as someone that has a lot of deeply ingrained avoidance behaviors (e.g. smoking weed 24&#x2F;7 to mask anxiety and pain, isolating myself to avoid social anxiety). Obviously, ignoring problems can often make them worse, and sometimes simple solutions do exist (e.g. I have had disabling IBS off and on for 20+ years that is improved significantly by avoiding alcohol and taking fiber). That said, everyone needs relief at times, so be kind to yourself about avoidance patterns.<p>Awareness is simply noticing how I feel without judgment or reaction, but with the attitude of a curious observer. So instead of A: (feel pain —&gt; “I’m fucked up &#x2F; disabled” narrative) or B: (feel pain —&gt; &lt;ignore&gt; —&gt; &lt;subconscious avoidance behaviors&gt;), it’s like C: (feel pain —&gt; “this is a sensation I’m experiencing” —&gt; &lt;no action&gt;). Needless to say, this is not an easy thing to do and takes practice.<p>Acceptance to me means not defining myself or my self-worth in terms of my illness(es), or comparing myself to others. However, it does not mean accepting defeat or relinquishing hope that things can improve.<p>Gratitude looks like being aware of and thankful for the wide world of things that you <i>can</i> do and experience, the people that love you (even if you can’t think of any, they’re out there), and remembering the “fact” that being a conscious creature in this strange and beautiful universe is an infinitely valuable gift.')
