In fact, local temperature records over several decades seems to be flat in pretty much every place I&#x27;ve looked up. On the other hand, I have observed widespread deception within professional environments and scientific communities... I was a climate believer for a long time, but these days it seems more like a religion than a science so I&#x27;m now a skeptic. The authorities keep preaching the climate change mantra with increasing urgency and certainty but it doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny. I&#x27;m more concerned about microplastics and air pollution.')
