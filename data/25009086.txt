The critical point here is that B is a low quality source, but plentiful. rocqua&#x27;s point was likely similar, if you replace height with thermal energy. You can&#x27;t use the energy you put in A to move it from B to A, because it costs you at least as much to move it up.<p>However, we&#x27;re not bringing it down to B. We&#x27;re bringing it down to C (ambient 21°C in their example). There will be losses, but shouldn&#x27;t it be doable, depending on the B-C potential?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t Peltier modules be 100% efficient in theory for rising B to A (as long as thermal losses go to the hot side, that is: tey keep a side cooler), for instance? If so, the generated energy is the one stored between A and C, minus conversion losses, minus A-B. That is, B-C minus conversions losses from A-C. Probably not very efficient at the end, though worth it if you have plenty of B (and a excellent &quot;C&quot; sink).')
