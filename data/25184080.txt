Considering that packages of higher importance tend to be more actively maintained, I&#x27;d assume that Debian won&#x27;t be significantly behind the latest release for packages that exist in both Arch official and Debian.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repology.org&#x2F;repository&#x2F;debian_testing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repology.org&#x2F;repository&#x2F;debian_testing</a>')
