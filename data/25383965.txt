Item(by='laurent92', descendants=None, kids=[25384187], score=None, time=1607679942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379587, text='Let’s assume the validation process takes $300 for each pass (each version, and initial release, has a consultant for 1&#x2F;2 day, assuming the consultant takes that time to analyse code and has tools ready, and that 1&#x2F;2 includes the occasional PR problem and the occasional escalation process). Given an app has an average of 30 versions, it costs Apple 9000$ per app, excluding the Marketplace hosting which must be minor compared to this.<p>That means the breakeven for the 30% fee is at 27000 sales for a $3 app _in average_, but many apps make no sales, many others are free, many are cheaper than $3.<p>So the 30% fee is effectively the bigger apps paying so the smaller apps can exist, and so a market can exist, with low-cost apps, which makes it interesting for customers to come. Therefore I don’t personally think the 30% cut is unfair; just that « the bigger paying for the smaller » is a debatable choice (which is the same idea as the bigger taxpayers paying for the poorest).')
