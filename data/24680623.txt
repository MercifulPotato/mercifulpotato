But there is more to consider than finances: For example I think mental health is a major issue (suicide, prison, depression, etc). I don&#x27;t see encouraging men into other fields where they learn to express themselves as a detractor. Putting more men into the arts for example doesn&#x27;t mean less men in STEM fields.<p>A lot of the male prison population usually have mental illness, sexual assault histories, were raised by a single parent (often the mother) or more generally a broken home. It&#x27;s not ideal, but if we encouraged more male teachers into the early education system, perhaps young boys would have a good male role model to look up to.')
