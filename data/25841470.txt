Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611106157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840943, text='&gt; <i>they are doing so on their own platforms based on a philosophical opposition to the message of sedition that 50% of the red team is pushing</i><p>Agreed. I worded it how I did on purpose - to not take issue with the platforms choosing to censor, but rather with the assertion that all platforms have some duty to censor.<p>&gt;&gt; <i>(meaning attack red tribe protests with the same zeal as blue tribe protests)</i><p>&gt; <i>This is false. Any leader on the blue team will say they would prefer all citizens be treated well rather than all citizens be abused</i><p>When specifically asked, yes, but that&#x27;s not how such calls are received by policy makers. I&#x27;ve definitely seen videos of rioters complaining for being &quot;attacked like Black people&quot; with blue tribe commenters partaking in schadenfreude. But yes my example was a bit obtuse, trying to capture the general attitude of condemning people being angry at the government in the red tribe way.<p>&gt; <i>this was happening on cable news and talk radio long before it was happening on the internet</i><p>I agree that this is part of a longer trend. But there is also a qualitative difference now that pent up anger has turned into mass action, especially over something so clearly farcical. If talk radio had incited something like this in the 90s, there would have been a clear target to blame. Even the gaslighting of politicians&#x27; sedition as not-sedition is an artifact of our postmodern media environment.')
