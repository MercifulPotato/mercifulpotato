People that don&#x27;t like Steam can use the Microsoft Store, Epic Store, Origin, GOG, the Ubisoft Store, buy physical copies, etc. so they probably just do that instead of complaining about Steam. And the same goes to publishers, in fact many of those stores were created by publishers that weren&#x27;t happy with Steam&#x27;s cut.')
