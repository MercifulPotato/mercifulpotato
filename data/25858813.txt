It has no effect in this scenario. You need to buy a significant amount of the BTC in circulation to reduce the supply. You buy a certain percentage of BTCs it doesn&#x27;t matter how many billions in volume there is. Buying so much will raise the price which in turn will raise the demand and the bubble starts. Every time the bubble is about to pop you need to buy again to repeat the process. It gets more expensive every time but at the same time the amount of BTC in circulation gets smaller and so the amount the attacker has can move and manipulate the market more. The is no need to go strait up the attacker can temporary crash the market by selling some and bet on falling prices. Then buy back more with the profit. A state with a money printer can not loose and can manipulate however much they want.<p>&gt;Buying “many millions” worth of bitcoin would not achieve what you’re proposing.<p>IIRC in 2019 &quot;someone&quot; supposed bough BTCs for about 100 million USD in a short time frame and it raised the price by several %. Its not the 100million that moves the market so much is the demand it creates when people see the price going up. No need to buy the bubble just manipulate the market into creating one.<p>Also 100 million may sound like a lot of money but for a large state this isn&#x27;t especially if its printed anyway. And they can recover most by betting on falling prices when they let the bubble burst.\nThe people who exits before the bust are the only people who actually have to be &quot;paid&quot; (they made profit) by the an attack. While those who stay in or join will lose everything in the end and cover most of the cost of the attack. Remember after the attack BTC would be almost worthless and the attacker would have sold it all while betting on lower prices. All the people who get liquidated indirectly payed for the attack. Everyone who holds BTC an bought it higher than the end price indirectly helped create the bubble.<p>You&#x27;d definitely need lots of money to do this but that doesn&#x27;t mean it costs a lot in the end. Most of it is a zero sum game.')
