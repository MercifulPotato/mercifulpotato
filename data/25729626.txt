Solar isn&#x27;t expensive anymore, panels can be had for &lt;$1&#x2F;Wh. The cost of batteries is still significant but some of that can be mitigated by buying used packs for 1&#x2F;4 the price.<p>The key with being off grid is redundancy. One is none and two is one. For example, if there are storms that last a week you&#x27;ll get almost no solar power. You need another way to get power, typically a fuel-based generator.')
