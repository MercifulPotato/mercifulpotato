At least in corporate environment with bazillion legacy apps, x86 will be the king for the foreseeable future.<p>And frankly I don&#x27;t really see the pull of ARM&#x2F;M1 anyway. I mean, I can get a laptop with extremely competitive Ryzen for way cheaper than MacBook with M1. The only big advantage I see is the battery, but that&#x27;s not very relevant for many use cases - most people are buying laptops don&#x27;t actually spend that much time on the go needing battery power. It&#x27;s also questionable how transferable this is to the rest of the market without Apple&#x27;s tight vertical integration.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d argue Apple&#x27;s M1 machines are already at this level and they&#x27;re version 0<p>Where is this myth coming from? Apple&#x27;s chips are now on version 15 or so.')
