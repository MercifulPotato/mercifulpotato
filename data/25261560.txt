It doesn&#x27;t even seem seem to attack generalized protein folding in general. It really seems like the plan was, &quot;let&#x27;s attack this problem with a Google-sized firehose&quot; rather than created a fundamentally different algorithm that had game-changing results.<p>Comparing your system to AlphaFold seems like your really bending the truth here.')
