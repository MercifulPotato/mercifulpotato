I don&#x27;t know about you, but it&#x27;s extremely difficult for most people to save up that kind of runway.<p>I think the idea is that step one <i>isn&#x27;t</i> hiring a subordinate employee; it&#x27;s having secure enough finances that you (or you and your co-founders) can work for yourself for a time.<p>Step two is actually working on the business, and step three is growing is revenues to the point where it can sustain you, four is growing them further to the point where they can support an employee, and <i>five</i> is actually hiring that employee and paying them $130k a year.')
