Item(by='yyyk', descendants=None, kids=[25653607], score=None, time=1609886208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652001, text='&gt;You&#x27;re here citing Kissinger as a venerable authority rather than an amoral war criminal, case in point.<p>Citing Kissinger does not mean endorsing him.<p>&gt;KSA exports the same toxic religious fundamentalism...<p>Iranian-supported fundamentalism controls 4 ME captials, KSA controls only 1 capital. Iran is a explicitly anti-American revisionist power with a serious nuclear program while KSA isn&#x27;t.<p>Unsurprisingly, I focus on the bigger more toxic power (that wasn&#x27;t always the case - two decades ago KSA was the bigger issue). Isn&#x27;t that more like realpolitiks rather than talking about what would some fictional KSA have done?')
