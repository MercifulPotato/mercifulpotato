Item(by='e98cuenc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611430845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25880902, text='Thank you for the feedback. Some people want to use the premium icons (as they are more exclusive), and they obviously help to keep the lights on, but I disagree with your point on us &quot;tricking you to click it&quot;. They are clearly labelled, and if you&#x27;re not interested at all in them you can filter them out. We will remember your preference and will not show them again.<p>There is a download limit on the icons you can download per day, with an exception to the limit if you&#x27;re downloading a full pack. A platform that creates its own icons has different trade-offs than a platform that collect icons available for free, and that&#x27;s another one of these trade-offs. We could remove the limit on CC icons, though.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that you have a sub-par experience with Flaticon, and glad that you extract some value from it.<p>The fact that our database is &quot;so big&quot; is because we paid artists to create these icons, and at the end of the day this money has to come from our customers, but I take note of your comments as we clearly have room to improve.<p>Thank you!')
