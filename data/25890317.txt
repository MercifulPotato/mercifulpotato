Those technologies do not serve the same purpose.<p>It&#x27;s written in JavaScript; it runs on node.js - at least the front-end part of it (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Automattic&#x2F;wp-calypso" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Automattic&#x2F;wp-calypso</a>). I don&#x27;t know what is running on the backend but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s LAMP?<p>The point I was making though is that &quot;WordPress&quot; can mean two different things - wordpress.org (the self-hosted LAMP version) or wordpress.com, which is a SaaS offering (so the language is more or less irrelevant unless you&#x27;re really interested in running your own admin frontend, I guess).')
