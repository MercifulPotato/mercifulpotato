The law needs to recognize that for massive social networks like Facebook and Twitter and for the Apple and Google App stores that people are actually entitled to those services, and have a right to use them, and shouldn&#x27;t be kicked off of them without any form of recourse.  They&#x27;ve grown too big to just consider them like the corner coffee shop and allow them to kick anyone off of their platform for whatever reasons they cook up.<p>And that means that they will need to staff up and that will come out of their profit margins, and that&#x27;s okay.  That&#x27;s why they need to be forced to do it by regulations.')
