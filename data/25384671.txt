But this is a narrow minded point of view in my opinion.<p>Digital nomads building some pointless SaaS products with inflated egos working remotely in far flung places of the globe, getting to sample the delights of the worlds great capital cities are not an important consideration in the impact of AirBnB globally. \nThe ability to live a lifestyle like that already comes with so much opportunity and privilege which is either denied or impossible for so many people.<p>And so when AirBnB ravages communities by driving prices up and forcing people out through their carefree regard for local rules and regulations, then yes, I would say that part of the problem also lies with AirBnB, unless you simply believe that any company should be able to bulldoze whatever comes in its path with zero repercussions?<p>There is a reason that cities like Lisbon are desirable to visit and spend time in. It&#x27;s not because its increasingly filled with tech-nerds who talk about &quot;Ramen profitability&quot; and play on slides in offices at lunchtime. Its because of the rich history of the place and the communities + people which make it up.
