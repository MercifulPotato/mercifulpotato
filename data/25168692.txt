Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=[25168987], score=None, time=1605951349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25167228, text='Twelve years of work is <i>nothing</i> if you put it in the right perspective. We are still in the 14-bis stage of human flight. To dismiss it entirely as something that &quot;facilitates crime and people chasing lambo money&quot;, you are showing either ignorance or malice. It&#x27;s no different than looking at early-stage internet and thinking &quot;oh, it&#x27;s only for porn and nerd who can&#x27;t go out and talk to people in real life&quot;.<p>Re: PoW. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> valid criticism if it&#x27;s already acknowledged as a crucial point that needs <i>and is getting</i> work and continued attention. You insisting on this point is as much whataboutism as as the one I mirrored there.<p>&gt; Your story was never why all those firestarters bought mining rigs to consume 3KW 24&#x2F;7<p>Because that is a non-story. People will act on their self-interest and they had an opportunity to profit.<p>If you want to be upset&#x2F;find fault about this story, perhaps you should look at the government that allows subsidized energy production and does not care about the externalities of it all. Then perhaps you will <i>also</i> understand the parallels with what I was talking about Lebanon. (Hint: tech that helps with decentralization and neutralizing the power of control held by big central entities)<p>&gt; If I am proven wrong, that would be a good thing.<p>That&#x27;s the funny part. No one cares about proving anything to you or any of the skeptics. People will continue to build and work on it and keep improving it. And then one day you will be using tech based on blockchain systems without even realizing and you <i>still</i> will be skeptical. And those working on <i>still</i> won&#x27;t care about you.')
