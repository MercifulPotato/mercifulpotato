[0] says that Hashlife has logarithmic complexity on average. In the worst case it is O(n) since it could have to look at every element to see a pattern if one even exists [1]. Therefore the worst case for any algorithm running in a Life turing machine using HashLife is the same as if it was running directly on the machine.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fanf.livejournal.com&#x2F;83709.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fanf.livejournal.com&#x2F;83709.html</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;234548&#x2F;what-are-the-consequences-of-hash-life-running-in-olog-n" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2345...</a>')
