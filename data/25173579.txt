Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606002134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147919, text='If there&#x27;s going to be some automated mechanism for newbies that effectively involves phoning-home or having some external centralized dependency at run time (even if it&#x27;s only DNS requests), then I&#x27;d like that to be optional, including in the official builds.<p>One of the reasons I run OpenWrt is to avoid some of the undesirable crud of commercially-packaged routers.  And the crud is getting much worse, especially with convergence with IoT, where there are conventions of often gratuitous (lazy and&#x2F;or predatory) centralized dependencies.<p>OpenWrt seems to have a good amount of civic-minded volunteers using it, not only driven by router manufacturers doing versions for their devices (where there are a lot of unfortunate commercial pressures to grab all the intimate data they can, create dependency&#x2F;engagement&#x2F;subscriptions&#x2F;etc.).  So I suspect there are others who are reluctant to do this like a move-fast-and-break-things conventional IoT play, even if that can be convenient in some ways.<p>Personally, for now, I currently just make my own self-signed TLS cert for the OpenWrt router&#x27;s Web admin console.  Longer-term, I want to make a dedicated hardware console for it.  I don&#x27;t expect everyone to do that, though, but I can imagine reasonably usable near-term solutions for bootstrapping a self-signed cert, integrated with the existing OpenWrt first-time config procedures, which would be easier than the bigger barrier of first-time firmware installing on a lot of the devices.')
