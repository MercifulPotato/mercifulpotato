What make it hard to understand is the use of abstractions like Monad, Transformers etc, and people use it a lot in Haskell. It&#x27;s very hard in fact to make a useful Haskell program without a Monad. That said, I don&#x27;t think another mainstream languages that use advanced abstraction like Haskell is gonna be easier to read either. Try to imagine a Java program that trying to use higher-kinded abstraction, I bet it won&#x27;t be pretty and easy to teach. I have experience trying to explain about Monad in Ruby to a coworker and it&#x27;s really hard.')
