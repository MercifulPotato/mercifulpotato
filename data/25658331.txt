Item(by='valenterry', descendants=None, kids=[25660444], score=None, time=1609945380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657832, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not insurable in the sense that at some point, the losses are so large and so frequent, that the insurer needs to collect premiums from almost everyone in order to cover the costs. I actually do consider the premiums a tax for the following reasons<p>Could it be that you limit your perspective onto only the US at the current point in time? Otherwise what you say just doesn&#x27;t make any sense and your points can&#x27;t be generalized.\nAnd even in the US, health insurance is not mandatory (as you say yourself), hence I would still not call it a tax.<p>&gt; No private insurer would touch this market since the losses are so high, so the government created the National Flood Insurance Program, which is the federal taxpayers taking on the liability for flood damage for those homes.<p>Yeah, so if you don&#x27;t talk about flooding being insurable in general but that there just isn&#x27;t any company that is doing it for Florida then I agree. And to be honest, I think it&#x27;s not good that the taxpayers are paying here. The nice thing about insurance is that it gives incentives, such as &quot;don&#x27;t live somewhere if you can&#x27;t afford the dangers at this place&quot;.')
