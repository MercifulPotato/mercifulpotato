Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[25181738], score=None, time=1606081674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181213, text='<i>&quot;Whatever you think of Mark Zuckerberg, you can&#x27;t accuse him of being stupid or lazy&quot;</i><p>Whatever you can say about Mark Zuckerberg, I doubt that he was even half as smart as, say, von Neumann or Tesla, or Da Vinci, or probably hundreds if not thousands of other people whose names we all know, not to mention the probably millions of people who were just as smart but have remained unknown.<p>These people did not achieve riches either because they did not consider them to be important, because they got screwed by people who were less scrupulous or more well connected, were just unlucky, or for a million other reasons than their intelligence.<p>Instead, the really brilliant minds of humanity are almost always the servants of far less intelligent people.<p>As for hard work, do you know how many single parents there are who are holding down two or three minimum wage jobs to support their families, dealing day after day and year after year of getting spat on and despised for being poor or having the jobs they have?  Or the fish seller who gets up at three in the morning every day to haul his wares to the market, clean fish guts off the sidewalk, and brave the weather to sell you fish day after day.  These people aren&#x27;t doing their work from a comfy McMansion or penthouse office, or ordering people about to do their work for them, but they work just as hard.<p>But what makes people think that intelligence or hard work make people deserving of money?  People fetishize workaholism and intelligence, while there are plenty of smart, hard working sociopaths out there (arguably, they&#x27;re exactly the kind who attain &quot;success&quot; in the business world, because they&#x27;re smart and have no scruples to keep them back from doing whatever it takes to succeed, even if it means walking over the backs and faces of hundreds or thousands of people).<p>To me it&#x27;s people who help others who are far more deserving of &quot;success&quot;.  The people who help the poor and disadvantaged, the teachers, the people who sacrifice themselves rather than those that sacrifice others.  But most of these people don&#x27;t attain &quot;success&quot; in the conventional sense.  They usually die poor and unknown, and you rarely see books or articles about how great they were.<p>The fawning is usually reserved for the rich, who, when it comes down to it, usually get that praise because they&#x27;re rich.  If they make the wrong decisions or are unlucky, no matter how smart or hard working they were, they are forgotten and often despised.  That would have been Zuckerberg&#x27;s fate as well, without any change in his intelligence or work ethic, if he hadn&#x27;t struck it rich.')
