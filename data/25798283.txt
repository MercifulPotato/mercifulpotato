To the &#x27;donor&#x27; (as it were) it&#x27;s probably (jurisdiction varies, IANA tax advisor, etc.) a decent inheritance tax avoidance (obligatory &#x27;as opposed to evasion&#x27;) - helps out a cause he believes in, while leaving the capital (hopefully&#x2F;in theory) for his inheritants.<p>To the recipient.. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d prefer it to a (stipulation-free) donation, but in general it&#x27;s probably easier to get big loans than big donations.')
