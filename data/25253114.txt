[0]<p>If a community speaks the language natively, in a certain distinctive way, that&#x27;s called a native accent, and as you say it&#x27;s meaningless to refer to any native accent as more or less accented than another. (<i>edit</i> I suppose in the extreme cases this might not be true, as a community&#x27;s dialect might evolve into a distinct language, but that&#x27;s by the by.)<p>With non-native accents though, the accent is the result of a limited linguistic ability. If you learn French, you&#x27;ll have less of an English accent as you become more skilled, as the accent is the result of your native English leaking into your French pronunciation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Accent_(sociolinguistics)#Non-native_accents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Accent_(sociolinguistics)#Non-...</a>')
