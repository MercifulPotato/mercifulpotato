I’d argue this is more useful as it lets new customers find you, as opposed to your existing followers on Facebook. In any case most business have to now update this info on multiple places.<p>But re “don’t need a website” — you can get one for less than €50&#x2F;year, and you get a @yourbusiness.domain + email as well.<p>If this is too much for you, you’re not a serious player. In fact, a business running on a @gmail or @yahoo address, with the online presence being on Facebook screams “amateur” or even possibly “scammer”. In any case it’s a useful signal that the owner isn’t really committed.')
