They just give no excuse to millions to keep using their service. They are not Facebook, so, they don&#x27;t have the same luxury Facebook has - keeping all your pictures, videos, and posts a hostage. I think Indieweb is more relevant today than it ever has been! Also, Twitter boosted its competitor Parler today better than ever. By Google Play blocking Parler, millions will learn how to install Android apps outside of their store and many conservatives will leave iOS for Android for this ability alone!')
