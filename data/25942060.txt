That&#x27;s illegal. If they did, what is happening to them serves them right.<p>Even if they didn&#x27;t, a &quot;short squeeze&quot; is perfectly legal. If the short sellers think the stock is overpriced, and there&#x27;s others that think its underpriced, then both sides are placing their bets and will deal with the result, either by making or losing a lot of money.<p>This is not a &quot;pump and dump&quot;, this is an unco-ordinated short squeeze. A bunch of people decided to take the short sellers on.<p>Whether everyone involved understands the risk of a short squeeze to them by going long is a prime case of &quot;caveat emptor&quot;. They&#x27;re not even buying calls, they&#x27;re actually buying the stock.<p>The short sellers are being squeezed mercilessly and will eventually have to bail out. At that point the stock will tank back to a more realistic position and the people that went long too late and didn&#x27;t exit will also lose lots of money.<p>Of course, they won&#x27;t crystalize those losses until they sell.')
