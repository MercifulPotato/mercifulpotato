Those engines are closed source.<p>For obtaining revenue and building a community their model works well.  Just not an open source community.<p>Unity is free for people and companies to use if their revenue is &lt;$100k&#x2F;year, so lots of people use it for personal projects and as early stage businesses.  That gets them hooked and happy to use it, and builds a community of 3rd party add-ons and assets.<p>For any business whose revenue then grows to &gt; $100k&#x2F;year, the business can easily afford the relatively low license fee of Unity; they won&#x27;t mind.  That fee goes up with increasing revenue of the business.')
