Apparently you are not familiar with his coding style; otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t have these complaints on linking. For his (and many others&#x27;) libraries, you &quot;instantiate&quot; the implementation in a .c file and declare functions in other source files. This way you only compile the library implementation once.<p>In addition, although the name of the repo is &quot;single_file_libs&quot;, it links to many double-file libraries consisting of a pair of .c and .h files. These libraries won&#x27;t have the issues you are talking about. Developers are well aware of the potential linking problems.<p>That said, you are right that single&#x2F;double-file libraries tend to be small. It is hard to work with a file with &gt;10,000 LOCs anyway.')
