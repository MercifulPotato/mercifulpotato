(Remember, the characteristic feature of gamma radiation is that it <i>penetrates,</i> easily passing through normal matter. A geiger tube has to be big.)<p>Additionally, geiger tubes consume a fair amount of power. It needs to be recharged daily, like a cell phone. Not something easily carried around just in case.<p>Additionally, additionally, the 500+ has two tubes, which lets it measure higher doses of radiation. A cheaper single tube geiger counter designed to detect low levels of radiation will saturate when exposed to more dangerous levels of radiation. (This was a fun detail of the Chernobyl disaster: all the dosimeters the staff had access to maxed out at 0.001 R&#x2F;s, which is far below any threatening level. This lead them to underestimate how bad the explosion was for many hours.)')
