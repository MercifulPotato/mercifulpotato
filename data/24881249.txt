REQ&#x2F;REP patterns tend to work out just fine, because the client is going to wait for a reply from the server. But things like PUSH&#x2F;PULL become...harder to follow. You can push things in the client, but how do you know when they&#x27;ve flushed out of the IO thread and made it to the server? Those sorts of things matter when shutting down a process, running integration tests, etc. In contrast, with an HTTP request, you&#x27;re basically always doing REQ&#x2F;REP, and so you know when the data has been pushed.<p>The 2nd issue is that ZMQ implementations tend to be harder to observe &#x2F; operate than a more common path like HTTP requests. (HTTP requests can go through a load balancer, have standard response codes, use headers for authorization, etc.) For these reasons, I&#x27;ve tended to avoid ZMQ ever after -- it seems like often, you&#x27;re best off either using REST or GRPC if by HTTP, or raw TCP if it&#x27;s purely a data push kind of operation (e.g. forwarding structured logs, with framing, to a remote TLS endpoint).')
