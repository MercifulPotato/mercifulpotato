I have a different strategy that I think is   &quot;better&quot; in a few ways but definitely still complicated.<p>(I&#x27;m assuming this is starting on a machine that already has windows on it because that&#x27;s how my computers generally come (although maybe not the future since Lenovo is selling Thinkpads with Linux now):<p>Step 1. Install Ubuntu (let it set up the dual-boot stuff for you). The main advantage of this approach is I don&#x27;t have the issue where grub can&#x27;t boot windows as described in the article. (NOTE: ubuntu&#x27;s installer won&#x27;t do encryption in this setup for some reason: Ubuntu please fix this and save me the following steps!):<p>Step 2: reboot into the installer.  Now things are going to get crazy.<p>Step 3: shrink the ubuntu partition as small as it will go (resize2fs -M ...).  Then create a new partition of the same size at the end of the drive and copy the data over to the new partition.<p>Step 4. delete the original ubuntu partition.  replace it with a &#x2F;boot partition and a luks partition.<p>Step 5. Copy the boot stuff into &#x2F;boot, copy the rest of the data onto your new encrypted &#x2F; partition (i usually do lvm here also).  chroot into the &#x2F;, do the mounting stuff TFA suggests, install lvm&#x2F;dmcrypt&#x2F;etc.  Reconfigure your initramfs and run update-grub.<p>Step 6. Delete the copy of the original ubuntu partition made in step 3 and resize the encrypted partition as needed.<p>OK I agree that&#x27;s a pretty ridiculous sequence and I wish Ubuntu would do it for me, but it&#x27;s pretty cool that it can be done at all (takes about an hour).')
