Until COVID that was never really a problem.<p>After the first shutdown lifted somewhat, the health department mandates requires us to be part of small &quot;pods&quot; to help contain any spread (as an aside, that has worked surprisingly well considering how close in contact people are)  We&#x27;re also restricted to a limited number days we can train so pod members have to coordinate with each other the classes we&#x27;re planning to attend so that we don&#x27;t show up and be the only guy or gal in our pod that night.<p>You know how we invariably coordinate?  Email or text.  Primarily email in fact.  It wasn&#x27;t planned or dictated by anyone.  It just worked out that way.')
