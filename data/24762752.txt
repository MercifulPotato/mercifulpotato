Also, aerobraking massively decreases the amount of fuel required to get to Mars.<p>Fourth, Mars probably has enough gravity to prevent most of the health risks associated with low gravity.<p>I don&#x27;t think either Mars, the Moon, or asteroids are dead ends for colonization. In the long, long run I think more people will live in rotating habitats in cis lunar space than on Mars,  and more people will live on Mars than the Moon, but I think there are enough resources for millions or perhaps billions of people to live on Mars.')
