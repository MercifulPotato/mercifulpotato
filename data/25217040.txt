Coinbase clearly states that they believe there to be three complaints and that they’re generally in the clear.<p>My point about reading between the lines is that the explicit, specific repetition of the claim and the <i>way</i> they’re saying it implies that the NYT is going to allege there were more complaints.<p>So then: what of the missing complaints? What Coinbase is saying, essentially, is that whatever else is alleged either didn’t happen (eg, the NYT is outright lying), or that they weren’t <i>really</i> complaints.<p>That’s what I’m getting at. It’s highly unlikely that the NYT is lying. I would be shocked if they did not verify in some way that the complaints alleged were indeed made to Coinbase. And I also do not think that Coinbase would accuse the NYT of lying either. It’s not a particularly defensible position.<p>So - that’s the reading between the lines. To me, the most plausible explanation is that the NYT will allege multiple complaints, and Coinbase is trying to say “no those don’t count.”')
