All you have to do is rename a bookmarks folder to contain the word &quot;(publish)&quot;, and anything added to that folder will be dynamically updated on your own page.<p>For example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linquist.app&#x2F;view&#x2F;edb18a0cec0940ccddb616802a1773a7f718f2d03d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linquist.app&#x2F;view&#x2F;edb18a0cec0940ccddb616802a1773a7f7...</a><p>Sharing it here in case anyone finds it useful.<p>Couple caveats:<p>* Chrome only.<p>* You must be signed into Chrome to use it. I know that&#x27;s not great for privacy, but it keeps bookmarks in sync across multiple Chrome installs - the alternative is to create a Linquist-specific account.<p>Hope it&#x27;s useful!')
