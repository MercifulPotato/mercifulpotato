Robinhood has been instrumental in crushing fees for trading individual stocks (a year ago Vanguard charged $7 per trade if your account didn&#x27;t have enough money, and now it&#x27;s $0), and is an incredibly user friendly way to get involved in investing. Seriously, compare Robinhood&#x27;s UI to anybody else (Schwab, IB, Vanguard), and they absolutely crush it. If you&#x27;re starting off and don&#x27;t have enough money to open an account with a legacy broker (I believe Vanguard requires $3k to open a Roth, not sure about their regular accounts), Robinhood makes it incredibly easy to start building a portfolio with a small pool of money (say $1k).<p>I feel like Taibbi had an axe to grind against Robinhood or else he would have tried to separate the &quot;bad&quot; (puts, options, a sense of gambling) vs the good (low barrier to entry, easy to buy what you want, etc).')
