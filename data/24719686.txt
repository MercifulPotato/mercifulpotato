Facebook may be a gigantic media company with a whole social component, but it&#x27;s still in many ways (especially in terms of advertising) mostly another media company with lots of eyeballs, fundamentally like so many media companies that have existed for a very long time.<p>Since political ads have been a part of media placement since (a very damn long time ago), what justification beyond hand wavey &quot;it&#x27;s a social danger&quot; arguments can some of you favoring this state for such a ban or the feeling of having to pursue it?<p>It almost seems as if this only started being a supposed problem since the unpopular-among-educated-liberal-types Trump won an election. Prior to that I recall much less mention of anyone worrying too much about political ads on social media (my memory might be faulty on that though). So, is it a general thing or are we talking about many people now thinking there&#x27;s a problem mainly because someone they happen to dislike took advantage of social media to win a major election?<p>Also worth noting:<p>1. Much of the really rabid fake news type content on platforms like Facebook doesn&#x27;t even come from paid in-platform ads. It&#x27;s sourced and virally spread from people (or fake accounts in many cases) posting it more or less organically, albeit in a highly coordinated way sometimes.<p>2. The whole argument of Russia supposedly using Facebook to &quot;influence&quot; the 2016 election has yet to be in any way credibly substantiated and has gone nowhere so far. Or does anyone have a piece of concrete evidence arguing the opposite to put forth?')
