Item(by='josteink', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605470227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102635, text='&gt; I wonder if making a shell on top of Android (for compatiblity with other devices) would make community larger<p>But then it would just be another Google-phone, based on a Google-controlled codebase. We have enough of those phones and &quot;OSes&quot; already.<p>I respect the Pine64, PinePhone and the surrounding communities for trying to make an actual, real Linux-phone based on a real Linux base.<p>I even bought a PinePhone myself to play with. It&#x27;s definitely not there yet in terms a full replacement of my iPhone, but at the same time I can see all the pieces starting to come together: It&#x27;s a real phone, with an open bootloader, running <i>real</i> Linux (with systemd, PulseAudio, whatever your distro rolls with) and a custom shell made for touchscreen phones.<p>It&#x27;s just what it needs to be. It just lacks some polish, that&#x27;s all.<p>And the community feels really vibrant, akin to the early Linux hacker-scene you had back in the 90s, where everyone is trying to do their part to help deliver something new and different.<p>For better, it&#x27;s like a full deja back to those days. I love it!')
