This is called a straw-man logical fallacy, you misrepresent my argument so it makes it easier for you to attack. Nobody has said this to you, that part is all in your head.<p>I&#x27;m saying the tools are not weird if you understand them, and how they fit as a cohesive whole. I&#x27;m saying they just look weird to you, because you don&#x27;t yet understand them. Can we do better? Absolutely, I&#x27;m all for better tools. But if the original poster wants to install pip and ruby and nodejs then knowledge of system paths is mandatory - because this is what they are trying to do.<p>In my answers above, I have named several programming languages, several operating systems, discussed my commercial experience and then talked about the rationale behind my logic.<p>You have done nothing but turn these into personal attacks against yourself, not discussing systems or operating systems, (not even naming one!) but always complaining about people calling you stupid or how you&#x27;re the victim. The only person that has used the word stupid in this thread is you. You are a toxic narcissist, and I chose not to engage with you.')
