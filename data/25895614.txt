No one is asking for ownership to be disrupted, we want someone to disrupt terrible cars.  Modern cars are terrible, the UX is horrid, the software never gets updated, and the look and feel of a good middle class car is just trash.<p>I own a model 3 and love it, yes it has some gap problems, yes structurally it might not be as sound as a Toyota but the car is a dream to drive. The experience is so much better than an internal combustion engine that i&#x27;ll never go back. There&#x27;s nothing quite like instant torque on the freeway while traveling 80 miles an hour.')
