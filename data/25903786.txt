It&#x27;s based on a set of assumptions (around telecoms operators being trustworthy) that just never held true.<p>The problem is that it continues to be the lowest common denominator for a lot of the world to stay connected from a telecoms perspective.<p>Moving to newer protocols makes a lot of sense, but for much of the developing world I imagine they&#x27;ll continue to rely on legacy technologies like SS7 for some time to come, as they have that hardware in place etc.<p>The driver away from legacy equipment in the West will likely be the skills shortage as engineers retire and there&#x27;s a need to move to newer equipment that can be maintained and understood. There&#x27;s enough of a shortage of new talent, let alone new talent that understands the old telecoms world way of thinking.')
