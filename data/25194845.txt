Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=[25196312, 25195620], score=None, time=1606187219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194722, text='&gt; Everyone has the right to bear arms but what do we do when that infringes on other peoples right to life? I think it&#x27;s a cogent question.<p>Clearly the state has laws against murder. And California even has laws that &quot;enhance&quot; sentencing criteria for anyone guilty of using a firearm in the commission of a felony.[1] Also, &quot;mass shootings&quot; are also illegal and are incredibly rare.<p>Also, I have a right to &quot;property&quot;&#x2F;&quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; (per Fifth Amendment and the Declaration of Independence). In the Bay Area, if I leave my laptop in my trunk, it&#x27;ll be stolen. If you leave CA (or at least the Bay Area) and visit a state with slightly looser restrictions, laptops can peacefully spend a dinner in the trunk without being stolen. I have to imagine that criminals who know they have very little to fear from armed ordinary citizens are emboldened by the restrictions on firearm ownership. By the logic above, the correlation (note: I have no data other than the ubiquitous &quot;BRING YOUR LAPTOP INSIDE!!!&quot; signs all over the place in the Bay Area) must mean that the state is neglecting a right to property, therefore the fun restrictions should be relaxed. Or maybe using aggregate statistics and correlations isn&#x27;t the best approach to analyzing legal-political issues in the absence of a very strong signal.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=12022.5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;codes_displaySectio...</a>')
