I had to laugh. Other members of the show referred to &quot;remind me later&quot; as &quot;kill me later&quot;.<p>That evening, watching some movie online it suddenly stopped. I check and it is the same flash update. I guess Flash updates bring us together in a bonding experience.<p>A pity for the environment that enabled so many media experiments and animations. I won&#x27;t miss the memory leaks or the updates, though.')
