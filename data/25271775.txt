It&#x27;s generally step one of the hate on the MacBook playbook. &quot;Psssht if you buy a MacBook you&#x27;re living the dongle life.&quot;<p>And it&#x27;s just not been the case for me with the recent MacBook Pros. Like your experience, with past laptops I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;ve always had to carry around different adapters, regardless of whether the machine was Windows or Mac. No matter how many ports the vendor tries to shoe-horn into the laptop, they can never quite get them all in there, and so you end up with a dongle or series of dongles.<p>With the MacBook implementation of USB-C, I carry one small USB-C hub that gives me pretty much everything from ethernet to microSD. The infamous &quot;dongle book pro&quot; actually has made my life less dongle-y.<p>And that&#x27;s where I see the whole &quot;bag of dongles&quot; as a disingenuous line of attack from people who don&#x27;t actually use the machines for their real lives. In practice, it&#x27;s the least dongle-y laptop I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>(thanks for coming to my ted talk)')
