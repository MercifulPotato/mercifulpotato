But the situation is so unequal here that this &quot;arms race&quot; would be more akin to a checkmate in one. Imagine this arms race would force both Russia and the US to invest $100BN more annualy in nuclear weapons. That would be economically devastating for Russia (who has a current defense budget of about $65 BN), and it would barely register for the US, with a current defense spending of $700 BN.')
