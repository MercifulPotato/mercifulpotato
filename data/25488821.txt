It is embarrassing to have a bike trail in such pathetic shape, especially when it is a busy transportation corridor through a major local employer. As an added irony bonus, it’s within the city limits of a city that laughably claims to be the “bicycle capital of the Northwest”.<p>But we have asphalt left over to pave a gravel trail that parallels another paved path a half mile away (Willows Rd. and the Sammamish River trail). ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
