Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[25201404], score=None, time=1606234346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188395, text='Having read Christopher Alexander before encountering GoF, I am a little sympathetic to the GoF.<p>IMHO, the idea of patterns addresses two things: 1 - attacking the &quot;haystack&#x2F;spaghetti&quot; that most large systems tended to result in, by providing a vocabulary or standard set of metaphors that can be used to encourage rather than discourage some good practices; and 2 - provide a common meta-vocabulary for discussing design (sometimes those &quot;discussions&quot; are between a long gone programmer and someone that encounters the code later).<p>Of course what we got instead was fetishism and towers of factory classes emitting envelopes resulting code that was diffuse, incomprehensible, and that focused on things other than the actual problem at hand.  Despite my theoretical sympathies I stay far far away from the GoF.<p>This reminds me of the Agile movement: not that bad an idea for a technical management consulting team trying to solve a customer&#x27;s tactical problem.  But outside that domain only some bits and pieces make sense, and, depending on the domain, not always the same bits and pieces.  Again: fetishism took over.')
