Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608694776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25513956, text='I linked this in another reply, but the most common ads now are native ads[0]. The point of these is to not appear as ads. With this in mind I believe that you can say that shows like Top Gear are partially ads (obviously not all ad). But like I said before, most car ads aren&#x27;t actually trying to get you to buy their car. They are trying to get you to think a certain way about a brand (e.g. &quot;A Lexis!!!! WOW! HIGH CLASS!). This should be obvious (post hoc) when you realize that luxury car brands advertise a lot to the general public (Superbowl, prime time TV, etc) and not just to the rich (you can actually find a lot of literature on this). People don&#x27;t buy cars frequently and honestly when they do, they tend to do more research than most other purchases because it is one of the biggest expenses they&#x27;ll have. You can also question Coke advertising. They could never spend a single dollar on advertising and you&#x27;d still know about them. Cars and Coke are just the obvious examples of advertising not <i>just</i> being about awareness, but other things as well (other things depends on the market).<p>So what I&#x27;m trying to say is that you <i>think</i> you see 5 minutes of advertising but I&#x27;m fairly confident you see substantially more (and if not, you&#x27;re not just an outlier, but an extreme outlier). I&#x27;ll give another example: the link from this post not only contains several ads on its page, but is an ad itself([0]). And I want to re-emphasize that many memes you see are also ads (again falling under the native category).<p>Ads have changed a lot in the last decade and if you think ads are just popups, the things on the side of your screen, or what plays between your favorite show, then you&#x27;re not keeping up[1]. And more importantly, you have to think beyond products (I think this is our major disconnect).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Native_advertising" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Native_advertising</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guerrilla_marketing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guerrilla_marketing</a>')
