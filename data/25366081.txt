Ohio in 1969 limited the scope of banned speech to that which would be directed to and likely to incite imminent lawless action (e.g. a riot). This seems reasonable.<p>Consider a hypothetical with the current election and baseless claims of fraud. A month from now as Biden is sworn in, the drumbeat of fraud continues. There are now collectives of militia groups who claim they cannot &quot;stand by&quot; anymore and the election must be overturned or they will secede from the union. Trump decamps to Mar-a-lago and continues to claim he won. Then one day, local county governments in northern Texas band together and take the side of the militias, saying they will not recognize the current federal government until Trump is declared the winner. This action spreads like wild fire and triggers the same revolt in most rural areas of the country. Trump incites them and declares himself leader in exile. Most red county governments back the militias and declare they will not recognize the current government, as they have no choice at this point. We are now at civil war.<p>Is this scenario likely to happen? In the current state if disinformation and cult-like following of Trump supporters, I honestly think it is. Look at how Kyle Rittenhouse is now a hero of the right.<p>So at what point does disinformation reach the level of &quot;imminent lawless action&quot; and should not be protected speech? The government is weak and severely limited here. Any action against disinformation will immediately back fire. It will not happen.<p>But YouTube as a private company can. And I think they should. It is fair that they see this disinformation campaign as getting very close to &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; and are acting on this threat.')
