Putting citizens in misery is not how you treat a government, specially an Iranian one. You are just going against basic human rights, like not being able to import medicines or basic needs of people.<p>The only miserable person here is you, someone who claims to be Iranian and yet thinks giving access to private repositories on a platform is against his beliefs, let alone the way you talk about Iranian people also makes you disrespectful human being.<p>Your hatred against the government has nothing to do with Iranian people, so please, think twice before you post <i>anything</i> on the internet again, if you can&#x27;t handle a simple thing like this, aka human rights, then you must have issues on giving opinions on other topics as well.<p>Off-topic: seems like you&#x27;re one of those iranis who escaped the country for whatever the situation you were in and now you&#x27;ve got the tongue to speak out, so you start attacking on normal citizens because YOU think that YOU are better than them, there&#x27;s just too many of you, you&#x27;re not the only one.')
