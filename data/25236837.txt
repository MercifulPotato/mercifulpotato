The abstract should contain that, but might not. And nobody * reads the entire abstract anyway.<p>A clinician scanning a medical paper is looking for patient relevance: should they use the approach described? The statistical details are too intimidating, the preamble is irrelevant, they know the scope of the problem already.<p>This is not what &quot;should&quot; happen, but it is what actually happens.<p>The gap between published findings and clinical practice is several years. The peer review and publication process are way out of touch with clinical reality.<p>On top of this, people find articles using Google and read them on their phones. (In reality, they read summarised opinion pieces found via Google.)<p>A systematic reviewer may read papers in full. But even they scan papers for inclusion&#x2F;exclusion criteria first. The deeper the information is buried, the greater the risk of misclassification. I&#x27;m not suggesting that TLDRs will fix this, it&#x27;s just another data point in why we&#x27;re seeing TLDRs being created.<p>* &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;nobody&quot; here excludes researchers :)')
