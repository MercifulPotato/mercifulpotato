Some people who took zolpidem got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, sleep-walked, or were involved in other activities while not fully awake. After they woke up, these people were unable to remember what they had done. Tell your doctor if you have ever had an unusual sleep behavior while taking zolpidem. Be sure that your family or caregiver are aware that these symptoms are serious and to call your doctor if they occur. Stop taking zolpidem and call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else unusual while you were sleeping.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medlineplus.gov&#x2F;druginfo&#x2F;meds&#x2F;a693025.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medlineplus.gov&#x2F;druginfo&#x2F;meds&#x2F;a693025.html</a>')
