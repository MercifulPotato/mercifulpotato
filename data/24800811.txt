That will definitely help people that want to translate this into reading sheet music. And you may be right in that doing this enough will give you a sense of what keys make what sounds, which then can clue you into to how songs work &quot;under the hood&quot;.<p>Since you&#x27;re rendering the score in realtime, you could let users transpose songs up and down which would really help them learn scales.<p>Very nice project, though.')
