Amazon is bad enough with fake reviews and retailers that ship terrible products when advertising them as something better.<p>So it takes a lot to make me think something is worse and meaner to consumers than Amazon. But sure enough, Facebook is it. Their ads are about 60% complete scams, from what I can tell. I get all these ads for $200 Lego sets for $30! And there are hundreds of comments from people who have bought. Guarantee they all got 1 Lego brick in the mail 8 weeks later, and the site that sold it to them is gone.<p>This would be bad if it was an occasional thing, but most Facebook ads I see are EXACTLY like this. Bait and switch. They send you a thing so you can&#x27;t claim they didn&#x27;t send you anything, but Facebook is making bank off of these dishonest scammers and seems not only not to care, but to encourage it. Oh and the thing they send you is from China, so sending it back costs more than you spent.')
