You can (and I did) buy all the NOs in the Predictit electoral college market and get a guaranteed immediate return.<p>If you can buy n NOs for less than (n-1-0.1) on predictit you&#x27;ll make money net of fees.<p>The bigger issue is trader limits. I could only take $50 worth of arbitrage because I can only own $850 worth of shares in each bracket. They also limit markets to 5k traders (which most markets have hit at this point) so other arbitragers can&#x27;t come in and correct the prices.')
