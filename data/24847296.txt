The majority of particiapants in HN discussion generally people who work for startups and people who work with web technologies. The Silicon Valley culture might be focused around time to market, but there is a large (mostly unheard) group of people who exist in a very different culture. For example: C is still an <i>incredibly</i> popular language (for better or worse), but on HN you won&#x27;t hear much about it outside the Linux Kernel.<p>A lot of this enterprise software development suffers from some very different problems (the time to market thing brings benefits in terms of making productivity important) but also has benefits in terms of thinking about investments long term (when done well).')
