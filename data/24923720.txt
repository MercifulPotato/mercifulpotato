I&#x27;m so pleased to see this, it&#x27;s heartwarming and so powerful. Having our grandfather&#x27;s voice is priceless. Plus the stories we learned that otherwise would have remained with him!<p>Question: my friend would be perfect for this as a job for her, how might she go about applying?<p>As an aside could you also use it to write biographies? Biography-as-a-service I imagine might go down well..')
