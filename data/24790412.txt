AFAIK their solution was essentially to run a TLS proxy in front of redis, and I&#x27;m not sure what they did if anything about any replicated traffic.<p>However, as of v6 (released recently) TLS is builtin.<p>As I explained in the discussion thread for the 6.0 announcement, putting a proxy in front of Redis, for clients that support TLS is like 10% of the problem, when you&#x27;re using more than one instance. You end up creating a rats nest of tunnels and local port numbers, so that redis internal replication traffic, and internal sentinel traffic, and sentinel to redis traffic is all encrypted too.')
