Because it continues with:<p><i>&quot;You could conclude from this pair of assertions that the creator of shirky.com pronounces it &quot;shoiky.com.&quot; This, unlike assertions about my physical location, is false. It would be easy to shrug this error off as Garbage In, Garbage Out, but it isn&#x27;t so simple. The creator of shirky.com does live in Brooklyn, and some people who live in Brooklyn do speak with a Brooklyn accent, just not all of them (us).&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Each of those statements is true, in other words, but each is true in a different way. It is tempting to note that the second statement is a generalization that can only be understood in context, but that way madness lies. Any requirement that a given statement be cross-checked against a library of context-giving statements, which would have still further context, would doom the system to death by scale.&quot;</i><p>And it continues a bit more about generalities.<p>You can agree or disagree with that take, but your comment makes it sound like the author used this dodgy reasoning, which only appears like that because you lifted a very narrow part of the article and removed the context. It&#x27;s an extremely unfair characterisation you&#x27;re making here. You can make almost any article look bad by this.')
