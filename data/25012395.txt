Insurance cards have zero security on them anyways. There&#x27;s no standard format for paper cards as is is. All I have ever had is a piece of paper that I ran off on my printer, and it says &quot;EVIDENCE OF INSURANCE&quot; in Times New Roman and lists off a bunch of crap that the police can&#x27;t verify. Some states, having a card is pointless, because if you lose your policy, the state finds out and already has record of it.')
