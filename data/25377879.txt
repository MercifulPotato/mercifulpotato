One to screw in the light bulb and four to share the\n                  experience.  (Actually, Californians don&#x27;t screw in\n                  light bulbs, they screw in hot tubs.)\n  \n  Q:      How many Oregonians does it take to screw in a light bulb?\n  A:      Three.  One to screw in the light bulb and two to fend off all\n                  those Californians trying to share the experience.\n  %\n  Q:      How many mathematicians does it take to screw in a light bulb?\n  A:      One.

If you collapse on a street in New York, plan\n  to spend a few days there.\n                  -- From &quot;East vs. West: The War Between the Coasts\n  %\n  To a New Yorker, all Californians are blond, even the blacks.  There are,\n  in fact, whole neighborhoods that are zoned only for blond people.  The\n  only way to tell the difference between California and Sweden is that the\n  Swedes speak better English.&quot;\n                  -- From &quot;East vs. West: The War Between the Coasts</code></pre>')
