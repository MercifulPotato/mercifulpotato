One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that people are really bad at working towards high-level, nebulous goals like &quot;code quality, right abstractions, decoupling, cohesion&quot;. Keeping these goals in mind requires constant thought, analysis and decision making as each case is different and there&#x27;s no universal solution.<p>So people jump at simple, single-faceted goals like &quot;normalise the database&quot;, &quot;spin out microservices&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t use HTML tables&quot;, &quot;rewrite using Rust&quot; etc. These involve no further thought, no continuous evaluation of nebulous targets like quality, no keeping up with moving goals.<p>It explains quite a lot of problems with politics too. Choose from red or blue. No further thinking required. If even that&#x27;s too difficult, just pick the one your parents&#x2F;friends picked. Easy!')
