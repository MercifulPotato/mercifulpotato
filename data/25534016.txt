People fucking notice when they expect a 650 dollar bonus and it doesn&#x27;t come.  It&#x27;s not some arbitrary &quot;check out this cool link&quot; style email that an employee might click and then forget they&#x27;ve ever engaged with.<p>Not to mention that it caught nearly 10% of the fucking company - That&#x27;s an insanely high click through for any phishing test I&#x27;ve ever seen at a software company.  And I don&#x27;t even know if they sent it to all 7k employees (my guess is no).  So either GoDaddy has incredibly incompetent employees, or this looked fairly real (and the email does actually look pretty damn good for a phishing email - custom image, no spelling mistakes, internal domain, aware of different geos the company operates in)<p>So you pissed of 10% of your company with an email that wouldn&#x27;t ever be sent as a real scam (because a week later the employee is going to ask where the 650 bucks is and alarm bells will go off).<p>I don&#x27;t have the context of a Godaddy employee, so maybe there&#x27;s an obvious mistake in there, but general speaking - this was a dumb play by the security team.  It&#x27;s now also losing them goodwill in public.')
