To some people, absolutely, right?<p>How about someone mentioning a concert that they&#x27;ve gone to, for an artist that&#x27;s outspokenly political one way or another? Just a concert, right?<p>What about talking about a great movie or TV show, if those are, I don&#x27;t know, &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot; or &quot;Lovecraft Country&quot;?<p>Can you mention that you went to a gun show, or a shooting range?<p>Can you recommend a Jordan Peterson book?<p>Can you put an NRA logo on your car?<p>What about a BLM logo?<p>What about on your T-shirt?<p>If a coworker goes through a gender transition, how does that get handled in a way that <i>everyone,</i> across the board, considers apolitical? Good luck with that: the very act of transitioning is, to a significant portion of the population, itself political.<p>So, I mean, sure, not <i>literally</i> everything is political, but if you give the statement a bit more of a generous reading than &quot;Come on, are you saying <i>ice cream</i> is political? Harrumph!&quot;, you can see the point being made.<p>(Also, re: ice cream: what about Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s?)')
