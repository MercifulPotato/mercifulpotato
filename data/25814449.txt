Item(by='IgorPartola', descendants=None, kids=[25814512, 25816710, 25814508], score=None, time=1610914265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814344, text='For that size screen, yes. I think roughly $1-3&#x2F;screen for that size is good. That’s what a small OLED screen will run you at any kind of volume. For $20 I would want something on the order of 6x8”. For $35 a 20” diagonal panel.<p>Granted you linked to Adafruit which is wonderful for their educational resources and easy to use high quality components, but that’s not where I would source parts for a project unless they had something truly unique or I was buying it for a newbie who could use the support they provide (bought some Arduino stuff from them recently for my kids).')
