I don&#x27;t, sorry. To me this is similar to the 4K and 8K HDR TV craze. I don&#x27;t plan on ever owning an 80&quot; TV. At 30-40&quot; 1080p looks great to me. I don&#x27;t see giving a shit about this either. Most of the time I am near decent wifi. When I am not, I can always wait to download something huge (and really don&#x27;t have a need to download something huge on my phone).<p>Now if they could just work on the audio quality and latency over regular wire-line networks, that I would be interested in. LTE to LTE calls already sound great, so I think there are some upgrades to the wired side of things that are required (which the likes of Verizon never want to do because it is more expensive&#x2F;a lower margin business than wireless so they neglect it and regulators don&#x27;t hold their feet to the fire).')
