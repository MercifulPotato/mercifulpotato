If all the early vaccines pass trails we can start opening up the world in 6 months. If they is the only one we are more than a year away.<p>That said, all the deals are contingent on being effective. With this being 90% effective that sets a bar for the others. The FDA has previously said they need your vaccine to be 50% effective to approve it. However with this being 90% effective they are unlikely to approve one that is only 50% effective. Unlikely doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t: different allergic reactions; usefulness in different age groups; ability to ship to remote groups; difference in effectiveness to some minority: all are factors that may make some vaccine approved even if it is clearly the worse one to get overall.')
