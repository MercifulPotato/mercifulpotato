You pedal and the motor contributes some additional power until you reach a certain speed (typically 20mph in the US, 25kph in Europe). At this point the motor stops assisting and the rider is contributing 100% of the effort. If you stop pedalling the motor stops assisting, regardless of your speed.<p>In other words the motor will help you accelerate to 20mph but beyond that it&#x27;s just your legs pushing a heavy bike.')
