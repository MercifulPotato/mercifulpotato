But both of these, if you take the time to learn, are not very hard to understand. And once you do, everything else very straightforwardly and non-magically falls out from that. These two bits of magic also don&#x27;t have many caveats&#x2F;leaks, so in practice you usually don&#x27;t have to think about the way they&#x27;re implemented and can just work with the abstraction.<p>Compare this with frameworks like Aurelia that bring in piles of new, implicit, inscrutable abstractions in order to accomplish roughly the same thing. Sprawling magic, that you find yourself constantly tripping over left and right.')
