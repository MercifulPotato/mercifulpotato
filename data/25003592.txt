Or get some form of functioning public transit? Pretty pathetic.&quot;<p>SF resident for 15 years until I left.<p>I walked around and talked to homeless.  From the dozens I have talked with:<p>1.  They are not from SF.<p>2.  They were homeless somewhere else and it sucked.<p>3.  Pan handling cash is easy. $100+ a day.<p>4.  The SF programs kick ass. Suboxone clinics, Free cell phones, free bus passes, monthly stipends $$, even occasional housing<p>5.  The police do not hassle much, you can shoot up on the street no problem.<p>It is a system designed to create more homelessness.')
