We&#x27;ll know soon enough how much immunity it gives you, but it seems to give plenty for now.<p>But unless it wasn&#x27;t clear: I&#x27;m pissed at the massive amount of people saying they won&#x27;t take the vaccine because of conspiracy theories. Not even the HN can escape them, apparently. I literally just saw and commented on someone spouting one in this thread just 20 minutes into the thread. And I got downvoted for calling them out, even when they agreed and took it down.<p>And then thinking that this vaccine which has been properly trialed and not rushed is going to somehow be worse than, for example, 1 in 1000 people in the UK <i>already</i> dead. Seriously?<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m going to shame people.')
