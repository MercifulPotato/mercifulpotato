But if overworking people is generally a net loss in throughput (as a lot of studies seem to suggest), giving in to this temptation ought to be counterproductive and decrease the likelihood of meeting the deadline. Now of course it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to really persistently, and en-masse do stupid things that turn out to be highly counterproductive -- like seeing a doctor throughout most of human history. On the other hand, given that the practice seems to be both ubiquitous  and universally hated you&#x27;d think the first major game studio to figure this out would completely crush its competitors in no time. Since this hasn&#x27;t happened yet, it&#x27;s tempting to conclude it must provide some advantage.')
