I&#x27;ll admit though that my predictions on the next place they would start to monetize was not these videos. And I expect this action to see some litigation (basically Google restricts who can be a &#x27;partner&#x27; and forces you to allow them to monetize your video without compensation if you aren&#x27;t a partner, that is basically copyright infringement of the content creators content :-))<p>My guess had been they would start charging for access to Google Maps or &quot;more than 2 turn by turn directions per week&quot; would cost extra or something.')
