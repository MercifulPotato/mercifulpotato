Poor farmer has a lot to gain from this bill. They get supply of funds right from by muting seeds and fertilisers to having assured income. Just paint the “industrialist” as the monster and destroy away?<p>Do you miss out on the huge number of HN discussions talking about the damaging effects of monopolization by BigTech players?
