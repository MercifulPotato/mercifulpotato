It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to get them loaded (on an M1 Mac, getting an extension loaded will require 4 reboots and a journey through the recovery environment).<p>I&#x27;d say that within the next 2-3 macOS releases, kernel extension won&#x27;t be loaded at all any more and only user-space APIs will be available for third-parties (including drivers).<p>From a security perspective, this is a huge benefit to users of course, but I agree that at least for advanced users, the ability to patch the kernel at random would still be beneficial for some use-cases.')
