And that&#x27;s the problem, because it seems you didn&#x27;t realize that tests that involve checking how 15 APIs interact are indeed tests that check how different services are integrated.<p>Do you disagree with anything?<p>&gt; A single DB query is normally something that _can_ be trivially unit-tested.<p>Well, not really. You unit test the call to the repository, not the call to the DB. Calls to the DB are tested in integration tests. Think about it.<p>&gt; But if the DB query is split across half a dozen complex services,<p>Aren&#x27;t you trying to tests how half a dozen complex services integrate?<p>I mean, take a step back and read your own description of the problem. As soon as you talk about interacting  &quot;complex services&quot; is already a clear tell that you&#x27;re way beyond unit testing territory.<p>&gt; Which usually means slow iteration and no local testing.<p>No, not really. It still means you have to add unit tests that cover how your individual clients and repositories and business logic works under the expected scenarios of a distributed system, and after you pass all of those you check how your service interacts with other services in integration tests.')
