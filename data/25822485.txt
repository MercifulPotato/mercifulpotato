Let me try anyway :). Note, some of the bad impressions may come from the usual clued up recruiters who are trolling LinkedIn for keywords and then crank up the spam.<p>So what I expect from a role that&#x27;s commensurate with my experience (trying to avoid &quot;senior&quot; as that&#x27;s usually a pigeonhole):<p>- You tell me what you need to have built, I&#x27;ll figure out the how (architecture, design, technology) and when it&#x27;ll be done, based on the usual cost&#x2F;velocity&#x2F;quality constraints.<p>- I&#x27;ll work with, guide, mentor and lead a team of developers if the size of the project needs it. However, I&#x27;m technical first, so I&#x27;m not interested in roles that are management only. This generally seems to be the crux of the matter - not a lot of companies seem to have these roles.<p>- If you give me the responsibility to deliver X, I also need to have the authority to make it happen. Don&#x27;t ask me how I figured that out ;)<p>I can usually find roles that fit two out of three, but I don&#x27;t seem to be able to find something that matches all three. My current role probably rates as 2 1&#x2F;4 out of three,  and is definitely a good fit, but with very limited growth potential (aka I&#x27;m close taking as far as I can take it).')
