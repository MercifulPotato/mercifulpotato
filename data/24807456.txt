Does it present a machine that contains a BIOS?<p>A google search turns this up: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;funwithbits.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dissecting-the-rom-bios-shipped-with-qemu-for-fun&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;funwithbits.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dissecting-the-rom-bios-shipped-...</a><p>Which means that OSes still have BIOS support.<p>It&#x27;s not my area of expertise, but it seems like turtles all the way down.<p>BIOS may not have been the best example, but Linux itself or Minix may be a good one.  If 100 years from now there&#x27;s a new dominant OS, there&#x27;s probably going to still be UEFI with some legacy operating system booting it up ... Or something emulating UEFI, etc.')
