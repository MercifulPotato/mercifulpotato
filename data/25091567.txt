By building it on \npylons, you can almost entirely avoid the need to buy land by following \nalongside the mostly very straight California Interstate 5 highway, with only \nminor deviations when the highway makes a sharp turn.<p>The author seemed completely unaware that conventional rail can also use pylons, and can (and does) use prefabricated elements.<p>The whole white paper seemed terribly uninformed about the realities of high-speed rail.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img2.chinadaily.com.cn&#x2F;images&#x2F;201801&#x2F;02&#x2F;5a4b62cea31008cfb2e95604.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img2.chinadaily.com.cn&#x2F;images&#x2F;201801&#x2F;02&#x2F;5a4b62cea3100...</a>')
