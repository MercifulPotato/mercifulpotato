Firefox connects to it even with 0.0.0.0 in the hosts file and a flushed cache (you need to also clear firefox&#x27;s internal cache if you&#x27;re testing with it), so I&#x27;d assume that trustd could connect to the ocsp site as well.  I don&#x27;t think this will work without ensuring there is no IPv6 traffic on your network, or otherwise dumping both IPv4 and v6 packets to ocsp.apple.com.<p>Disable IPv6:\nsudo networksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi\n(where Wi-Fi is the name of the network service)')
