The difference for me is that we have an amazing office space, comfortable chairs, big desks and monitors and ample space. But, it&#x27;s open plan and extremely noisy, with interruptions being frequent. It&#x27;s not a space that allows deep work. I feel that 1 or 2 days in the office would make for a healthy harmony between work and life. We also really need to rethink working hours.')
