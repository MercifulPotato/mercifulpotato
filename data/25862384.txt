Policy about its proper use been see-sawing back and forth for a decade.<p>Starting about 10 years ago, just before it mattered to me, official policy decided to NOT screen using the PSA test.  The belief was that underinformed primary care docs were overreacting to a high PSA number and ordering too many biopsies which often led to &quot;unnecessary&quot; infections.  Of course, the right response was to do a better job of interpreting the test results, ideally to refer the results to a more expert urologist <i>before</i> doing a biopsy, not to cut back on the test.<p>Given its low cost ($50) and very high sensitivity, the PSA test provided a very valuable service that could be equalled by no other test.  Physical exam is often wrong, missing a large fraction of positive cases of cancer.  And biopsies introduce infection most often in older patients.  Younger ones can tolerate biopsy better, but were disallowed from PSA screening entirely due to this overprotective policy.<p>The right solution was clearly to interpret the PSA test results more judiciously by introducing more expertise prior to biopsy, knowing that PSA is overly sensitive for diagnosing cancer.  Fortunately the official policy has since been reversed, and PSA has returned to routine use -- now with inclusion of a second test or a urologist prior to biopsy.<p>The same blunder took place in mammographies at about the same time.  Too many false positives led to too many biopsies and thus routine screening with mammography was deemed unacceptable and it was deprecated as well.  Fortunately that overreaction has also ended.<p>Sensitive medical tests are essential.  Overreaction to possible misinterpretation of positive results by inexpert GPs is the problem, not the test itself.  I routinely thank the stars above that my GP was expert enough to know that.')
