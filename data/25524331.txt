Web seems to be about the only place it works seamlessly nowadays.<p>Also, if anyone in the Windows desktop team is here, please support SVG desktop backgrounds. Often my desktop is vector art and I’d like to skip the jpg middle man and get something that scales to all my monitors well by default. You were somehow weirdly on the right track with the Windows 8 start backgrounds fwiw.')
