(Is that true?) Or do they need the clean rooms, solvents, filtration, etc. to improve just as much with every jump in node size?<p>We are way past that already. Any external contamination, even one stray atom, can cause a defect in any reasonably modern lithography process. There are parts of chips where thicknesses are measured in &quot;monolayers&quot; -- that is, the thickness of the material in that position is one uniform layer of atoms.')
