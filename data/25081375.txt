Completely fucking pointless?<p>It never ceases to amaze me how easy it is to boil frogs, even if the frogs in question are high-IQ, technically sophisticated HN readers.<p>Right now, you can still circumvent DRM, because you can still buy something that&#x27;s approximately a general purpose computer (even if it will invariably already come with some remote-acessible hardware level spyware outside your control). But if current trends continue, this will not be the case by the end of the decade.<p>Also, preventing private individuals from receiving and distributing unauthorized copies is only one way in which DRM is useful to companies.')
