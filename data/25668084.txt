I watched them burn the streets of Chicago. They looted stores in the loop, twice. There are stores that are gone forever.<p>Nobody set the capitol on fire. The majority of protesters didn&#x27;t even enter the building. They damaged some property in a public building. They didn&#x27;t set a police station on fire.<p>There is absolutely no way you can compare what happened on the 6th to any BLM race riot. Was it wrong? absolutely. They should not have done it. But the left has burned and looted. Portland has been absolutely insane. A 14 year old black kid was killed in CHAZ by community police that shot up a white Jeep and then tried to get rid of all the evidences.<p>The Supreme Court dismissed the Texas lawsuit with three sentences. Three sentences!!! SCOTUS is the only venue for a state to challenge any other state.<p>People have lost faith in the system, not because of the orange man bad, but because the system if fucking broken. People are totally unwilling to even acknowledge the idea or concept that wide spread mail in ballot fraud happened, when it certainly did.')
