I&#x27;m a rather bad case of type 1 (classic manic depression) and high functioning. I wrote up a blog post about how I managed to spend my entire life hiding continuous psychosis.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kayode.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;4106&#x2F;living-with-psychosis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kayode.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;4106&#x2F;living-with-psychosis&#x2F;</a><p>Hiding is what I&#x27;ve always done. It&#x27;s exhausting having to appear normal all the time.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate to have understanding friends. Instead of me constantly bitching, we have code words for how I&#x27;m feeling. If I&#x27;m good, that makes I&#x27;m stable and relatively happy. If I&#x27;m okay, I&#x27;m probably depressed. It goes on from there. I&#x27;m able to talk about how I feel without getting into the details no one want to hear every day.<p>At work, I&#x27;m extremely fortunate to have a boss whose wife is bipolar. I&#x27;ve been able to get ADA accommodations that give me the flexibility and restrictions I need to go to work every week. This is the first job I&#x27;ve ever had this luxury.<p>And it really is a luxury. This is my first job where I&#x27;ve had any kind of accommodation. I&#x27;ve worked at places where I&#x27;ve pretended to have the flu just to take a day off for mental health.<p>Even now everyone, except my boss and friends, treats taking time off for mental health like vacations, because that&#x27;s the experience for them. I&#x27;ve used so much PTO, I never get a vacation. Instead, I&#x27;m always at home on days off, dealing with a hell that my coworkers have never come close to experiencing.<p>I could go on a lot longer because there is no limit to how many things I have to deal with. But no one really wants to read that and I don&#x27;t want to write it again.')
