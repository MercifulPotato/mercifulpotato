That means 100 IQ people. And then it was refined so the 85 IQ people could work most of it. I have no doubt that if you gave standardized IQ tests to every reader of Hacker News, you would not see much of an overlap with the bell curve of the American, or even world, population.<p>The people coming here are generally very technical, very smart (I&#x27;m defining this as at least one standard deviation above the norm, so 115 and higher IQs).<p>Most people aren&#x27;t going to build their own enormous media server from used enterprise gear. Most people aren&#x27;t going to build their own home surveillance system even though the hardware and open-source software out there exists. I could list another hundred projects for which we have specialized &quot;consumer-friendly&quot; devices.<p>Watch the YouTube video where Jordan Peterson talks about working with an 85 IQ individual and how it was a struggle for that person to consistently and accurately fold a <i>sheet of paper into thirds and put it into an envelope</i>. And now realize that for many of you, that&#x27;s someone for which you&#x27;re developing.')
