All dutch banks are connected and all webshops accept it (it&#x27;s hard to find a place to use your creditcard here). Transactions are instant and non-refundable. Costs are around 0.35 per transaction and NO % fees. Just a fixed amount per transaction. For big volumes, that per-transaction amount can be lower. It&#x27;s amazing and I wished they&#x27;d just roll that out worldwide. No risk for merchants at all.')
