Even if just to check where a given DNS record points to.<p>The problem is that an ipv6 address is not something you can pronounce, recognize at a glance, or remember. All of these are unfortunately still things one has to do, despite there being name servers. The (proposed) solution is to have a 1:1 algorithm that translates an ipv6 address into a value that a human can work with.<p>If I&#x27;m troubleshooting an issue on an ipv6 network, and my colleague asks me for the IP of a machine, I have no choice but to either text it to him, or painfully, tediously and error-pronely spell it out.')
