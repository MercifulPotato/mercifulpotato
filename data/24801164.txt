How does it affect those developers at all?<p>I guess I&#x27;m obliquely commenting that keeping the project small and in the hands of open-source developers, may be pointless. Otherwise, why agonize over what others are doing with it? Either we want others to use the open-source version too so its a popular desktop with lots of attention, or we don&#x27;t and becoming a popular desktop with lots of attention doesn&#x27;t affect those open-source die-hards at all. Either way, a successful project becomes popular on a lot of desktops.')
