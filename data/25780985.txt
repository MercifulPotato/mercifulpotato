There&#x27;s a lot of misconceptions about testosterone and how it can be used to benefit lots of men.  If you go into any doctor and they have tour testosterone tested, they probably won&#x27;t give you TRT unless your T is below the low-bound of &quot;normal&quot;, but being on the low-bound means you&#x27;re not at your optimal.  There&#x27;s also lots of scare material about TRT out there for people who don&#x27;t want to body build; supposedly you&#x27;re guaranteed to have cardiovascular issues, shrunken testicles, &#x27;roid rage, and so forth.  If you keep your T at its optimal level but not going significantly past that, the chances of serious issues are minimal.<p>TRT aside, young people need to get their vitamin D, get exercise, eat little to no refined sugar, filter their water, and be allowed to co-mingle; when males and females are separated for long periods of time, testosterone decreases even more.')
