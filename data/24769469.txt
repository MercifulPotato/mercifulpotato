It takes <i>one</i> to talk, and the whole organization is at risk.<p>Online &quot;reputation management&quot; is easy work, it&#x27;s a very grey area, and it would take a lot of investigation to reveal that someone has actually been targeted and attacked.<p>But take medication sellers, the covers are great, but it only takes one customer to brag about it and then it&#x27;s a matter of time until you&#x27;re done.
