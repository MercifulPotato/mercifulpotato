Probably not, even though she was wrong and a terrible person for saying that.<p>The law is very specific when it comes to free speech. You need specific calls to violence and Trump did not come anywhere near close to that here.<p>He&#x27;s asking people to fight because the courts have refused to even hear testimony. Texas brought a lawsuit and was dismissed in three sentences for not having standing, in the only court legally allowed to decide cases between states.<p>If you still deny any and all election irregularity after all the videos and all the dead people voting and all the questionable information, that is part of the problem.
