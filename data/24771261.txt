There aren&#x27;t many places where software engineers are unemployed.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that there are places where people are paid much less because there&#x27;s so little demand for labor there- if you&#x27;re the only employer of software developers in 100 miles, you can pay a pittance. And at the same time, places like Silicon Valley pay a premium for labor because there&#x27;s a shortage (let&#x27;s not discuss the reasons around that- I don&#x27;t feel the need to drink).<p>When the market is merged, it will be leveled. And I cannot imagine those who stay in San Francisco are going to benefit. But the brilliant developer who has been paid terribly at a small software firm in the middle of no where, who can&#x27;t leave for other reasons, that developer is going to see their fortune changed for the better.')
