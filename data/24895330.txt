They didn&#x27;t say that single header libraries are wrong per se, but that it&#x27;s bad practice to not declare functions in headers as inline, because it can cause accidental code duplication.<p>EDIT: I see now that this advice is only valid for C++, where the &quot;inline&quot; keyword creates a weak symbol. I forgot that this doesn&#x27;t work in C.<p>Anyway, the #define trick is only necessary for C, in C++ you would simply declare all functions as &quot;inline&quot; (which automatically happens for function templates, btw)')
