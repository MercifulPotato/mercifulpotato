I prefer to not press my keyboard every single time i need to speak, because otherwise i would be pressing my keyboard all the time.<p>Edit: everyone suggesting me to use my mouse: i use a laptop without a mouse and sit on my sofa while in meetings. I prefer to unmute myself while there’s a discussion where I’m part of and mute myself when I’m not talking anymore. Push to talk every 10 seconds for 10 minutes is much more inconvenient than just having the mic on all the time.<p>Note that I do not work as a programmer.')
