So why do people prefer saying &quot;calories in, calories out&quot; instead of &quot;atoms in, atoms out&quot;?<p>That&#x27;s because &quot;calories in, calories out&quot; implies that there is an easy solution to being fat... you simply need to &quot;out&quot; more calories, while you &quot;in&quot; less calories, duh!<p>Which conveniently ignores all possible problems with trying to &quot;in&quot; less calories and &quot;out&quot; more of them. For example, that your metabolism can make you feel extremely tired, even pass out, if you don&#x27;t &quot;in&quot; enough calories. Similarly, to &quot;out&quot; more calories you sometimes need more than sheer willpower; your muscles have to cooperate, and sometimes they will only if you &quot;in&quot; enough calories.')
