An interesting way seeing ideology at work is when people start framing <i>policy choice</i> as the natural state of things.<p>To what degree gig work permeates the economy is entirely in the hands of the lawmakers of California, and if they care about the long term accumulation of human capital they better nip it in the bud right now.<p>I completely and entirely disagree with the idea that taxpayers are supposed to be on the hook for ever increasing benefits.
