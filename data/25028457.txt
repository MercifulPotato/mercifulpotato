But they can perhaps be fixed by effectuating a challenge-period after a patent application starts, whereby the patent can be invalidated if someone comes up with an implementation. Also there should be better protection against trolling, for example by requiring the holder of the patent to have a product implementing that patent. Further, a patent should not provide a strict monopoly on the technology for a given period (blocking competitors), but the rules should be so that anyone can buy a license for a reasonable price.')
