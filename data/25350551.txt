There are some people selling handmade goods, for sure, but there&#x27;s a low signal to noise ratio if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re trying to tune into.<p>It&#x27;s just become another avenue for drop shippers, and it seems like Etsy is happy to look the other way &amp; continue with their false marketing, as long as they get their cut.')
