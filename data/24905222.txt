I made it my primary editor for about 6 months, which forced me to become familiar with it.<p>Now I&#x27;ve dropped it and I&#x27;m back to vscode and Roam as my life management system. Maybe the time I gave it was too short, but I didn&#x27;t feel like org-mode or emacs made me more productive - the opposite. I spent so much time fiddling with configuration options, trying to understand elisp, finding the right emacs&#x2F;org-mode packages, and so on. Yeah, these things <i>felt</i> productive, but in the end they were are a waste of time that got in the way of getting work done. Also, let&#x27;s not talk about the time where emacs just crashed and lost several hours of work. Apparently the default config (I used Doom) didn&#x27;t think it was important to handle that case.<p>Perhaps things are different once you&#x27;ve use Emacs for 5+ years and are intimately with its ecosystem and packages. So, if you decide to go that route, it&#x27;s a long-term investment. Don&#x27;t expect any productivity gains soon.<p>And honestly, even after using org-mode for 6 months for pretty much everything in my life, I didn&#x27;t think it was that great. Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think it quite lives up to the religious hype it gets from some users. People are going to downvote me for saying this, but IMO org-mode is a pretty neat but outdated piece of technology with most of its following coming from people who grew up with it and have used it for 10+ years. The power comes from their familiarity with it, not from org-mode itself. It&#x27;s not that great.')
