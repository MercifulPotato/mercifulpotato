Could he have moved back in with his parents? Could he have gotten a second job (at McDonald&#x27;s or something?) I&#x27;m not suggesting that these would be good, or easy options, only that homelessness was not a forgone conclusion. This comic is only one man&#x27;s personal story, and it does not necessarily coincide with the general demographic and economic trends of the time. ie, it&#x27;s not clear that his story speaks about the particular hardships of one age compared to the hardships of another.')
