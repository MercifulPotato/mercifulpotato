Who out there is using 20+ AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP products to back a single business app and is having a fantastic time of it?</i><p>Netflix uses a lot of AWS higher-level services beyond the basics of EC2 + S3.  Netflix definitely doesn&#x27;t restrict its use of AWS to only be a &quot;dumb data center&quot;.  Across various tech presentations by Netflix engineers, I count at least 17 AWS services they use.<p>+ EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, EMR, ELB, Redshift, Lambda, Kinesis, VPC, Route 53, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, SQS, SES, ECS, SimpleDB, &lt;probably many more&gt;.<p>I think we can assume they use 20+ AWS services.')
