Whoever gain the majority&#x2F;power is the winner.<p>&gt; Unless facebook taking sides, i don&#x27;t think it harm democracy. Both side too can utilize facebook for their advantage.<p>The problem is, for the most part, there&#x27;s harm to democracy if no compromise is ever reached, and the &quot;fight&quot; on every issue becomes constant and intractable.<p>For instance, the fight around the response to COVID has pretty thoroughly undermined the response to it.  You have people refusing to wear masks for the most part to just to say &quot;fuck you&quot; to the other side.<p>This kind of over-the-top fractiousness is a clear propaganda win for authoritarianism.  China, for instance, is pretty effectively using it (and their corresponding success) to reduce the appeal of democracy among its people.')
