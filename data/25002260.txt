The nature of cities is constant change. Meanwhile the activists are desperately trying to keep change to a minimum so that the character of neighborhoods never changes. It&#x27;s an interesting dichotomy.<p>&gt;because rents have gone up so much, and also it&#x27;s just not as fun, it&#x27;s crowded and stressed.<p>Rents will drop if you increase density ... but that would mean building higher density housing and thereby accepting that the character of cities and neighborhoods change.<p>&gt;I am aware that I am a part of the problem: my wife and I are white, yuppie, dink tech workers. :)<p>The fact that you&#x27;re white and a tech worker isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s that you had the opportunity to move to San Fransciso for work due to the tech boom, and now you&#x27;re trying to pull the ladder up so others cannot do the same.')
