Partly that&#x27;s why my static site is based on Hylia (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hankchizljaw&#x2F;hylia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hankchizljaw&#x2F;hylia</a>), because it has Webmentions in its roadmap. Alas! Nobody ever implemented it, and now Hylia is archived!<p>I don&#x27;t have the knowledge of JavaScript to implement webmentions in Hylia all by myself (I&#x27;m more of a PHP developer). I could still try, but it&#x27;d take quite some time, which I don&#x27;t have (I&#x27;d rather employ it on my actual project)')
