You don&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; in evolution or the big bang or an old earth. Scientific inquiry 101.<p>And sure, I get your overall point. I was Christian until age 26. I worked two years as a missionary in a foreign country, 90hr weeks, no pay, for my Christian beliefs. What &quot;God&quot; meant to everyone I encountered throughout that time, before, and after, is&#x2F;was always a bit different. Ultimately we create our own personal God, and what that means can be compatible with honest and rigorous scientific inquiry. But you have to throw out large portions of the bible and accept that it&#x27;s largely a work of art and useful fiction, and I will place $1000 down on a bet that the vast majority of &quot;Christians&quot; would bristle at such ideas.<p>But yeah, best to stay away from discussions of religion with anyone except your closest friends. Even then it&#x27;s usually ill advised unless you have hours to sift through the nuance and are very good communicators.')
