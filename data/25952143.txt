Item(by='IG_Semmelweiss', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611882284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951040, text='You will find that your statements are easily flipped if you are truly honest in looking for answers.<p>My intention is not to paint with a wide brush, just to demonstrate that everyone has beliefs, and they manifest in different ways.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#x27;t go to a building and dance and sing to my belief of no diety.   ( I believe seculars call it a rave.)<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not go and seek out others who believe in the lack of a diety to associate and grow together. (any number of activities can fall in this category in fact)<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#x27;t go on to claim wars over the land holy to my belief of no diety.  (I believe are referring to Bush&#x2F;Obama nation-building)<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t go on to terrorize my children and tell them they are unloved because they&#x27;re born in a way that offends my belief in the lack of a diety.  (I believe you are referring to the secular terrorism, that is human-to-human, i.e. calling others &quot;Deplorables&quot; )<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#x27;t go on to terrorize my neighbors and tell them they are unloved because they offend my belief in the lack of a diety. (see above)<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#x27;t go to other people who have different beliefs and tell them they are wrong due to their belief in a diety. And that my belief is the only way they can be saved. (I believe there is no need to say X is wrong when instead they resort to shut them up #cancelculture)<p>Atheism is not a religion, but it is a belief system like any other.  It may appeal to logical people, but that doesn&#x27;t make it better or worse. Its just a different way to perceive the world around you.')
