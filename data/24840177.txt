Pointless semantics.<p>The reason they should be considered unemployed is contextual. &quot;Unemployment&quot; is <i>the</i> measure used by journalists &amp; politicians to gauge the labour market. In <i>that</i> context, it is very important to consider these people who have stopped expecting to work unemployed. They are part of the &quot;slack.&quot; Their experience experience of the labour market is &quot;i can&#x27;t get a job.&quot;<p>If unemployment is lower than it was in year X because people stop applying or qualifying for some unemployment benefit... that doesn&#x27;t mean the labour market is better.<p>Everything is contextual. People arguing for alternative unemployment measures aren&#x27;t (generally) arguing semantics. Their arguing that the metric is misleading us.')
