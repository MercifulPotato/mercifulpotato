Here&#x27;s how it works: spacetime is 4-dimensional, and a vector in spacetime is <i>always</i> c units long.  You can restrict your travel solely to X, Y, Z, or time if you like.  If you do that, the other three components are going to be zero.<p>Photons put it all into the X, Y, and Z components, leaving nothing for the t component.  They experience a change of position in space, but not in time.  What&#x27;s so hard to grasp about this?<p><i>Another point is that if this concept were actually scientifically useful, somebody would be using it in a textbook or peer-reviewed paper.</i><p>Seems that a fellow named Maxwell got a lot of mileage out of the concept, even if he didn&#x27;t know what was really going on.')
