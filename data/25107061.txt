Actually, it is arguably more problematic because it doesn&#x27;t have any compelling features that it does better than other world-scale maps.<p>The best world-scale maps are going to be along the lines of the Robinson projection, where you give up on trying to pretend that the world atlas is a rectangle. You&#x27;re going to be screwed any way you go about it. Cylindrical map projections suck at large scales, because one of the directions is being stretched way too much. Conic map projections are good at intermediate scales (state-to-continent size), but when you expand the map to large sizes, the distortions at the edges become too great to bear.<p>The Gall-Peters projection is an equal-area map, but it goes about this in an especially annoying way. The areas near the equator are made excessively tall and skinny, and near the poles, they are excessively short and wide. And it turns out that human beings are really not good at comparing sizes of rectangles that have drastic aspect ratios in different orientations. The spaghettification of countries doesn&#x27;t lend itself to a visually pleasing map, and it really obfuscates useful tidbits such as &quot;Maine is closer to Africa than any other US state&quot;, which is pretty clear in virtually every other world map. To top it off, it was presented to a cartographic conference as the map that&#x27;s better than Mercator at a time when all cartographers were already using non-Mercator maps and complaining about lay people relying on Mercator maps for world projections.')
