So county leaders get on Atlanta committees and vica versa. People don&#x27;t understand how ingrained the idea of padding paychecks of themselves, friends, and family, that politicians have turned the system into. government has more than enough money to solve problems but the problem they set about solving was how to enrich themselves, their friends, their supporters, and other party members.<p>In Georgia tax commissioners have in law the right to sell their services to cities on top of what they are providing by their job title!<p>The number of political appointment if not elected jobs that pay over 100k is ridiculous and many pay a quarter a million or more per year. Worse this all factors into their public pensions and many can take them before 50.')
