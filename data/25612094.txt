Item(by='m-ou-se', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609587377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25611376, text='`T: &#x27;a` means that you <i>may</i> keep values of type T around for lifetime &#x27;a, but not that they <i>will</i>. So `T: &#x27;static` means that you may keep values of that type around forever, as they do not refer to anything that doesn&#x27;t live forever.<p>So neither `&amp;&#x27;a i32` nor `MutexGuard&lt;&#x27;a, i32&gt;` are &#x27;static (unless &#x27;a is), because you shouldn&#x27;t keep references like that around longer than the stuff it points to. But i32 by itself satisfies i32: &#x27;static, because it&#x27;s perfectly fine to keep an i32 around forever. (But that doesn&#x27;t mean that every i32 will stick around forever.)')
