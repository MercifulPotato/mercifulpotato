There are industries [<i>cough</i>] where (for a good number of jurisdictions) you MUST have the pentests and other audit-like engagements conducted by a specially approved operator. Think of a royal charter.<p>These operators have no incentive to invest in proper skills. So they don&#x27;t. They can charge almost anything they like. And sure enough, they do.<p>In an industry with such massive vendor lock-ins and regulatory capture regimes, organisationally you get to shovel a lot of money for sub-par pentests. The appetite to have yet another one, even from a known-good and reasonably priced provider, is quite hard to come by. After all, these approved providers will <i>REFUSE</i> to even look at a third-party pentest report, let alone let one guide their own testing.<p>So in aggregate the existence of these approved providers and their level of competence degrades the security posture of entire business domains.<p>Macchiavelli would have been proud.')
