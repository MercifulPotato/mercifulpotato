Many Americans are constantly eating when they&#x27;re at home, either mindlessly snacking or eating a huge meal. Given that you only have 8 hours between work and sleep, occupying yourself for 1 of those hours could mean a significant decrease in time spent eating.<p>Incidentally, this is why intermittent fasting works well for some people.')
