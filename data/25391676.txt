It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in an age and fitness bracket where I&#x27;m unlikely to be in serious danger from becoming infected, and a lifestyle bracket where I&#x27;m unlikely to be infected at all. I expect supply will be limited at first, so someone staring down a lot more risk than I am should get it.<p>That&#x27;s my situation too, but I voted yes under the assumption that I won&#x27;t be allowed to take it until all the higher risks groups have gotten it.<p>But I&#x27;m in America and assumed in January&#x2F;February that we&#x27;d handle this pandemic <i>far</i> better than we actually did.  So maybe I&#x27;ll be unpleasantly surprised <i>again</i> to find the first doses allocated by some corruptly shortsighted system like an auction.')
