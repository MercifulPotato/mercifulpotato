This is driving traffic to media websites?<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for Google surfacing the content, unless the user was a daily reader of that specific media outlet that user would never of visited that media outlet to view the article.<p>I get it if one media outlet is ranked higher than another media outlet that can&#x2F;may be unfair and some transparency on how news search results are ranked may help, it may also do the reverse if you no the rank algorithm you can game it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how making Google pay to show a link to a news story helps though other than Murdoch trying to prop up there news properties that look to have reduced readership.<p>Have I missed anything or miss-understood the problem?')
