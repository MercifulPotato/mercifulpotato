But the are the only console&#x2F;gaming company that keeps thinking outside the box.<p>Sony and MS: let&#x27;s build a gaming PC and just have a different enclosure for it.<p>Nintendo: what if we try &lt;any number of crazy and interesting ideas&gt;.<p>Also: a few days ago a friend of mine got stuck with shitty mobile internet for e few days.

Everything else (phones, consoles, readers etc.) just couldn&#x27;t imagine a world without an internet connection and would suffer when connectivity was bad&#x2F;intermittent.')
