This would also contribute to the supply-demand curve biasing to 3.5&quot; (on top of the ubiquity argument)<p>3.5&quot; have a more durable design - the hard plastic, the spring loaded shield and, most importantly, the center disk that rested on the enclosure housing that prevented the magnetic medium from sagging.<p>When 5.25&quot; disks are stored on end, they sag over time causing them to physically be unreadable. You have to store them flat. 3.5&quot; are (mostly) resistant to this sag and therefore will be more likely to survive long term.')
