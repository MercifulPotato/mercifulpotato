Item(by='padseeker', descendants=None, kids=[24701009], score=None, time=1602002934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698449, text='I work for a sizable consulting firm with multiple offices including one in Chicago. We saw a lull during the early months (april-june) of Covid&#x2F;quarantine, we froze hiring, and a few projects were cancelled (one was a major airline). We had a heavier bench for a short time, and utilization fell 10-20%.<p>That lull is over, at least in Chicago, and not just our office. We have almost no bench, utilization is reaching 100% for at least tech centric practices, and we&#x27;re hiring again. Front end, back end, devops, salesforce implementation and integration, you name it, demand is exceeding supply for resources available.<p>On one hand it&#x27;s comforting to have job security. But it&#x27;s also surreal to hear reports about 13% unemployment. These are strange times. It does feel like anyone in the tech profession that we are insulated from the worst effects of this catastrophe. Most of us can easily do our jobs remotely. My brother and his girlfriend are both chefs living together in Chicago. Enhanced unemployment benefits expired in July and their lease ended in August so they both moved back in with their parents. I know what is happening out there but at times I feel like we live in a bubble.')
