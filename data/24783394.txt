He said, in his first year, he wanted to stated to take NBC off the air[1]. It&#x27;s a message that he&#x27;s been saying since before he took office. Understandably, taking a billion dollar corporation off the air is a lot more difficult than wiping an anonymous poster online, but to imply that &quot;Fake News&quot; is entirely just criticism is just complete ignorance of what the man has been saying for years.<p>&gt;<i>I&#x27;m not taking the side of Trump or anyone at all by saying that criticism is different than censorship, that&#x27;s just a fact. Your argument is not in good faith if bringing that up to you is considered an implicit support for Trump, or anyone really.</i><p>If someone says <i>the only people screaming for censorship are firmly on the left</i>, how am I supposed to argue that point without focusing on Trump?<p>I&#x27;m not bringing this up because I want you to vote Biden or not vote for Trump, but to dispel this notion that &quot;censorship&quot; is exclusively some far left&#x2F;right tool of oppression. My personal view is that these platform should do whatever they want, just like how HN mods run Hn the way they feel, and no private platform is &quot;obliged&quot; to give you a platform no matter how large they are. Regardless the _government_ should be limited in power to tell private companies in what they should and should not publish. To this day, there has been no _US government_ pressure to &quot;censor&quot; legal political posts - it&#x27;s been entirely private actors who have taken censorship action. However to suggest that one side is 100% free speech and the other side are coming to take your &quot;free speech&quot; is misrepresenting what both sides.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-politics&#x2F;trump-nbc-license-ban-tweet-cnn-shut-down-fake-news-threat-latest-a7994861.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-politic...</a>')
