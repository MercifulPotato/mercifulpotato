The main concern here is national security, instead of showing off their regulation power (which is an aspect these tech giants always try to conceal).<p>The narrative in the article such as &quot;how they just used their unconstrained power to utterly destroy a rising competitor&quot; looks absurd to me. The competitors of parler Is Facebook, Twitter, i.e. social media platforms, NOT Google, Amazon, and Apple.<p>It feels like the author deliberately misused these kinds of association to trigger irrelevant focus.')
