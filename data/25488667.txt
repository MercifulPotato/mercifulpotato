For example, if you ever make it to Japan, you&#x27;ll see there are thousands of stores specializing in papers, pens, and other desk accessories that the SV bubble thinks are no longer useful.<p>My wife has a network of friends that she&#x27;s met over the years from France to Hong Kong who all write to each other on actual paper.  Either on antique typewriters (like my wife), or hand-written letters.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve learned that as more and more people are realizing that social media is a farce and are giving up on it, they&#x27;re going back to the old ways of communicating that still work.<p>Because of that, you can&#x27;t even buy a quality typewriter (not a Chinese replica) for under $500.')
