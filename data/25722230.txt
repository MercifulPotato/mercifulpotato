Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610324622, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721879, text='&gt; Most legal systems have concepts of being an accomplice, criminal negligence, constructive possession and so on. So it seems reasonable that a website which help crimes be committed or hosts illegal content on its servers should have some liability or requirements on taking reasonable preventive measures.<p>That doesn&#x27;t follow at all. If you get on a Greyhound bus with the intent to get to a place to commit a sex crime, Greyhound would &quot;help crimes be committed&quot; by carrying you to your destination, but they&#x27;re not the police and it&#x27;s not their job to investigate you before allowing you to travel.<p>&gt; Especially if the website is made aware that such crimes are being committed.<p>There are two different versions of &quot;made aware&quot; here.<p>One is that a court has decided that something is illegal and ordered them to take it down. I have a hard time believing that they don&#x27;t comply with that.<p>Two is that somebody <i>claims</i> that something is illegal, but the website is neither judge nor jury and has no competence to adjudicate the claim. In this case it&#x27;s not at all unreasonable to refer you to the actual court system, which will bring you back to number one.<p>The fact is that all of these alternatives are designed to be an end run around the constitutional protection of speech, by foisting the messy process of determining what&#x27;s illegal onto a platform that can claim it isn&#x27;t subject to the First Amendment, instead of a government body that is. Even though it&#x27;s a government penalty being imposed for not removing what is, in practice, a body of works some of which are lawful speech.')
