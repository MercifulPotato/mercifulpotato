I sympathize with the author&#x27;s complaints with respect to the difficulty of cleaning it, though mine just doesn&#x27;t need cleaning very often.  And the wick DOES get moldy if you let it sit in wet water for weeks on end.<p>But her other complaints puzzle me:<p>I don&#x27;t find it to be messy to refill.  What is she doing wrong?<p>It&#x27;s even more baffling that she thinks it &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.  I mean, she refills the tank every night, so we know the water is  disappearing from the tank... where does she think the water is going? Isn&#x27;t that proof enough that it does, in fact work?')
