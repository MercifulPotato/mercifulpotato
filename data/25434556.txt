Milk substitutes also tend to be really really high in vegetable oils that seem to at least have a troubling correlation with chronic disease.<p>The metrics used for the environmental impact of intensive animal husbandry tend too skew towards the worst case (obese cows on a grain fed diet in a feedlot). There are plenty of dairy farms raising cows with a more sustainable grass-based diet that doesn&#x27;t release nearly as much methane (Think how gassey you&#x27;d be if the only thing you ate was ice-cream?)<p>I like supporting my local dairy farmers, more than I enjoy supporting some multi-national milk-substitute beverage company with a supply chain spanning the globe.')
