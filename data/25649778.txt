I always use &quot;halftoning&quot; and &quot;dithering&quot; interchangeably.  Yet, notice that today&#x27;s printers are often matrix-based, i.e., like a high-resolution binary screen, with a bit of ink smearing depending on the type of paper&#x2F;plastic.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve always assumed were hand-drawn by an artist.<p>Maybe some are still drawn by hand, but most printed stuff is at some point dithered automatically (and a lot of critical information can be embedded on the dithering patterns).')
