Quarters are hard in metric as 4 is not a factor of 10. Which is why imperial systems are often base 12 (gives you 3 and 4 as a factor). circles are base 360 so that you get factors form 2 all the way to 12.<p>How much this matters is open to debate, but base 10 is clearly a terrible thing in this. It might be a good compromise, but I am not sure.')
