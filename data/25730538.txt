Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=[25731059], score=None, time=1610380302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729784, text='&gt;When repair labor costs more than automated production, then it&#x27;s cheaper to replace whole units than mend parts<p>We&#x27;re not there yet. There are profitable businesses that can do repair and&#x2F;or replacement of broken soldered IC chips in laptops and smartphones (see YouTube channels of Jessa Jones and Louis Rossmann). So cost of repair is not a barrier in many cases.<p>The problems they highlight, that should be very easy to fix through regulation, is lack of access to technical manuals, lack of access to diagnostic equipment and tech giants (like Apple) bullying their suppliers to prevent sale of replacement parts to independent repair shops.')
