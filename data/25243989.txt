At some point I was the only engineer in the company! I can still perfectly recall dating back 15 years how each product was tested and what the issues were. Am always on the lab floor when tests are administered, doing the setup work myself and sometimes fixing the issues as they arise. In the teams, all electronic designs are reviewed and signed off by me.<p>Hate to be blunt, but if you can&#x27;t push your product past the baseline EMC tests (like 47 CFR 15b or EN55032), your designs have no business being out there in the wild.')
