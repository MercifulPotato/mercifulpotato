People tend to abuse things like slack. Sure YOU want your issue&#x2F;idea addressed immediately, generally I don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to handle issues immediately and tend to queue them up and I&#x27;ll get back with the person. I am a very focused person and constant interruptions turn me off, so I turn slack notifications off and kind of treat it like email as well and check every few hours unless I&#x27;m working with someone on something in the NOW.')
