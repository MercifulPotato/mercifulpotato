That&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> number of nukes, the world does not have nearly as much nukes now, and even less so for the smaller powers (90% of all nukes are held by USA and Russia).<p>India and Pakistan together have ~300 warheads; if India and Pakistan blow all their nukes, that&#x27;s comparable to something like two years worth of nuclear weapons testing back in the 1960s, and the 1960s tests were nowhere close to triggering a worldwide famine.')
