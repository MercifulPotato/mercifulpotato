Item(by='jfim', descendants=None, kids=[25409403], score=None, time=1607886784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25408893, text='&gt; It&#x27;s hard to argue that tariffs on goods from China don&#x27;t make it less attractive to buy goods from China.<p>It&#x27;s true that tariffs will make buying goods from China less appealing, but if you look at the outcome, it&#x27;s not really a win. Consumers are paying more for the same goods, companies are scrambling to move their production to India and Malaysia, and there&#x27;s not a significant increase in US manufacturing.<p>A properly executed initiative to increase US-based manufacturing would address all of the factors necessary to restart manufacturing:<p>- Not only tax cuts, but subsidies and investment aimed at increasing manufacturing in specific industries<p>- A concerted program to identify labor and skills shortages, and address them<p>- A program to identify the missing parts of manufacturing ecosystems and address them. One reason why electronics are made in China is not only cheap labor, but access to a whole ecosystem of suppliers and other manufacturers. Need one million PCBs assembled, plastic casings made, half a million cardboard boxes printed, instruction manuals printed and bound, well, there&#x27;s a whole ecosystem of partners ready to get all of these things done with the capacity to have a relatively short turnaround time.<p>- A clear bipartisan commitment that this is something that won&#x27;t get deprioritized or axed one or two administrations later, but something that is of national interest and that both parties agree to push forward<p>- A national focus on a key differentiator from other countries&#x27; manufacturing. China has cheap, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany have good, the US has big and sturdy maybe?<p>- Tariffs to protect newly formed manufacturing businesses, but only in conjunction with all of the above<p>This is what a solid plan for restarting US manufacturing would look like.')
