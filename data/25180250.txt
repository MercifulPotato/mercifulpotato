Someday when our fiber internet arrives, we&#x27;ll also look back and wonder why did we ever need to debate net neutrality.<p>Well it&#x27;s kind of the same thing with university admissions.  The problem that we&#x27;ve encountered is that the number of elite schools and admissions spots (established largely for the population of the post war growth economy) has not grown in proportion to the population.  1600 kids per freshman class has been the same for 30 years.  And therefore the question of who gets in has gotten worse and worse as the number of kids competing has grown, and we&#x27;re bickering over people&#x27;s belief in different weighting schemes.<p>What the US needs is more good schools.  Not tinkering around the edges and theoretical arguments of whether rich kids deserve good schooling more than poor people.  That will get us nowhere in the big picture.')
