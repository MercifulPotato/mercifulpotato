This lets you implement certain things (authentication, formatting, compression, caching, logging, pagination) once in an abstract class or mixin, and add it to all your views.<p>Of course, Django already has those classes and mixins.<p>This means you can write very simple views. Just define the queryset and the template, and you&#x27;re done. Everything else just works, because it&#x27;s already implemented in well-tested parent classes.')
