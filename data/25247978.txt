But in the meantime, stopping distance is important.<p>Making the changes you propose in urban settings wouldn&#x27;t even be sufficient.  Or do you also mean to clearcut all forests within 50 meters of all roads, then nuke the grass with herbicides?  A year ago when driving Alaska Highway 5 during dusk I was nearly killed by a moose.  The trees there were cut away from the roads, but the grass was high enough to hide the moose until I was almost next to it.  And about ten years ago in Pennsylvania, I did hit a deer in similar circumstances.  Thankfully I was able to slow down enough that it didn&#x27;t come through my windshield.  There is no way in hell I would ever opt for any system that increases my stopping distance.  ABS and good tires are no longer optional as far as I&#x27;m personally concerned.')
