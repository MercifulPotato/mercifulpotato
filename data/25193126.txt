Depending on how young your kids are they may also like the hidden treasure routine.<p>My brother and I went on a streak of trying to find hidden treasure.  One weekend we convinced my grandfather to drive us around to scope out spots to look.  My grandpa told us to give him directions where to go.  Eventually we found a spot and started digging.  After digging a few shallow holes my grandpa pointed to another spot and to our surprise there was something solid about a foot down.  It was an old Neiman Marcus tin full of loose change and candy.  We were thrilled and for years we would tell anyone who would listen that we had found buried treasure.<p>When I was an adult if finally occurred to me that my grandpa had set the entire thing up.  There is just no way my grandparents would have let us eat candy we found buried in the ground.  But he had set it up well enough that my brother and I didn&#x27;t notice.  We believed we had given him directions to the place it was buried and we believed we found it after searching the area thoroughly.  Really, he had buried it earlier before we came over and gave us subtle hints until we found it. We were four and six at the time.<p>When I realized it had been set up I called my grandpa and we had a good laugh.  He told me not to tell my brother before he hung up.  Keeping the secret is key.')
