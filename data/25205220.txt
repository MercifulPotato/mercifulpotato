Same with other ARM manufacturers. Apple did something unique with M1. I don&#x27;t know what it is but at their current rate of improving in-house silicon the M2 is likely to be the best performing single thread chip in the world regardless of company, architecture, or power envelope. And that&#x27;s not done by being the same as everyone else except the clever idea to &quot;just make it bigger&quot;.')
