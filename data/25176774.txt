Because their hands are too small to play demanding repertoire<p>The link does not and can not conclude this. It can not because it makes a confusing sleight of hand, with an inference between competitions, repertoire, and an implied necessary hand size which is incorrect.<p>It is incorrect because some of these competitions require repertoire from specific composers (e.g. Mozart or Bach competitions) whereas some do not. Entrants to the Rubenstein competitions may have the same repertoire as those to the Mozart and Bach competitions. Yet it compares winners of Rubenstein to Bach and Mozart.<p>&gt;The short version: more women play the piano at the collegiate level and beyond than men<p>Such small numbers of people will reach a level of getting first prize in elite competitions, that these people are essentially irrelevant. In absolute terms, it sounds like males are massively excluded from piano up to elite levels. Perhaps piano sizes should be increased?')
