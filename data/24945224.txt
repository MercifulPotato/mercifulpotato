I could see this going either way. Maybe a human will be able to identify spots (like puddles) where traction will be especially bad, but a machine can do a detailed physics simulation of a maneuver before trying it.<p>In whatever way a machine does adjust its behavior for slippery roads, it will probably be more consistent at it than a human. Humans have to deal with force of habit, so for example they may momentarily forget that they can&#x27;t brake hard or they shouldn&#x27;t take that turn at a familiar intersection at the same speed as yesterday.')
