They are just not ordinary state machine diagrams based on a single, scalar state variable.<p>The state expressed in Statechart could be turned into a single variable, and the chart could be refactored into a flat state transition diagram.<p>But that diagram would potentially be huge compared to the state chart description.<p>The state chart condenses that description by avoiding the duplication of some sub-state-machine for every change of some variable which is irrelevant to it.<p>E.g. suppose a device has two master modes of operation, A and B, in which it responds to inputs in totally different ways. Suppose that mode A and B retain their internal state when the mode switch takes place.<p>If we don&#x27;t use a hierarchical state chart, we end up having to represent what happens when a certain input arrives in a state under mode B, for every possible state in mode A which is not actually in effect and irrelevant. Basically, we have to deal with the product state space, in which the explosion leads to numerous identical combinations.')
