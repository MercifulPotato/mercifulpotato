If the object absorbs the light, there&#x27;s a certain amount of pressure, and if the object reflects the light, there&#x27;s even more pressure.<p>This has practical applications.  Optical tweezers are made of light&#x27;s force acting on small objects.  &quot;Optical tweezers are used in biology and medicine (for example to grab and hold a single bacterium or cell like a sperm cell, blood cell or DNA), nanoengineering and nanochemistry (to study and build materials from single molecules), quantum optics and quantum optomechanics (to study the interaction of single particles with light)&quot;  (Wikipedia).<p>Conservation of momentum means the light has mass by definition, and this photon mass can be measured by multiplying the mass and acceleration of the object.<p>Not only does this mean photons have gravity in the theory of GR, because all mass&#x2F;energy does, it means they attract each other in a vacuum.  In theory, you can make photons orbit each other due to their gravity.')
