This is the kind of operation of government that is supposed to never be disruptible. If past mobs knew it was this easy then we could have had a zillion coups by now.<p>You don&#x27;t automatically achieve a coup by entering some building and interrupting some bureaucratic process, no matter how symbolic it may be. Biden got elected.<p>&gt; This is still unimaginably bad.<p>You must lack imagination.')
