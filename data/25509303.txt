Item(by='cbanek', descendants=None, kids=[25523414], score=None, time=1608660887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504771, text='As for the design constraint that webcams have to be small to fit into the lids, I find the lid to be one of those places where I get the worst angle (both for lighting, and just in general), which is under your chin.  I have to sit back a foot or two to make it look right.<p>Instead, what if there was a detachable part that was in the base that contained the webcam?  Then you could hang it on the top lid (like normal place) or maybe set it on a table or higher up at any angle.  I guess the next issue becomes powering it and getting the data there, but maybe just have a USB cable and solve both of them.  I guess this would end up to be more like a go pro in the end though.<p>I have had some pretty good webcams in the past (the 1080p logitechs were pretty good), but they were about $100 then.  But I think there won&#x27;t be something that good in a laptop because the cost will just never be worth it.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay for it, I&#x27;d rather spend that money on a camera that won&#x27;t turn useless in a few years.')
