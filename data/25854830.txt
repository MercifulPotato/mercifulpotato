Item(by='astrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611198123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25854492, text='&gt; If a developer is given free reign as to what they can build, they will naturally build the most profitable thing they can on the land they have available. I doubt anyone would dispute that?<p>There is no such thing as luxury housing[1], and developers in the US are given nothing like free reign, so this doesn&#x27;t happen - they don&#x27;t build special gold-plated apartments for rich people. The most profitable building for the landowner would typically have more units, because that means more people will buy&#x2F;rent units from them.<p>And of course, the developer is not necessarily the landowner, and so they might be paid a flat rate anyway.<p>[1] What actually happens is developers call their buildings &quot;luxury&quot; because it sounds good, but they&#x27;re lying.')
