In this case though I meant &quot;in the right direction&quot; too. I, for one, welcome third party kernel extensions moving to userland.<p>&gt;<i>Do they ? How many brain-time did Apple waste yesterday by soft-bricking ALL THE DAMN MACS running Canalina ?</i><p>A little. Nothing like the brain-months I&#x27;ve wasted on Windows and Linux troubleshooting, and I&#x27;ve been using Windows for ~30 years, and Linux for ~20 (plus several UNIX varieties of yore, like SunOS, Solaris, and AIX, with the ocassional toying with FreeBSD as well).<p>I&#x27;m annoyed by several things in Apple land as well (e.g. the keyboards on the last 3 years on laptops, the firewall bypass situation in Big Sur, the not-so-useful touch strip, and lots of minor issues), but I&#x27;m also annoyed by the &quot;grass is greener&quot; sentiment all the time, or the &quot;sky is falling&#x2F;Stallman was right&quot; rhetoric...')
