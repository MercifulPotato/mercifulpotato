Item(by='DCKing', descendants=None, kids=[25233129, 25233371, 25233176], score=None, time=1606513644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232723, text='&gt; Is there anything stopping MS from copying Apple&#x27;s approach?<p>One thing I don&#x27;t completely understand about Rosetta2 is when it performs static recompilation and when it&#x27;s doing dynamic recompilation. I&#x27;m under the impression that a lot of Rosetta2&#x27;s magic is in static recompilation. I don&#x27;t know in which cases it statically recompiles and in which cases it dynamically recompiles though. If anyone knows anything about this I&#x27;d really like to understand this better.<p>If my hunch about Rosetta2 focusing largely on static recompilation is correct, Microsoft can&#x27;t copy this approach easily. Static recompilation is very hard to make reliable. It&#x27;s probably doable in Apple&#x27;s use case (doable, definitely not easy), where their only aim was probably to make everything that runs on Intel-based Catalina or Big Sur on Apple Silicon. However, Intel-based 64-bit Windows 10 can (attempt to) run all 32-bit Windows software made since Windows 95. That&#x27;s a much wider and diverse range of software, and the only approach to make that reliable is to depend on the slower dynamic recompilation.<p>If my hunch about Rosetta2 is not correct, and it&#x27;s achieving these performance numbers on pure dynamic recompilation, all I can say is hats off to Apple. Microsoft would do good to pay them a large amount of money to license their tech in that case (or to copy as much of their approach anyway).')
