This does not mean the remaining 37% will ever get tested, it means around 63% of the codebase is worth testing. What&#x27;s more relevant is the individual namespaces. For example: Services is at 100% test coverage, because everything in Services actually does something worth testing. Models.DTO, that&#x27;s more like 50%. I do not need to test every auto getter and auto setter.<p>I view test coverage like a log curve, more is better, but the returns can get very diminishing.<p>As far as the tool, working in C# I use JetBrains dotCover.')
