I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;ve never encountered it before.<p>Thanks for Pijul; I&#x27;m super-excited about the possibilities. (Unlike many HN commentators, who are too trapped inside the git way of thinking to realize its limitations ;-)<p>I think your biggest challenge now is going to be everything besides the software itself that makes a project successful: Is the website fast and inviting? Is the software easy to install? Etc.<p>Thanks again &amp; wishing the best for Pijul.')
