They show a whole bunch of graphs without even advancing a theory as to how abandoning the gold standard caused a decline in, for example, employee compensation growth. Or divorce rates. Or ... obesity rates, really? There&#x27;s so many graphs on here that it would take forever to dispute all of them, but here&#x27;s some general points.<p>1. A lot of these graphs start at 1940 or 1950, showing a change in the trend in the early 1970s. But that was the end of WW2, where Europe was in ruins and rebuilding and America saw a massive increase in prosperity and economic output. That was a pretty unique period, it&#x27;s only natural for that trend to diminish or change over time.<p>2. A hell of a lot happened in the late 60s and early 70s, not just abandoning the gold standard. One of these graphs is of the incarceration rate. Do you think we started seeing mass incarceration at that time because we abandoned the gold standard, or do you think it was because of the war on drugs?<p>3. Some of these graphs are deliberately misleading. One is of the cumulative inflation rate, and seems to show the inflation accelerate in the early 1970s. Except a healthy economy should have a steady inflation rate each year (of around 2% I believe), so this graph is supposed to be exponential! They just picked the right window so that 1971 is the inflection point.')
