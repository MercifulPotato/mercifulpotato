It can be done empirically.<p>Yes, you might make a formal proof of asymptotic behaviour and the property that the iterator returns a set, given a certain approximate model of the system, of course. However, it doesnâ€™t just become simple or practical given the existence of a suitable type system alone.<p>Also I am not sure of the usefulness of tests of the asymptotic behaviour of an implementation of a data structure over tests over the applicable data and system. Is there a demand for this? What I mean is separate from the proof that a theoretical hash set had X complexity in its operations. That is clearly interesting.<p>Unit testing might be for the poor man, but how much money will the man doing the formal proof have left at the end of it?')
