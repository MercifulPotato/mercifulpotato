As long as you have a solid PC, the experience is great—it single-handedly convinced me VR was more than a gimmick. Great quality picture + audio, reasonably ergonomic and I love the controls. Overall, I&#x27;ve been super happy with it.<p>Downsides to consider:<p>• You need a solid gaming PC (with a 2070 or better).<p>• Expensive ($1000 for the kit)<p>• Connected to the computer by a wire, awkward for &quot;room-scale&quot; VR<p>• Base stations provide great tracking but require setup (mounting high up in your room) and mean that the setup isn&#x27;t very portable.<p>• Limited&#x2F;janky access to exclusive titles. (You can hack around to get Oculus-only titles to work, but it seems rough and I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.)<p>If you&#x27;re not budget-constrained, I believe the Index will give you the best overall experience.')
