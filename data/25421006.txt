Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607969645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417092, text='&gt; All I&#x27;m saying is that the example is contrived, it streches credulity. You&#x27;re making a marginalist argument where the cost of being slow is increased enormously.<p>Things like that <i>actually happen</i>. Hospital generators fail during a power outage. The floodgate machinery for a dam fails and if they can&#x27;t get it open in time the dam will burst.<p>Instances exist of someone without lights and sirens on their car having a legitimate need to get somewhere quickly.<p>&gt; I could as well make up a scenario where each additional kph increase costs some absurd number of lives, and then it balances wherever you pick the numbers to balance.<p>But then human discretion is deployed in the other direction, and you <i>don&#x27;t</i> drive the vehicle that fast, even if the vehicle itself doesn&#x27;t prevent you from doing so.<p>&gt; And for your case, there is already a judicial system that will give you a break if these things happen.<p>What we are discussing is having a chip in your car that prevents you from exceeding the speed limit. How is ex post facto judicial understanding supposed to help with that?')
