To assume that your perspective is so superior, that it gives you a right to ignore civil protocol, is incredibly arrogant.<p>&gt; absurd allegation of systemic racism<p>So the contents of this article is blatantly false?\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Institutional_racism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Institutional_racism</a><p>I&#x27;m curious to know about what year you think, approximately, that systemic racism against black Americans ceased?<p>That you find me uncivil doesn&#x27;t really bother me.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;The formal structure of institutions, as defined by their formal usually written rules, is the best description of their systemic&#x2F;institutional properties. Only laws and other formal structures can have a systemic effect, and anything institutional by definition consists solely of them.<p>One can stretch the definition of systemic&#x2F;institutional a bit to also include the social contract.<p>In neither case can one claim there is anything except systemic&#x2F;institutional racism in favor of black Americans.&quot;</i><p>As I thought. You have just decided to entirely redefine the accepted definition of systemic&#x2F;institutional racism so suit your argument. &quot;But it doesn&#x27;t say anything about race in this formal document!&quot;. Ignoring anything - apparently no matter how established and prevalent - that goes against your arguments is the fallacy of cherry-picking.')
