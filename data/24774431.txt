How warm -60c felt after walking around in -130c for a few minutes in just shorts and shoes.<p>2. How much I wanted to run once I got out of the chamber. I was not a runner and I never liked running but I really wanted to run.<p>I kind of want to do it again to feel that high. Cold showers got a smaller reaction but something similar.<p>I need to get back into cold showers again but I definitely felt best when I was doing cold showers, it&#x27;s a cheap trade of a few minutes of unpleasantness for such a mood boost but it&#x27;s hard convincing yourself to do it first thing in the morning though.')
