Item(by='lern_too_spel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611086704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835130, text='&gt; they say Google lags a couple of generations behind Apple in lockdown features,<p>Android is already caught up with iOS in lockdown features and in some ways already surpassed. This is a very strange argument for PureOS, which requires apps to request permissions at install time (like earlier versions of Android), and many apps in Flathub just ask for all permissions. I hope PureOS improves this situation because it will also make my desktop better in addition to providing more mobile choices, but to claim they are better than Android already at this simply has no basis in reality.<p>&gt; newer defaults are pointing in the direction of further restricting sideloading.<p>Google itself has said that sideloading will become better in upcoming versions of Android. This is something that I am looking forward to because I develop apps for my own devices that I want to manage the deployment of myself without being restricted to the basic deployment capabilities of the Play Store. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;android-developers.googleblog.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;android-developers.googleblog.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;listening-...</a>')
