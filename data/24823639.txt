I used disposable razors for years and had got painful and disgusting blisters on my neck.  I switched to a $40 Philips 3-head shaver and the blisters reduced.  Then someone told me the secret to irritation-free shaving: shave dry, before washing.  The oils on the skin protect it from damage by the shaver.  I started to shave before my shower and my neck blisters mostly went away.  Switching to a high quality foil shaver (Braun 7 Series) helped reduce the blisters even more.<p>The Braun 7 series is expensive, but the it lasts a long time.  The heads last a long time and are inexpensive.  I bought the shaver for $160 three years ago.  I replace the shaver head once a year, for $35.  So over three years, I&#x27;ve spent ($160 + 3 x $35)&#x2F;3year = $230&#x2F;3year = $77&#x2F;year.  Two gripes: 1) the battery is too big so it&#x27;s a little heavy for travel, and 2) the charging port is not USB so I have to bring the charger when I travel.  The base station with &quot;cleaning cartridges&quot; is a scam, just throw it in the recycling bin.  When my Braun 7 series shaver breaks, I will buy another one immediately.')
