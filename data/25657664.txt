In our back and forth we&#x27;ve now teased out the basic &quot;no-true-scotsman&quot; argument used to advocate for free markets, also known as the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.<p>Why the free market will solve the problem. What&#x27;s that you say? The market is producing disastrous outcomes making life unlivable for huge swaths of humanity? Well clearly you should add more free market then, as the cause is clearly not having enough of that.<p>The reality is that not all social goods and goals can be priced, or measured, or even understood and articulated in a way we all agree on. And, the really core and subtle point that often gets missed is that it&#x27;s literally impossible to base your normative system on the idea that we&#x27;ll all just optimize for outcomes when that system is non-deterministic.<p>All models are false, some are useful. For sure the economic canon has some analytic and descriptive value, that&#x27;s not in doubt. But it has very serious and severe limits, and that&#x27;s where all the actually interesting public policy discussion happens.')
