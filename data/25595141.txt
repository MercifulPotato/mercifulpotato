The comment said there&#x27;s value in documenting the process, and I agree with that.<p>We use a ticketing system to track work. It&#x27;s not Jira. But we do have a requirement that all work is tracked in that system. It&#x27;s not so that a Product Manager or Engineering Manager can chime in and micromanage; it&#x27;s so that we have a record of the fix that&#x27;s easy to find, track the conversation around it, and be able to reference it 6 months or later. Documenting how it was fixed and tested and verified is very useful. Having a place for a manager to eyeball tickets before they are working is not the value of the system.')
