I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because if I wanted to copy some sort of text, you could do it with the email detail page.  And most text is selectable there, from the email name, actual emails, document content, etc.  In mobile devices, text selection is such a pain so the desire to do it is less.<p>Does selectable text have a performance penalty?  In iOS UILabel is far faster to render than UITextView, but only UITextView is selectable.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if many of my UILabels were selectable, but I&#x27;m forced by performance constraints to not let it happen.<p>Maybe put forward making SelectableText the default and renamed to Text and Text is renamed to UnselectableText and becomes the non default if there isn&#x27;t a perf penalty?  It would need an automatic migrator for that to happen although.')
