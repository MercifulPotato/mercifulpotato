They&#x27;d be the first to censor if they were in charge of these platforms. They are some of the first to ban in moderated communities like reddit.<p>Based on what? I and many people I&#x27;m close to in real life are constantly concerned about these escalating erosions of expression and all prefer the less-moderated corners of the internet. None of us have ever sought out control and grew up consistently annoyed at one-sided media outlets, even if they represented the perspective we happened to agree with at the time. If we still use reddit (most of us are falling off), it tends to be a small subset of niche communities that don&#x27;t focus on meta-politics or have auto-banning protocols. These are the people I see complaining about this around me. Is it just because I&#x27;m not on twitter?')
