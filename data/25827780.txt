It makes a world of difference in how the recipe tastes.  And you have to be a relatively experienced cook to know to flag this.<p>&quot;Cooked&quot; onions are generally soft but still acrid.<p>&quot;Caramelized&quot; onions are starting to get hard again because of browning and are sweet with no acrid flavor at all.<p>Those are two <i>VERY</i> different flavor profiles.<p>And that&#x27;s before we get to the point that we have to wait 40 extra minutes for the caramelized onions while everything else is waiting because you expected that it only took 20.')
