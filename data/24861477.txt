Remill (the binary lifter) sometimes has issues with certain constructs such as switch statements, and we&#x27;ve hit a number of LLVM and ptxas (PTX assembler) bugs as well, since LLVM&#x27;s PTX backend isn&#x27;t fully mature and most CUDA kernels are light on function calls and don&#x27;t look like typical application code. However, when the process works, the PTX doesn&#x27;t look too terribly different from the original code.')
