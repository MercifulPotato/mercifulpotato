I was thinking in terms of observable spacetime volume. Even though there&#x27;s only about 0.4 billion years before z = 11, the scale factor increased by a huge factor during that time (a factor of 100 from CMBR emission at z = 1100 to z = 11). That&#x27;s a lot of spacetime volume from which we have no useful observations.')
