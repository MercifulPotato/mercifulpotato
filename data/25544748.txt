The wiring in those cars got very brittle over time and shorts were pretty common. That car came from France to NL (I imported it).<p>Anyway, it was a fun gimmick and it helped to dissuade people from taking it for a ride. I never did find out if it was on purpose or accidental, that dash was not one to disassemble if you didn&#x27;t need to.')
