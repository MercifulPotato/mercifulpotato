The answer hasn&#x27;t changed from then to now, we&#x27;re simply far more aware of being upset at the answer. In a way the problem that was always there has been revealed and some people don&#x27;t like the loss of control over these people&#x27;s opinions.<p>Me personally I&#x27;m an advocate of &quot;let go, stop controlling, see how things turn out&quot; and then fix the <i>real</i> problems that appear, rather than creating worse problems by squeezing the play doh too tightly. It has the upside of being morally defensible rather than having the air of &quot;I destroyed your life for your own good.&quot;')
