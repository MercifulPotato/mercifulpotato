That seems to be par for the course.</i><p>It absolutely is. I was on a town council for several years and our city manager worked like a <i>dog</i>, 60+ hours a week including strange hours (nights and weekends often), salaried for less than the median US HHI. If he hadn&#x27;t had a string of well-paying jobs beforehand he definitely wouldn&#x27;t have been able to take the pay cut.<p>Why would anyone capable of making $80, $100, or $150k a year say no to that to take a thankless job for $40k where they get worked to the bone? What&#x27;s more is that it&#x27;s not an easy job. Most of us here would be grossly unqualified in the best of circumstances, but toss in the political intrigue aspect and most of us would be out within 6 months, by choice or otherwise.<p>The only people taking these jobs are 1) passionate about public service, 2) sacrificing as a stepping stone to future public office, 3) independently wealthy or at least mostly set up for retirement&#x2F;locking in the municipal pension, and&#x2F;or 4) by some fluke, qualified for this job but unqualified for any of the plethora of jobs that pay better and aren&#x27;t as grueling.')
