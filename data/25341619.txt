What&#x27;s the use case you&#x27;re imagining where a plane is just too slow?<p>The only thing I can think of is if some service like FedEx can amortize the cost of the launch across a very large number of low-mass items and charge a premium for fast delivery.<p>Still, I&#x27;d assume that this would use vastly more fuel per mass of cargo moved than a plane, and should probably be avoided for CO2 emission reasons even if it works out economically.  Is my assumption wrong?')
