There&#x27;s no special &#x27;anti-conspiracy&#x27; method of reasoning, nor any other special-puprose method.<p>Likewise, there&#x27;s only one way a theory can be wrong. No theory has ever been wrong because it was a conspiracy theory.<p>What&#x27;s actually being discussed here is how to make <i>other people</i> believe (or claim to believe) something. That&#x27;s fine, as long as it&#x27;s not muddled with how the truth is discerned.')
