It wasn’t because it was an integration of Mozilla’s services. It was exactly the opposite. It was the fact that Pocket was NOT a Mozilla service at the time the integration happened that people bitched about it.<p>Which just goes to show that it wasn’t a real concern, but a Twitter net pointless and baseless moral crusade.')
