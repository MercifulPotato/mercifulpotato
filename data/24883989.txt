They problems with all it&#x27;s neighbors, well even with a country which is separated by 100kms by sea (AUS). They&#x27;re quite intelligently meddling in Nepal govt. to threaten India, at the same time taking over villages of Nepal. .They have problems with Mongols, Muslims, Tibetans, Hong Kong. All while actively debt trapping poor nations. They foul cry when a nation blocks chinese tech, but every foreign tech is pretty much banned in entire China!<p>I don&#x27;t see any end to this. In the current COVID situation, not even a group of nations could stand up to china&#x27;s domination. Maybe it&#x27;s just too late to take any action. They&#x27;re playing dirty, so ideally we should to. But could we? I doubt. They&#x27;re lobbying power is way too tremendous. At least my country, no leader has a spine to stand up.')
