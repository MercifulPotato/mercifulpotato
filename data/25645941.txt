Those are &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; of the &quot;cheap, fast, good, pick two&quot;.<p>Those are not problems, those are trade-offs. OP is right, you could be in a position in which those trade-offs dont apply to you (i.e. by buying a &quot;expensive&quot; but great solution, this happens all the time in all the industries) or you could sacrifice one item (say speed) in your solution if this is not a problem for your workflow (&quot;so what if a open source tool runs 2x as slow as the best proprietary option, our daily batch processing take 2 hours and it is used in weekly buckets&quot;)')
