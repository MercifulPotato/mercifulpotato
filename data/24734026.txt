Apple claims that wasn&#x27;t their request.<p>2. The channels won&#x27;t be closed.<p>3. Telegram won&#x27;t be removed from the App Store.<p>&quot;Apple forces Telegram to Close Channels&quot; makes it sound as though the channels are, in fact, being closed, which isn&#x27;t the case.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to call Apple out on their behavior here, but it&#x27;s another matter entirely to scare users into thinking that the channels will be deleted--they won&#x27;t, assuming you&#x27;re not on iOS.  If you&#x27;re in one of those channels, statistically, you&#x27;re probably not on iOS anyway.')
