If you bought a house in Detroit in 1965 you aren&#x27;t likely doing well today. If you bought in San Francisco in 2019 you&#x27;re probably under today (though that may fix itself). If you bought in Japan almost anywhere you now have a used house which like a used car only goes down in value. If you&#x27;re lucky the land goes up but condos&#x2F;apartments you don&#x27;t usually own the land and even then only in prime locations. Most locations land is likely losing value as the population declines. Land in Ginza (the most expensive land in Japan) only recently passed its late 1980s price per square meter.')
