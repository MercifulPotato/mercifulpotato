Then the mail gets indexed (for text search) by another program and displayed by a third.<p>Anyway I found mbsync, which is just this amazing, efficient, very solid transfer program that&#x27;s been around for many years just quietly doing its job. I almost wrote it off because its homepage is on sourceforge but if you poke around a bit you&#x27;ll see it is actively developed, there&#x27;s an active mailing list, etc. I love it. It&#x27;s kind of interesting how this project I had never heard of just does its job well and works and the program by the semi-famous software pundit whose programming essay went viral really does not (from what I have heard).')
