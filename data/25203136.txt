Sounds like they&#x27;re going to be charging for an entire year of service up front or at least as part of an annual contract, which makes sense. (See: &quot;Stardust will only be the beginning in a year-long partnership.&quot;) So this will be 21.99 euros ($26.04 USD) for the year. I wonder if this is an x86 instance or if it&#x27;s ARM. Pricing would make a lot of sense if it was ARM.')
