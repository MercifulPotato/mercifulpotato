The Chez maintainers move at a deliberate pace, and don&#x27;t necessarily share all the same priorities as Racket. But we&#x27;re very much in touch with them, and they&#x27;ve helped develop even some of the changes that aren&#x27;t upstream.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;ll move back to pure upstream Chez in the near future, but it&#x27;s not quite a fork either.<p>You can read more about some of these issues in our ICFP 2019 paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;plt&#x2F;rkt-on-chez&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;plt&#x2F;rkt-on-chez&#x2F;</a> which is co-authored with the Chez maintainers.')
