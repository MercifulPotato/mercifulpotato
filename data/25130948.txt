Apple deserves praise for its SOC architecture on the M1 and putting it together, but the manufacturing advantage is worth noting.<p>Apple is essentially combining the tick (die&#x2F;node shrink) and tock (microarchitecture) cadences together each year, at least the past 2-3 years. The question, perhaps a moot one, is how much the performance gains can be attributed to either? The implication is that the % improvement due to tick is available to other TSMC customers, such as AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and maybe even Intel.<p>We&#x27;d have to wait until next year (or 2022) once AMD puts Zen4 on 5nm and see an apple-to-apples comparison on the per thread performance. But of course by then Apple will be on TSMC 3nm or beyond...<p>EDIT: confused myself with tick and tock')
