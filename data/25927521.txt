I built a test app in both Ionic and Framework7 and vastly enjoyed the experience of F7 over Ionic.<p>For Ionic Vue is still in beta, poorly documented and had some vague errors with obtuse solutions. It didn&#x27;t have all the components you might want in an app either, so less boiler plate.<p>Framework7 has full Vue documentation, and the handful of components that aren&#x27;t Vueified (Calendar, Toasts) are easily integrated using native JS and the this.$f7 helper.<p>Their creator is highly active and responds to almost all (non-idiot) questions on their forum.<p>Downsides of F7: no SCSS but CSS variables which clutters the inspector, a lot. You can always overwrite these with a scss file but the variables are always there.')
