If they lied to the second employer to get the second job (such as by saying that they had no other jobs or were quitting their other jobs) that may be fraud in some jurisdictions.<p>It&#x27;s also very risky in terms of civil liability. If either employer introduces a product that comes anywhere near to something they worked on at the other employer, that other employer may sue the employee alleging trade secret theft.<p>That&#x27;s a civil matter, not a criminal matter. Mostly, being civil not criminal is good for a defendant...but there is one important area where it isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the burden of proof. Prosecutors in criminal cases have to prove &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. Plaintiffs in civil cases just have to meet either &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; in most cases, and &quot;clear and convincing&quot; in a few.<p>I&#x27;m not fully sure, but I believe a trade secret appropriation suit would use &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot;. That&#x27;s also known as &quot;more likely than not&quot;. Working at plaintiff on stuff anywhere close to the allegedly misappropriated trade secret will be enough to to meet that for plaintiff, effectively shifting the burden of proof on the employee to prove that they did <i>not</i> supply the other employer with the trade secret.<p>The plaintiff would almost certainly sue the other employer too, not just the employee. If the plaintiff wins that suit, that other employer might sue the employer asking them to pay any damages they owe from that suit.<p>This would not be pleasant for the employee.')
