All of these brands include the company logo and usually try to differentiate their design so that you, as the consumer, are a walking billboard for them.  Beyond that, you can be assured that they collect any data on the consumer that they can.  What they do with that data is out of the consumer&#x27;s eyes.<p>It is also worth noting that there is plenty of advertising in Apple products.  Heck, the last time I used one they had at least two digital storefronts built in.  They may not be as crass as Microsoft is (e.g. with the use of the Start Menu), but it is data driven.  Whether the advertising is plastered everywhere or not simply reflects the target market, rather than how they collect and use data.')
