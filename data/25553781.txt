Some ten minute conversations have had the highest &#x27;return on investment&#x27;.<p>Deciding to always aim at the meta-thing right after I have the thing. One specific example is asking a question on the #python IRC channel years ago about a library and receiving an answer from someone who&#x27;s never used it, immediately thanking them and asking <i>how</i> they did to <i>find</i> the answer. That process was much more valuable to me, because I could use it on other things [they did a git grep on the repo].<p>Deciding to use money as an instrument for myself and others. I mostly buy time and experiences. I did it when I was in highschool and continue to do so now.<p>Ars longa, vita brevis.')
