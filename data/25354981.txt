You do know that things delivered by USPS does mean it was shipped via USPS right?  You know about smart post or surepost and how they work?  I find it funny you said I don’t have a grasp, if you view my history you see jobs postings from companies I’ve built including one that does 2mm shipments a month with a negotiated USPS deal with similar rates to amazon.')
