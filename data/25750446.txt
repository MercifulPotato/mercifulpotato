The only thing that matters to the principle of freedom of speech is those consequences.<p>Who cares whether it&#x27;s a government that decides that when you express a certain opinion, you lose your job- or twitter?<p>Funny, but not surprising, how even self-proclaimed leftists will side with capital when it&#x27;s treading on the right people.<p>You might say &quot;but you can&#x27;t force people to platform&#x2F;associate with those they find odious!&quot;, to which I reply &#x27;of course you can&#x27;- there&#x27;s laws against unlimited free association, with the argument that bulk group dynamics end up diminishing individual freedom on net.<p>You might say opinions are a different category from e.g. ethnicity, as they can be changed, while race can&#x27;t.<p>In that case,  in the future when we can change our bodies in a day, will it be alright if &#x27;race&#x27;, no longer existing as such, becomes as acceptably targetable as speech?')
