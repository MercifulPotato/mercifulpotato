As a long-time happy and healthy vegetarian &quot;cook&quot;, here is my utterly simple heuristic that never goes wrong: assuming you have a good-quality non-stick pan: on medium heat olive oil you can toss in any and all vegetables, a source of protien, ginger, garlic, and some freshly ground black -- or mixed -- peppers and salt. You&#x27;re set. (Also assuming no allergies to said basic ingredients.)<p>E.g. tonight (I&#x27;m in CET) I made this simple veggie delicacy; happens to be vegan too:<p>1. toss in some freshly chopped ginger and garlic in some olive oil on medium heat<p>2. add a couple of finely chopped shallots (or even a plain white onion is fine)<p>3. sprinkle some cumin seeds, salt, and freshly ground black pepper<p>4. next up: two chopped green courgettes<p>5. then, toss in two chopped,  medium-sized portobello mushrooms<p>6. finally, add some precooked chickpeas (but if you have the discipline for it, the best chickpeas are dried peas that you soak overnight for 10 hours, and boil the next morning for 30 minutes; no contest).<p>Stir-fry it all for 10 minutes or so, and you&#x27;ll intuitively know it when it is ready.  You can have this with any kind of carbs -- couscous, tortilla wraps, rice, some variants of pasta, bulgar, you name it.<p>Rinse, repeat with many other vegetables and protien combination (flavoured tofu, seitan, et al).  No need to go wild over following a recipe to the dot, or on heat transfer mechanics.')
