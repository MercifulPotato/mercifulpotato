If I knew more about Excel when I was 13, I&#x27;d probably retype unit stats from StarCraft into it and do the maths that I ended up doing in my head. Spreadsheets have plotting functions, which are a fun thing to play with. Also tracking my own magazines &amp; CDs is something I remember doing as a kid - entirely doable in Excel, though in my case, this was my first exposure to Access and RDBMSes in general.<p>Also worth noting that a proper spreadsheet like Excel is in itself a <i>functional reactive programming REPL</i>. FRP is what you do when you play with formulas.')
