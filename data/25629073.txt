Adtech produces petabytes of data every day proving that advertising works. There&#x27;s a reason why two of the most valuable internet companies sell ads.<p>The problem is knowing exactly which formats and campaigns are working down to the dollar, but part of that is just the reality of fuzzy attribution and it&#x27;s only getting harder as privacy regulations get stronger.
