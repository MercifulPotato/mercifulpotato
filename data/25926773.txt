It doesn&#x27;t even have to be fraud, there are so many factors you often can&#x27;t fully control, and reactions can depend on very subtle details or minor impurities.<p>My impression is that usually the informal communication about stuff &quot;that everyone knows doesn&#x27;t actually work&quot; is far more efficient than in your case. But this is something the PI has to do, as a new PhD student won&#x27;t be connected enough for this, and your PI seriously failed you there.<p>It would be nice if someone published that this method doesn&#x27;t work, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be how this works. The amount of effort to actually demonstrate that it really doesn&#x27;t work is so much higher than the reward.<p>In a healthy environment people should have been much more sceptical much earlier. At the latest when you saw potential manipulations in the NMR. I&#x27;m curious what kind of artifacts you saw there, did they just remove or add signals?')
