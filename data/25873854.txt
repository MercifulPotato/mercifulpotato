Then they built what appears to be a total of 2400 of them.<p>The Model S was announced in 2012 as their first &quot;mass produced&quot; road car (and they don&#x27;t appear to have broken 100K cars in a year until ~2017), so that&#x27;s 15 years to get anywhere near the scale of a grown-up car manufacturer.<p>To reiterate, they didn&#x27;t have to support other production in any of that time, and they didn&#x27;t have to make any sort of profit during any of that time.<p>To compare, Audi spits out ~2m cars a year, and can&#x27;t just stop selling cars to retool their factories.')
