The jsonb column approach worked fine until we scaled it beyond a certain point, and then it was an unending source of performance bottlenecks. The mongodb version is much faster.<p>In retrospect we should have gone with mongo from the start, but postgres was chosen because in 99% of circumstances it is good enough. It was the wrong decision for the right reasons.')
