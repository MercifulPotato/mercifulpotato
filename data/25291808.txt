What the heck am I going to do with a whole ham?? I literally do not have the freezer space for this. I&#x27;ve never had children, and have only been in a house with one other human.<p>That&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of food waste. Heck, I sometimes lament that I can&#x27;t buy smaller amounts of spinach because I hate seeing half the bag go to waste.And I&#x27;ll add that this has nothing to do with cooking or not cooking: I like to cook, and do so most days.<p>That packaging keeps food waste down because it breaks things into smaller portions - not to mention that many food places seal them in ways to make them last longer (example being adding a mix of gasses to help it not oxidize).')
