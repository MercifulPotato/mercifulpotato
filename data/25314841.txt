The only reason they&#x27;ve started putting &quot;labels&quot; on these is because they prefer not to block stuff completely.<p>Either way, both section 230 and the fact that they&#x27;re private (rather than government) entities give them that latitude.<p>Without Section 230, they&#x27;d likely just block all those posts and much, much more in order to avoid litigation.<p>That said, I&#x27;m less concerned about section 230 WRT to Twitter and Facebook and more concerned about small sites and blogs.<p>Without Section 230, anyone with deep pockets could just bury anyone who allows comments on their site in lawsuits.  Twitter and Facebook could fight back and likely succeed.<p>But anyone without millions to spend on legal fees could easily be forced offline.<p>And so I wonder, what value would be added by removing section 230 protections?  I&#x27;d expect that the only folks who would really benefit would be lawyers -- and the rest of us would be poorer, both in terms the diversity of voices and diversity of platforms, for it.')
