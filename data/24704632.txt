Perhaps a system where the &#x27;relevance&#x27; claims are evaluated by industry reviewers, and the scientific claims are evaluated by academics?<p>Post-publication (I&#x27;m counting arxiv here as publication) review is an improvement. My branch of science doesn&#x27;t use arxiv to any real extent, unfortunately.<p>Edit: I left a word out.')
