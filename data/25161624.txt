When somebody makes a point of saying something that doesn&#x27;t need to be said - and makes a point of saying it over and over again as if it were profound - anybody who&#x27;s been around for a little while gets really skeptical really fast.  There&#x27;s a famous Reed Hastings (of Netflix) quote along the lines of &quot;do not tolerate brilliant jerks&quot;.  Naive people love to share that quote - and it&#x27;s undoubted that they have somebody in mind who they&#x27;d prefer not to tolerate when they share it - but there&#x27;s literally not one single human being who&#x27;s ever lived who has said the opposite.  Why does it need to be said, then?  Because he (and the repeaters of the quote) needs justification for not tolerating people who&#x27;s face he doesn&#x27;t like, no matter what performance numbers they can produce in their defense.  This slide deck includes a <i>good</i> quote from Grace Hopper: one measurement is worth a thousand expert opinions - but anybody who puts together 100 slides about &quot;culture&quot; bases everything on &quot;gut feel&quot; and ignores actual data.')
