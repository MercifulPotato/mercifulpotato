After all, if your platform is promoting specific content by your own actions&#x2F;volition, then it&#x27;s no longer just content posted by some user, but it&#x27;s now being used or reposted&#x2F;linked by the company that owns the platform for monetary gain  (I would guess ToS would solidify this with some boilerplate statement saying they can use your content to make money and to promote the platform etc).')
