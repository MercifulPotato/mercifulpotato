Amazfit devices are &gt;1cm thick (even the ones that claim 9.2mm, it&#x27;s a lie). They are also larger diameter than the Pebble Time Round, so overall more than twice as big and much less comfortable.<p>The phone software is nowhere near as good, the watch UI is poorly designed, and the watch face&#x2F;app selection is poor in comparison to Pebble. I haven&#x27;t tried gadgetbridge yet but on newer Amazfit devices it requires some hacking to get it to work (extracting login tokens or encryption keys or something) and I expect that it will be fragile.')
