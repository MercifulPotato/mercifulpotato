Item(by='JohnStrangeII', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601819307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678280, text='I&#x27;m working in formal ethics, mostly on formal aspects of value structure, and agree with you. This article is a hodgepodge of many different ideas, some of them interesting, others a bit naive, and has almost nothing to do with formal models for ethics. There is plenty of research in formal ethics such as deontic logics, abstract argumentation frameworks for preferences and norms, nonmonotonic logics for value-based reasoning, normative systems, input&#x2F;output logics and formal axiology.<p>One thing that the author does not address in enough detail is the simple fact that there are many different ethical traditions that come to different conclusions about particular normative issues, and that there are plenty of authors in ethics who (still) consider their business a normative one. A &quot;bottom up&quot; machine-learning based approach to this would invariably fail and miss the whole point. There are some ethicists who consider it mostly a descriptive endeavor - Schopenhauer was one of the first, for example -, but they are in a minority.<p>As long as experts in ethics cannot agree what the &quot;right&quot; ethics is, it&#x27;s hard to see how we would be able to teach it to machines. Many meta-ethicists including me would even deny that there can be an &quot;expert&quot; about moral and particularly about ethical questions at all. However, I have no doubts that various robotics companies will implement those ethical rules and approaches that best serves their interests as companies.<p>That&#x27;s why I think robot ethics is kind of misguided. What we need is laws that regulate AI and put its use into a legal framework and closes loopholes. This is a political, not just an ethical issue.')
