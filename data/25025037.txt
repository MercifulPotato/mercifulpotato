Or are you assuming that&#x27;s not a side?<p>In my social circles, it very much is. My understanding of facts leads me to believe COVID-19 is a great enough &quot;plague&quot; to warrant lockdown measures.<p>People who share your opinion often write these responses out as &quot;extremely risk-averse&quot;, but many disease experts vehemently disagree.<p>To put that in context, let&#x27;s consider your next statement:<p>&gt; Many people die for various reasons.<p>In the United States, we keep track generally of how people die. The top three causes of death[1] in 2018 were heart disease at 655,381, cancer at 599,274, and accidents at 167,127.<p>So far, COVID-19 has surpassed accidents at 229,238 deaths[2].<p>This isn&#x27;t about preventing death no matter the cost. It&#x27;s about taking reasonable measures to slow what has become the third leading cause of death for Americans.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;fastats&#x2F;leading-causes-of-death.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;fastats&#x2F;leading-causes-of-death.htm</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidtracking.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;national" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidtracking.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;national</a>')
