People tend to do what they <i>can</i>, in fact, do regardless of the rules<p>Eclogiselle.com already has Creative Commons maps and free flyers that can be used by anyone right now without paying me a dime. That puts completely free resources into the hands of small communities if they see value in them.<p>I hope to make money providing custom maps and similar services for people who can come up with a few hundred dollars but cannot come up with a few thousand. But I am also happy to see this supported via Patreon and tips by people who believe something like this <i>should</i> exist so small communities have some tools available to them, no matter their budget.')
