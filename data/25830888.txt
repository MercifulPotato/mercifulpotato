It may be that you over-absorb iron. Someone close to me had this condition and described it as &quot;thick blood&quot;. Undiagnosed hemochromatosis<p>He regularly gave blood, which helped shed the iron from his body, but at some point he stopped, and it contributed to a severe cognitive decline. He drank too much, too, which didn&#x27;t help.<p>If you or someone you know has &quot;thick blood&quot;, go to a doctor. Suggest they check for <i>hemochromatosis</i>')
