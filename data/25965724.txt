I&#x27;m running an elixir project that I&#x27;m testing over localhost, and you don&#x27;t have to do any port magic whatsoever. Just run the app in WSL and go to localhost:port in your browser. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is if you do any of your development in the windows part of the filesystem, you might run into weird file locking issues, but I haven&#x27;t had many of those.<p>Also, the WSL extension for VS code makes it hardly noticeable that you&#x27;re even working in windows.')
