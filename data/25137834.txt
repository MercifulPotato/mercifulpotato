No upsells entertained. And I let them in on the fact that I&#x27;m calling all the others and expect to make a decision by a set time. Always remain super polite but stay firm. In a way I suspect many appreciate this because I&#x27;m not wasting their time, it&#x27;s a quick decision on how eager they are to fill their quota. But it&#x27;s fun to see how much the &quot;final price&quot; evolves over the course of a few hoursâ€¦')
