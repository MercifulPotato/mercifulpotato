The US brings in 140,000. This means Canada brings in 20X the number of new immigrants per capita than the US does.<p>The US had 1.8 million new immigrants (legal and otherwise) in 2016 and ~13% of the population is foreign born. Canada exceeds that (~21%) but nothing like the 20X rate you&#x27;re claiming.')
