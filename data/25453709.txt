The real bad dudes agreed to handle the mutual problem for a fee, and DPR paid.<p>Of course, the scammer and the real bad dudes were the same guy, and he managed to turn an extortion into a murder for hire of himself and some fictional associates, and made off with just under a million dollars at the time, not counting what he made scamming customers and also not counting future price increase.<p>DPR, the criminal mastermind that he was, fell for it, never put it together, and paid. He legitimately thought all these names were different people and actually existed. I don&#x27;t believe he even found out he got scammed until he was in jail facing charges and the scammer was caught for some other unrelated crimes.')
