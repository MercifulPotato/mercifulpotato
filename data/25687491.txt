Unless the vast majority of btc transactions are between the same few wallet addresses, this seems impossible?  Even if you assume that the transaction is an instance of a common known script, you still need from-address, to-address, and amount, all of which are &gt;16 bit quantities and in general are cryptographically random.<p>The only explanation I can think of is that they are relying on a sidechannel to communicate the actual transactions, which makes sense in the miner case (the utxo pool) but not in the general node case.<p>Beyond that, I run a BTC node occasionally and the bottleneck is validating blocks, not downloading them.  Transactions are complicated enough right now that I&#x27;m only able to catch up at about 350x real-time (that is, it takes around a full cpu-day to validate a year of blocks&#x2F;transactions).')
