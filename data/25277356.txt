Every dollar saved on automation is a dollar still in the pocket of the automation owner. The money supply doesn&#x27;t go down. The type of demand shifts, but it doesn&#x27;t vanish.<p>Oh, sure, you&#x27;ve got the risk of an unemployable underclass full of dystopian ennui. But before the guillotines come out, the .01%ers will have lots of cash for buying art, personalized AAA video games, solid gold plumbing fixtures, and the like.<p>There&#x27;s good reason to think that we need to reconsider the value of human life in an automated era, when there is plenty of stuff to keep people alive if only we could distribute it just a little bit. We&#x27;ve actually been doing that for well over a century, and there&#x27;s good reason to think that we&#x27;ve avoided the torches and pitchforks so far only because of that.<p>The aggregate demand of &quot;society&quot; needn&#x27;t go down without it.
