When a challenge was raised, the challenge was ignored.<p>Cite this, please.<p>&gt;This is one example of many where challenges were raised and ignored.<p>Cite this, as well, please.<p>&gt;I can only tell you what I personally believe based on the evidence&#x2F;testimony I have heard &amp; read, is that there is compelling evidence and its a legitimate case worth hearing, and should not be dismissed so casually as it has often been by the judges so far.<p>These next two questions are real questions, not snark, I promise.<p>Honestly, genuinely, do you believe your layman perspective is more valid than someone who has spent their entire life honing their craft (judges)? Do you really believe that?<p>Edit: Downvote me if you want, but at least have the decency to answer my questions. If you&#x27;re so concerned about it, then get your information out in front of more people, instead of making baseless claims.')
