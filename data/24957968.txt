We know that being more outdoors and having your windows more open is helping to reduce infections, but when you are entering Winter then a lot of the knowledge we have won’t stop the fact that infections will still rise due to the change in our behaviour in cold weather. It’s just a fact of life, the entire world sees infection spikes of other viruses (flu and so on) in Winters and therefore it’s not helpful to make sarcastic finger pointing comments when we all have accepted this as a fact of life and know this is just how it is.')
