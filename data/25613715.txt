For lineage there is always the wiki page, so you can go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lineageos.org&#x2F;devices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lineageos.org&#x2F;devices&#x2F;</a> and then click on the phone you have and there will be an installation manual. Not always 100% you need to know, but a good start. I should link those, the url scheme is regular, that should be an easy change.<p><i>Edit:</i> The Lineage link now goes to the device wiki entry, where the installation instructions are also linked.<p>For the removable battery, the idea here really is to go one step further. When almost all modern phones have no removable battery the next best thing is having a battery that is easy to replace, even if it is not directly swappable.')
