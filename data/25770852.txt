But no cut-n-paste.)<p>J claims that election workers coached voters and was instructed not to ask for photo ID from voters. However J does not name the location, provide the number of incidents, or name the employees. J never told a supervisor of the incidents nor took steps to address them. (J only came forward after reports of Biden winning.) J also claims, at the TCF center, she was directed not to compare signatures and to &quot;pre-date&quot; absentee ballots received at TCF on Dec. 4. The State Elections Director, CT, answers that signatures were previously verified at the Detroit Election Headquarters and that the &quot;pre-dating&quot; involved completing a data field inadvertently left blank during that earlier process. (I wonder if Michigan use the envelope&#x2F;affidavit and anonymous ballot approach like Arizona, which ideally would have stripped off the signature part before vote counting for privacy. Michigan may need to do some work, if vote counters can match signatures with ballots.)<p>State Senator RJ wasn&#x27;t there and makes claims based on other affidavits.<p>AS was a Republican challenger that didn&#x27;t attend the training. AS claims out-of-state license plates brought &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of ballots in at 4:30 am, and that every ballot after that was for Biden. CT responds that rental trucks with out-of-state plates were used, all ballots were brought in the same way, the number of ballots he claims is speculation, and that 220,000 more votes were made for Biden.<p>DG claims large numbers of ballots were delivered in unsealed containers. Plaintiffs never supplied any legal requirement that sealed containers were required.<p>PC claims that computers were connected to the internet, based on an icon on one of the computers, but provides no other evidence. CT asserts that only the computers that needed to be connected were. (The Court notes that CT, in a Facebook post prior to the election, claims that Democrats were using COVID to commit election fraud (They see you when you&#x27;re sleeping, they know when you&#x27;re awake. (I&#x27;m getting punchy here.)) and that the predilection to see fraud undermines his claims.<p>MC was an IT consultant from Dominion Voting Services at TCF. MC claims witnessing &quot;nothing but fraudulent events take place&quot; including tabulating machines that jammed a lot (?) and a cover-up of the loss of vast amounts of data. No one else corroborates MC&#x27;s claims, and by no one the court says the other complaintants.<p>Ex-Assistant Attorney General ZL claims that he was mistreated, that ballots were processed without confirmation of eligibility, that he was unable to observe because he was required to stand 6 feet away, and that he was excluded from the room after leaving to get something to eat because he was a Republican. However, two Democratic observers were also excluded, with the reason being the maximum occupancy of the room. Further, as mentioned above, voting eligibility was determined elsewhere. A large monitor was provided to allow observation at a safe distance. ZL also did not file any complaints at the time.<p>There&#x27;s a bit about injunctive relief, irreparable harm, and legal remedy. (Michigan law provides for the Secretary of State and county clerks to audit races, but that doesn&#x27;t seem satisfactory for the plaintiffs.)<p>The court finds that the plaintiffs have legal remedies and suffer no harm without an injunction, but that the defendants would be harmed by an injunction, as well as the public interest. The plaintiff&#x27;s affidavits are contradicted by the State Election Director, whose account is corroborated by five other affidavits. An injunction and independent audit is denied.<p>This one is kind of interesting, even though the &quot;independent audit&quot; thing seems only like some kind of delaying tactic, rather than trying to get the election discarded.<p>On one hand, there&#x27;s the assumption that election procedures and officials are legal and fair, and the further consideration that a ruling for the plaintiffs would be a <i>big deal</i>. (Judges apparently don&#x27;t like to be backed into a corner and forced to make rulings that result in <i>big deals</i>, particularly on short notice. The phrase &quot;judicial activism&quot; shows up, for example.) On the other, these are serious accusations that are being considered seriously.<p>In this case, the court decided that the plaintiffs had other options they could use, and that the affidavits were not credible enough to override other considerations.')
