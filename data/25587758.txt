Yes, you can inspect a cell and see what the source for that cell is, but that might be 10 other cells and you can only really review one cell at a time. It&#x27;s like a programming language where you only see one line of code at a time. Worse, those references usually aren&#x27;t named. What does &quot;A1 + SomeOtherTab:B2&quot; mean?<p>All of this really starts to fall apart when you have 10s of tabs with hundreds of rows of data which are often copy&#x2F; pasted. You won&#x27;t even notice that some intern hard-coded  one value into cell F75 until you actually drill down to that cell.<p>Spreadsheets are great until you hit a certain complexity, then they are unmanageable messes.')
