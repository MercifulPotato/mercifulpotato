On one hand, the design is much less ad-ridden and well-written than other SEO&#x2F;affiliate link-driven websites.. but I don&#x27;t see much value from it.<p>* the reviews for products are too short and vague<p>* until you actually read the top part and realize it was written by a human being, it looks exactly the same as all the other affiliate websites that get deranked (probably the reason he&#x27;s getting 0 traffic)<p>* the &quot;real reviews verified&quot; badge screams SCAM to me, although I know less technical-minded people are persuaded by stuff like that')
