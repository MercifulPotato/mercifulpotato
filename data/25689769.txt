This was backed up by sworn testimonies from two observers[3], news reports from multiple stations[4](see [2] for links to other news organizations that reported this - none were Fox News), and video footage[1].<p>The above is not only being ignored by the majority of media outlets (intentional ignorance), but there&#x27;s no way to prove that voter fraud didn&#x27;t occur when the voting process was completely unmonitored. I don&#x27;t believe that the situation was actually illegal[5] - but there&#x27;s no way that a sane person can look at the above circumstances and conclude that the election officials weren&#x27;t trying to hide something, and a reasonable person would look at that batch of 98% of ballots being for Biden (which stand out among the counting for that entire evening) and conclude that that was almost certainly fraud.<p>Moreover, there&#x27;s either no legal action, or no legal resolution (due to e.g. courts dismissing cases on technicalities, and not even considering an evidentary hearing) for these issues.<p>Hence, no good evidence for voter fraud only because of intentional ignorance and deceit to prevent such evidence from being obtained.<p>PostScript: This deceit was committed by <i>the country government</i>. That fits the criteria of &quot;coordinated&quot; at a technical level (i.e. multiple individuals working in concert).\n    [1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;kylenabecker&#x2F;status&#x2F;1335057722560155651" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;kylenabecker&#x2F;status&#x2F;1335057722560...</a>\n    [2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;no-the-georgia-vote-counting-video-was-not-debunked-not-even-close&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;no-the-georgia-vote-cou...</a>\n    [3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;20420331-mitchell-harrison-affidavit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;20420331-mitchell-h...</a>\n    [4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;pipe-bursts-atlanta-arena-causing-hour-delay-processing&#x2F;story?id=73981348" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;pipe-bursts-atlanta-arena-ca...</a>\n    [5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.justia.com&#x2F;codes&#x2F;georgia&#x2F;2010&#x2F;title-21&#x2F;chapter-2&#x2F;article-11&#x2F;part-1&#x2F;21-2-408" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.justia.com&#x2F;codes&#x2F;georgia&#x2F;2010&#x2F;title-21&#x2F;chapter-2...</a>')
