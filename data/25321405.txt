I was born with what I was born with. Why do I have to think about it? What choice did I have in it? Religion, I can choose. Politics, I can choose. Gender? That&#x27;s not my choice. To the extent it&#x27;s my identity, it&#x27;s forced upon me. Thanks, guys.<p>In this thread, I&#x27;m responding to timeeater&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s censorship, not incivility, that results in banning. As evidence, timeeater says that criticising feminism is &#x27;not allowed&#x27; or suppressed. But I would argue that it&#x27;s not criticism of feminism that gets timeeater in trouble, but instead the tendentious supposition that discussing women at all is &quot;political&quot; (to quote, &quot;But there are political topics on HN all the time (women in tech, worker unions at Amazon, and so on and so on).&quot;). Then timeeater goes on to make some statements about special treatment and special insights. Now <i>that&#x27;s</i> the rabbithole of wasted pixels that Paul Graham is getting at in his essay -- it&#x27;s really not germane to the discussion, and it&#x27;s all bound up in an identity that is indeed chosen.')
