There is a plant that&#x27;s around hot springs. The fact that it survives the heat is thanks to a fungus that&#x27;s inside the plant. But the fungus can&#x27;t do it alone, it needs a virus for it. The virus contains the genes needed to express the protein needed for thermal tolerance. Really cool stuff.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doi.org&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.1136237" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doi.org&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.1136237</a>')
