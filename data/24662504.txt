If I was to do a full inventory, I would probably find I&#x27;m in the possession of tens of thousands of items. I&#x27;m currently in the situation where something breaks daily. It has forced me into being very picky. I no longer buy things, if I can avoid it. Every thing I buy has the potential of being a problem down the line that will require time and attention. Even disposing of broken things can be a big hassle.  If I do buy something, brand new, I will take a close look at it and think about how it will fail. And try to reinforce those failure points. \nMinimalism is definitely a valid strategy, at large scales.')
