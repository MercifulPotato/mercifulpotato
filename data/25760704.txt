Twitter &amp; Facebook is not the US government&#x27;s communication lines. The government can and regularly does publish communications on its own internet infrastructure it controls and regulates. The government also maintains continuous contact with a global free press that breathlessly and rapidly reports on anything the government and Trump himself wants to say.<p>Let&#x27;s not misrepresent what this actually is: a private enterprise locking a political leader out of one of many communication platforms that the leader prefers. Twitter &amp; Facebook are not and have never been critical requirements for the US government (or Trump) to communicate effectively.')
