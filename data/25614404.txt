It seems that, through inheritance, 138 relatives each owned a tiny share of 2.35 acres of land, with one of the relatives, Carlos Andrade, owning a larger share and having been the only one living on the land. Andrade sued his relatives to force them to sell and compensate them for their shares. Zuckerberg sided with Andrade. I&#x27;m not sure of the details, but it sounds like he doesn&#x27;t have the island to himself, since Andrade is living there, and it sounds like the other relatives weren&#x27;t using the land.')
