I&#x27;ve noticed there seems to be less of the unalloyed fanboyism, and more realism in people&#x27;s reported experiences with it now they&#x27;ve had a chance to use it for a few years. Reports still seem to be positive, but more balanced, which I think is the sign of a language ecosystem maturing.<p>I generally take breathless coverage of how brilliant some new language (or tech stack) is with a large pinch of salt. The foibles and pitfalls of modern languages are often hard to spot until people have code-bases that are at least a couple of years old. I think the good stuff is generally easier to see at first, while the problems (which are often consequences&#x2F;side-effects of the good aspects) generally take longer to appear.<p>Programming languages seem to follow a variation of the Gartner Hype Cycle, with the twist that just after you get to the Plateau of Productivity and lots of people are quietly getting stuff done with it everyone starts to declare that &quot;language X is dead&#x2F;dying&quot;.')
