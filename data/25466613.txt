Unfortunately that lack of long-term focus can really slow your stride, but on the plus side, pivoting is easy (too easy) and you never look back.<p>I&#x27;ve certainly been disappointed to find certain paths were unexpectedly difficult and &quot;not worth it&quot; for me, but I can&#x27;t say I regret leaving them; usually part of what made the path difficult was the lure of another path.<p>I also wonder if having dreams involving physical stamina make them harder to let go of. Ballet, for instance, is very physically demanding, and aging will cost you; you can&#x27;t just take a 10 year break. Whereas if I dream of building a certain piece of software, it actually gets easier because the tools get better and age gives me experience.<p>I&#x27;ve also always been weary of dreams that depend on something too beyond your control, such as winning a certain award. You can do your best, but you can&#x27;t force others to do worse.<p>(ETA: On a spiritual note, I don&#x27;t think the achievement of any dream should be the foundation of the worth of one&#x27;s life. That is, your existence in and of itself has more intrinsic value to the world than the achievement of any personal dream.)')
