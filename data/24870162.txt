While the median reader is, I think, nebulously feminist, there is an extremely vocal anti-feminist contingent, and not a huge number of people talking seriously about feminism. I speak about feminism only by carefully avoiding any of the words they find triggering, and still usually not received well.<p>Philosophy doesn&#x27;t get a great shake, either. HN discussion of philosophy seems to concern itself mostly with caricatures of postmodernism and logical positivism.')
