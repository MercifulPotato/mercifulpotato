Router that I own Let me make a router table that fits in my workspace and has the features I need, now the router can be used in other ways.  Want to cut circles, make a circle cutter for my router. Dovetails, jig to make that with my router.  All of the tools are add on to a pretty basic tool, and they are set up for me.<p>To go back to the static website, I really like the Wiki format (Current favorite is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmwiki.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmwiki.org</a> ). I picked it for three reasons 1) It&#x27;s a very powerful wiki 2) I can convert the site into static pages. This lets me build in the wiki format, then publish out.  3) There is a cookbook (a tool another user wrote) to make PDF.  You can select the pages in page order and produce a PDF.  To that base I&#x27;ve added my custom items.<p>Pmwiki in it&#x27;s own right is simple (a router), but allows for cookbooks (custom extensions) that others can add.  One of the interesting things is the current lead developer doesn&#x27;t really add features to the core, they also create cookbooks to add on.  And the core is pretty soft, if you don&#x27;t like the markup, you can change it.<p>A long way to go to say that I can see writing software like the OP article.  But if you should look at a core tool and see if you can build around that.  @Molf uses hinges as an example.  You can do a lot around a stock hinge (paint, bevel the edges, add &quot;hand crafted tool marks&quot;, a process that is easier to do than starting from ground zero.')
