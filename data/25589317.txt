At the time, Sun&#x27;s apparent goal was to draw developers away from GNU and Linux development into Solaris. Not only did Sun not want code from GNU and Linux in Solaris, more importantly, Sun did not want technological advantages from Solaris&#x27; kernel to appear in Linux.<p>Given Sun&#x27;s goal, no matter what GPL said, I am sure that they would have figured out a cute way to engineer their license to be incompatible.')
