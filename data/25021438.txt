Imagine a well-produced show with deep participant profiles - a cross between a reality TV show and a HBO&#x2F;Netflix long-form movie.<p>It would humanize the participants first, then after viewers care about them, their lives, and their families, the actors gradually explain their backgrounds and opinions - some of which a viewer will disagree with. Viewers would &quot;meet&quot; people they may not interact with regularly. (Sarah Silverman&#x27;s &quot;I Love You, America&quot;[2] is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to this, and it&#x27;s not all that close.)<p>This would need to be a multi-decade plan, probably with philanthropic and public funding.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braverangels.org&#x2F;what-we-do&#x2F;red-blue-workshops&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braverangels.org&#x2F;what-we-do&#x2F;red-blue-workshops&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xmQpf-B94mc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xmQpf-B94mc</a>')
