Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24912357], score=None, time=1603833506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911931, text='I&#x27;m assuming you meant &quot;carbon tax&quot;? Why? Because it&#x27;s the most elegant way of putting a price on emissions.<p>Why UBI? It redistributes the tax collected from high emitters (likely to be higher income) to low-emitters (likely to be lower income) so progressives like it. It keeps the tax revenue neutral and doesn&#x27;t allow the government to expand so conservatives like it.<p>&gt; Why do these same activists also campaign against nuclear power?<p>Because of the long history of cost overruns, waste disposal and management issues, and the fear of a minuscule chance of catastrophic failure (not saying this last one is a rational fear).<p>Why fixate on nuclear power whenever climate change comes up? Why not institute a carbon tax and leave the rest to the market? Some countries (France, India, the UK) love nuclear power, and others (US, Japan, Germany) are not so hot on it. If they all have carbon taxes, each country can figure out for itself what it wants to do, and collectively embargo&#x2F;tariff countries that don&#x27;t have a carbon tax.<p>It&#x27;s weird that a lot of people&#x27;s default position is &quot;I won&#x27;t do anything for climate change unless we get nuclear power.&quot; Almost like they know there&#x27;s very little chance of the national opinion about nuclear power changing very soon, so that gives them an &quot;out&quot; on taking any other action.')
