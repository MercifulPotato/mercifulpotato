Skills that many parents can&#x27;t teach on their own, and that most kids wouldn&#x27;t go out of their way to learn if you left them alone.<p>I attended elementary through middle-school at a district <i>too poor to offer a high-school chemistry class,</i> and still learned my times tables and how to write a paragraph. I even went on to Community College, a state school, a state-school masters, and an MD on scholarship. Sure, I didn&#x27;t get the chance to take AP classes, and I didn&#x27;t have some fancy robotics class, but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to bash the public school system that got me to where I am. Sure, I didn&#x27;t get everything a kid growing up in Pasadena got, but California has a robust-enough public-education system through the Community Colleges and UC&#x2F;Cal-State system that it wasn&#x27;t a dealbreaker in the least.<p>I don&#x27;t know what district you attended, but if you took nothing away other than &#x27;boredom, authority, and pointless busywork,&#x27; I&#x27;m curious as to how exactly we are debating this point in written English.<p>I think it&#x27;s a slap to the face of a lot of teachers doing their best, as well as their students, to say that kids in disadvantaged districts learn <i>nothing</i> other than how to sit still and listen to authority. I learned quite a bit, in fact.')
