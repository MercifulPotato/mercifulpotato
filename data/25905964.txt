Or better yet - put those 200$ on a bug bounty to implement it - I&#x27;m sure somebody would jump on it.<p>&gt; I love the classic response here:<p>This is the exact same response as you&#x27;d get from Adobe if you requested a feature from them. If a request doesn&#x27;t carry a direct profit incentive for a company, they will completely ignore it - and if you worked a lot with Adobe software you would be very familiar with that.<p>Yet somehow, people get more mad when small FOSS dev teams don&#x27;t jump on their pet peeves immediately than when multi-million-dollar companies that they pay hundreds of $ ignore years of pleading by even rather large players in the industry to implement some pretty basic things.<p>It&#x27;s free software, not free dev time.')
