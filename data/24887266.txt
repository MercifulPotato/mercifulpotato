This is a risk we take in today&#x27;s world. I could imagine a near future reality where I buy a monitor and then find I need to have a Facebook account in order for it to turn on, or a car that won&#x27;t drive without logging in to Facebook. Or a refrigerator. Ten years ago these would seem totally ridiculous. Today, they are still silly but oddly believable.')
