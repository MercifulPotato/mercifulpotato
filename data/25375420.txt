It&#x27;s not about availability of packages. It&#x27;s more like people develop and verify on RedHat based distros (because ScientificLinux was RedHat based). Some examples:<p><pre><code>  - Software is released RPM first.\n  - Software certification done on RedHat and CentOS (compile &#x2F; verification).\n  - Library versions present in RedHat and CentOS are used in development.\n  - Documentation is written RedHat first.\n</code></pre>\nYou can do everything on Debian. Possibly something would be hardcoded and you need to work around or re-compile it. Or, it works without hiccup but, developers can&#x27;t provide support since they didn&#x27;t test on Debian.<p>Scientific software is a very different beast. Its accuracy and precision sometimes depend on the mood of a newborn butterfly in Zanzibar. I develop such software so, I know a little bit about the peculiarities.<p>Since RedHat also has paid support, RH based distributions are considered more sound and mature, because if something breaks, RedHat can fix. It&#x27;s no different for Debian but, RedHat was able to fly an engineer for NEC Corp. to reproduce and fix a GCC bug on-site. System in question was Itanium based IIRC.')
