Under deflation the opposite has been true. Of course lately we have massive improvements in technology to thank for boosting productivity in almost every field, which somewhat masks the negative effects of the inflation. If it weren&#x27;t for that there probably wouldn&#x27;t be much of an economy left by this point.<p>Cash has no utility on its own. It&#x27;s just a placeholder. Take some out of circulation and the purchasing power of the remaining cash will automatically adjust to match the value of everything available for trade. Stuffing cash in your mattress hurts no one. Inexpertly dumping it into the market to avoid inflation, on the other hand, might well bring down the average rate of return.<p>The natural rate of inflation or deflation is a key economic indicator which reflects the expected average rate of return. Only ventures with expected returns above this rate (the deflation rate) are economically productive. Messing with the money supply distorts this signal and, though excess inflation, encourages investment in less ventures which divert resources away from the more productive ones. Of course artificial deflation is no better; the ideal is not forced deflation but rather a currency whose supply is not subject to manipulation.')
