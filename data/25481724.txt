Now you can say it&#x27;s not you that&#x27;s biased, it&#x27;s just the algorithm.<p>It&#x27;s not that you set up the algorithm to rely on the bias - ML trains on data produced by a biased system and ends up building a model containing the same biases - you don&#x27;t need to &quot;set-up&quot; anything - if you&#x27;re fine with the existing biases you can &quot;launder&quot; them through ML.')
