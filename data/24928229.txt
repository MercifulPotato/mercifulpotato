He could claim that notebooks are wonderful, but that would be less intellectually useful because it puts the onus on the listener to find and compare alternative opinions. He is, as speakers really should be encouraged to do, providing an easy reference to strong competing ideas and also providing a specific case of why he thinks they are wrong.<p>It is a horrible mistake to bring people in and give them attributes they don&#x27;t have (eg, &quot;Joe Schmoe is an idiot who is wrong about X&quot; is objectionable). It is good practice to reference where mistaken claims are being made (as in this case &quot;Joe Schmoe said X and that is wrong&quot; is helpful to the listeners).<p>I am very doubtful that Joel Grus&#x27; identity is so tied to his jupyter-scepticism that this talk represents a personal attack. It is completely routine debate and possibly quite fun for all involved.')
