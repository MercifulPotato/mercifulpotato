Every few months I have to send an appeal to them so that I can continue sending mails from my mail server. They claim that there were user complaints about spam but it&#x27;s pretty much impossible. I think they just silently blacklist smaller mail servers periodically and hope that they can fight spam that way. Obviously they can&#x27;t.<p>So if you want to be able to receive emails from smaller mail servers - don&#x27;t switch to Microsoft.')
