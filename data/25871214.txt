I also like that the company is based in Germany, and I had good experiences contributing to their code.<p>However, I do have to say that the software is somewhat clunky and slow, and the clients can be a little rough around the edges. (The desktop client has a particularly nasty bug that likes to clobber git repos.)<p>So if ownCloud comes out of the rewrite as sleek and reliable as they claim, they would be worth taking another look at. Until then, I&#x27;ll stick with my Nextcloud...')
