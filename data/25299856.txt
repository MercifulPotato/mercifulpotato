They are rolling out the red carpet like a matador&#x2F;torero uses red cloth to bait a raging bull. They are also saying “no bull” as a play on words to say they aren’t bullshitting us by putting out this laptop with all AMD components. As for “pangolin”, I think that’s just them reusing the model name that was previously used for this form factor in their lineup.')
