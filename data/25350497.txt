It’s my #1 book recommendation for software engineers.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0814474578" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0814474578</a><p>The lessons from the book are especially helpful when I feel stuck in debugging; I’ll think through the guidelines and they get me unstuck almost every time. For example, yesterday I started feeling stuck trying to figure out why my tests were failing, and I realized I was failing to follow the “stop thinking and look” guideline. We tend to <i>theorize</i> way too much about what may be happening when we should simply <i>look</i> to see what is actually happening.')
