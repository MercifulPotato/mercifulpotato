It just takes a while.<p>Probably, yes, but Tesla does have quite a head start.  This is also something both professional and armchair analysts have been saying for the last decade.  &quot;The big automakers will just throw their weight around to catch up.&quot;  They still haven&#x27;t caught up.  They probably will someday, but having the head start and the lead during an inflection point period is quite valuable.<p>&gt; now they are in the driving seat in terms of numbers on the markets that are truly developed (in Norway Audi, VW and others are eating Tesla&#x27;s lunch).<p>I mean, lets compare apples to apples.  In 2020, Tesla sold ~500k EVs worldwide.  Audi sold ~50k EVs.  The remainder of the VW group sold about ~175k EVs.   Tesla is still significantly ahead despite your characterization.')
