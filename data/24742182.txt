Since Apple charges $129 for a display, and since I don’t have any access to touch and proximity sensor calibration equipment, I can’t properly do it by myself.<p>I paid $99 for that one brand new last year.<p>It replaced a 2016 iPhone SE (from 2016) with a battery that only held a charge for a hour and also fell apart - the glue holding the display module together wore out.<p>The 2016 iPhone SE runs the latest iOS 14. I think the 12 mp camera is suitable enough for my needs, the square sides are great for standing it up without the use of a tripod to take a photo, and I have a headphone jack still. There hasn’t been a iPhone since that’s come close to being as small. Still, I’d like to see it get even smaller. I haven’t found a single phone since that’s had a compelling reason for me to sacrifice this size without switching to Android.<p>To date I’ve spent approximately $560 on iPhones since retiring my  next favorite phone of all time: my Nokia Lumia Icon. I still miss windows phone.')
