Why not let something break, and then they&#x27;d have a stronger negotiation position?<p>I can&#x27;t imagine (but would be very impressed with tech co-founder) if a year old system could run without any maintenance for a month.  Seems also unlikely that tech co-founder could be replaced fast enough to continue reliable service seamlessly.  I don&#x27;t think non-tech co-founder realizes that if tech disappears, it will kill the baby.')
