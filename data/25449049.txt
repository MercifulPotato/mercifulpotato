It compels people to ignore their unique life circumstances in favor of a shortcut explanation that may not apply to them at all. I&#x27;ve always been similarly wary of concepts like &quot;rebound relationships&quot; or &quot;best years of your life&quot;. If we have a bunch of de-personalized frameworks to help explain the course of our own lives, it only moves us farther away from seeing our lives for what they really are. Maybe that relationship ended because you have attachment issues, not just because it happened to follow shortly after a different relationship. But if you and people around you write it off as just another classic &quot;rebound&quot;, then you may miss out on the ability to learn something about yourself.')
