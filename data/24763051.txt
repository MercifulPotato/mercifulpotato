These types of tools were also used by the Greeks and Romans of classical times, as well as the Celtic Druids and ancient Chinese.<p>In 1949, while searching for evidence of lost civilizations in the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, a group of French explorers found a massive system of caverns known as the Tassili Caves. Many of the walls in these caverns were covered with wonderfully preserved pre-historic paintings. One of the most remarkable ones that they found was a huge wall painting of a dowser, holding a forked branch in his hand searching for water, surrounded by a group of admiring tribesmen. The wall murals in these caverns were carbon dated and found to be a least eight thousand years old.
