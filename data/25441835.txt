Item(by='hmwhy', descendants=None, kids=[25441935], score=None, time=1608122367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440758, text='I can&#x27;t comment too much on the zero-G washing part (but I tend to agree), and I think the comment about solvent is actually very interesting.<p>It&#x27;s likely that weight is probably not the biggest concern if such a washing system were to be implemented, as they would probably design a system to recycle the washing liquid. I think most solvents that are candidates as washing liquids post either additional health and&#x2F;or fire hazards in space.\nIn addition, and particularly for water-based washing, I think the error tolerance in engineering either (1) additional infrastructure to the existing water-recycling system and&#x2F;or (2) a part that can confidently remove unwanted chemicals are challenging problems. the latter is probably the bigger concern because tolerance for error there would probably be substantially lower than urine recycling.<p>Just a guess because I thought it&#x27;s an interesting comment, and it&#x27;s quite possible that one can already design (if it doesn&#x27;t already exist) a washing liquid that is safe for consumption at small quantities.')
