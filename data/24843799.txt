This whole thread is. Google is a good citizen, but people on hacker news just love a good story about tearing up big tech. How is society better off with google torn up? Arguments I expect and don&#x27;t accept:<p>1. It allows alt search engine or alt browser to succeed. So what? The alt search engines and browsers are worse than the google ones. It doesn&#x27;t benefit any actual people to have them rise up.<p>2. Google screwed my friend one time. Every single company (and person) on earth is guilty of this. One swallow does not a summer make.<p>3. Google is restricting this tech I like, or google is sometimes wrong about their bans. See (2)<p>And so on. I haven&#x27;t seen anything compelling in this thread, just a whole lot of hyperventilating.<p>And to your point. No, search is not a wall of ads. But if you feel that way, literally change your search engine. It&#x27;s easier than typing this comment you just posted.')
