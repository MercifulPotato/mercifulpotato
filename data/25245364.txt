Item(by='commentrix', descendants=None, kids=[25245402, 25245408, 25245384, 25245387], score=None, time=1606661220, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25245175, text='But I think it&#x27;s &quot;anti-American&quot; to deliberately editorialize and misrepresent the police as illegally violent and biased, when the facts are otherwise:<p>- black people kill black people far more than police or white people kill black people, but the dominant story about it is, police violence is at fault<p>- police have to deal with 1000s of violent encounters with unstable and dangerous individuals every week, and aside from security guards, they&#x27;re the only officers in civilian society authorized to use physical force, and each year dozens of uniformed officers are killed[0] and thousands are violently assaulted[1], but again, the dominant propaganda is the fake story about the &quot;plague of police violence&quot; against &quot;poor innocent victims&quot;<p>If some officers murdered people, and that&#x27;s enough to produce this persistent propaganda about &quot;police brutality&quot;, then the dozens of murders and thousands of assaults by people against police should be enough to create a greater story about &quot;anti-police brutality&quot; -- but it&#x27;s not. The &quot;police brutality&quot; narrative is a lie that&#x27;s trying to be born as truth through endless repetition, spread by corrupt and irresponsible media. It&#x27;s obviously propaganda and a divisive tactic, but people lap it up. It&#x27;s very, very sad, that it is used as an outlet for people, who twistedly see it as a way to vent their unrelated frustrations, with someone to incorrectly blame, a &quot;cause&quot; to disguise their anger about their other problems. The same tactics are used to recruit and radicalize terrorists.<p>One of the saddest thing&#x27;s about these myths is how they are being used to whip up anti police sentiment, which funnels into anti police violence, which results in really bad outcomes for the perpetrators, who probably were otherwise OK people, but got deluded by this propaganda into making mistakes that ruined their lives, and the lives of others.<p>But, go on, keep spreading this delusion and apologizing for violence against police, like idiots, manipulated by forces you don&#x27;t understand.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov&#x2F;officers&#x2F;national&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;leoka" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov&#x2F;officers&#x2F;national&#x2F;u...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ucr.fbi.gov&#x2F;leoka&#x2F;2019&#x2F;topic-pages&#x2F;officers-assaulted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ucr.fbi.gov&#x2F;leoka&#x2F;2019&#x2F;topic-pages&#x2F;officers-assaulte...</a>')
