They have been involved in laundering terrorist rhetoric and incitement to mass attacks. Take the case of Fox employing Tucker Carlson.<p>Tucker owns Daily Caller.<p>Daily Caller published an article extolling the virtues of ISIS-style ramming attacks against protestors.<p>Fox News republished this article. The result was a spike in ramming attacks against protestors.<p>Fox gracefully pulled the article after complaints, no blow back since it wasn&#x27;t their own article anyways. Nothing to see here, just entities paying each other and relaying each other&#x27;s incitement.<p>There has to be at least a dozen people at Fox News that need to be imprisoned for their role in pursuing death and violence against political and cultural opponents. So yes lets do the steps you mentioned then move on to discovery so we can find out how execs at Fox measured success when publishing incitement.')
