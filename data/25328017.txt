These days anything meant to be a device os that doesn&#x27;t make allowances for the non-vilatile memory it will likely be running in (even if just the base is and not media mounts) as needed in some way is really doing users a disservice.<p>The power cycling is new to me though.  Is that also based on bad defaults (e.g. not using noatime mount option etc.) or is it actually based on power? Because that seems weird given their designed use case (constantly getting and losing power as they go in and out of devices).')
