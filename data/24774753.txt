They just both have pros and cons.<p>If you&#x27;re wearing gloves, Touch ID doesnt work. If you&#x27;re wearing a mask, Face ID doesnt work. If your finger is a bit wet and&#x2F;or wrinkly, Touch ID doesnt work. If your face is at a very off angle Face ID won&#x27;t work.<p>Face ID worked pretty well for me (before mask time) and for me it had less tradeoffs. I prefer it.')
