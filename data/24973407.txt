I never was much of a desktop user, but I used their Android app out of convenience and have gone 100% Firefox.<p>I stopped using Google Search and instead use Bing for most things... yeah yeah I know, one demon for another, but Microsoft Rewards have saved me some measurable cash so far and I have pretty much isolated my Microsoft life from any other online personas.<p>I&#x27;m starting to eyeball moving away from Gmail more and more as these stories show up. I&#x27;ve had my own domain for years now and have my incoming mail forwarded to gmail.
