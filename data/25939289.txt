Item(by='alpaca128', descendants=None, kids=[25939917], score=None, time=1611820027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25939039, text='The only decent solution in my view would be a new, separate\nkind of terminal spec, maybe even completely focused at terminal\nemulators. It could make sense to handle input better(maybe even\nwith keyup&#x2F;keydown events) and maybe display images in a\nnon-hacky way(it can already be done via w3m...kind of).<p>Changing the existing standards just won&#x27;t work as it would\nbreak a ton of programs, although if I&#x27;m being honest - while I\nlike the idea of such a terminal rework - I don&#x27;t know if it can\nbe done nowadays without it opening the flood gates by\ndevelopers who just can&#x27;t restrain themselves from adding so\nmany features it might as well be a new browser engine.<p>And either way I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the effort as those\ninput limitations only affect a few specific situations. I use\nhundreds of custom keybindings in Vim and so far the only\nobstacle I encountered was the `Tab` &amp; `Ctrl-i` overlap. If I\nneed to hold down more than one modifier I did something wrong\nanyway.')
