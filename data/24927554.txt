C++ is unproductive when compared to <i>other languages</i>.<p>C++ can be found to be the best language for a specific class of problems. But.<p>Those 2000 lines of C++? If that code had been python or F# or even C# and the problem had been &#x27;generic&#x27; enough it would likely have less lines of code and be done faster.<p>If that 2k lines happened to implement some numerics stuff with hard performance requirements then C++ might come up on top.<p>But my complaint overall is not about a short 2k line program. It&#x27;s about the whole program lifetime and software complexity of a complex system.<p>For non-trivial programs C++ opens a whole can of worms concerning compatibility, deployment, locales, memory handling, weird bugs due to sometimes obscure lifetimes, integer sizes on different plarforms... etc etc.<p>And the C++ spec is infinite for most mortals.')
