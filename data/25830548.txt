Item(by='uuoc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611036708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830503, text='&gt; I find it disturbing that the overwhelmingly US neo conservative liberal media companies slap the label &#x27;far right&#x27; on just abut anything that doesn&#x27;t fit their world view and agenda. Any sort of recognition there are center right or moderate conservatives appears to have been cancelled.<p>This is because &quot;far right&quot; has become a code-word for &quot;neo-nazi&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;white supremacist&#x2F;racist&quot;, so labeling everything that does no fit their preferred world view as &quot;far right&quot; automatically sets it up to be something so obscene that it should be banned in the minds of their viewership.<p>And of course, what you see is the beginning of the banning happening right before your eyes.')
