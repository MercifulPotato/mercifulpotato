In my experience, monoliths are universally bad in every imaginable way. A huge part of my career has been splitting monoliths into cohesive smaller codebases which could be called microservices.<p>How to split them has never really been a problem, you tend to develop an intuition and the monolith kind of splits itself.<p>Eg, currently we have user profiles (user id &gt; the users names, email etc) in one microservice, relationships between users (user id &gt; other user ids) in another.<p>Each has its own datastore, deployment, scaling etc. It works great and while there is a small overhead cost to pay for splitting things it&#x27;s vastly preferable to the monolith we used to have, which contained lots of things that had very little to do with each other, took ages to test and deploy, if it went down it was game over etc etc etc.')
