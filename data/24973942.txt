As to FB and Twitter, I&#x27;m on it <i>FAR</i> less than in the past.<p>They&#x27;ve just become toxic on so many levels.  What I used to appreciate was actual discourse with those I don&#x27;t always agree with and now everyone just got completely intolerant of any views not their own.  I&#x27;ve had more unfriends&#x2F;unfollows in the past year than the past 20 or so before that.<p>It&#x27;s an echo chamber of insanity, and if you don&#x27;t fit cleanly in it, it just feels like you want to drop in less.  There are a few FB groups I check in on, and engage with, but now it&#x27;s maybe half an hour a day across all social platforms where as a couple years ago, it might have been 2-3hrs a day.')
