If the paper wanted to make a case for this star being a candidate for the signal&#x27;s origin, the paper should have at least discussed the expected probability of finding such a start in such a volume in the Milky Way.<p>They found 1. Or 14. Or a lot more, if you relax a constraint that isn&#x27;t motivated. The &quot;paper&quot; concludes that both candidate volumes(<i>) of space should be searched for exoplanets.<p>(</i>) only one &quot;horn&quot; (of 2) received the signal, but they don&#x27;t know which one. Hence two possible volumes of space where the signal could have originated.')
