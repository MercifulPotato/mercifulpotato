My answer is obviously going to be biased, but I think our calculator is very different from a TI Nspire.<p>We actually designed it with high school students in mind. We interviewed a lot of them, and we reached the conclusion that on average they were using less than 10% of the features of their calculator.<p>So we designed ours trying to make it as intuitive as possible. You&#x27;ll notice it borrows from gaming consoles and mobile phones: that&#x27;s because high schoolers already know how to use those!<p>As an example that might seem like a minor detail, we&#x27;re the only graphing calculator on the market with anti-aliasing. It might not sound like much, but it&#x27;s a lot of work to get right and that&#x27;s the kind of detail we like to pay attention to.<p>Anyway, you can judge by yourself: our (free) simulator is just a click away: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numworks.com&#x2F;simulator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numworks.com&#x2F;simulator</a>')
