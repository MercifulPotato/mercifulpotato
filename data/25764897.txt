It&#x27;s much more effective to call someone else evil than to put forwards your ideas of good.<p>By calling me irrational, I do not need to be compromised with or taken seriously; compromise and dialogue is based on the fact that people are both making good faith efforts to engage. Part of what is chilling about the whole social media thing recently is that it&#x27;s arguing that it causes people to be in an irrational state and not to be taken seriously. Go home trump voters; you are drunk on social media.<p>So yeah, there is a lot of judging going on, because that kind of judging is more effective than compromise. You yourself sound like you are open minded more because people will need time to come to the undeniable truth than anything.')
