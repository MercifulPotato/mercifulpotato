Some thoughts from a former Twitch engineer:<p>- Probably the hardest part of running these things is managing outbound bandwidth costs. You&#x27;ll need to either limit inbound bitrate or transcode video down to a manageable rate, or else you&#x27;ll quickly spend a <i>lot</i> of money on shipping 4k video for people.<p>- Right now, your nginx hosts both do ingest and playback, if I understand it right. You might want to separate the two. It makes maintenance easier, and it lets you scale much better - right now, a single stream probably maxes out on viewership based on the CPU capacity of the single nginx host that is ingesting the stream, transcoding it, and delivering it. If you have multiple nginx hosts which could deliver the already-transcoded stream, you could scale much better.<p>- Please don&#x27;t keep using RTMP. RTMP is so stateful that it&#x27;s pretty hard to manage, it doesn&#x27;t have a spec, it doesn&#x27;t have implementations on many devices, and its security is, uh, _weak_. Big players are forced to keep using it because telling their broadcasters to change is hard, but you don&#x27;t have that problem. You might consider accepting an alternative modern protocol.<p>- You&#x27;ll almost certainly need admin and moderation tools soon. Expect lots of pirate streams, as well as some horrific content. You can&#x27;t run a live streaming platform without admin tools.<p>- Beware DDoS attacks. This setup looks very, very, very easy to take down, as-is...')
