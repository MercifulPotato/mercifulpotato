That&#x27;s why Netflix or Goldman Sachs can give unlimited time off and its rarely abused.  But if Walmart did it, their employees would take off 5 times a month for fake illnesses.<p>I worked as a unionized grocery clerk and essentially everyone used all their sick time.  People (including me) would call off just because they wanted to go to a party or something.<p>Some places try to avoid this by requiring a doctors note.  But that&#x27;s worse.  I worked for a midsize electronics company that had unlimited sick time, but I needed a doctors note for anytime. I literally ralphed in the bathroom mid-day on a friday and HR made me go to the doctor on Monday to justify it, even though I was already better.<p>That policy is crazy because it creates a transaction cost for sick days. If I have a bad cold or stomach virus, might as well go into work than go to the doctor right?')
