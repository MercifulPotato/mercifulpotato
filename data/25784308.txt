They vary in aesthetics and mechanics but none of them help you do the hugely valuable work of planning years out and then driving your weekly planning and daily activity off these huge goals.<p>More so, they profoundly fail to keep you accountable for (a) engaging in the system and (b) keeping the bulk of your activity on your most valuable goals.<p>There are certainly systems that you can implement on top of the existing applications but they leave it up to your discipline to run the system which - at least for people like me - isn&#x27;t the best way. I need someone or something to force me to do this high value work: sometimes that&#x27;s a boss, an admin, or coach who force me to say what my big work is and whether I am sticking to it. In the absence of that, I want the software to do it.<p>In retrospect it will seem silly that busy executives running multi-billion dollar enterprises are at best using the same tools that others use to, pun intended, &quot;Remember The Milk.&quot;<p>If someone knows of systems that claim to help with the above, let me know. Otherwise, if you think you&#x27;ll want to use something like this let me know as well.<p>At the very least I am building this for myself and a couple of like-minded folks. If this doesn&#x27;t bring in a dollar of direct revenue, it will anyway be a win by helping us to be more focused in our high leverage work. But I am willing to open this up wider so if there&#x27;s interest here, let me know and I&#x27;ll let you in on the beta whenever that comes around.')
