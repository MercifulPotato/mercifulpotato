Random access is expected to mean O(1) advancing of the iterator. I don&#x27;t think it can be done without upfront work and allocation at construction.<p>If one needs random access they can always do the bidirectional range -&gt; vector of string_views conversion.<p>Ranges are relatively new in the standard and not many algorithms landed in the library. I&#x27;m pretty sure there will be many new range algorithms in the upcoming standards. This particular algorithm is probably worth suggesting. I recommend floating the idea on the cpplang slack (there are #ranges and #future_standard channels) and&#x2F;or the std-proposals mailing list. I never wrote a proposal, but you can chat with people who did.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpplang.slack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpplang.slack.com&#x2F;</a><p>You can get an invitation here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpplang-inviter.cppalliance.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpplang-inviter.cppalliance.org&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.isocpp.org&#x2F;mailman&#x2F;listinfo.cgi&#x2F;std-proposals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.isocpp.org&#x2F;mailman&#x2F;listinfo.cgi&#x2F;std-proposals</a>')
