Item(by='elmo2you', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605477536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105086, text='&gt; I think it&#x27;s important to note that each attempt is a gamble, and not everyone can afford to keep losing.<p>This is true, and pretty much always has been. It&#x27;s also why, despite much propaganda (some know it better by the name of &quot;The American Dream&quot;) and a few lucky exceptions, entrepreneurship has mostly been an endeavor of the more privileged, with access to enough funds to make several mistakes (or sometimes multiple in parallel) before hitting a jackpot.<p>For some reason, this often appears a rather touchy subject, if not a cultural taboo. In particularly in the USA, where many apparently believe that taking a risk as an entrepreneur should somehow result in success if you persevere. Some might even feel almost entitled to it, or so it appears. Which is rather odd, if you&#x27;d ever look at the statistics of failed business. Not to mention the many crazy and often totally unrealistic ideas some folks come up with.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s all just a product of (cultural) brainwashing, ignorance, or just too much hope on a better live (or desperation about the current one).<p>EDIT:\nTo be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that how the system works is fair. As a personal opinion, on the contrary. But complaining about how things didn&#x27;t work out as you believed&#x2F;hoped they should have, is like being angry at a bull for attacking you while being a vegetarian. Neither bull nor the system care.')
