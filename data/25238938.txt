Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t so easy, because something like USB requires a software stack.  How much better it would be if all the hardware was memory-mapped!<p>Then we wouldn&#x27;t need an OS at all if we didn&#x27;t want one.<p>So, I&#x27;m still waiting for Raspberry Pis to be what they should have been in the first place. Pi&#x27;s seem to be going the wrong way simplicity-wise.<p>Maybe one day someone will come up with a RISC-V machine that satisfies this niche. Such a machine would be many many years away, though.')
