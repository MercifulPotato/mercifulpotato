The US is at 1170 deaths per day with 332 million people, for 3.5 deaths per million per day. That&#x27;s a factor of 1.7x worse by the US. In number of new cases it&#x27;s worse.<p>You&#x27;re doing math with the &quot;Today&quot; numbers that are not always reliable because not all US states have reported sometimes. The 7 day moving average numbers are more reliable.<p>It&#x27;s also very easy to lookup countries like Denmark, Finland and Norway that are much much better. Picking individual small countries is not a great methodology, particularly Czechia that did extremely well in the first wave and thus has a much more susceptible population.')
