A degree typically teaches things that are fairly static.<p>If you&#x27;re a biologist, I would expect 90% of the things you learned in college to still be true, or mostly true, when you retire.  A certificate, on the other hand, validates that you know this particular thing well, until the next version comes out.  Depending on what &quot;thing&quot; is, and when the last version was released, it could be less than a year.  So even if I accept that the certificate does mean you know this system really really well, it doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s true for very long.<p>They&#x27;re also an external validation of your skills, so people who aren&#x27;t confident in their skills will often mention their certificate when they feel their skills are being challenged.  I think this creates a bias in how we view certificate holders.  I&#x27;ve noticed the same thing with people who have degrees from prestigious institutions.  I&#x27;ve got a bad taste in my mouth from MIT because most of the people who went to MIT and I&#x27;m aware that they went to MIT like to bring it up when they don&#x27;t feel confident.  That&#x27;s not to say everyone who went to MIT is like that; the rest just don&#x27;t feel the need to constantly mention it, so I don&#x27;t even know.<p>They&#x27;re typically multiple choice as well, which are much easier to fake understanding on.  &quot;Which network architecture accommodates X best?&quot; is probably going to be easier to answer than &quot;You have a network with X servers that need Y bandwidth, etc, etc, explain what network architecture you would choose, and why.&quot;<p>And lastly, I think there&#x27;s a certain sense of derision for certificates for things created in our lifetime.  Things that came before us have a sense of tradition that gives them a sense of legitimacy.  Of course your accountant needs a degree, they&#x27;ve always had degrees.  New things don&#x27;t have that, so you have to justify why a certification is necessary, and most don&#x27;t meet the bar.  Everyone managed to use GitHub just fine without a certification.')
