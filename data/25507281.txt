Of course, seldon-core does not automate infra provisioning, but based on my previous point, I think many teams are better off being more hands on with this infra.<p>Lastly, there is a third tool missing from the mix - monitoring. I think cortex offers some tools in this area, but I wish they would make a part two showing how the monitoring functionality they offer can integrate into a retraining pipeline within metaflow. This post shows you how to get started, but it doesn&#x27;t show you how to maintain applications long term.')
