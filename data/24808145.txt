Not even a radio. Have the operation of the car be up to driver skill, not computer programmer virtuosity. (And I&#x27;m a programmer!)<p>Of course, it is possible to make mechanical computers, but they are very costly to develop, heavy, take up lots of space, hard to modify, etc. Besides, it&#x27;s a lost art.')
