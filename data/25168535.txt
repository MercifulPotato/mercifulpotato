Often, when designing a system, I did not have enough information about how it will actually be used (and in some cases - neither did anyone else; when you create a market all you have is guesses). Things I was sure weren’t important turned out to be important, and vice versa.<p>E.g. in one of the systems, prior business analysis showed that legally valid “chain of custody” would be an issue, which dictated very specific (and often costly, performance wise) decisions.<p>And then after the 3rd customer deployment, it turned out that they don’t care - they’d rather pay less for everything, and lose every 20th claim. And after the 20th customer it was proved beyond the shadow of a doubt.<p>It was stupid to believe what customers said ahead of time, yes. But I don’t think that’s the kind of stupid you are\nReferring to.')
