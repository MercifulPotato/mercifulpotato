They are quite different.<p>Facebook is a social network. On occasion, with a warrant approved by an independent Judiciary, an agency may request on a case by case basis, information relating to a specific concern for which there are specific indications warranting a search - much like the search of your car or home.<p>WeChat is a control, censorship and surveillance network.<p>- WeChat, like &gt;90% of Chinese companies, has CCP party apparatus that work within the company who overview protocol to ensure loyalty to the CCP agenda. The US &#x27;equivalent&#x27; would be the CIA having staff at Facebook to intercede in policy decisions and to make sure &#x27;The Man in the White House&#x27; has his policy objectives met.<p>- WeChat censors everything. If you, right now, start saying something negative about Xi, it will likely get censored by one of the massive army of censors. The US equivalent would be 100% of Facebook posts going through a &#x27;large office in Virginia&#x27; where President&#x27;s political operatives oversee censorship.<p>- WeChat censors anything they want, for whatever reason. Winnie the Pooh comparisons to Xi? Banned. References to Tiannamen or Hong Kong protest? Banned. The US equivalent would be Facebook banning all memes mocking Trump, and of course, banning any and all activity related to BLM, social justice, protests, any kind of history that contradicts the ruling American party&#x27;s official view of the world.<p>- WeChat is used used to identify networks of civil antagonists. Have you said something about &#x27;Hong Kong&#x27;? Well, you&#x27;re friends are going to be tagged and more likely monitored. The US equivalent would be government operatives sifting through the Facebook DB all day, using that information to monitor your friends messages, because you said &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27;.<p>- WeChat is used for a host of other things including payment etc. meaning the breach of privacy is considerably more significant. Everything you buy, everywhere you travel etc. tracked and monitored at all times.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;campaigns&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;which-messaging-apps-best-protect-your-privacy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;campaigns&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;which-me...</a>')
