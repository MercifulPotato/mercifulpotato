Schellenberger?  No, sorry, it&#x27;s not worth considering his arguments for anything.  His arguments go like this...<p>- We don&#x27;t need to worry about the Amazon burning and being cut down because it&#x27;s not actually the &quot;lungs of the world&quot;<p>- We don&#x27;t need to worry about sea-level rise because the Netherlands<p>- Burning wood is much worse than burning petroleum, so let&#x27;s keep burning petroleum<p>Etc.  Schellenberger is an idiot trying to be an iconoclast... and failing miserably because the icons he&#x27;s tilting at are windmills.  Let&#x27;s leave Schellenberger out of this.')
