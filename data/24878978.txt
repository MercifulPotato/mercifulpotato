IIT feels like trying to fit  the problem into a ready made concept, and  doesn&#x27;t start from where  it should - why should there be consciousness in the first place? for survival (my answer). RL with its agent centric setting is much more suited to answer such questions. Agents with goals, embedded into the environment are a better starting point than integrated information that exists who knows why.')
