Item(by='_jesseb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607006231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288426, text='I recently gave it a try and it generally feels nice starting out, but I started running into rough edges pretty quickly, enough that I don&#x27;t think I would want to build a large app using it. Main complaint is how it handles styles, it does not allow you to apply styles to the edge of a component without doing one of several workarounds, all of which have downsides. Means it&#x27;s very hard to create a set of generic styled components and then apply layout to them using a parent, which makes it a bit of a pain to reuse things, which is kinda the point of component based libraries.<p>I also get the feeling that the Svelte maintainers do not particularly care what the community wants and are building what they want, which is totally cool, but unfortunately I disagree with a lot of their choices so I guess it&#x27;s not for me.')
