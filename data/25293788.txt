The community of radio astronomers is feeling the loss of Arecibo very keenly.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned this in a previous comment [1] so I won&#x27;t rehash it again, but here [2] is a statement from the NANOGrav collaboration - we have been using the Arecibo telescope on a weekly basis (along with the Green Bank telescope) to observe a large number of radio pulsars for over 15 years now, and when we announce the first detection of very low frequency gravitational waves, Arecibo data will play a critical role.<p>This loss really hurts. The US community is scrambling, and we are going to have to rely on the generosity of our international partners going forward - there&#x27;s just not going to be enough telescope time to do all the science that we&#x27;d judged as very important through competitive review processes.<p>(And that&#x27;s before we get into the unique radar capability, etc.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25154898" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25154898</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanograv.org&#x2F;announcement,&#x2F;press&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;Arecibo.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanograv.org&#x2F;announcement,&#x2F;press&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;Arecibo.h...</a>')
