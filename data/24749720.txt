All the off the shelf software is essentially rented.<p>Software itself has no legal value - the copyright is what is considered to be property.  That property can be leased or sold.  This is why copyright infringement is called infringement and not theft.<p>When you “buy” software, you are actually entering into a lease contract to use the software (sometimes perpetual, but increasingly only temporary) which can have various terms and conditions (that you really should read, but never do).  But that lease doesn’t grant you the copyright.')
