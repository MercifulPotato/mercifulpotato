Receiving isnâ€™t hard. I also routinely get mail from the past dozen or so tenants who had my address, so you could just use a fake addressee as well.<p>When USPS does randomly seize a package (such as a fake ID caught at customs) the end result is nothing happens to the receiver other than the package not arriving.')
