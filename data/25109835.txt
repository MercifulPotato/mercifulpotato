Of course there have been sh*t moments like Windows Vista and Windows 8, but Windows 2k, XP, 7, and now 10 (enterprise version), have always been good to me.<p>I can use Linux for sure, and I appreciate the effort the community does, however, for my use case, I don&#x27;t see the advantage of using Linux over Windows, and I find many disadvantages: missing software (office, adobe, although I have run it under wine), missing or not perfect drivers (energy efficiency is a problem even on thinkpads).<p>Again, I really like the effort, and if I must use it, I can, but I don&#x27;t see the advantage.<p>Now, I use it on my dad&#x27;s computer (he is 80), as it is much difficult for him to screw up than Windows.')
