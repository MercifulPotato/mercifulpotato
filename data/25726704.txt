You just have to open the built in camera app, then click this icon[0]. It defaults to the translator camera, which I find really that you can just point at text and it translates it on your screen. Then there&#x27;s a picture of a square with a line down the center that turns on the QR scanner.<p>As you can imagine, when all the covid checkins started, I couldn&#x27;t find this. Everyone would say to me &quot;just open the camera on your iPhone it&#x27;s easy&quot; as though it was a given that every visitor was using an Apple phone.<p>I went through three different QR apps based on what I found on the play store and all of them blasted me with inappropriate ads I kept wishing I didn&#x27;t open in public. A bit if visibility in the UX would have solved this.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;L5XG21G" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;L5XG21G</a>')
