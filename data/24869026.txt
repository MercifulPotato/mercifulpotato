He was providing his credentials to another contractor who impersonated him, which is something that he probably would not have tried in the office!<p>Although maybe he would have tried it, because the impersonator called into meetings and everyone noticed that he sounded completely different (had much better English) and the work was different (less skilled)!  If it was me, I would be checking the sub-sub-contractors work and at a minimum calling into meetings myself ;)')
