Each time she seemed delighted about the gift idea. Everybody just joked that she bought too much of it initially and was now slowly clearing her storage. After another 3 years without any obvious symptoms (she took care of the house, drove her car, went shopping, used her bank card, managed all correspondence with banks and insurances), my grandfather mentioned to her something that implied that her mother was dead (she had been for over 15 years). She didn&#x27;t remember and had a complete breakdown.<p>Being affected by this when you are <i>40</i> is just heartbreaking.')
