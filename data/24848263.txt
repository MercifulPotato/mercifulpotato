Disconnecting does not free the GPU.<p>Which is ultimately a bug, or a missing feature, in MacOS -- it shouldn&#x27;t be possible for a random broken app to make your 10h battery only last 1h -- change my mind.<p>Coincidentally, even though MacBook Pro 16&quot; has a much larger battery than MacBook Air -- ~100Wh vs. ~50Wh -- MBP is also capable of consuming said battery at a much faster rate -- 100W vs. 30W.  So, if you need an average web-browsing machine with the best battery runtime in the presence of silly apps that consume all available resources, it&#x27;s actually a much better choice to get MBA vs. MBP.<p>Why Apple doesn&#x27;t introduce a setting to optimise the runtime for battery, or a lap-use mode, is beyond me.  I had to install Turbo Boost Switcher to make my 2020 MBP16&quot; usable as a laptop -- it runs out of battery, and is too hot to use on a lap, otherwise.  Sadly, there&#x27;s not even any tool to reliable turn off the graphics card, either -- I had to find a setting to switch it off in Firefox manually.')
