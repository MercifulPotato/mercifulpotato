JLCPCB (and others, but I have the most experience with them) will do 5 boards for $2 + shipping and the first order gets free shipping. I&#x27;ve used this service for prototyping many times and had great experiences.<p>I had been planning to build almost the exact same thing as what the parent posted but had been putting it off because I didn&#x27;t want to draw up a PCB, so this is perfect.')
