You go to a sales call and say you want X, and then their engineering department prepares a datasheet saying that their product supports X.  (Obviously the hardware supports X, but it may be kind of broken, so it&#x27;s easier to tell customers that don&#x27;t ask for it by name that it&#x27;s not there.)')
