Do you want to be remembered as a jerk?<p>Don&#x27;t really care, to be honest. I won&#x27;t be there. Nor do I care about my funeral, where (or if) I&#x27;m buried, or any thing else post-death.<p>But please tell me how my behavior is that of a jerk. I&#x27;m of the opinion that someone&#x27;s reputation should be based on what they did while they are alive. How does the act of dying change or otherwise mitigate a dead person&#x27;s despicable actions?<p>And how does pointing that out make me a jerk?')
