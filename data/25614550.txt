You think they rigged the tests, and want to publish your own X vs. Y comparison but Y&#x27;s TOS prohibits it.<p>Once one major Y does this, many others follow suit as a defensive measure against Y.<p>I seem to recall seeing some where X&#x27;s TOS would try to limit the prohibition to just that situation, such as saying that you could only publish X vs. Y performance comparisons if either there were no restrictions on others publishing Y performance comparisons or Y granted X an exception to Y&#x27;s prohibition.')
