The reason they stated for leaving CA is due to logistics, i.e. a company can&#x27;t process hiring paperwork for hundreds of thousands of people out of thin air. A more apt comparison would be your state government saying you have 6 months to rebuild your wooden house with bricks or face exorbitant fines. In that position, it wouldn&#x27;t be a tantrum for you to decide to leave said state.<p>Regardless, CA is a big market for rideshare, so even if they leave, Uber will surely come back to CA once they make whatever changes they need to their platform to conform with the local regulations. That&#x27;s what they did in Austin.')
