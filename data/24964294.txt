In the article, the scary near misses they talked about fell into that category rather than into the &quot;actual airbag deployment&quot; category.<p>It would be nice to have however I think it misrepresents. If the end result of having Autopilot on is that the driver, on average, crashes less then it&#x27;s an improvement, even if the driver has to regularly intervene. What&#x27;s important is the end effect, not how it happens.')
