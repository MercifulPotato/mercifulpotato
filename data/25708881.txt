Perhaps the moderation on Twitter has a bias to one camp or its users have a heavy bias to only reporting the content that they think &#x27;violates the ToS&#x27;.<p>The fact is, both social networking sites here have this content hosted on AWS and either have a poor or a bias in moderation of this content.')
