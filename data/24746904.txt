This is not an honest evaluation<p>&gt; nuclear waste isnâ€™t a glowing toxic ooze<p>That&#x27;s irrelevant, whether true or false waste has to be handled. So far it&#x27;s not been done well, and language like that is appeal to emotion, not facts.<p>The comment of 300 times waste from solar panels than nuclear doesn&#x27;t reflect the different waste types.<p>I&#x27;m not actually against nuclear intrinsically but pieces like this are not honest nor therefore, useless.')
