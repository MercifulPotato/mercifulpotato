How much of a standard boring Linux distro is written in zig? (That&#x27;s an honest question, not a justification or even a defense to ship broken software.)<p>So yes, the headline is most likely misleading: It should be &quot;The state of debugging zig binaries in NixOS.&quot; I expect that debugging a C binary on OpenSUSE[1] would give different results.<p>[1] I picked OpenSUSE here because installing library source is very easy and to my limited experience gdb just finds it. I haven&#x27;t used OpenSUSE for a while. I have never used NixOS, so no clue whether that would rank above or below average.')
