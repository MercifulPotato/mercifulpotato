That demand represents an ideal; there will always be errors, but the insistence that all errors are unavoidable and that (as the parent suggested) we shouldn&#x27;t even talk about them is extremely irritating.  It provides the enemies of the welfare state with the best possible arguments (&quot;you don&#x27;t even care if the money is going to people who need it&quot;).')
