I use index cards as notes for experimental recipes, processes, etc. I can store those in the pockets of the folder. Then information or recipes that I find useful, I will transcribe into the notebook. I have divider tabs in the notebook to separate my hobbies (wine making, canning, mushroom culturing, etc).')
