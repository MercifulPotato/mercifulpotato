I moved to Portland. And yes, property values here have risen quite a bit since then. And many moved to Seattle where prices have risen even more.<p>Changing your question a bit: Given that prices here in Portland (and Seattle) are relatively high now (though not nearly so much as SV) what are some other lower cost alternatives on or near the west coast? Maybe Spokane. Possibly Olympia. Eugene? Though now we&#x27;re getting into smaller urban areas.')
