Some would even argue that there is no reason for it to exist. There are a few competing theories of gravity that don&#x27;t jive at all with what&#x27;s discussed in pseudo-factual language in the patent.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that his only source cited seems to be his own, albeit peer reviewed, paper. I hope <i>that</i> paper at least cites someone other than himself. So all this talk about gravitons being EM and photon carriers is a whole lot of guestimating. It doesn&#x27;t seem to connect in any way with LIGO&#x27;s expectations and results.<p>It makes sense to patent an idea based on what he&#x27;s hoping will eventually become a fleshed out scientific theory with proofs and whatnot, it doesn&#x27;t mean any of it will turn out to be correct. It just means if it does find proof, he could get rich.')
