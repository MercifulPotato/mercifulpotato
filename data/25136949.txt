I&#x27;m sure the 737 Max is as safe as any other plane to fly in.<p>What&#x27;s still troubling to me is that the FAA was allowing Boeing to parlay it&#x27;s way into 2017 using 1967 certifications.<p>&quot;The 737 was first certified by the FAA in 1967. Like every new 737 model since then, the MAX has been approved partially with the original requirements and partially with more current regulations, enabling certain rules and requirements to be grandfathered in. Chief executive Dai Whittingham of the independent trade group UK Flight Safety Committee disputed the idea that the MAX was just another 737, saying, &quot;It is a different body and aircraft but certifiers gave it the same type rating.&quot;')
