Devices have different red, green and blue light sources.<p>I know it sounds like nitpicking, but we are talking about subtle differences in shades of beige, after all.<p>An LCD display will have a white backlight, with some distribution of wavelengths, and each pixel has filters that pass a certain band of wavelengths (one band each for red, one for green, one blue).  Different LCDs will use different backlights, with different filters.  An OLED will have a three kinds of emitters, each with its own distribution of wavelengths.  CRTs used to have three kind of phosphors that glowed with their own characteristic colors.<p>Now, if you could give us the CIE XYZ coordinates of the color, or the CIELAB coordinates, that would be very helpful.  They are device-independent.')
