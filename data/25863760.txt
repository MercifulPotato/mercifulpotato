Things that help:<p>- If it&#x27;s <i>work related</i>, i.e. my math studies related to my astrophysics related work project, try to flow into it after work. I&#x27;m probably already in the right mental frame and have the motivation (something in the project was stymying me or piqued my curiosity).<p>- If it&#x27;s <i>not work related</i>, take a break, preferably something physical. I used to run after work, now I row and do some bodyweight exercises + yoga (I&#x27;ll run again once it&#x27;s not below freezing with ice on the sidewalks). This exhausts me physically, but creates a <i>complete</i> break from my work. After a shower, I feel refreshed, and can get to whatever it is I want to do.')
