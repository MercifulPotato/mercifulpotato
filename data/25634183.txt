The number of paper dollar didn&#x27;t increase by ~70% this year, what did is an <i>economic aggregate</i> called M1 which is a conventional (since the sixties) way of counting certain things. It ISN&#x27;T some fundamental value of what-money-is®. Most of the dollar every American own (their bank account, and their savings) have never been part of M1, so this money wasn&#x27;t affected either.<p>The monetary system is a complex thing, and the landscape is changing at a fast pace since 2008, which makes it even harder to graps. Unfortunately, most cryptofans didn&#x27;t even try to understand it, and they keep parroting the almost 100 years-old Autrian critique of central-banking without any kind of cognitive effort: “It&#x27;s obviously broken, so I&#x27;m not going to try understanding it”.<p>For people without prejudices, interested in understanding the subject, I strongly recommend Perry G Mehrling&#x27;s lecture on the Economics of Money and banking on coursera: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;money-banking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;money-banking</a>')
