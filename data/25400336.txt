(You know the saying that everyone wittingly or unwittingly commits three crimes a day?) Several Russian agents were indicted for Russiagate-related things; Putin will turn his goons over to US custody any day now!<p>Then we have people like Carter Page, whose name was raked over the coals for years because a FBI lawyer intentionally altered evidence (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;fbi-ig-report-russia-investigation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;fbi-ig-report...</a>) showing that far from being a Russian asset, Page had for years briefed the CIA every time he met with suspicious Russians. (Got to love how the Times describes said altering evidence as a &quot;serious error&quot;.) You want an actual Russiagate-related indictment and guilty plea? Kevin Clinesmith, said FBI lawyer, is your man.')
