We ban accounts that do that, regardless of what they&#x27;re battling for or againstâ€”we have to, because it destroys what this site is supposed to exist for. I&#x27;m not going to ban you because your account has mostly been posting good comments. On the other hand, mostly-not-exploding-bombs is not sufficient. If you&#x27;d please review the site guidelines and be more mindful of the intended spirit of the site going forward, we&#x27;d be grateful. Perhaps you don&#x27;t owe your enemies better, but you owe this community better if you&#x27;re participating in it.')
