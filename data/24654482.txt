Homeless services are expensive. It&#x27;s cheaper to get them apartments, even if you still offer them all of the support services you were offering before.<p>We already do that, though, through things like food stamps and section 8 housing. It&#x27;s expensive, but it works, because it keeps a lot of poor people fed and sheltered.<p>The visible homeless that you see are people who tend to have additional problems, on top of being poor (Untreated addiction and mental health problems are two big causes of this.)')
