Topic was about China but I brought up that everyone else does it too (US, Russia, Israel, Germany, etc) and people thought it was insane and a conspiracy theory(specifically that anyone would want to influence Reddit because it is &quot;a small website&quot;). It honestly feels like we&#x27;re gaslighting ourselves because this topic has been so openly discussed over the last 50 years that it is hard to say that this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> happening. Though maybe because I suggested agencies use memes now instead of more well known sock puppets.<p>Even on HN news I&#x27;ve been downvoted for this. I guess people don&#x27;t think memes are being weaponized, even when they are explicitly referred to as such by those in the military[0] and other agencies. Actually one thing I&#x27;ve liked about The Boys (on Prime) is how it shows the viral marketing of Stormfront and how it is manipulating people (and how people didn&#x27;t even notice the not even remotely subtle naming of the character). I guess that just shows how effective of a tool all this is.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qOTYgcdNrXE?t=1287" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qOTYgcdNrXE?t=1287</a>')
