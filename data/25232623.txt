Item(by='noch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606511696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232425, text='&gt; You are delusional if you think that 200 years of modern mathematics, physics and astronomy can be mastered by a single person, let alone an average person, who rarely has the mental capacity to even understand most of the material en detail.<p><i>You</i> are delusional if you imagine I said you should master everything. In fact, I said you should make the effort. Recall, John Nash said that in graduate school he had to reinvent 300 years of mathematics for himself? And just how many books did Witten say he studied in a year in graduate school on his own?<p>Try to calm down and question your assumptions. I&#x27;m not your enemy.<p>Trying to understand stuff before asking for an opinion is a habit. If you don&#x27;t practice it, you can&#x27;t do it, and you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if you instead believe that the default should instead be relying on others who practice the habit.<p>Importantly, the habit of doing your own homework is actually a muscle: if you don&#x27;t strengthen it, it will atrophy or never develop. The stronger it is, the faster working through physics and mathematics and chemistry papers becomes. Perhaps we can do better than our masters from the Renaissance if we try?<p>&gt; Stick with playing the cello then<p>Thanks! That&#x27;s kind of you to say. It&#x27;s a struggle but I&#x27;m getting there.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t as simple as music theory or perfecting motor functions by means of practising.<p>You think music is simple? You are totally trolling me. I like your sense of humour.')
