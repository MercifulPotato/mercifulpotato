(Though I expect usage will certainly go down as prices rise and coverage may get thinner as a result.)<p>I don&#x27;t know about prepared food delivery. Dominos makes it work well. A lot of Chinese restaurants do, usually for a pretty small delivery radius. But there are a lot of things that just don&#x27;t have a critical mass of people willing to pay for what 30 minute delivery costs. (On the other hand, the consensus seems to be that grocery delivery, or just pickup, is going to stay fairly common going forward.)')
