Item(by='frongpik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608753572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520372, text='Ads are inherently immoral and it&#x27;s ok to watch a movie for free as nothing is stolen in that case. Ads are immoral because the website gets access to the biggest distribution channel in history - the internet, access to the financial system, a huge educated society and all this for free, and for this opportunity it sneakily builds a profile of visitors and sells that info to whoever pays. On top of that it dares to annoy visitors with tasteless visuals. Imagine someone wants to start a business and is given an opportunity be seen by hundreds of potentials clients: they come to his party curious to see what&#x27;s there, but he secretly takes pictures of all visitors, records who talks to whom, takes photos of contact lists in their phones, and then sells all that to the highest bidder. On top of that he suddenly starts loud tv ads on a huge bright lcd screen to feature some junk paid by nobody knows who. Only then, after wasting everyone&#x27;s time and profiting off their personal data, the host dares to pitch his business idea. So yeah, if a website treats me like trash, I&#x27;ll do the same in return.')
