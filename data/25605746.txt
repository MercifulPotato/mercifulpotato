Consumers like to be able to order from home through an app from a wide range of restaurants.<p>This is actually the problem restaurants are facing: How to adapt to change technology and consumers habits? A bit like traditional taxis were blown out of the water by Uber.<p>Restaurants don&#x27;t have to offer delivery&#x2F;takeaway, and indeed traditionally they don&#x27;t (at least in Europe). They&#x27;ll have to decide how to adapt and that may include focusing on the in premises experience instead of chasing online sales.<p>But, again, this bill does not solve problems, and may actually be counter-productive as already explained, and you&#x27;re certainly not giving me an example to the contrary.<p>As a side note, and something to consider: these platforms are very good for the taxman as they make tax evasion all but impossible (and I suspect that has a financial impact on more restaurants that they wish to admit).')
