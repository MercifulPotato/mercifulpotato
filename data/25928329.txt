When I work at corporate I work maybe 2-3 hours a day. When I work on my personal projects I work more than 8 a day. All that time sitting around procrastinating isn&#x27;t necessary to do the actual work, it is just a waste of time (not for me, I got paid the same as when I put in effort, but for the world).<p>Edit: And just to clarify, I always got stellar performance reviews, quick promotions and large salary bumps. Corporate just doesn&#x27;t demand much from you so it is hard to motivate yourself to do the job when nobody else performs well either. This includes Google etc, at least the teams I worked at there.')
