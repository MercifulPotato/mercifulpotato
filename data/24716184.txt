It was on the news here in Japan this morning - flu cases have pretty much disappeared this season - presumably because everyone is wearing masks.<p>&gt;Where do you get your data about annual influenza deaths? If you have a good source, I&#x27;m willing to take a look.<p>I can look for it, but IIRC the several 10,000 annual influenza deaths are a statistical projection.  There was an article somewhere from someone in ER during the peak of the COVID-19 deaths saying they had pretty much never seen an actual influenza death - and that was the experience of other people in ER - so there was a mismatch between the statistical projection and lived experience.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s important not only so you don&#x27;t get sick, but also so you don&#x27;t spread it to others who may have a weaker immune system. We&#x27;re all in this together.<p>The best way to do that is to wear masks.  Here in Japan - nobody here ever said that &quot;masks don&#x27;t work for non-medics who haven&#x27;t been trained to put them on properly&quot;.  So we don&#x27;t now have the problem with lots of MAGA folks running around saying &quot;masks don&#x27;t work&quot;.')
