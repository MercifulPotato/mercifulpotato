It had a 24bit address space for 16MB of memory, but then again the 8088 itself already had a 20bit address space (for 1MB), and both could only continuously address 64kB without segmentation.<p>It was also famously called &quot;braindead&quot;, mostly because switching into 286 Protected Mode to make use of its new features pretty much meant turning off 8088&#x2F;8086 compatibility (unless you used some horrible tricks).<p>When the 80386 came along with its real 32bit register set and address space, and significantly increased compatibility even in Protected Mode through vm86 and a few other additions, it really made a tremendous impact in comparison.<p>And while DOS was still 16bit, it would now often run in memory managers (e.g. QEMM, EMM386...) as a vm86 task in Protected Mode, making some good use of some of the new 32bit features.')
