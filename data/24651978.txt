It was mostly pipe-fitters getting certified in the class and I was able work on whatever projects I wanted. I started with stick, then went to MIG, and then did a follow on class where I told them I just wanted to do Oxy-Ace.  I think now they offer a more variety of classes, for people who want to do art and such.<p>If I recall, flux core is dirtier, and having a tank of argon on your cart isn&#x27;t too expensive for a shielding gas.  I lived in a studio and luckily my neighbors were cool with me running a chops saw.')
