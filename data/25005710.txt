The theoretical complexity of Anu is improved compared to Pijul. The complexity of Pijul is in O(log l) where l is the number of lines written since the beginning of history, whereas Anu is in O(e) where e is the number of edits. Since each edit has at least one line, this is always better, and Anu can in fact handle large repositories (Linux kernel, Nixpkgs), that Pijul couldln&#x27;t handle.')
