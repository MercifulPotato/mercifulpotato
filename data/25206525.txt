Building kernel&#x27;s when the device is unplugged seems to indicate its stuck in battery save mode despite the OS requesting a higher perf profile.<p>Ugh, and certain OEMs (HP for one) don&#x27;t let the user tweak these settings in the BIOS because they apparently want to charge people to change things like whether the laptop supports S3 mode (for linux). If one spends a bit of time reversing the bios, a lot of options show up that aren&#x27;t accessible by default, including the precision boost options.<p>I get HP&#x2F;etc doesn&#x27;t want random &quot;leet&quot; pc users messing with the power&#x2F;thermal settings, but hiding them with alt-a&#x2F;fn-f1&#x2F;etc advanced menus probably took care of 99.9% of the support requests while leaving people with an out. Changing the password&#x2F;key-combo on the recent machine is mostly incompetence, as is failing to follow the OS&#x27;s performance requests (which is seemingly a large part of the problem here).')
