What do you believe china will do with the info gleaned from TikTok data?<p>Personally I am more afraid of my own government than I am of china,  See my government has the power to put me in a cage, or even kill me if I defy them.  They have a the power to unilaterally declare an &quot;emergency&quot; to put me under house arrest, they have the power to close my business at will....<p>If china attempted to any of these things to me here in the US that would be an act of war, but when my own government does it that is perfectly acceptable and even endorsed by the courts of this land<p>So why pray tell do believe China is the threat?')
