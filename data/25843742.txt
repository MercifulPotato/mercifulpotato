Called my HMO, made a same day appointment for their vaccination center at the local stadium, went there by bus in the rain.  swiped in with my card when I got there and was given a number.  waited close to an hour for my number to be called, got quickly stabbed in the upper arm an soon left.<p>It really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard.
