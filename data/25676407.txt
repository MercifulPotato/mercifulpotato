My take:<p>there&#x27;s a large security perimeter that&#x27;s already been breached, and the video shows one chokepoint of the perimeter that hasn&#x27;t yet been breached.<p>The officers at that checkpoint know what the situation is: They aren&#x27;t going to do any good in an open space surrounded by a mob of thousands.  They are moving back to a more defensible position (presumably where they can buy time to evacuate the Congress floors).  They are calmly walking because breaking into a jog could incite the mob further.<p>I don&#x27;t see them opening the gates.')
