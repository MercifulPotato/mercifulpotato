These are now rivalling the first wave<p>Are you sure? This is the data I&#x27;m looking at:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-02-22..latest&amp;country=NLD~DEU~ESP~GBR&amp;region=Europe&amp;deathsMetric=true&amp;interval=smoothed&amp;hideControls=true&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=7&amp;pickerMetric=total_cases_per_million&amp;pickerSort=desc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToS...</a><p>This link goes to &quot;confirmed deaths&quot; per million people, see also the &quot;case fatality rate&quot; setting. The former is about 6.8 now versus 13.8 at the peak in April; the latter is 3% versus 15% at the peak in April. There are half as many deaths and a fifth of the deaths per case. That&#x27;s not even close to &quot;rivaling it despite being geared up&quot;, at least from this data. Is this data wrong?')
