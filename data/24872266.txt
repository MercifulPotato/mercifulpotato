It&#x27;s hard to know the true requirements until the system is actually in production. You can&#x27;t realistically pre-learn many domain lessons: you just have to dive in and see what floats by setting sail.<p>Finding the best balancing point is hard to turn into a sure-fire formula. I use experience (age) to make a best guess based on on past successes and failures and project types.<p>One tip is to collect and keep a list of questions and suggestions, and make sure they are sufficiently explored. You can&#x27;t answer questions that have not been asked, but AT LEAST answer those that are asked. Make sure staff is not afraid to ask questions or make suggestions.')
