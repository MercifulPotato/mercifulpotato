It would pay off any upfront cost if, on the long run, the server uses ie. 50% less energy than x86 alternatives for the same bang.<p>Now, the thing is that the typical cloud or datacenter machine today is more of a custom built piece of witchcraft than an off-the-shelf blade. So, meh, maybe not. But an ARM-based cloud, Apple or not, sound like the way to go, at least for the long term.')
