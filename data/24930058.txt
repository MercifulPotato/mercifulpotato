It&#x27;s ok to make fun of something. It&#x27;s generally not ok to joke that, say, a race is intrinsically inferior to another, or that women are sexual objects, or that white dudes are just there to earn money or whatever antagonism floats your boat. It&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t be illegal to make such jokes, but it should be shamed out of the mainstream.<p>You being triggered by other people being triggered is the height of irony.')
