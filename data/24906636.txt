I have no words of wisdom or insight...<p>I wish I hadn&#x27;t said I &#x27;hated&#x27; living here - that was an unconsidered comment that really doesn&#x27;t properly reflect how I feel. Let&#x27;s say &#x27;dislike&#x27;.<p>There are other places I&#x27;ve lived that I&#x27;d prefer to move to, but I&#x27;m happy in my job and content with my home, and have a lot of good (mostly Swedish) friends, and to stay relevant to the thread, I love outdoor life (though to balance that, as others have mentioned, allemansr√§tt isn&#x27;t as easy or all-encompassing as one is led to believe).<p>I think the disillusion is a large part of my problem. And the fact I haven&#x27;t seen sunshine for over 2,5 weeks...')
