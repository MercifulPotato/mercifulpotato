They are going down the road of &quot;who needs uni, just use our text, our online learning aids, our online _courses_&quot;... With each new ad from the textbook publishing company, I see a push to have learners just use their material... the large problem is the university expects you to use books from well known publishers, so they have leverage to get you to use the book+material.<p>Big tech giving software and courses is one thing, but those come and go... it is like learning to use any tool, hey do you use a DeWalt or Milwaukee? Each are the same but different. In 10 years, you might use a completely different tool, but the tool was just that, it is the ideas and concepts that you are supposed to learn in (and outside of) the classroom. It is my job to teach you _how_ to solve problems, perhaps using the DeWalt or the Milwaukee or both.<p>Eh, as others have noted, companies have been donating for years, we could argue that grants shape our research too, but as long as professors keep the goal in mind (how do I get students to effectively and efficiently solve problems using available tools of the day), I think our future will be alright.')
