For larger jobs (hours, days) the solution proposed by Google Cloud is to use AI Platform Training, but this requires for us to rewrite Notebooks. \nAn we don&#x27;t want to rewrite code in Notebook to dispatch it to a different system.<p>One of the ideas we started looking is to use Notebooks in K8s using JupyterHub.<p>Does anyone uses JupyerHub in production?<p>We already have a dedicated k8s cluster and the expertise to manage it so I can think JupyerHub can be a good solution where each notebook runs in a pod that can be scale up&#x2F;down  Any pointers or comments about the experience are appreciated')
