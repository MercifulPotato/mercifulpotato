I see other EU users say that WhatsApp is absolutely dominant in their countries, and yet everybody i know uses iMessage, which may not be surprising if you look at graphs like this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;os-market-share&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;denmark" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;os-market-share&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;denmark</a><p>For &quot;social circles&quot;, coordinating sports activites and more, people use Facebook or Facebook Messenger, which is just as bad as WhatsApp.<p>Schools here use Microsoft Teams for remote teaching classes, and Office365 for schoolwork, and there&#x27;s not a single Google account to be found anywhere. O365 may be just as bad, but the contract is negotiated on a government level, and bound by the GDPR and other local laws, so i assume my kids personal data are relatively secure.')
