On one hand I appreciate these kinds of posts because they bring math with intuition to broader masses.<p>On the other hand, it makes people believe that they have understood what&#x27;s there to understand and move on. In a sense, they contribute to the Dunning-Kruger effect.<p>The article illustrates this quite well. The intuition is presented well, but is no substitute for actually learning math. The first two questions in the end:<p>&gt; Why is one function reversed?<p>&gt; Why is convolution commutative?<p>With having studied math &quot;properly&quot;, it&#x27;s immediately obvious that they are answers to each other. Defining it with the &quot;reversal&quot; on one function is what makes the operation commutative by introducing a somewhat hidden symmetry and that&#x27;s a quite common trick in mathematics.<p>The other two questions are also quite clear with some actual math background. Not M.Sc. level math, just some proper calculus. You just need to sit down and do the math, which can take half a page of pen-on-paper. That&#x27;s what math is, you need to work it.<p>Again, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I appreciate the effort. But those types of posts don&#x27;t make you more fluid in math than reading a popular science article about Alpha Centauri makes you an astronomer or an expose about Covid-19 makes you an epidemioloist. It&#x27;s popular science and can&#x27;t replace the actual study of the subject.')
