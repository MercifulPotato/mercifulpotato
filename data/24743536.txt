One time someone played a cassette of To The Extreme from the beginning (I forget the setting; maybe I was hanging out with a friend from school), and I remember hearing an ascending sequence of tones (probably sine waves), each one an octave higher than the previous, before the first song started. Of all the many cassettes I ever listened to as a kid, this might have been one of two or three that ever started this way. Does anyone here know what I&#x27;m talking about? What were those tones for, and why did this cassette in particular have them? From what I&#x27;ve read, I gather that this particular cassette might have been a copy made on someone&#x27;s home tape deck. Or did legitimate commercial copies have those tones too?<p>&lt;&#x2F;tangent&gt;')
