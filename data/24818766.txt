After about 3 days it was impossible to use them - my brain actively stayed awake with them in, trying to find the sounds it &#x27;knew&#x27; were there.<p>Switched to bose QC20 and... they&#x27;re generally <i>great</i> ... except... don&#x27;t sleep in them!  They&#x27;ll break.  Often.   I&#x27;ve switched to cheap earbuds from the dollar store tied to a white noise app.  The $5 earbuds may break every 1-3 months, I just get more.<p>The &#x27;sleep buds&#x27; look nice, but would be hard to justify another ~$300 at this point.')
