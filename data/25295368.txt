I like using my linux desktop because I can set it up exactly how I want, and macOS just doesn&#x27;t roll that way. Now, I&#x27;m not really the target market, so whatever, but there are a few things that upset me about it:<p>1. I could really, really love macOS if they had a &quot;don&#x27;t treat me like a child&quot; checkbox I could hit somewhere that would turn off some of the more obnoxious default behaviors. It took me a solid 5 minutes to figure out how to navigate to the root of the filesystem on a new MBP I recently was given at a new job. The most intuitive thing I could think to do was double click the name of the folder I was in (&quot;Recents&quot;, by default when you first open it), which seems to do nothing except make a little icon appear and grow&#x2F;shrink the window in Big Sur. Neat. The left pane, by default, literally has no means of navigating to the filesystem root. OSX has seemingly always wanted to pretend the filesystem doesn&#x27;t exist. I like the filesystem. Stop trying to hide things from me.<p>2. This point is actually more a credit to apple than anything - the rendering, touch input, display management, etc on macOS is stellar, and it makes me angry I can&#x27;t have the same level of polish on my linux install. I really, really want something that is as smooth as the macOS experience but with the customize-ability of linux. Apple pisses me off because they are incredibly close to that goal but they find it philosophically objectionable (for business reasons that I understand, but it still pisses me off)')
