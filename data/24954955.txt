Imagine paying $50k for a Tesla, and only being able to get $30k when you sell it because you paid $20k for features that won&#x27;t transfer over to the new owner. Even worse if your new car isn&#x27;t a Tesla: that money would be lost.<p>There&#x27;s an easy fix for that: add the option to transfer the Autopilot to another account. Then you can sell off the Autopilot as well.<p>Given, of course, Tesla being willing to allow that, or if not, sufficiently consumer-friendly legislation.')
