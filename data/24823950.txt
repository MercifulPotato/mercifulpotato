From the ligth beam&#x27;s view nothing happens, it just falls into the black hole. In fact the light beam never experiences time as it travels with the speed of causality.<p>From the reference of the outside observer the light emitted at the event horizon will forever try to leave it, but as spacetime itself casdades into the hole at the speed of light (at the horizon) this light will get redshifted until you can&#x27;t see it anymore. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the light you shoot into the hole never reaches the singularity. It just means that the light emitted at the event horizon will struggle forever to get out of the insane warp. Think about this: if you&#x27;re walking on a conveyor belt with a constant speed `n` in the opposite direction and the belt itself is moving with a constant speed `n` you&#x27;ll never make progress. This is what happens <i>at</i> the event horizon.<p>Light beams are not reversible. If you use a mirror they won&#x27;t travel back in time, they will just change course. They will never go back in time.')
