Unfortunately I don&#x27;t believe there will ever exist accurate numbers of the true portion of people who browse a subset of the web with JavaScript disabled, at least partially because many of those same folks will prevent the means used to collect the data in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s no place for me to dictate how you do your development, so I won&#x27;t do that. It is however my personal opinion that websites should depend on HTML and CSS, and progressively enhance functionality with sprinkles of JavaScript. The vast majority of websites are not interactive applications, and I think modern web development practices could do with something of a hard reset.<p>I&#x27;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to decide how things ended up where they are now and whether it&#x27;s a good thing for them. Personally I think it&#x27;s comical and horrifying just how much compilation goes on in projects written in that particular interpreted language these days!')
