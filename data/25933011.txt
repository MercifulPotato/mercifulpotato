I&#x27;m considering making a web version by compiling to web assembly. As I understand it, if I want to sell this application as a web app it needs to meet certain accessibility requirements. As far as I can tell that means I cannot sell the app and need to start over because opengl&#x2F;webgl aren&#x27;t particularly accessible on the desktop or browser. Am I legally required to build this as a traditional web app to meet accessibility requirements if I want to run it in a browser? Are requirements looser if I build it just as a desktop app?')
