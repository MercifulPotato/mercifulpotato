The goal is to have the task initial steps completed (planning&#x2F;thinking)  so I can work on it throughout the week.\nNext 3 hours: Continue working on the tedious task above or whatever work needs to be completed.\nLast 1-3 hours: Finishing up tasks that can be completed  before day&#x27;s end.<p>For personal projects, I dedicate as much time as needed as long as it doesn&#x27;t hinder my family or fitness time.')
