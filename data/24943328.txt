I played the Quest games as a kid and only heard in passing about Ken and Roberta and early Sierra (I was young enough to not know how unusual it was for a software company to be started and run by a married couple). In my completely presumptive head canon, Sierra petered out because LucasArts games were so much better, and Ken &amp; Roberta sold out and moved into early retirement. I hadn&#x27;t known Roberta was fighting to the very end for her vision on King&#x27;s Quest VIII.<p>(Speaking of LucasArts: peeking at KQ8&#x27;s Wikipedia entry, I see Roberta made the astonishing claim that KQ8 sold twice as well as Grim Fandango: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;King%27s_Quest:_Mask_of_Eternity#Reception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;King%27s_Quest:_Mask_of_Eterni...</a>)')
