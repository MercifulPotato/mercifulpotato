If we have a punishment&#x2F;deterrence-based society, then it seems like the deterrent is not working well for many large corporations. Giving a fine that is a tiny percentage of their money doesn&#x27;t seem to penalize the behavior much, and more importantly, may not lead to behavioral change. I believe some people need to be held criminally liable and go to prison to stop some of the harmful behaviors.<p>I think the challenge is that even if someone saves 100 lives, if they kill 1, they face criminal consequences. Maybe coming from the assumption we&#x27;re supposed to do things to help people, I dunno.')
