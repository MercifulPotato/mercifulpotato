Each person is assigned a numerical id as a class label and classification means that the system takes as input an image of a face and outputs a label.<p>Such systems are used in one of two modes, verification or identification.<p>Verificatiom means that the system is given as input an image and a class label and outputs positive, if the input matches the label, or negative otherwise.<p>Identification means that the system is given as input an image and outputs a class label.<p>In either case, the system may not directly return a label, but a set of labels each associated to a real-valued number, interpreted (by the operators of the system) as a likelihood. However, in that case the system has a threshold delimiting positive from negative identifications. That is, if the likelihood that the system assigns to a classification is above the threshold, that is considered a &quot;positive identificetion&quot;, etc.<p>In other words, yes, a system that outputs a continuous distribution over classes representing sets of images of peoples&#x27; faces can still be &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>Think about it this way: if a system could only ever signal uncertainty, how could we use it to make decisions?')
