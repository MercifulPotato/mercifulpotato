If it weren&#x27;t for COVID, I&#x27;d suggest a similar path to what I took (led to both losing weight and building up a social group) which is to join a team sport. Like a local soccer league, if you&#x27;re very out of shape take it easy the first season then use the improvements you do see as motivation to continue exercising between seasons.<p>However, I don&#x27;t know of any soccer leagues going on that aren&#x27;t COVID hotbeds. Kickball and softball provide a lot more space between players, but doesn&#x27;t reach the same activity level. But being in shape helps with both of them and they can both provide good social connections.<p>I also joined two other groups at about the same time. The area&#x27;s &quot;Young Professional&quot; group, which was a monthly meetup of professionals aged about 22-35. And a church group (if you&#x27;re not at all religious this will not be of any interest to you) that was about the same age range and met up twice a month. Through both I found new friends and started doing more things (I actually joined soccer through the friends made at the church group).<p>However, COVID is messing all of those things up. You can still see if there are groups that are meeting and join them so long as they&#x27;re being reasonably cautious and meet your personal safety threshold.')
