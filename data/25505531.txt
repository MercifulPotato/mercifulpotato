What I mean by &quot;perfect&quot; is: for a given part&#x2F;component&#x2F;decision&#x2F;etc, take the time (an always-limited resource) to learn as much as possible and contemplate more than just the seemingly obvious path forward. Take security for example. I&#x27;d rather &#x27;waste time&#x27; now making sure I&#x27;m covering any gaps in that realm before shipping.<p>OTOH maybe some jacked-up abstraction&#x2F;incorrect tool choice&#x2F;ugly-ui&#x2F;etc is something that can wait a few sprints or longer. At least you can <i>plan</i> when to deal with these. Security breaches tend to plan your day for itself on your behalf. :)')
