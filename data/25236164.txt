I am one of the k6 developers, can you share exactly what the missing piece was?<p>&gt; tests that would run much much more often (like every seconds or couple of seconds), in a continuous manner.<p>You can do that, just use an arrival-rate executor that runs an iteration every second, with a test duration of 365 days or something like that :) See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using-k6&#x2F;scenarios&#x2F;arrival-rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using-k6&#x2F;scenarios&#x2F;arrival-rate</a><p>&gt; Tue goal was to have something at the same time like a healtcheck (is it still working), like a performance test (does it answer in a timely manner) and like a validation test (does it answer the right result - the endpoints we wanted to test do &quot;complex calculations&quot;). Our best answer so far was to wrap K6 in an infinite loop, but I wonder if there could be something smarter.<p>You can certainly wrap k6 in an infinite loop. Nothing wrong  with that, though you can probably use the `scenarios` feature (with long `duration` values) to achieve it without wrapping k6: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using-k6&#x2F;scenarios" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using-k6&#x2F;scenarios</a>')
