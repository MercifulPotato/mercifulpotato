Item(by='bobthepanda', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607908724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410273, text='These mostly sound like variations of &quot;the bike lane is poorly designed&#x2F;maintained&quot; or &quot;the bike lane isn&#x27;t wide enough&quot;. If the rightmost lane of a cars-only road was treated as a poorly maintained gutter this would be an issue as well, but society treats cars as the norm and bikes as marginal. Same goes for the &quot;cars in bike lane&quot; issue; double parking is also an issue, but somehow we have decided that that is less tolerable than doing so in the bike lane.<p>As far as width goes, in European areas with high cycling rates bike lanes are very wide, nearly a car lane wide, so one can pass. American ones tend to be very narrow because cycling use is low and biking is treated as marginal.<p>You can have roads without bike lanes at all that are still safe for biking, but they have to be sufficiently narrow and slow. Most American streets are extremely wide, and so people often speed, which is an extremely common complaint in American residential neighborhoods. The difference is that most people will ask for a stop sign, which sometimes doesn&#x27;t do anything, or they ask for speed bumps, which cost a lot of money.')
