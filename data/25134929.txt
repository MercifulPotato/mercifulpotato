I&#x27;ve been hacking away on the PineWatch as a platform for the last few months, mostly to teach myself baremetal Rust, and it is an extraordinarily satisfying circumstance to be able to tell time on a watch running my own code.  The hardware is decent for the price (very cheap), and it is so very, very refreshingly open.<p>I will pick up a PinePhone as soon as possible, based on this experience, and I&#x27;m probably going to be a Pine stalwart for the next few years, at least, as a general platform.  These guys are finally delivering devices that we developers can be happy to get involved in.<p>I say that as a dev with years of iOS experience, where I am currently fatigued with having to keep up with yet more proprietary bollocks from Apple: the future of these devices is open.')
