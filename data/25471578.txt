Unless I&#x27;m missing something, the article doesn&#x27;t actually say it&#x27;s happening, just that it might.<p>The headline claim about one person asking about a $25K donation comes from a single anecdote in the middle of the article:<p>&gt; Dr. Jeff Toll, who has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the first hospitals to stock the vaccine, recalled a patient asking: “If I donate $25,000 to Cedars, would that help me get in line?’” Toll said no.<p>The rest of the article makes a logical leap from people asking their doctors when they can get the vaccine to implications that they are trying to skip the line by paying extra, simply because they&#x27;re wealthy. The author throws in some anti-Hollywood and anti-Silicon Valley jabs for good measure:<p>&gt; The pattern is familiar in a state where Hollywood stars and Silicon Valley executives are accustomed to getting their way.<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much substance to this article, beyond the one anecdote from one guy who asked about a $25K donation.')
