Since Vietnam is relatively close to the origin of the fruit, I presume they had oranges long before direct European contact.<p>So one wonders if the idea of having the same name for both arose independently in both places, or if Vietnamese didn&#x27;t have a name for the color until they established trade with Europeans, and decided to follow their lead in using the same name as the fruit?')
