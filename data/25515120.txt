We moved lots of code out side db_mutex (db mutex is convenient but costs too much)\n2. We introduced a new KV separation implementation that we believe is better than RocksDBâ€™s implementation (we didn&#x27;t hear any production user are using RocksDB&#x27;s KV separation yet)\n3. We introduced a lazy compaction strategy that can delay compaction task while online services are dealing with short-time heavy writing.\n4. Other optimizations like time histogram based TTL, pipelined WAL sync.')
