Mergers, splits, divided payments, proxy voting, exercising bond contract provisions, warrants, short covering etc.for retail customers. Not glamorous work to be sure.<p>I can tell you unequivocally that to deliver the simplicity, affordability, and transaction efficiency we now take for granted, many MANY layers of broker&#x2F;dealer process and manpower are built on top of pretty archaic systems and processes and regs. I’m sure that’s something most HN readers would roll their eyes at because of how low tech and antiquated it was. But that’s how the market actually functionally works for retail investors. And those regs are often granular and exist because of historical failure.<p>Just being able to buy stock, and not worry about getting the literal paper stock in your own name is an innovation we take for granted by having securities held in street name. We in fact had some paper stock in a safe because some clients insisted having in their name.<p>When we processed shorts we literally would hold the short against a specific humans named account or go borrow shares by picking up the phone and calling another broker. Shorts don’t happen out of thin air. It’s someone else stock you’re selling.<p>In 2005 I would log into a black screen DTC terminal and pull money down at a firm level by manually typing the values in (lord knows what happens if this gets messed up).<p>If accounts went over minimum margin requirements we would pick up the phone and call them to explain why they needed to close positions or add collateral. One time we closed the entire account an mailed them a check for the balance because they kept ignoring.<p>When corporate action transactions settled (T+5) we would manually allocate them to accounts, and then print out the accounts affected for manual QA. The print out went into a filing cabinet for compliance reasons.<p>All of this is to say...it seems like HN model of how retail financial markets work is like super efficient APIs that transact like magic plumbing. In reality it’s more like an anthill built on top of a Rube Goldberg machine. You may not want to believe that RH and other brokerages have to abide by insanely complex and Byzantine rules and regs and systems and interactions because they make a drop dead simple experience in their app...but they almost certainly do.')
