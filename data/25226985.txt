We just get so much of this stuff somebody promoting something about talking about building something that helps people build something to talk about promoting stuff. That&#x27;s so many nested meta levels that I&#x27;m as a dev calling BS after about 2 of them and go away.<p>Unfortunately I read your blog post as something similar. It was about how you funnel people into some community that helps others polish their writings so they get more reach. That&#x27;s 3 levels right there.<p>Here is you chance to show that the chain ends after those 3 levels and there is actual non-meta content waiting at the end of that chain.')
