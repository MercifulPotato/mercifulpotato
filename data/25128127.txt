It takes 82 seconds to compile on my i5-4200M.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this test is deserving of the breathless headline and commentary, especially since the original tweeter later follows up with:<p>&gt; Extra info: The M1 macbooks (air&#x2F;pro) can&#x27;t drive 2 external screens, and the air throttles a bit after 3+ minutes sustained compute (20-30%)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rikarends&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328753176552632321" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rikarends&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328753176552632321</a><p>I&#x27;ll be more interested if the M1 can compile something 2x quicker than the i9 when the compile time on the M1 exceeds 30-60 minutes rather than being less than a minute.<p>EDIT: to be clear, I expect the M1 to feel faster than the i9 for the vast majority of users, however the headline is &quot;in a real world Rust compile&quot;, implying that this is a more valid test than synthetic benchmarks. I take issue with that, as I don&#x27;t really consider something that compiles in less than 2 minutes on 6 year old hardware to be a much more useful test than the benchmarks.<p>We already know the A-series of chips performs incredibly in short workloads. We have no information yet on how it performs under sustained workloads.')
