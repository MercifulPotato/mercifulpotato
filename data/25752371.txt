I pretty much maxed it out when I bought it: quad-core i7-3740QM, 32 GB of RAM, a pair of Samsung 850 Pro SSDs (RAID1), Nvidia something 2GB, FHD screen, etc.<p>I was thinking about upgrading recently and was leaning towards the T470 for various reasons, including seeing a few nice used ones available locally at &quot;okay&quot; prices... until I started to actually compare them!<p>Based on the benchmarks I could find, I came to the conclusion that the performance of the T470 was no better than that of my old tank, the W530 -- and may have even been worse! Once I looked into the cost of upgrading the RAM on the T470 (as I tend to run several VMs concurrently) I decided I&#x27;d simply be wasting money &quot;upgrading&quot; to the T470.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;ve got a T420 which, although even older, still performs amazingly well -- once it was upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and a 480 GB SSD. I&#x27;ve only got ~$150 in it and it&#x27;ll do a fine job if&#x2F;when the W530 finally dies.<p>(The &quot;upgrade&quot; wasn&#x27;t really a priority anyways, as I&#x27;ve got a beast of a workstation that I use 90% of the time.)')
