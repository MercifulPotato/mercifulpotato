Now I can write idiomatic C, Forth, Erlang, OCaml, and Ada&#x2F;SPARK, but C -&gt; Forth was the most difficult one, I would say.<p>As for C++: I have zero clue about it. Occasionally a student who learns C++ comes to me for help and I end up being useful and help her (by RTFM), but other than that, nothing much really.')
