I think the terminology you&#x27;re looking for is &#x27;contingent&#x27;, where the client only pays a % fee to attorney if they manage to generate a judgement. In this case, does the UK insurance kick in to pay a fee to lawyer if they lose the case?<p>I&#x27;m talking about civil cases here, not criminal.')
