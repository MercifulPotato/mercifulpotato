Item(by='chrisweekly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605709723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136258, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;every-layout.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;every-layout.dev</a> has fantastic free content, but the full $100 for all the materials (book, site, components) has had absurdly high ROI for me.
