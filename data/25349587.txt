Can you watch someone make a mistake without intervening? Can you do so without severe emotional turmoil?<p>Most managers never break the micromanagement habit, and will always pay the price. Probably the biggest price of not trusting people is that they don&#x27;t trust you either, and they find ways to keep you out of the loop so they can make decisions and get work done. This in turn causes you to trust them even less. Distrust is a self fulfilling death spiral.<p>You might have no choice, e.g., if you work in a micromanagerial culture. Can your boss watch you, as you are watching someone make a mistake? In other words, are your management habits the source of a culture, or merely its effect?<p>Thus the final step is: Can you stick up for your people after they&#x27;ve made a mistake?')
