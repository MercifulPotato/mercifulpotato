For the person, for the city, for the environment, for the economy, for the world. Will you <i>eventually</i> run out of economically feasible buildings to build? Sure. But along the way, millions of people get what they want and couldn&#x27;t have before. Swap drives across sprawl for subway commutes. Exchange &quot;whatever&#x27;s around&quot; jobs for better ones that create more value. Get access to richer cultures and more potential friends.<p>Decommodification is not magic. Scarcity is still there. Unless you&#x27;re going to expropriate from current owners, it mainly means the government buys housing on someone&#x27;s behalf. The government suffers exactly the same problems as market-rate buyers there. Relieve scarcity, lower prices as much as you can, and tax revenue to those programs can do more good.')
