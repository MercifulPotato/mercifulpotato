Anyone joining in that protest, is explicitly supporting that cause by being in that protest. That makes the entire crowd complicit in white nationalism. Trump&#x27;s claim is that these people who are happy to protest in a coalition of white supremacist and neo nazis are very fine people and not themselves white supremacists? It&#x27;s absurd.<p>The Charlottesville protest was a racist, bloody affair that ultimately resulted in a counter protested being killed after a white supremacist drove their car into the crowd of protestors. But, Trump felt it was very important to defend the protestors and in particular defend Robert E Lee, a man responsible for leading the war to keep a state&#x27;s rights to slavery. The idea that this is somehow not racist and Trump is a man of equality, is again, absurd.')
