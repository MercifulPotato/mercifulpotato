One example is night vision goggles which basically just project a flat screen onto your eyeballs. Many people report that they become susceptible to tripping, falling, hitting objects, or just straight up walking into trees with NVGs, in part because the loss of depth perception takes such a toll on their brain that they can&#x27;t adapt in time. It takes hours if not days to fully adapt to NVGs, and even then you can&#x27;t operate as quickly as you can in daylight unless you practice consistently (think SWAT or Navy Seals type training).')
