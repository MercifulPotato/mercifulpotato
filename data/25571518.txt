How is that entertaining?<p>As another commenter above noted, it&#x27;s a form of wish fulfillment and imaginary transgression, which is particularly appealing to teenage boys, since virtually all forms of actual aggression are off limits.  Sports are the only arena where boys are allowed to be physically aggressive in real.  Other than that, we have an entire group of young people who once would have been learning to hunt and kill and defend their clan but who now have to sit around and do very little besides read, write, and stare at computers. Arguably it&#x27;s a positive thing to have less violence, but it leads many young men to wonder why the hell their bodies are strong and powerful.  In video games, they at least get to pretend that there is some utility to being able to be forceful.')
