It even included an old school browser toolbar.<p>I couldn&#x27;t avoid installing the 250+mb &quot;Solution Center&quot;, because I needed it to disable the overly enthusiastic automatic cropping that the scanner for some reason defaulted to. The option to disable that was buried deep in some obscure settings menu. Ugh.<p>Too bad this warning was not related to that kind of behavior.')
