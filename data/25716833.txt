There&#x27;s no opt-out.<p>Ecosia is fine but I just don&#x27;t get the corporate policy. It&#x27;s making my work a lot more inefficient, and when I worked for clients (I currently work for internal clients which isn&#x27;t chargeable) I billed $300 per hour.<p>An Ecosia search is worth half a cent, you need 45 searches to plant one tree.<p>Suppose I do 20 searches in a day, that&#x27;s 10 cents. Suppose the extra search to Google takes 3 seconds, at a billabe rate of $300 that&#x27;s 25 cents times 20 searches is 500 cents, about 50x whatever Ecosia is gaining. I just don&#x27;t get why my employer can&#x27;t just pay 20 cents into Ecosia&#x27;s tree fund, get the same marketing, contribute 2x as much to trees, save 25x as much money on this thing and save me frustration.<p>If I then figure that (1) a search for Google (I don&#x27;t use Ecosia search results at all) is not contributing any revenue at all and (2) even those who use Ecosia search results are getting worse and less time-efficient information versus Google, the economics of simply letting people use Google instead of Ecosia (Bing) and contributing the equivalent in money, makes even more sense.<p>And then (3) corporate actively does not want you to go shopping online during work. This idea to show ads during workhours when employees just want search results is a ridiculous idea.<p>Other than that I think Ecosia is a great idea, but it must be opt-outable.<p>tl;dr I hate big corporates.<p>In other words, at the cost of 8 cents per second in billable time, I&#x27;m generating half a cent')
