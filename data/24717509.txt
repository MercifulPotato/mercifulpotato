He consulted eben moglen and based on that change his opinion. It is possible that Eben consider the decision to still be Richards, which technically it was.<p>When it come to apple I strongly suspect there are a few things companies like them will try avoid putting lawyers and money on. What is the definition for derivative work and what is the definition of fair use. If you do want to stake money on that you likely want aspects of the case being stacked in your favor, and basing the majority of a product on a GPL code base is not that. A single function call to libreadline would likely be more favorable, but a company like apple would just rewrite such trivial amount of code.')
