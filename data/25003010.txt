Laws, programming, etc.<p>If it is too complex to readily use it and easily debug it, then it is bad. It is bad not because it is complex, but because it inserts overhead, and overhead in time spent solving problems is always exponential.<p>I am for the idea of using ipv6 as a sort of nation-level NAT for big corporations and countries to expose part of a private address space over a section of ipv4, while each country gets most of ipv4 to itself along with a section where you can route to other countries, in exchange for a small fee. Say 30% of the ipv4 space is globally shared by everyone and the rest is local to your own country. Also IOT local mesh networks all would be on auto configured tunnels with only certain gateway systems hard coded- systems you can block at your router.<p>That’s the most sensible solution. It will be a real shame if it is not the reality. Arrogance and “hurr durr i’m so smart and i spent 40 hours this week setting up this brilliant ipv6 network topology for my company that will require five manuals to fully explore and retain me in my job for a minimum of 10 years to keep it all working”- meanwhile the rest of us will suffer.<p>The biggest most canally disgusting thing about ipv6 is that it will render dns based ad blocking a thing of the past. If you want any kind of blocking you will have to go with curated WHITELISTS, instead of blacklists. And that may be more secure but it will also be a lot more work, which, again, the ipv6 nerds will love to do but will present a hassle for the rest of us. You won’t be able to manually check the dns list anymore. you will simply have to accept that the overhead and the security risk of trusting all of the 35 million addresses in the whitelist is a cost you are willing to accept.<p>Say no to ipv6.\nI have already blocked it on everything and will never adopt. it is the ethanol of internet addressing.')
