Item(by='jfk13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607082456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300940, text='It depends.<p>In Firefox, disabling &quot;Allow pages to choose their own fonts&quot; does not completely block web fonts (as setting gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled to false would); what it does is to prioritise the default fonts, and move any page-specified fonts to the end of the fallback list.<p>This means that for &quot;normal&quot; text, the browser&#x27;s default fonts will be used, but if there are Private Use Area character codes that are only supported by the site&#x27;s custom webfont, it&#x27;ll still get used for those. So icon fonts that are based on PUA code points will still work.<p>What doesn&#x27;t work in this scenario is when the icon font <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> encode its icons in the PUA, but uses normal Unicode characters -- either symbol code points that <i>are</i> supported by the system&#x27;s default fonts, or as some icon fonts do, regular English words that then use ligature rules to produce the icon glyphs. (So the icon font contains OpenType mappings such as &quot;phone&quot; -&gt; [phone icon].) In this case the content on the page will end up rendered using the default font instead.<p>[Edited: HN doesn&#x27;t let me include an actual phone icon there, apparently.]')
