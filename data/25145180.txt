Similarly in other works.<p>In this case, the book as a whole would be copyright Star Wars Corporation, probably a holding entity specially to handle multiple involved copyrights (the copyright to Star Wars itself, etc.), and unlike a Windows install media you won&#x27;t find a page listing &quot;this work contains parts copyright X, Y, Z&quot;. But the contractual obligations still exist.')
