I view it more as &quot;capturing&quot; a billion. You mention FB. With network effects, it is inevitable that there will be a few large dominate social media companies. If it wasn&#x27;t Zuckerberg it would have been someone else. I view these people not as pioneers pushing us forward but as lottery winners. Why should the lucky one on top capture most of the value? The people like Newton and Einstein who actually had revolutionary ideas were not even close to billionaires.<p>I am not sure why you feel that &quot;taxing rich people&quot; makes everyone worse off. 60 years ago a man with a high school diploma could support a middle class life for a family of 4. Taxes on the highest earners were much higher than they were today. 60 years before that there was no federal income tax and people worked 14 hour days in dangerous conditions while Carnegie and Rockefeller amassed wealth on scales not seen until today.<p>But yes I agree with you that a tax on each market trade is lol stupid. But I think it is a straw-man argument along with  setting the tax rate at 100%.')
