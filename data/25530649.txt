The Bible (especially certain books like Ecclesiastes or Proverbs), The Quran, The Upanishads, to name a few. Again, don’t just go in blind, or you’ll walk away thinking none of it makes any sense.<p>Seeing as how the Quran was &quot;written&quot; over decades and the Bible over millennia, they DON&#x27;T make sense. They&#x27;re both self-contradictory, with various authors pushing various purposes depending on what they wrote and when. There&#x27;s value in each, but let&#x27;s not pretend they&#x27;re towering forks of art with a singular purpose and vision.')
