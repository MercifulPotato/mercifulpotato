I could not disagree more! Too much of the field was concerned with detailed proofs and mathematical formalism that were somewhat disconnected from probability theory. Modern machine learning (or AI or whatever) still has strong roots in probability and statistics. Loss functions are still based on concepts such as the log-likelihood function.<p>Formal proofs and mathematics are essential, but can become a distraction from the end goal. It is like playing Chess by going after your opponents pawns instead of their king. I would say modern machine learning has become tantamount to experimental physics and this article is written from the perspective of a string theory theorist.')
