Velocity doesn&#x27;t encourage good architectural decisions. It rewards building stuff quickly. Most commercial systems I see become rats nests very quickly.<p>With free software, if I waste a year tweaking something to figure out how to Do Things Right, that&#x27;s okay. If I&#x27;m a downright a-hole about accepting commits (Hi Linus!), that&#x27;s okay too.<p>It&#x27;s different incentive structures.<p>From my perspective, Linux circa 1995 was just fine. If anything, Linux 2020 is a modest step backwards. I&#x27;d rather have long timelines and high reliability. That&#x27;s not something commercial teams can sustain. People need to keep externally signalling productivity.<p>Ubuntu and Red Hat are a bit of a wildcard, since they take a hybrid model which seems to be dragging Linux down the path to look a lot like Windows 95, with layers of hairballs upon layers of hairballs. I&#x27;m not thrilled about that.')
