Detected attacks tend to divide into two groups - the scripted continuous probing that&#x27;s just background noise these days (but if you have access to the logs on any internet connecting device in front of a firewall you will typically see it being probed at least every 10 minutes), and targeted attacks - where the first rule is to be very careful, lay low, and perform careful data exfiltration. Reading the reports on the kinds of the latter that were discovered, and in particular how they were discovered, suggests there is probably much more of that going on than is generally realised.')
