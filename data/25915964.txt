But Twitter is an incredible service. From the Arab spring to people like @balajis who broke COVID (for me at least) before major news networks.<p>The only interactive we have as users is positive (a heart or retweet) vs negative (thumbs down on Youtube, downvote on reddit).<p>I think a broken heart, &lt;&#x2F;3, essentially as a downvote, could do a lot to make Twitter more of a community that rewards and punishes, rather than just allows people to exist in their own eco-chamber. The politicians of the last month would have likely seen way more downvotes &#x2F; broken hearts than favs and retweets, and that might have done something for them personally...it&#x27;s at least worth a test if anyone at Twitter reads this :).')
