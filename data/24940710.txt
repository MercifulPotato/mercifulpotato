I&#x27;m not into the game industry at all but I get the impression that automated testing isn&#x27;t so much of a thing with a lot of games, and they depend on manual testing a lot, either with armies of game testers or a community (for early access games), especially for games with a lot of randomness and &quot;emergent&quot; behaviour.<p>But for an indie game like Factorio with so much development, features, interactions, etc it&#x27;s almost mandatory.<p>I&#x27;m sure most games have a big automated testing suite though, there&#x27;s too much in there nowadays to warrant manual testing.')
