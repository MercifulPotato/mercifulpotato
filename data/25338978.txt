That&#x27;s an academic route, and probably won&#x27;t lead you anywhere. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s likely the most common response you&#x27;ll get here.<p>I&#x27;d start by asking yourself a simple question: who do you admire most? Look at what values and &#x27;philosophy&#x27; they have. Learn more about what&#x27;s behind them. Dig deeper. There is no particular path here; you&#x27;re asking an age-old question that doesn&#x27;t have a clear answer. Your values are the root of any &#x27;philosophy&#x27; you might have. Get clear about your values, then look around.')
