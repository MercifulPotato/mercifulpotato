A siege on the seat of government. Where does sound familiar. Didn&#x27;t Trump stage a rally down the road from one that got besieged?<p>How weird is that huh? These funny coincidences. Lets discuss another coincidence.<p>Recall when Trump supporters consisting of Nazis and white nationalist groups held the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville? How one of his supporters committed a domestic terrorist ramming attack against protestors killing a girl?<p>After being forced to make a statement by those near him, against his wishes, Trump stated there was &quot;very fine people on both sides.&quot; Essentially saying thank you to his supporters instead of disowning the extremist elements among them.<p>Fast forward to the D.C. attack. Who was in the crowd? The same white nationalists that years ago rallied at Unite the Right. One being Matthew Heimbach who already committed violence at one of Trump&#x27;s rallies.<p>What did Trump say after his coup failed, at a time when he was meant to denounce the extremists among his supporters?<p>&#x27;I LOVE YOU. YOU ARE SPECIAL.&#x27;<p>So I&#x27;m going to get to my point, I don&#x27;t believe your concern. Maybe people &#x27;on the right&#x27; should spend less time fomenting outrage among themselves and start the process of distancing themselves from the cult of Trump.')
