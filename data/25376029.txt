I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the recruiting communication I receive in terms of salary, and my current salary is above average. Companies would be insane to ask current employees to take a pay cut to go remote unless they want people to leave.<p>As long as companies are focused on hiring the best people they can find, they&#x27;re going to be motivated to continue supporting market rates.')
