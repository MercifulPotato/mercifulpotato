The time zone difference makes things harder, but we work well together. The cultural issues are greatly lessened by the fact that a number of people on the US side of the divide are from India, and I (US-born white guy) have made five trips to India to get to know people there.  We&#x27;re able to hand off issues to each other and address customer issues quickly because someone is available around the clock.  I&#x27;ve had to push back and limit meetings to keep from working all the time, but it&#x27;s easy to get sucked into over-long hours.')
