The giant FAANG companies need huge quantities of programmers to grow, they are fighting with their competitors to hire those programmers, and they&#x27;re all convinced (true or not) that they need only the best programmers and that their interviewing systems which can identify such programmers.<p>Sure, the companies tried the standard approach of just secretly agreeing not to compete with each other for talent, but the DoJ didn&#x27;t care for that, and so they just do the other thing: pay as much money as is necessary to get the folks they want.<p>Apple makes about $435,000 in profit (not revenue) per employee, including non-technical employees. If they think that they need to pay staggering salaries to programmers to keep a good thing going, they will absolutely do it. Would they like to pay their programmers a third of what they&#x27;re paying now? Totally. Would such a salary be fair? Totally. But those programmers would just call a Google or Facebook recruiter and be out the door the next day.')
