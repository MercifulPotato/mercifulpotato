Honestly, I despise the superficially objective and neutral concern troll approach to this. I can&#x27;t see this article as anything but a dishonest way to say: &quot;what if someone used private communications to do something bad? let&#x27;s get rid of private communications&quot;. Except it doesn&#x27;t own up to the fact that that&#x27;s ultimate what it&#x27;s proposing. It stops at fearmongering.<p>Also, I commented this above, but there&#x27;s a different way to solve the problems of polarization and radicalism. It involves solving people&#x27;s material problems, and the US has been slowly getting worse at this and decaying for a while now. Instead, the political establishment is doubling down on surveillance, the silencing of dissent off of any platform with reach, and ultimately physical repression, through the increased funding and militarization of police.<p>Right now this is claimed to be targeted at the far right.. but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to compare the police reaction to BLM vs the capitol riot to see where it is going.')
