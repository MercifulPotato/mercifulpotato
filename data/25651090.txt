I would suggest this reflects the complexity of our current healthcare delivery system and also the misalignment between the shorter technology cycles and the far longer cycles of foundational changes in healthcare. Would Haven have succeed with more time? I would say the actual question was what could Haven achieved in only three years?<p>Have to admit this is sad news as the promise of Haven was a possibly significant challenge to the current, awful, state of healthcare in the US and offer a commercial single-payer solution that would avoid the entrenched political agendas driving the public option discussion.<p>Lastly, I feel Amazon missed a huge opportunity here with their massive technical capability combined with the insurance and financial capabilities of their partners. Creating a vertical integrated health system isn&#x27;t new, but the capabilities of Haven were significant. Sadly, seems like the Amazon Health strategy was limited.')
