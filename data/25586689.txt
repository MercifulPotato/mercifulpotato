I&#x27;ve worked in China and been in the country multiple times over the last few years.<p>In Mao&#x27;s times you had to carry the little red book in your pocket, were put into a factory or lined up against the wall. Today foreigners can go to the country, start a business and you can work where you want. Over the last five years in particular the situation for businesses has gotten better because the courts actually have started to function and address stuff like IP claims. Still slow for foreign business in particular, but if you think modern China, one of the world&#x27;s most integrated economies, is comparable to the Mao era I truly don&#x27;t know what to tell you.<p>China is also, ironically enough, probably one of the most fiscally decentralized economies on the planet. If you look at the degree of economic autonomy regions have, you won&#x27;t find it really anywhere else.')
