Item(by='bishalsaha', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1603452056, title='Open-Source Hardware', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Working on software and thinking about a startup is easier than for hardware startups.<p>I just can&#x27;t list all the reasons but mainly it is because of MVP creation and iterations. Only the final product can be shipped and the business models can be one time purchase or the hardware becomes a trojan for subscriptions and app ecosystems. Supply chain management, enterprise resource planning, logistics, warehousing basically scaling altogether is a hassle no one wants to take on. The profitability is also really hard and companies like Apple cut costs like this new iPhone package design and reducing things. It&#x27;s really hard but the plus points are once bought a customer is stuck with it for a while and it&#x27;s hard to replace, and as I said it becomes a trojan for app economy... The market is wide open for companies to start making something more than an iPhone alternative and EarPods copy, for me I am trying to sell pre-packaged raspberry pi which are all set and configured as for customer requests and I am making it easy for people to have a free VPN, Virtual computer, NAS, Penetration testing and web server or may be anything even internet 2.0 with P2P service. The idea for me is to understand hardware business and how to make and manage product, by the way it&#x27;s free all open source hardware and software I am just assembling, configuring and making it ready to use out of the box, target customers are college student as I am also one of them...<p>What ideas do you guys have for starting a successful hardware business and how?<p>Sorry for my words and bad description of the problems, I am just weird and I just bad in communications... SORRY')
