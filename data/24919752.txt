There are brilliant design and engineering bits everywhere. I learned more from studying this codebase than most other I can think of, especially with regards to templates meta-programming ( I learned about “template template parameters” from coming across extensive use of those there ). It’s actually somewhat challenging to grok what’s going on — but it is worth pushing through until you “get it”.')
