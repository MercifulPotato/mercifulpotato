Even if they were to win it (because a judge determines the takedown provisions don&#x27;t cover it or for another reason), they&#x27;d be in for a costly legal battle. Moreover, without the Title II provisions, they would be liable for having distributed the circumvention in the past!<p>On the other hand, if they DO comply with it, the RIAA is extremely unlikely to sue them, whether this is covered by the safe-harbor provisions of Title II or not.')
