For smaller projects, I don&#x27;t think anything matches Ruby in terms of pure solo-dev productivity. I still use it for scripting.<p>One thing I would advise, given your situation, is to avoid full-blown SPAs. You can use something like Stimulus Reflux and be way more productive than going down the whole React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;library explosion rabbit hole. Ditto for spending a lot of time on Kubernetes, Docker, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re not a full-time dev, just do things with the minimum abstraction needed.')
