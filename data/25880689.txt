Other cars can do the same, or at workplaces.\nSome new building codes now mandate that the parking be charging ready, so they have to put the conduit under the pavement, but they don’t need to wire it right away. So that’s a first step to simplifying a retro-install.<p>I do think apartment parking will eventually be retrofitted. The charging networks could easily have a apartment product—or license their network access to a manufacturer. So you would just use your charging network app or card as when charging around town. There are also products like Evercharge that split the power from a single circuit across several plugged in cars (optimizing power usage and reducing the need\nfor conduits and wiring).<p>The various EV promoters have been tackling this issue for a while, something like the Electric Auto Association may have people or resources to help convince an apartment owner.<p>I wonder: shouldn’t a grid with lots of solar incentivize workplace charging (day-time use of peak generation), and a grid with wind majority incentivize home charging (night-time use of peak generation)? Maybe')
