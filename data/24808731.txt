It just works for some people.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Windows 10 and WSL for several months. It feels like consumption OS for me, I am not that productive. I do not like ecosystem, I do not feel secure installing 3rd party binary software.<p>I want distribution with plenty of open source solutions that just works.
