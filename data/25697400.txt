Riding high, wealthy, good reputation, not much real competition. In 10 years they will be knocked on their heels as they fail to adjust to a new industry change.<p>My suspicion is that eventually AWS will become the &quot;mainframes&quot; of tech, and a new software+hardware paradigm will make all their services obsolete and their hardware too expensive. My money&#x27;s on the return of store-and-forward communications. Once your watch has as much power and storage as a SunFire T2000, and every IoT device can store terabytes of data on gigabit networks, who the hell needs redundant servers?')
