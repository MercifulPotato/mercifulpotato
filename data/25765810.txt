I&#x27;m asking seriously: I finished my bachelor&#x27;s 30 years ago and my master&#x27;s 15 years ago and that has never been my experience.<p>Our professors were actual people we talked and interacted with, even the boring ones. And they made an effort to teach. Now, I didn&#x27;t go to a huge &quot;research&quot; university, where I hear it&#x27;s common to get profs who have no interest in teaching, but what you describe isn&#x27;t remotely like what I encountered.')
