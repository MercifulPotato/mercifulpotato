Examples include but are not limited to:<p>- Health care provided by Medicaid, free clinics, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program<p>- Nourishment provided by food stamps, school lunches, school breakfasts, soup kitchens, food pantries, and the Women’s, Infants’ &amp; Children’s program<p>-Housing and amenities provided through rent subsidies, utility assistance, and homeless shelters<p>Yes, of course, because no European nation provides these. What an idiotic article.')
