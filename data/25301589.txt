Self-taught, been doing software professionally for more than 25 years, and have <i>rarely</i> ever needed anything close to the types of math&#x2F;compsci problems these services test you on.<p>The &#x27;sit with someone for an hour&#x27; are far more indicative of how you&#x27;d work with someone because... you&#x27;re working with them.  2 years ago I did a &quot;remote pair code test&quot; with the team lead for about 30 minutes.  I think I got most of the &#x27;test&#x27; done in half the expected time, and we talked about where&#x2F;why I cut corners, how you&#x27;d test it, what sorts of things you need to keep in mind to address edge cases, etc.  I got to see what working with the team lead was like in that case, and... ultimately, it wasn&#x27;t much different after I got the gig.<p>Good luck to you in your hunting!')
