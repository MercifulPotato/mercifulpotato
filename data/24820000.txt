It&#x27;s effectively a note that the bank owes you cash.</i><p>Yes.<p><i>&gt; as far as I understood without physical money there would be no bank accounts.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure why that would be the case. I&#x27;ve never withdrawn a physical dollar from my bank account.<p><i>&gt; how could an economy go 100 percent electronic banking, if banking is built on the existence of physical cash? This is the missing link.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the point of CB digital currency. The point of CB&#x27;s digital currency is to reduce the indirection between policy and business&#x2F;consumer behavior.<p>NB: this includes both fiscal and monetary policy. So e.g. provides a mechanism to cut the retail banks out of things like covid relief funds.')
