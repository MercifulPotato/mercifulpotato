The AC project managers kept bringing in more AC consultants and told the bank management not to worry, everything was good. They were heavily customizing a non-y2k version of the vendor&#x27;s software, and the vendor warned project management that they were customizing this in ways that would prevent future support and patches, but AC project management covered this up.<p>Eventually the vendor contacted the bank CEO directly and said &quot;what are you going to do about the y2k issue, we are concerned&quot;.  CEO: &quot;What y2k issue?&quot;<p>The bank had to go live with what they had, fire and blacklist AC and burn tens of millions of $$ to re-start the project to deliver exactly the same thing, but using a y2k-compliant version as a starting point, and removing as much customization as possible so they could take future vendor patches.')
