The browser is <i>the best</i> at doing the things it does, and any control that you implement yourself is going to be worse. If the browser can do something for you, you ought to <i>let</i> it do that for you. If you insist on writing your own controls, its behavior will differ from how the browser&#x27;s own UI works in subtle ways, repeated indefinitely for each combination of OS and browser and user input paradigm. People who rely on muscle memory to use these features, people who perhaps cannot percieve whatever UI hints you come up with to teach your custom control, or people whose needs you have forgotten about, will all struggle to use your UI. And for what? It looks prettier? No thanks.')
