Double stupidly, I ran it as root and so $INSTALL&#x2F;lib blew off the system&#x27;s libraries. I recovered the machine without any rescue disk or reboot or anything, by by copying files from an installation of the same distro. Of course, no commands for copying worked. I think what I might have done is to NFS mount that machine from the other machine, and then doing the copying on that machine.')
