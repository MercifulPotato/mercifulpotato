The nearest Dominos is 2.5 miles away.<p>I am deleting this app now.<p>Edit: Yeah I know this probably doesn’t have to do with the app itself, but it’s mildly infuriating anyway<p>Edit 2: I don’t think it is due to Covid because they are advertising contactless delivery and I can also walk into their store right now. Also, I recall having this same problem 1 year ago.<p>I think the real explanation is that I live in a relatively new (2 year old) community and they haven’t bothered to update their delivery address database. I thought 2.5 miles was close enough, and 2 years was long enough to get a database update. I don’t really know, though.<p>My point, to clarify, is that this isn’t a very good user experience. Here’s a constructive suggestion: tell me why you won’t deliver, because otherwise we’re left to guess in the HN comments.<p>Sorry if my comment came off as shallow and dismissive.')
