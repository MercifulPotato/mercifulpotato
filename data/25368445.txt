Nobody still uses photographic film end to end. Somebody in Hollywood tried to edit physical film last year, and she had to call in favors just to get blank leader and film cement. Trying to emulate film is like making sepia-toned pictures.<p>The industry has been through this before. With the end of silent films. With the end of showing an orchestra if the film had music. (That&#x27;s credited to Irving Thalberg). With the end of editorial geography. (That ended with Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; in 1960). The industry got over those, and they&#x27;ll get over 24FPS and film grain.')
