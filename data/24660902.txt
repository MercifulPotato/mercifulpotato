Historically European racism is quite different. The Nazis were deeply racist, but didn&#x27;t care much about skin color in particular - they hated and murdered Slavs and Jews and Roma, groups not identified by skin color. Europe have to acknowledge and engage with this horrible past, but things like obsessing about the Dutch &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; tradition is totally missing the point IMHO.')
