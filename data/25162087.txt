For around the same price as the 400, I can get the 8GB  pi and a full kit of accessories.<p>But, I really like the idea of having everything just built into the keyboard.<p>In your experience was the 4GB of RAM on the 400 reasonable?<p>Ever since the 400 popped up on here i&#x27;ve been looking into both of them. I just worry the 400 lacks more long term versatility than a straight pi 4 with a kit.<p>Any thoughts on this?')
