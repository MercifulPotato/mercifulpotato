There is also &#x2F;r&#x2F;iPodhacks.<p>It&#x27;s fairly easy to take them apart and can be fun. You can extremely easily and cheaply get parts like battery replacements (sometimes even w&#x2F; extra capacity), screen replacements, and sometimes even storage upgrades. (Although I honestly think the 5G nano might be out of that last category. Moreso talking about Minis, full-size iPods, and, IIRC, 1st&#x2F;2nd gen nanos.)<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not for everybody; and, definitely, it might be useful to get another device suggested by someone else here as a backup or something. But this <i>is</i> HN, so I figure it&#x27;s an adequately geeky suggestion. :) I am also into the environmental impact of fixing things vs. buying new things.<p>EDIT:<p>Here&#x27;s a reliable resource for parts I have used in the past - (please note I am not affiliated with the site, just saying it has worked for me):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idemigods.com&#x2F;Apple_iPod_Parts_s&#x2F;77.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idemigods.com&#x2F;Apple_iPod_Parts_s&#x2F;77.htm</a>')
