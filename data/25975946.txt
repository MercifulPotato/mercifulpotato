An advanced civilisation can defend against or modify (maybe even focus) the damage that an imploding star would cause, and an Issac Arthur video on the topic of the amount of space we have in the solar system states clearly that there&#x27;s more than enough for trillions of trillions of trillions of habitats. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much reason for spreading a civilization out whatsoever, given the cost of communication and the assumed cultural and informational lag between the settlement and the source civilization.<p>As the article states, it&#x27;s unlikely to be the case that we see an expansive civilization until it&#x27;s too late.')
