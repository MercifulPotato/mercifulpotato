Because it cost enough? Because a website claimed it was &quot;Offishial Ankker CABLE&quot;?<p>Ensure that whatever peripherals you buy that need high speed connectivity _come_ with the USB-C cables they need. Since the cable is part of the product the manufacturer will ensure they will bundle the cheapest cable that still works for that product as advertised. This works naturally for devices like USB-C docks, USB-C monitors and hubs.<p>The problem with USB-C is that many people look at it as a connector _and_ transmission standard but it is not, it&#x27;s only a connector standard. The transmission standards are specified separately and they are many. Depending on your application (what do you use the USB-C for) certain cables may work or not. You&#x27;d have to do the research to determine which signal do you need to transport over that USB-C cable: is it PD power (up to what wattage&#x2F;amperage), is it USB2 (how many devices), is it DisplayPort or is it Thunderbolt3. Then buy a cable that advertises support for the signal you need.<p>Alternatively, buy a cable that advertises support for the highest bitrate of all those transmission types, essentially buy a cable that advertises Thunderbolt3 support, but in that case don&#x27;t be surprised why almost all TB3 cables are very short, it&#x27;s not easy to transport 40Gbit&#x2F;sec reliably. There are longer, but active and a lot more expensive, TB3 cables.')
