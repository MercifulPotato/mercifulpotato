The W3C WebAuthn spec. explicitly calls out that you should allow users to register more than one authenticator, and might want to provide a nice way for your users to label them, e.g. &quot;Yubikey&quot;, &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;Greg&#x27;s key&quot; or whatever. Every site I&#x27;ve used that offers WebAuthn does this correctly <i>except</i> AWS and you&#x27;d have to take that up with Amazon.')
