Imagine running Windows 98 on your Xbox as well as DOS games. A quick search reveals Dosbox has a retroarch core but it&#x27;s a bit tricky to run Windows 98 although I have found Dosbox-X is made to run DOS-based Windows versions like 98, ME and such. Wow, I wonder if we could run the Nesticle emulator for extra layers of nostalgic warmth? Also come to find out the original Halo had a minimum requirement of Windows 98. That&#x27;d be an awesome project to get working if Halo CE wasn&#x27;t already backwards compatible.')
