Coercion ultimately leads to violence if the coerced individual doesn&#x27;t surrender.<p>So, I can&#x27;t take this &quot;incitement to violence is bad&quot; thing seriously. Because if they truly believed that, then all political speech should be banned.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;state-monopoly-on-violence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;state-monopoly-on-violence</a>')
