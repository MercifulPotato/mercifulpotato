DNT in browsers has showed that extremely clearly: it was meant as a marker for you to not be tracked, yet advertisers used it as an additional bit for fingerprinting. Policy might be a way, but it relies on humans looking at apps. It&#x27;s always much more effective to have technical measures in place, if possible. As in, no mater how much you&#x27;d like, you can&#x27;t track a user across the web if their browser doesn&#x27;t accept third-party cookies. And many app developers are in no way better than web developers with their incentives, intentions and tactics, it&#x27;s just that the web makes these issues more noticeable.')
