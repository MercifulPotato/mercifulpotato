Debugging skills are not that hard to teach, while of course practice makes perfect.<p>Debugging is not limited to EE&#x2F;CS courses of course. The sound on the TV doesn&#x27;t work? But you still get a picture? So the HDMI cable is carrying the video correctly. Sound goes through the same cable, so it&#x27;s not a cable issue. Do you hear sound if you switch to another input? Then the speaker is working fine. And so on. Divide and conquer.<p>Debugging (figuring out problems) relies on a handful of basic principles:<p>- having some understanding of how the system works<p>- looking for differences. A works, B doesn&#x27;t. What are the differences between A and B?<p>- tracing issues through components (the data we care about makes it to the database, but the UI doesn&#x27;t show it)<p>That&#x27;s about it. Definitely teachable.')
