One of Apple&#x27;s first investors was the Small Business Investment Company, an investment arm of the federal government. The EU would be stupid to not support the development of an independent technology sector.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;discoveries&#x2F;disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100660" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;discoveries&#x2F;disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100660</a>')
