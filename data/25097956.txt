And here is where the tail might chase the dog: it&#x27;s the definition, not an observation I&#x27;d think.<p>&gt; When performing a Fourier transform, we represent the signal in a new basis, where each component<p>... each component is a sine, that is described by the 3 constants above.<p>&gt; In simpler words, it comes down to the barber pole illusion. If you rotate a spring-shaped 3d curve, it looks as if it was traveling upwards. And the 2d projection of the spring are Sines and cosine.<p>Exactly, a complex exponential function is just that spring. And if the absolute value of the argument is not exactly one, the spring spirals outwards or inwards.')
