Item(by='jelliclesfarm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611018193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819521, text='There is an evolution of the soul ashwini to Bharani to krittika.<p>The soul is untethered and wandering in ashwini...in Bharani it’s bound in the womb, hanging upside down and dependent on the mother for everything. It is undecided and while everyone awaits the arrival...the birth..the fetus chooses when to make its appearance.<p>In krittika tho’ ..it’s the nakshatra of individuality..the soul is born and possesses independence. It is demanding and curious. The symbol is the knife. It’s the knife that cuts the umbilical cord of the baby to step from a metaphysical existence to a physical existence.<p>For Krittika prominent charts, the best remedy is to give unselfishly to others. Without calculating. Like agni who was the deliverer of the sacrificial offerings to the gods and humans..his duty being that he has to give equally and fairly to everyone their rightful share. Krittikas will overcome challenges by sharing and being fair.<p>Another one of my favorite stories to read is the story of Nachiketa and Yama from Katha Upanishad. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nachiketa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nachiketa</a> It is the archetype of Krittika and Bharani. (Nachiketa and Yama respectively)<p>Something beautiful happens in the stories. I started reading all the Puranas and Upanishads with a different perspective after I started studying astrology.<p>I think ..with enough time..I can map all the stories to make sense of a kind of progression of action and karma. It’s all there...only thing tho’.. it’s coded.')
