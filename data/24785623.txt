That&#x27;s been my general experience, and we&#x27;ve also been printing through Linux at work for <i>decades</i> now - and with CUPS about since it arrived. The number of printers we&#x27;ve been through I have lost count of, but they work. We print all kind of documents, at sometimes an industrial scale. And of course it doesn&#x27;t matter what the document <i>is</i>, pure text or not.  \nAt the home front the HP printers &quot;just work&quot;, the only slightly tricky one was a Ricoh laser printer I was given - it doesn&#x27;t use PS or PCL but instead its own system. That needed a 3rd party driver.')
