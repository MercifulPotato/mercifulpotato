This country has never accepted calls for violent overthrow of our democratic system as &quot;freedom of expression&quot;, and that&#x27;s a view that&#x27;s been upheld by all three branches of government across all eras of our history from the founding (Shays Rebellion?) through the Civil War (which definitively settled that armed rebellion is not a permissible way to settle political differences) through World War I (which defined our current laws about sedition and restrictions on the freedoms in the First Amendment) to the present day. You don&#x27;t have a right to force anyone else -- individuals or private corporations -- to amplify your views, and you certainly don&#x27;t have a right to incite violence or rebellion even on your own dime.<p>EDIT: This would be a <i>less bad take</i> if Parler had been booted just because people on the platform voted for Trump, but to be clear: Parler was booted because <i>it was used to organize an armed rebellion with the explicit goal of finding and executing members of Congress certifying a democratic vote</i>, and <i>its users have been encouraging people to feed Democrats&#x27; families into woodchippers while making them watch</i>.')
