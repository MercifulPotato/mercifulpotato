There can be a relationship, sure- but  suicide, by and large, comes from a mentality where the victim legitimately believes they will not ever be happy enough in the future to counter-balance the pain that&#x27;s consuming them in the present. In their despair, they truly believe that suicide is the only way they can end the suffering. In their minds, this is quite literally their only hope. To say that this is caused by feeling rejected by society is extremely narrow, so please be aware of that.<p>This having been said, trying to begin a relationship while in the throes of depression is not a good idea. If you can&#x27;t love yourself, it sows the seeds for a highly unhealthy dependent or codependent relationship- even someone who isn&#x27;t actively considering ending their life can&#x27;t thrive like that.<p>Finally, consider this: let&#x27;s say the person using this app is indeed suicidal because they feel like they&#x27;ve been rejected by society- dating apps are infamous for short-lived relationships, rejection, and predatory subscription models (search hn and you will find any number of threads discussing this last one). Even if this is a truly altruistic service without a predatory subscription model, what do you think someone who is in the depths of despair will do if they&#x27;re rejected by a community that markets itself as a haven for the rejected? If they weren&#x27;t at the very edge of suicide before, how much closer did they just get pushed?<p>In short, be aware that there&#x27;s a fair bit more going on than &quot;maybe they feel lonely.&quot; I suspect this approach would do more harm than good.')
