It’s a bit like refusing to have gloves in your house, so that a burglar can’t borrow your gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.<p>Adware, spyware, and malware has always had the ability to avoid system DNS. At its most basic, they could hardcode lists of IPs into their malicious code. At its most complex, the same building blocks that DoH&#x2F;DoT use were available to them: they could build similar tools that tunnel over HTTPS&#x2F;SSH&#x2F;etc, whichever protocol they felt was least conspicuous on their target system. Drop a list of hostnames into a pastebin post, tell your malware to check the list for updates, profit.<p>DoH in Firefox simply makes the above issue harder to ignore. Before this, an enterprise or individual sysadmin could implement DNS inspection at the border, see logs showing their users browsing naughty websites, and feel like they’d made progress. But they’d always be blind to attackers (or nefarious users) who just didn’t bother using the stock DNS offering to bootstrap their hijinks. Detecting that has always required device-level monitoring or further MITM of traffic; learning about DoH makes that more obvious to sysadmins, but it doesn’t materially change what adversaries were able to do already.')
