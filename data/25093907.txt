The reason many more Harvard CS students talk about Google &gt; Stripe is not because Stripe is not prestigious (it obviously is, and plenty of super talented students go there). It&#x27;s because Google hires a ton of Harvard CS grads, whereas many late-stage startups do not hire as many new grads, nor do they have as large of hiring pools. They&#x27;re going to have an obviously larger impact on the sorts of jobs people discuss.<p>The same thing with GS, Jane Street, or Citadel, because they actively recruit at Harvard through on-campus recruiting and hire a comparatively large portion of Harvard graduates.<p>This is related to the other reason that companies like Google are talked about much more than mid-stage startups: the school on your diploma has much larger impact at these big, more calcified companies than it does on startups where individual hires could help make-or-break the company. And places like McKinsey or Bain basically hire many students so they can tell clients they have a team of Harvard grads working on the problem.<p>&gt; they assume their intelligence insulates them from peer pressure.<p>If you come into Harvard with this notion, I can&#x27;t really see how you stay with it after your first recruiting&#x2F;punch season. And, honestly, Harvard undergrads aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> smart.')
