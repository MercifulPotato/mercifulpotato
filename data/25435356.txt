Item(by='tomsmeding', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608066922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435113, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve often wondered if this means I am an introvert. I don&#x27;t hate other people - on the contrary, I always try to be kind and respectful, and I try to see the humanity in people, even those who hold different views to me. I care a lot about society and the future of our species and our planet. I just don&#x27;t feel a need to have social interactions in these tight-knit groups, having realized that they were the source of pretty much all my emotional struggles.<p>I don&#x27;t think whether one is an introvert necessarily has anything to do with whether one is kind and respectful. While being kind certainly seems like a beneficial thing if you&#x27;re an extrovert, it doesn&#x27;t seem quite necessary, and on the flip side preferring a quiet room doesn&#x27;t mean one can&#x27;t be kind.<p>At least, I feel the same as you in that I&#x27;m certainly not one to do lots of partying (ignoring the special case of 2020), but I always try to be kind, helpful, etc. I&#x27;m not sure I can find myself in your story about emotional struggles, but that might just be my young age.<p>&gt; One thing I do think is important to note is that this is somewhat of a privileged position to be in<p>Agree completely, there are various advantages to being wealthy enough to make your own choices about how to organise your life. This amount of wealth does not even necessarily mean &quot;being rich&quot;, though in a sense we in that position are definitely rich (both money and other things), even if there are people far richer in terms of monetary value. And those &quot;various advantages&quot; can wind up being more than one may think, both those in the position of wealth and those not in that position.')
