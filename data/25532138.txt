But it&#x27;s ok because that group of posh muppets in the ERG stand to make a wad of cash from their crony mates and we&#x27;re now a &quot;Sovereign&quot; nation. Which is excellent apart from the fact it&#x27;s made up faux history bullshit from another era of &quot;great&quot; Britain that never actually existed and certainly doesn&#x27;t exist in a globally transient world.<p>The whole thing has been a very, very expensive, entirely farcical (laughable if it wasn&#x27;t going to royally bugger large swathes of the country) exercise in nihilism.<p>Bitter much? Yes. Yes I am.')
