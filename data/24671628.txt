Item(by='ragingrobot', descendants=None, kids=[24678228], score=None, time=1601728840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670746, text='I&#x27;m 41, and have been using it for over 2 decades.<p>It&#x27;s always been a hobby. I work in a non-tech field, I have just liked it better than alternatives, and like the tinkering bit.<p>It started about 1993, as a freshman at Bronx Science. The school&#x27;s internet terminals ran AIX (IBM X Stations with these nice big 21&quot; CRTs). Senior year, a friend gave me a CD from Walnut Creek. That was Slackware.  Started playing with it, and liked it. I was using a custom built 486 I bought at a computer show. However, things were far from easy as documentation back then was hard to find.<p>From there, first year of college (1998), I moved to Red Hat (at 5.1) and with the help of a guy on IRC got the Sound Blaster drivers compiled, X running, and everything else I needed. The college computers at the time ran VAX (not so Unix-y) and Digital&#x27;s OS&#x2F;F, so again I felt right at home with a Unix-like OS.<p>From there it was a wrap. Haven&#x27;t touched any proprietary system since. In between there&#x27;s been periods of using BSD, and a lot of &quot;distro hopping.&quot;<p>Twenty three years later, I&#x27;m almost back where I started - Fedora. Still a hobbyist, still tinkering.')
