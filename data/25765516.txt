E.g. you don&#x27;t become upper class as a prostitute or drug dealer, just because you manged to get by well.<p>Either way, within a class a white man will still have better chances for influence and freedom than a black trans woman. So gender and &quot;race&quot; are not obsolete classifications.<p>However, I think any sense of identity is the cognitive fallout of experiencing lack of self-efficacy, chronically. Seeing the increase in white men building an identity around being &quot;white&quot; and male, too, indicates a wide decrease in class mobility.<p>Pitching those identities against each other is indeed class warfare.<p>Based Tucker Carlson: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;PoliticalCompassMemes&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fwnwft&#x2F;peak_auth_unity_achieved&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;PoliticalCompassMemes&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fwnw...</a>')
