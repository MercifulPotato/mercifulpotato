I saw it fail again, and again, and again, and again, AND AGAIN, and again, and again. Then I saw it fail some more. The promised features never materialized, and the drama and surprising behaviors never ceased. All costs, no benefits? I&#x27;ll leave that on the shelf, a few spots down from reiserfs (which was plenty sketchy BEFORE you know who did you know what).</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11&#x2F;feedback&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11&#x2F;feedback&#x2F;</a><p>As to file systems in general, I think they covered them very well..<p>As to Plex, he also mentioned the others:<p><i>Jellyfin and Emby are two notable players in this space (playback on any device) but we should also mention Kodi. Kodi is great if your use case is local only as automated media transcoding for the target device isn&#x27;t something that this software does. But, for me, Plex is still the best overall in this category. It has the slickest UI and the most features. Despite this, the progress being made by Emby and Jellyfin recently is very impressive and these are both projects to watch closely.</i>')
