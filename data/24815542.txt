The &quot;store everything&quot; has always existed in my experience, that&#x27;s how the aggregates were built in the first place. The aggregates were for speed and convenience, and you drill-down as necessary, including to the individual record level.<p>Maybe the shift is people thinking that it&#x27;s cheaper to just analyze the entire corpus on-demand because we can throw a spark cluster at it?')
