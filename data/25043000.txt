What you need during that period, can be extremely different from what mom, dad, grandma or the person who shows up needs.<p>And not all of us chimps are very good at expressing and&#x2F;or being fully conscious of our needs(esp during a big shock) so don&#x27;t judge people for looking like they need one thing but finding comfort in another.<p>Those needs exist on a very wide spectrum.
