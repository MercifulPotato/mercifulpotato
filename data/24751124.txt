Last issue i had wasn&#x27;t as bad the random hangs&#x2F;reboots (which fortunately hasn&#x27;t happened recently) but i simply couldn&#x27;t launch the crimson UI <i>at all</i>. I had to do a full reset and reinstall of the drivers for it to appear again.<p>In comparison updating to the latest Nvidia driver when i had an Nvidia GPU (which was since early 2000s to ~2 years ago) was basically a non-issue: i wouldn&#x27;t even think twice about it as i never had any issue.<p>And FWIW that was the same on Linux too: i never had issues with Nvidia&#x27;s drivers there either and performance was more or less the same (at least for OpenGL stuff). But note that i avoid stuff like Wayland, hybrid GPUs, etc like the plague.')
