I get quite a lot of value from the link roundups, but find that the original content (the non-roundup posts) are about praising their ability to make predictions and their own opinion pieces (“recommended throughout”), brushing away criticism, regurgitating opinions of other experts on things they have no clue about, taking low-brow jabs at “the left“, etc.<p>Case in point: MR authors spent the last months arguing for the herd immunity approach, and bringing up Sweden once a week, and now apparently  they were just waiting for data.<p>I just don’t get why they get so much readership and are seen to be similar to Slate Star Codex, Gwern, etc. (which have their own shortcomings, but are on a different level in terms of their reasoning ability).')
