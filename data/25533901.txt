Also it feels few understand how seasons work.  Every solstice and equinox prompts a news article or two explaining what the terms mean.  Four times a year.  So for them &quot;Sun moves around the earth&quot; is actually just as good as &quot;Earth goes around the Sun.&quot;<p>When I was a kid I carefully recorded the position of the sun for a year, and plotted the sun&#x27;s &quot;motion around the earth&quot;.  Then I flipped it around and had the earth&#x27;s orbit.  (I also plotted Venus and Mars, as much as I could see them, and they plotted fine, once I switched to heliocentric.<p>I seem to remember that this was how Kepler came up with equal angles in equal time; I am sure I read it in a book and followed what it said, but that was many decades ago.<p>So the reasons are readily available without any tool but a pen and paper, but I don&#x27;t think they are even meaningful to most people. I can&#x27;t really blame them.')
