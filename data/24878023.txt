I still have to derive pitches manually, and while singing the sound of my voice is loud enough that I don&#x27;t hear the tinnintus anymore and I often don&#x27;t notice my singing going slightly out of tune.<p>I do have the ability to recognize relative pitches in relation to e. g. accompaniment playing in a given key, and this recognition is automatic in a way that the derive-from-tinnitus definitely isn&#x27;t.<p>Also sometimes the tinnitus goes out of tune down to almost E4, this sucks.')
