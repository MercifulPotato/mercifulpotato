And the ones we got a hold of were generally pretty attentive and actually understood what we were talking about, and could even help most of the time.<p>However the reps were pretty up front that as soon as a support issue crossed the line onto any other team at Google... you best just figure out a workaround, because even once we&#x27;d already crossed the threshold and had someone inside Google working on our behalf, there was just nothing that could be done.<p>And yeah, this has led me to be extremely resistant to moving _any_ infrastructure we care about to GCP. I have zero faith my account won&#x27;t just be suddenly banned one day with no effective recourse. And I&#x27;d also never recommend any &quot;paid support&quot; option they offered like some people are suggesting they provide, because I&#x27;d have no faith in their support team being able to actually solve the sorts of issues that are hard for people to solve on their own.')
