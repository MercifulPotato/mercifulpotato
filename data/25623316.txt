It&#x27;s simply not a thing over here. Whether you&#x27;ll be granted a mortgage (usually) simply depends on whether or not you have a steady source of income that&#x27;s sufficient to cover the risk. Whether or not you missed a CC payment when you were on an extended trip really doesn&#x27;t factor into it. I think I prefer it this way.')
