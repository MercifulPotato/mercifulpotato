The credential is pretty meaningless if it can simply be purchased, people will catch on quickly enough.<p>The ideal business is then one that actively inflates the credential&#x27;s value while lowering the difficulty of achieving it.  The best way to do this is to increase selectivity&#x2F;restrict supply, raise prices, lower difficulty (grade inflation), and increase the time required to get the credential, while providing alternate activities for those who are inclined to do something other than receiving an education.<p>Heck you can get degree credit by virtue of living in a foreign country via a study abroad program.<p>The other activities a university may participate in like research, or educating only matter to the extent they enhance the &quot;prestige&quot; of the credential or to benefit the minority of students who value academic rigor <i>more so</i> than the credential.')
