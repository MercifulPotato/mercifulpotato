Which is an obscure way of saying &quot;a cataclysmic change&quot;. If we keep up the pace of innovation, something is going to change very severely, and we have no idea what or how.<p>I think about it in terms of weapons. Over time we increasingly advanced the innovation of weapons. In an extremely short amount of time we peaked at nuclear weapons, which, if they were actually used regularly, would reach a phase transition: virtually all life on the planet destroyed, with a small collection of humanity transitioning to underground bunkers and underground warfare. And then some new life would emerge on the planet and take over, like a radioactive slime mold or something. <i>So far</i> we have simply decided not to trigger this change, but all someone has to do right now is push a big red button.<p>So the infinitely increasing innovation leads to a cataclysmic phase transition. I think the point is that there&#x27;s <i>lots</i> of these things that are moving towards phase transition.')
