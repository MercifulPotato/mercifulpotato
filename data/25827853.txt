This one surely would hit plenty of boxes: scientists don’t pay attention to industry, researchers only care about grants, etc. It’s a lot of words just to say “they need bigger datasets”, which is also a check box.<p>The article ends by suggesting using GitHub. When I was a PhD student I recall open source projects being a standard data source for people who did software engineering research. But it’s not my field, so I’m not sure if effort estimation really has missed this.')
