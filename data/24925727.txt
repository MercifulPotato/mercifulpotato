Optimistically for wayland this might change between 2024-26 at which point application developers can stop supporting it at which point people who are so inclined can provide an x11 build of Firefox in 2026-2028 which are liable to work through 2030.<p>In a less optimal world we are still in step one in 2030.<p>Anyone who thinks X is going anywhere this decade is dreaming.')
