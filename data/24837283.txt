Item(by='pessimizer', descendants=None, kids=[24839002], score=None, time=1603202002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836805, text='&gt; people in the real world need to use it<p>There is absolutely no purpose other than propagandistic for the percentage commonly referred to as &quot;unemployment&quot; with no other qualifiers. That number&#x27;s only purpose is to start dropping a short time after an unemployment shock whether or not any jobs were actually added to the economy.<p>The other numbers aren&#x27;t to give a &quot;broad picture&quot; of the labor market, they&#x27;re to give the entire picture of the labor market. &quot;Unemployment&quot; contributes nothing. At the time of a shock it echos other metrics, and after a pause of a few months it announces that whatever the administration announced its reaction to the shock would be is starting to work, no matter what the other numbers say.')
