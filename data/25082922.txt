Item(by='strombofulous', descendants=None, kids=[25083279], score=None, time=1605279666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082703, text='Last time I used it there were two fees (I don&#x27;t remember exactly what they were called but it was like a service charge and a delivery fee) and dashpass only covers one.<p>Also in my experience (in Chicago) the food in the app costed $1-2 more per item (this wasn&#x27;t listed anywhere, but if you compare the cost with what the resturant charged it was a lot more).<p>Also there was at least one resturant that I visited that would give you less if you ordered through a delivery app to make up for the fact that they had to pay a fee. This is shady and shitty on the resturant&#x27;s part and not <i>really</i> DD&#x27;s fault (although frankly it&#x27;s kind of predictable) but it was still a thing that happened when I used the app.<p>I haven&#x27;t used it for about a year though (because of the above shady practices) so they might have changed.')
