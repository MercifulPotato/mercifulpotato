As someone who is creating a product in the same niche that you&#x27;re targeting while also coming from a non-OECD country, I can confidently say that you wrote something valuable from reading through your index.<p>Marketing the book and getting to the audience would definitely be a challenge if you&#x27;re targeting non-OECD country audience. $10 is a good price because CTCI is $10 and a good bunch of my network bought the physical book before they got a job (most just pirated the PDF). The set of people who bought the book was only due to the word-of-mouth recommendations from the CS crowd. I&#x27;d say taking up the strategy of marketing the book like Learn Python the Hard Way would be effective:<p>- Give the e-book version for free.\n- Create enough buzz around your book with reviews from your target audience and in CS forums.\n- Once there is network effect, you could release a revised version and make it paid.<p>It&#x27;d take time and iterations to perfect it, but Learn Python the Hard Way is now priced at $29.99 and it generates good sales. Good luck!')
