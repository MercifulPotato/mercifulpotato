The main design problem could be deciding exactly where between ConTeXt and Soulver should the new tool&#x2F;language lie power-wise, i.e., how much should it expose.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing using TeX directly, rather I&#x27;m proposing basing a new, simpler language on the Lua(Meta)TeX TeX engine, and probably also on ConTeXt&#x2F;LMTX.')
