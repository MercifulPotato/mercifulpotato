The law is short and unambiguous[1]. There is no provision that says providers lose immunity if they go “above clear, previously set guidelines”. That is some straight made up garbage.<p><i>If</i> what you were saying were true (again, it is not!), the “clear, previously set guidelines” are right in YouTube’s Terms. Those Terms explicitly say that they have no obligation to host your content, might change the rules, might remove your stuff, and you’re OK with that. And, even better, the issue of whether or not a provider can lose their S230 immunities through harm due to the reliance on misrepresentation of material fact was adjudicated in Green v America Online[2] and the answer was no! In that case, AOL’s member agreement was clear and binding. YouTube’s member agreement is similarly clear and binding. YouTube cannot lose their immunity in the way you claim.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawfareblog.com&#x2F;whats-name-quite-bit-if-youre-talking-about-section-230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawfareblog.com&#x2F;whats-name-quite-bit-if-youre-ta...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;47&#x2F;230</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;green-v-aol.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;green-v-aol.pdf</a>')
