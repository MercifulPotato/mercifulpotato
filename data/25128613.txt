Mozilla fired a person who donated money to a deplorable cause. You can try to hide behind free speech, but we all know what this is about.<p>He quit. And I don’t agree with it, but I wouldn’t exactly call his cause deplorable. People with those views can believe they’re being completely ethical. That was also in 2008, a different political climate, and nobody allowed him to learn from it or to restitute.<p>Of course, I agree that wasn’t their downfall—it was simply misdirected goals and funding.')
