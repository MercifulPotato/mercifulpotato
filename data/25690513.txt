I was under the impression that you were claiming that Matrix is less secure than WhatsApp. If they both leak metadata then they&#x27;re roughly equal from a privacy perspective no? I guess with WhatsApp you can&#x27;t know the extent of metadata leakage, but at least with Matrix, you have the advantage of knowing precisely what data is leaked.<p>Not trying to push Matrix or anything, i&#x27;ve been using Signal for some time already anyway, but thought i&#x27;d see what alternatives there are. The lack of chat backups is a real drawback, though since the Android version has a backup option, i&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s something they&#x27;ll eventually implement?')
