As the other commenter gave an example, if you have a niche product which only a fraction of people would be ever interested in, it would help if you can know who those are, and restrict targeting to them.<p>I can search for knitting needles or be viewing a knitting post on Instagram. If an artisan needle seller wants to target his product it doesn&#x27;t help targeting people who are not interested into artisan stuff. So to maximize the ad budget impact the ads are better left targeted specifically to people who have a higher likelihood of buying artisan stuff. This problem doesn&#x27;t affect some mass market knitting needle seller.')
