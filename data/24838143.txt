This took months to fix and the person bringing it up initially was yelled at about not understanding programming languages in the discord channel.<p>Another one I personally brought up was that the standard library&#x27;s utf-8 module had a decoder that panics on invalid input sequences, certainly setting consumers up for DOS attacks with malformed utf-8 inputs. EDIT: DOS vulnerability is still there (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;std&#x2F;unicode.zig#L695-L697" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;std&#x2F;unicode.z...</a>, PR to fix that was closed <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;pull&#x2F;4929" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;pull&#x2F;4929</a>). I never responded to the PR because it was at that moment I decided to abandon Zig altogether.<p>The response to the latter was pretty much &quot;the standard library isn&#x27;t meant to be used right now&quot;, to which I really don&#x27;t have a response. There was a very, very long and heated argument in the discord channel about it where instead of addressing the concerns about DOS and security I was instead insulted for apparently trying to taint an otherwise perfect language.<p>The community is vile and the few examples I&#x27;ve seen of the maintainer disregarding safety and security in this way don&#x27;t give me any amount of confidence in the project overall.<p>EDIT: Worth mentioning, the syntax and semantics surrounding Zig are not new ideas. I&#x27;m sure another project will pop up at some point to compete; many discussions I&#x27;ve seen in the language design channels on IRC and a few discord servers have many people arriving at similar conclusions Zig has made, without knowing Zig even exists. I think we&#x27;re slowly converging on a language that looks a lot like Zig, but I don&#x27;t think Zig will be its ultimate incarnation.')
