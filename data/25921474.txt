I&#x27;d be interested in knowing about cases where it doesn&#x27;t work well.<p>My experience on systems without indexes differs strongly from yours.  Yes, they can work well.  But if you have multiple use cases for how your data is being queried, they push you into keeping multiple copies of your data.  And then it is very, very easy to lose consistency.  And yes, I know about &quot;eventual consistency&quot; and all that - I&#x27;ve found that in practice it is a nightmare of special cases that winds up nowhere good.')
