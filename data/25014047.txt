I think it is reasonable in some cases, but there are many use cases (vanilla CRUD web apps) where a web framework is really helpful.<p>The standard library is very low level. Want sessions? DIY. Want user auth? DIY. Want CSRF protection? DIY. The list goes on.<p>It feels like a waste of time implementing these &quot;solved problems&quot; from scratch, but the biggest problem is how easy it is to introduce security vulnerabilities when implementing from scratch, or forgetting to do so.<p>It’s nice to learn concepts from first principals by using the standard library. But once I know how these things work, I’d rather rely on someone else’s battle tested code and best practices.<p>Yes, you can add in separate libraries to solve these specific problems, but they are less likely to compose as well as they would in a framework. On top of this, each time you pull in a new library you have to spend time evaluating it. When I use a framework I don&#x27;t have to think.')
