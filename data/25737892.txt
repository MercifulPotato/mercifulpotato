I should&#x27;ve said something like &quot;what if they censored progressive reform instead of violence and hatred&quot;.<p>&gt; One could equally easily assume ... the left would instead organize outside corporate communication channels (as it has in the past) for boycotts, demonstrations, and mobilization<p>Yes, but one could also assume the extremists are going to do the same thing to stage another insurrection. And, under the argument that they still have freedom of speech, there is nothing we could do.<p>The point is that people are supporting the current, reasonable policy (censoring hate speech and calls for violence) with the wrong justification (private companies that control communication can do whatever they want). This particularly becomes a problem when the companies decide to use their censorship for profit at the expense of indie studios (which has happened), and said studios don&#x27;t have good alternatives.')
