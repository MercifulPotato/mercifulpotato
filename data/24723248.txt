It reads the same as someone telling me I&#x27;m enabling fascism by not posting a black square on instagram or whatever.<p>I&#x27;m nearing the point of being aggressively dismissive towards this kind of attitude, because a lot of it doesn&#x27;t even seem to be laid out in good faith. People are just addicted to being mad, addicted to being right, addicted to the idea that they can channel their anger through pop politics and get validation for it as a bonus.<p>I have an extremely low opinion of the people and groups who follow along with whatever pop social issue is trending today because they don&#x27;t want to get in trouble, and IMHO those people aren&#x27;t really worth interacting with because again, it&#x27;s more about landing a spicy dunk on the bad guys (tm) and collecting heart icons than whatever issue they&#x27;re using as a weapon today.<p>&gt;your work is not apolitical. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you&#x27;re building<p>spare me.')
