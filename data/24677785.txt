Is anyone here well versed in the state of the art of brain plasticity? I always wondered if you could slow down Alzheimer&#x27;s disease by trying to &quot;outpace&quot; the brain decline by forming new connections at a faster pace. Learning a language was the first thing that came to mind.<p>I&#x27;d also be very interested in a comparison of two language vs. three language. Switzerland would be the obvious choice but children from partners that don&#x27;t speak the same language and use English as a lingua franca or Canadians with one extra language (Chinese living in Canada etc.) should provide a big enough sample.')
