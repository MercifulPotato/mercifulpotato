(Those who can create VScode plugins and don&#x27;t know emacs, have no idea how convoluted creating a vscode plugin is, and how trivial it is in emacs).<p>Even if I happen to do something via VSCode, I still use Emacs for Org, Magit, etc. and also as the above mentioned programming platform, because I found these mini apps with key&#x2F;text interface help a lot with everyday tasks.')
