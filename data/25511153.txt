It feels artificial, especially when practically every media outlet has the same vitriolic tone.<p>I don’t play games much anymore, but I did pick Cyberpunk 2077 up (via Stadia) and I’ve found it to be a blast. Certainly not perfect, but absolutely a world worth exploring. My favorite part are the details; there are tons of little stories and narratives in the items you pick up during each mission. The constant barrage of negativity surrounding it make no sense to me.')
