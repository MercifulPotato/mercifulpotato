These places get a better idea of the actual IFR and are diluted out by places that falsify data (China) and aren&#x27;t capable of taking real population level data (smaller and undeveloped countries).<p>The first part of the paper is justifying this choice as to not dilute out the measurements from the small regions. I guess if you hang a lampshade on it like that it almost makes sense this paper was approved. But it&#x27;s easily misinterpreted.')
