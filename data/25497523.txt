(They weren&#x27;t, by the way.)<p>This isn&#x27;t an uncommon scenario, and one where price transparency isn&#x27;t really going to help.<p>Also, what am I supposed to do, decline the services of an anesthesiologist and request an in-network one? What if there isn&#x27;t an in-network one on duty? What if they&#x27;re busy? if I need a surgery now, what choice do I have?')
