Item(by='spyspy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611845833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25942558, text='Users on r&#x2F;WallStreetBets have rallied around buying stocks, like GameStop ($GME), that are heavily shorted by the market (generally by larger trading firms). This buying has driven the stock prices up very very quickly, because of the buying itself and other knock-on market forces (google: gamma traps, short squeezes). The players that were short have thus lost a lot of money on their bets. r&#x2F;WSB has taken a lot of pride in this and using it as a rallying cry to keep buying. It&#x27;s mostly bs - everyone just wants to get rich - but it&#x27;s effective and making headlines.')
