I recall seeing GME pump starting right about then in Sept.  I am also convinced that the shorting hedge funds could have been  playing it on the up side  via options.  They could have sold puts; bought calls.  There are a lot of dark pools that are not transparent to know who is doing what.  It is pretty naive to believe that all these hedge funds dabbling in these type of games are the sheep and not the wolves.<p>Both the new shareholders who are now the insiders and the hedge funds are likely to be aware of the small float that would kick started the short covering pyramiding scheme and reddit would have provided the pawns to spawn it really fast.<p>Don&#x27;t be naive.  They fundies have been hitting all the high volatility stocks with small floats&#x2F; high short ratios.')
