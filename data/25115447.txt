Do you know that the &#x27;safety feature&#x27; phones home every single app you use clear as daylight on any network you&#x27;re on? Your ISP can log what you&#x27;re using, what time, where from. Apple is supposedly big on privacy, yet this was handled by many engineers who thought it was OK to do. That&#x27;s called hypocrisy. You should be calling out Apple too.<p>&quot;Apples platform is based on curation&quot; yep, here it is. That&#x27;s the iphone developer Mantra. Except were talking macos. What you&#x27;re saying is nobody can create and run applications without apples signature. That apple gets to control it all.<p>Whatever happened to developer freedom? The ability to create and share? That disrespect software development, that disrespects it&#x27;s origins, and instead of seeing how hypocritical that is you create excuses for the company that chokes the life out of it.<p>These are terrible apologies for the world&#x27;s richest company. You advocate against yourself by thinking &quot;it&#x27;s apples way or it&#x27;s the highway&quot;. You willingly give up consumer control and make logical fallacies to ignore having to address the cognitive dissonance.<p>This is why right to repair is being chosen by voters.
