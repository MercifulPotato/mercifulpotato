It is able model some aspects of quark gluon plasma. [1]  Not a high energy theorist myself, but this is the retort some of my friends would give.  It also is well motivated by an entire human history&#x27;s worth of experimental data which any new theory needs to reproduce.  Wolfram fails even to show that this is the case for his work.  Note: I&#x27;m also not a &quot;true believer&quot; of string theory, but comparing it to Wolfram isn&#x27;t fair.<p>&gt; Not convinced that&#x27;s true.<p>Besides making a point about string theory, do you really have a reason to believe that?  I know many high energy physics folks myself and work with some of them.  I have never met someone that does this professionally that has given Wolfram&#x27;s theories a second thought.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bnl.gov&#x2F;rhic&#x2F;news&#x2F;091107&#x2F;story2.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bnl.gov&#x2F;rhic&#x2F;news&#x2F;091107&#x2F;story2.asp</a>')
