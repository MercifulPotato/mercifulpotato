What ever this instruction, it just has to be invalid.</i><p>On x86 at least, it is a valid instruction. INT3, or CC in hex. There are also the debug registers which implement breakpoints without modifying any code, although it&#x27;s limited to a maximum of 4 at once.<p>Characterising gdb as a &quot;C debugger&quot; is quite appropriate --- try to debug the Asm directly with it is an excruciating experience.')
