Beyond that, there is nothing more the police can do for victims. Victims need laws passed to help their communities from turning to crime in the first place or laws that decriminalize so called victimless crimes. Part of those changes means funding schools and small businesses and tax abatement for those in most need. So now, while we are talking about funding we look at the city budget. Lo and behold, police departments take a lot (in some cases a plurality) of total tax revenue that could be used to help victims in ways beyond deterrence. That is why we talk about defunding police. That is the context in which we are focusing on victims. The police create many victims on their own and currently have no internal way to fix that problem.')
