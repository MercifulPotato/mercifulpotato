You&#x27;ll find plenty of 0-1s essentially filing paperwork in HHC, who have no subordinates reporting to them, across the Army. The overwhelming majority of 0-1s who are &quot;line managers&quot; will be in the Combat Arms branches (Infantry, Armor, Field Artillery, etc), and you&#x27;ll still find 0-1s making slide decks for the Battalion Commander while they wait until it&#x27;s their time for a Platoon.')
