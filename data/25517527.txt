It may not happen instantly, but it’s inevitable. You’re simply removing one of the only competitive metrics that customers have to choose between brokerage firms and replacing it with something opaque. (The fact that Robinhood even exists is proof that explicit-fee brokerage models produce competition from lower-fee competitors.)<p>Unfortunately, the degree to which customers are getting fleeced is hard to know. <i>Which, let me repeat, is exactly why this model exists.</i> The article mentions it’s at least $34M but even the SEC seems unable to calculate the exact amount. And if they can’t determine it, then how in the world is the typical customer supposed to? At the end of the day, the degree to which customers are getting fleeced is probably exactly proportional to Robinhood’s revenue from order flow. If RH is receiving vastly less revenue-per-customer from that source than explicit-fee exchanges make from fees and order flow, then customers are getting a possible bargain. If RH is doing as well or even better with this model than competitors, their customers are probably getting screwed and don’t even realize it. (And if by some miracle RH isn’t abusing this, then other brokerages will abuse it and try to outcompete RH.)')
