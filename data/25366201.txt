Search engines from all over that you&#x27;ve never heard of, but they&#x27;re all showing accurate user agents. I don&#x27;t attribute every access by far, of course, but for a small website (with peaks to high HN ranks, so it&#x27;s not unknown or that badly linked) it&#x27;s manageable to tail -f the access log and see that the traffic you&#x27;re getting matches what you expect after e.g. posting a link in a chat group. About 99% of traffic in such a case fall within the categories &quot;human-looking user agent visiting this newly created URL that I just shared in the group&quot; and &quot;random bot traffic&quot;.')
