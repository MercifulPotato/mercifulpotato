Because what&#x27;s truly essential is <i>Web access</i> - for communicating with your friends and family, for access to government services and banking, and bunch of other little things you may need to do to secure a job, etc. Most of these things you can do even better on a computer - <i>if you own one</i>. A smartphone is the cheapest personal device with full-featured Web access these days, which is how it becomes essential for people who can&#x27;t afford a computer (and a place to keep it, i.e. a home).')
