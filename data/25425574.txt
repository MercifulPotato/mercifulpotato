America has a lot of assets, in the black population, they should encourage people to visit their homeland, on a paid trip. Helping the African economy and helping African Americans create business connects to Africa. Then there should be a programme where African Americans get a lump sum, if they start a business or invest in land in Africa. France is doing something similar but Americans have a much higher advantage something like 30 million people of African decent.<p>After visiting Africa I think will also help people expand their mind set about the world and that Africa is not a bad place and has lot of opportunities.<p>Africa has a lot of future, plenty of growth. China knows this and has invested a lot into Africa.<p>Taiwan does something similar with a paid trip to visit Taiwan to learn about the culture and history and create business connection between the people.<p>It would not cost anything as well, you just reallocate aid money.<p>To a degree European Africans have been doing this for a long time, plenty of YouTube videos about people moving to Africa to start a business. Fun to watch too. Many of these European Africans have positions of power in the government or private sector.<p>Thoughts?')
