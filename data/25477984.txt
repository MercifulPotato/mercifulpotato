It wasn&#x27;t the best by any measure, far from it, but I liked it, just because it was extremely easy to modify everything.<p>They advertised it as having a 1.5GHz CPU, but the governor was set up to practically never let it go beyond 1.2 GHz - most of the time it would top at 1GHz. Shenanigans.<p>The clock&#x2F;voltage configuration for <i>everything</i> (CPU, GPU, RAM, some other stuff) was stored in a password protected Excel file (.xls!), and removing the protection was laughably easy. The kernel would compile with the data directly from that file, I haven&#x27;t seen that before.<p>I was able to play with the settings to my heart&#x27;s content. I got the CPU to run at a real 1.8Ghz, at which point the phone would literally burn through the battery at around 1% <i>per second</i> under full load. Of course, it would get extremely hot and shutdown in about half a minute :D<p>I got that phone super optimized, custom CPU,GPU and RAM clocks and voltages, got an extra hour of screen on time out of it and it was smooth as hell, a stark change from the default settings.<p>The damn GPS wouldn&#x27;t work while moving though, which was pretty ridiculous.')
