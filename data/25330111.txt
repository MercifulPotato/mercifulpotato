I think that&#x27;s an indication of lack of sufficient regression test coverage, coupled with complacency&#x2F;fatigue from working on the same code base for an extended period of time.<p>Unfortunately, the most business critical pieces of code tend to be the least regression tested. It&#x27;s the earliest stuff that was made before any test frameworks were matured, it&#x27;s been hacked on countless times by half the team based on shifting requirements to the point that no one understands it fully, and any future changes are such a high priority that it&#x27;s &quot;faster&quot; to test it manually or in production.<p>I am of course guilty of that myself on some pieces of code. I try to prioritize cleaning up expensive tech debt, though. When folk are hesitant to modify a piece of code, it&#x27;s a strong indication that the code is due for refactoring. It&#x27;s  always worth it as long as you implement regression testing in the process.')
