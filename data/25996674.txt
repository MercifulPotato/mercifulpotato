Item(by='Alupis', descendants=None, kids=[25996846], score=None, time=1612231338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25996461, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know who panicked and why, but all JDK versions have always been out of a free public update period after about 5 years<p>People panicked because, unlike before, it didn&#x27;t just say &quot;we&#x27;re no longer updating this, but you can continue to use it&quot;. No, instead it was a shakedown for money if you continued to use it past some specific date listed in the popup. Painting that as normal is disingenuous, and rightfully led to a very public Oracle JDK exodus.<p>&gt; First of all, none of those companies offer an 8 JRE, because OpenJDK was not yet open-source in version 8, and OpenJDK 8 doesn&#x27;t have the JRE<p>Azul seems to disagree. They have a JRE7[1] and JRE8[2] offering.<p>&gt; (it&#x27;s missing Applets and Web Start, for example, the very things people need a JRE for).<p>I doubt people need a JRE for Applets or Web Start anymore. So that&#x27;s not the reason. Old Legacy Java5 Applets aren&#x27;t going to run on Java9+ without other significant changes anyway.<p>If I go to Oracle&#x27;s website, it&#x27;s difficult to find where to download any version of Java JRE or JDK without being bombarded with a plethora of &quot;Subscribe and protect your Java investment!&quot; and many other calls to pay for support and what-not. That&#x27;s their prerogative. Nothing is wrong with Oracle wanting to charge people to use their binaries - and this reinforces my earlier points about Oracle stepping back into &quot;just another JDK vendor&quot; role. You may disagree with that exact phrasing, but I do not believe the distinction of contributing more code matters for the point I am raising.<p>If what you say about Oracle and their flavor of the JDK is true... well then Oracle has a massive optics problem because out here, outside the inner OpenJDK circle, the Java8 thing was quite a fiasco and definitely led to many organizations trying out Oracle&#x27;s JDK &quot;competitors&quot; for the first time.<p>&gt; they&#x27;re not ports<p>Never said they were. They&#x27;re OpenJDK source compiled and offered in a binary for free without any strings attached - far from what Oracle&#x27;s messaging was at the time of all this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azul.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;zulu-community&#x2F;?version=java-7-lts&amp;os=windows&amp;package=jre" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azul.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;zulu-community&#x2F;?version=java-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azul.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;zulu-community&#x2F;?version=java-8-lts&amp;os=windows&amp;package=jre" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azul.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;zulu-community&#x2F;?version=java-...</a>')
