They are pioneering future medicine. In 50 years people are going to look at medicine pre wearables like we look at healthcare in the 1800&#x27;s.<p>I was very happy FitBit sold to Google because I want them to survive, and unfortunately in this current tech regime the only way to do that is join one of the big players.<p>It just makes me sick when people who are partly responsible for the current anti-competitive marketplace make phony statements pointing the blame at companies like Goog, and <i></i>heroes<i></i> like FitBit are caught in the middle.')
