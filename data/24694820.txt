He just added a pinch of sci fi to make things interesting and different, but in a good way.<p>It starts as a bit of duex ex machina yes, but its never inconsistent. Any new progression seems logical from the old, so its easy to follow and doesn’t break the world view you develop for the series.<p>Also one of the best things the book got right for me is the scale of character’s actions. You don’t have mega heroes. The good guys just try to survive in the big universe and do good, but it doesn’t always work out the way they want as the world is big and you have unintended consequences. It felt very real.<p>It does have mega villains though, which were a bit _too_ powerful in my opinion, but not without historical precedent I’m afraid.')
