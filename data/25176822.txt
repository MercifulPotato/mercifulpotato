Never used adobe stuff, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to; but I cannot imagine in what sense Photoshop can be much better than that.<p>Still, there are some improvements that I yearn for GIMP that are not likely to ever be considered.  Everybody seems so intent to make a tool for dealing with photos and synthetic color images, to the detriment of other kinds of images.  For example, in scientific imaging, you would need to deal with floating-point valued pixels, and an arbitrary number of channels (more than 3 or 4).  If you work with images coming from microscopy or satellite images, then every pixel typically has a lot of spectral bands that cannot often be reduced naturally to RGB, but you&#x27;d still want to map them in an arbitrary way and edit them in GIMP.  This is far from being possible today.')
