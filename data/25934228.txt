I for one have some reservations about that. Kind of the whole point of having an OSS code base is getting externals to put in their time and effort.<p>I&#x27;m hardly a major contributor but I have provided some fixes over the years. This license is a bit of a deal breaker for me and I&#x27;m not likely to volunteer more time on this. I charge premium rates for commercial software development. I&#x27;m sure most bigger companies would also not be very eager to put any time and effort into this code base under this license where in the past this would have been less controversial with e.g. legal departments doing due diligence.<p>No amount of &quot;clarifications&quot; is going to fix that. It&#x27;s not a problem of people stubbornly misunderstanding: it&#x27;s people disagreeing with them. They&#x27;ll be dealing with negative press and FUD for years to come around essentially any press release, announcement, or other bit of news in the foreseeable future. IMHO it&#x27;s actually bad for business. And it seems the stock price is trending down the last few days; so maybe it&#x27;s not just me. Not to late to correct this mistake, just saying. I assume share holder value was the driving force here. Not served by any of this apparently.<p>As for forks, I don&#x27;t think Amazon has the right people currently to do anything more than very minor&#x2F;trivial updates. I doubt that they will fix this by putting a large product team together to actually try to innovate. That would involve poaching people from Elastic or other projects. Easy to predict, because so far they haven&#x27;t in the two years of opendistro having been around. I don&#x27;t know about crateDB but I think they are a fair bit smaller than Amazon; so it&#x27;s doubtful they can keep up much. I guess for them, the key thing is actually keeping up with Lucene updates.')
