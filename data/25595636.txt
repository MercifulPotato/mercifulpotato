Most other difficult single-player games, you can get by through attrition, forcing your way through a difficult section via a mountain of lost lives and increasingly precise muscle memory tailored to that exact scenario.<p>With roguelites, you can&#x27;t do that -- or at least, not nearly to the same degree. With the level layout and enemy setup changing every time you play, you have to think things through, and improve yourself at the <i>system</i> level, rather than brute force mastering one corridor at a time.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s not entirely unlike multiplayer games; you can never fully memorize what to do, as the details keep changing.')
