Though I agree that it&#x27;s way better to drive cars that are cheap enough to repair or replace out of pocket.<p>Insurance companies make money by overpricing the actual risk. And they make a LOT of money. The expected value of an insurance contract is negative to the buyer. Coverage of tail risk (e.g. millions in liability), makes sense since you don&#x27;t want to get bankrupted, but when there&#x27;s a capped risk you can tolerate (e.g. value of car), avoiding the insurance statistically saves you money. Insurance companies pay their actuaries very well to guarantee this.<p>Plus, not having to deal with insurance companies makes car repair so much less stressful in my experience...')
