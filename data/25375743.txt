The difference is that I objectively <i>am</i> an impostor. I&#x27;ve worked with plenty of Stanford&#x2F;Berkeley CS grads and can conclusively say that I am a worse programmer than them and will never be as good. My concern is that eventually the number of those people will be so great that mediocre devs will be pushed out of the market. I&#x27;m honestly incapable of passing these Leetcode&#x2F;Google style algorithm interviews which are skewed towards CS grads, and that&#x27;s increasingly becoming the standard for every company regardless of size.')
