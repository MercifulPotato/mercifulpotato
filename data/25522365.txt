Facebook wants users not to know when they&#x27;re being tracked and definitely doesn&#x27;t want them to have to opt-in to tracking. Facebook knows users don&#x27;t want to be tracked.<p>Does adding this new feature make Apple a good and virtuous company? I&#x27;ll leave that for the Tech Vatican when they decide whether Apple gets to go to Tech Heaven.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t really care about that, I just want the feature and find Facebook&#x27;s argument against it to be very weak.')
