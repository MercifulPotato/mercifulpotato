None of the processes are similar.  There are attempts to make something like the flu shot than others could make, but those are not approved in the US (yet).<p>Note, since my reply I&#x27;ve discovered the J&amp;J has in fact released results at 72%. too late to edit my post, but I will stand corrected when called out on that.  At 72% the mRNA at 95% is much better, but J%J can make a lot more vaccine so I&#x27;ll take what I can get.')
