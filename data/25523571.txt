You can specifically say to never play this song or artist again. They used to let you thumb up or down on tracks which I think was a much easier UI.<p>Skipping songs doesn&#x27;t seem to do enough for songs in your playlists so you have to go through the whole right click -&gt; never play again workflow. I really wish I could just downvote individual songs as they play and tailor it that way since sometimes I&#x27;m just tired of a particular song, but maybe I like the song or the artist and don&#x27;t want to click on &#x27;never hear this again&#x27;. It just seems to repeat certain songs way too much based on your listening history.')
