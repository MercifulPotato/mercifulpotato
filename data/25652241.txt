My team did this a couple years ago and it&#x27;s significantly eased up our on-call rotation, at least to the point that we&#x27;re only getting called for major outages while the offshore team handles the minor issues, change&#x2F;release support and things that go bump in the night. There&#x27;s still weeks where we put in significant time if there&#x27;s a major issue, but we&#x27;re not getting woken up for every little alert that goes off.<p>I should also add my team has an automatic comp day at the end of our rotation, though that&#x27;s handled on a team-by-team basis. Plus it&#x27;s not uncommon to get an extra comp day if you have a particularly brutal week or support some major off-hours work.')
