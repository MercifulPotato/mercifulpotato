I wonder: Junior developers nowadays who learn JS and React as their first, go-to stack for web development, they haven&#x27;t ever experienced the raw productivity of &quot;just write php and upload it via ftp&quot; or &quot;just write it in rails&#x2F;django and render stuff server-side&quot;.<p>They come to expect that all development is as slow as theirs, including frontend &lt;--&gt; backend apis (graphql), huge js complexity (webpack), breaking changes (react-router), etc.<p>I see lots of companies nowadays wanting to hire &quot;React devs&quot;. It seems we&#x27;re collectively forgetting how fast you can ship stuff if you just use proven technology. Makes me wonder where we&#x27;re headed.<p>Maybe it&#x27;ll be a competitive advantage to use old (= proven) technology in the future?')
