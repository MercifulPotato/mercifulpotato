Probably Lodal leaving as principal was a catalyzing factor, as she was much more adept at insulating TJHSST from school system politics than her successor was. The philosophy of treating the students as adults was under fire from parents of students at other schools for reasons I don&#x27;t completely understand. (e.g., they forced the school to cancel all off-campus lunch privileges).<p>Another issue I saw was that the school generally trended away from a science &amp; tech magnet to a more generic gifted &amp; talented school. Instead of getting in because you were passionate about, say, programming or robotics, and the school&#x27;s tech labs were a good fit for you; you are now going there because it&#x27;s the best school in the country and you&#x27;re top in the class, even if you don&#x27;t much care for the enrichment activities that are provided.')
