After hydration TVP is almost double protein by weight compared to store-bought mince (at least where I shop), and it also has a good dose of fibre content, and no fat.  Once again, I went 50&#x2F;50 on this and I could eat less and feel fuller, and I argue it tasted better because the dish wasn&#x27;t as oily.')
