So let&#x27;s look at the risk vs reward of that situation:<p>Risk: very high because they rely on user trust to survive and they could get sued into oblivion under the GDPR.<p>Reward: they now have a list of IP addresses with Firefox users behind them. Any big website has that so it&#x27;s not valuable to third parties and it&#x27;s not valuable to Mozilla because they don&#x27;t do any targeted advertising or anything similar.<p>A list of IP addresses is about the least useful thing to log if you want to track people.')
