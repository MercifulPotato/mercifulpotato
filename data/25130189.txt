I&#x27;m saying that the defining trait of man that sets us outside of our natural surroundings is our capability to use intellect, empathy, and morality to guide our decisions.<p>This is not a tool that &quot;Nature&quot; has in its toolbox. Nature has, natural selection. The random smatterings of dice throws that takes place trillions of times per day over the course of billions of years. The equivalent of throwing paint against the wall for a millennia to eventually recreate a Picasso.<p>This is not how humans work. Our efforts are efficient (at least more so than Nature&#x27;s efforts), and when honed and optimized can be made into machines of frighteningly impressive efficiency.<p>There is certainly a difference between the creative and destructive processes of Man vs Nature.')
