All of those things signal &#x27;personal brand&#x27;.<p>These things are becoming &#x27;far too important&#x27; in terms of how we evaluate each other and this development is really lacking in self awareness for a generation of folks who are supposed to be against this kind of stuff.<p>Secondarily, I&#x27;m wary that overall, this is just contributes to the &#x27;life resume BS&#x27; competition of filling up your professional profile with rubbish to make you seem engaged - much like &#x27;GitHub commits&#x27; as some kind of signal of validity.<p>At least with LinkedIn it&#x27;s considered to be &#x27;professional&#x27; i.e. this is your &#x27;work presentation&#x27; - the casual nature of these new CVs tries to blend some personal and aspiration aspects so as to make the individual seem more &#x27;authentic&#x27;. This is a creeping cultural problem and might be the source of a lot of baseline social conflict in the office. It&#x27;s a &#x27;place of work&#x27; - your hobbies are nice, but not relevant.')
