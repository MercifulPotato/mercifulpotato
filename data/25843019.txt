It was upgraded to hybrid AOT&#x2F;JIT mode in 2016. All of it was open-sourced, unlike Graal, where many key optimizations (such as auto-vectorization) remained proprietary.<p>Unlike GraalVM&#x27;s AOT mode, Android VM can run existing Java libraries without any code changes â€” you don&#x27;t have to painstakingly look for static variables and mark them for late loading, and reflection just works.')
