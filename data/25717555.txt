I remember going to a conference in 2001 that was massively popular. The type of stuff you&#x27;d learn there was pretty outrageous and very very black hat (so much so, that people sharing those tips were too self-conscious to reveal their identities, hence the term black hat).<p>My point is - you could very much do very well back in those days regardless of your content quality (which consequently trended down and gave rise to content farms). It&#x27;s only in the last 10 years (and particularly starting in 2014 based on my experience with my own content) that the content quality became a true proxy for ranking, and vice versa.<p>As a side note, these days, you still have SEO conferences, but the stuff you learn there is so diversified that people have started calling it content marketing and other names. The perhaps most useful gathering is SEOktoberfest, it&#x27;s invite only and they admit only 30 attendees. Never been there, but I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s worth the six grand that it costs to get in as a first-time attendee (I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form).')
