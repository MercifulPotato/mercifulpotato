I&#x27;ve seen it done in Erlang (for example).  At the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t matter to much the specific language.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what concrete examples the author has in mind for &quot;low-code&quot; or &quot;MDD&quot; solutions, so this criticism may be irrelevant, however I will say that drag-and-drop GUI tools for building business logic tend to fail for the following reasons:<p>* They have poor version control integration<p>* They have limited facility for creating new abstractions, which results in a lot of duplication<p>* the amount of inherent complexity that can be tackled with these tools is surprisingly low')
