You can also pay to watch on some services. You hear Bradford&#x27;s actual words spoken by a fine actor in the context of the events he was describing. (They really are his words, not modernized, so some viewers might want to turn on closed captioning.) It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best introduction I know to set the stage for reading Bradford&#x27;s story of Plymouth.<p>I also suggest establishing a broader foundation in the early colonies with something like the Teaching Company&#x27;s lectures on America before 1776, available in audio form from Audible.com, which allows one to establish a historical foundation while doing mind-numbing chores like doing the dishes or cleaning the garage.')
