Whenever this topic comes up, somebody boasts about their 2000 album collection or whatever and simple math demonstrates that you&#x27;d get like 100 years of streaming services for that price.<p>&gt; When all you had was physical media, you listened to albums over and over got to know them, relished the new albums you purchased and had to take the time to decide between one or the other.<p>This feels like &quot;yells at cloud&quot; to me. I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;worse product forces appreciation&quot; argument in any circumstance. I am far more able to appreciate a wider range of music now than ever before, in large part because it isn&#x27;t a $15 dollar commitment to listen to an album and decide if I like it.')
