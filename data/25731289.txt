After all, it&#x27;d suck if your laptop battery was going down noticeably even when the laptop was in standby.<p>Of course, loads of vendors of cheap devices ignore this - the makers of a $5 rechargeable bike light or USB fan aren&#x27;t going to put in the components needed to negotiate charging speed. But <i>in principle</i> if you made a USB cable with only the power pins connected, compliant devices should only charge exceptionally slowly, if at all.<p>(Wall chargers, instead of enumerating as a USB host to negotiate power, used to put a certain value of resistor across the data lines, to signal what current the device could draw - this hasn&#x27;t always been standardised, which is why phones and USB chargers can be incompatible)')
