So if one can make heat from intermittent power (say, resistively, or with some kind of heat pump) then storage becomes much less of an issue than if one wanted to store the electrical energy itself.<p>In any environment where renewable power is being curtailed, the cost of using that power to make heat will be very low.  Nuclear heat will be competing against a very low cost alternative.')
