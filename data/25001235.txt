It especially doesn&#x27;t require the film maker doing it herself to these poor actresses. It doesn&#x27;t matter how &quot;subtle&quot; it is, the movie is part of the problem. It&#x27;s like making a movie denouncing puppy murders and then the entire movie is just the director shooting puppies. &quot;But don&#x27;t you get it? How can our movie be bad if it&#x27;s denouncing bad things?&quot; you may say, oblivious to the fact that this director just created a great movie for puppy-murder enthusiasts.')
