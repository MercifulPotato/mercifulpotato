Some BBS software (or doors) would convert uploads from arc, sea, zoo etc to zip on upload. Between the two the move away from arc happened more or less overnight.<p>One if the failings of zopfli (IMO) is that there isn’t a utility to walk a directory and find embedded deflate streams and decompress them and there isn’t any indication that zopfli has touched a file so it is a brute force search to try and recon press a file. I’m also surprised that deflate with 64k windows never caught on even though zip has supported it for years and it’s a really easy extension to the existing format that just uses a reserved bit.')
