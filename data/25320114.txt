Huge props to that site :P I subscribed to a bunch of things like Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal. I would say Seeking Alpha was probably the best value for money. It just gave me ideas for how to think like an investor&#x2F;trader. Most of my research and learning wasn&#x27;t in the mechanics of trading but building up mental models for how things might play out and thinking about risk. I spent a lot of time just watching and observing the markets without tacking action.')
