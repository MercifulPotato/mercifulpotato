I agree with everything until:<p>&gt; <i>their belief that 12 months is &quot;enough time&quot; shows a clear ignorance of how the product is used in enterprise or they fully understand and are banking on the desperation of enterprise to sell RHEL licenses.</i><p>There&#x27;s another explanation, and I think it makes a little more sense than yours which would require Red Hat, literally the company whose core job it is (which they are damn good at, enough so that you use it) to provide an enterprise distribution to some of the most conservative companies on the planet, to not understand how the product is used in enterprise.<p>The suggestion that RH is &quot;banking on the desperation of enterprise to sell RHEL licenses&quot; at least makes sense given the facts, and that&#x27;s kind of what I thought too when I first saw the news (the way they worded it sure made it seem like this was a money grab).<p>It is possible however (and indeed this is my belief) that Red Hat doesn&#x27;t consider Stream to be <i>that</i> big of a change, and they&#x27;ve given a full year to migrate.  Indeed if you read my blog post[1] I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that big of a deal.<p>I have zero inside info on this but I would bet highly that sales of RHEL were a factor in this decision for sure.  I don&#x27;t see how they couldn&#x27;t be.  But given <i>how long</i> Red Hat has been providing all their sources publicly (which they DON&#x27;T have to do) and acquiring and open sourcing companies, you don&#x27;t give them even a tiny benefit of the doubt here that maybe their not just one-sided evil capitalists trying to squeeze nickels out of the CentOS community for short term gains?<p>[1]:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;centos-is-not-dead-please-stop-saying-it-is-at-least-until-you-read-this-4b26b5c44877?sk=e500c2f16403d634ff8a4ea17d705252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;centos-is-not-dead-please-stop...</a>')
