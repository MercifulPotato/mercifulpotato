Sometimes, you roll the dice and you win.  So you want to roll more.  Similarly, sometimes you load up YouTube, and it recommends you a good video.  So you come back, looking for more.<p>The same hook applies to nearly all websites these days, it&#x27;s not just &quot;social media&quot;.<p>So how does this mess with your motivation?
