There&#x27;s plenty of waves of immigrants before tech - the Gold Rush, Okies in the 1930s, WW2 GIs, the defense boom around Lockheed (which brought my father-in-law to the area; my wife is a Bay Area native), desktop software, and then finally the Internet.  Just as Detroit had waves of migration from the 1700s - fur trading, Great Lakes trade, iron manufacturing, and then finally automobiles.<p>I&#x27;m specifically picking Detroit from ~1895-1970 vs. Silicon Valley from ~1995-future because there&#x27;s a similar dynamic at root.  A single globally-relevant industry that&#x27;s remaking society, and everybody pouring in to capitalize on this.  Given similar root causes, it seems likely that their futures will be similar as well.')
