What they did was take desktop GPU power consumption running the model in fp32, extrapolate to a 240x GPU (P100) setup that would run for a year straight at 100% power consumption.<p>Yes if you do run 240x p100s at literally 100% 24&#x2F;7 for a year you get the power consumption of 5 cars. This run never happened though, this all ran on TPUs at lower precision, lower power consumption and much lower time to converge.<p>If anything this tells you that electronics are ridiculously green even when operating at 100%. I&#x27;ve never profiled world-wide carbon production but something tells me if you wanted to carbon optimise you&#x27;d be better served trying to take cars off the road and planes out of the sky.')
