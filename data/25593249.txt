They can manufacture phones every bit as good as Apple&#x27;s without help.<p>China used to need Apple more than Apple needs China. Now, Apple needs China more than Apple. Apple can&#x27;t move its supply chain home without eye watering costs.<p>It won&#x27;t be long before Apple phones start to lag Chinese phones technologically and it won&#x27;t be long before China can start threatening sanctions that hurt the US more than they&#x27;d hurt China.')
