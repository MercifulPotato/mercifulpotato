The subconscious does not. I wrote about this in reaction to one of the videos earlier: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22256369" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22256369</a><p>I would assert that even with the errors, people get a more realistic view of the past through these reconstructions than by watching the original footage. The reconstructions drop the barrier of otherness, which greatly diminishes the value of the old footage as a historical lesson for the masses. The reconstructions make it seem like a real place that had real people in it.<p>Moreover... what terrible, horrible thing are we worried about with these reconstructions anyhow? People will have slightly wrong ideas about what color roofs were in the past? People might have wrong ideas about exactly how slidey people&#x27;s gaits were in the past? It&#x27;s not like you feed in footage about a train ride or people riding horses down the street and the AI is adding in cell phones, translating people&#x27;s speech to modern slang, and changing political posters to features modern politicians. We&#x27;re fighting videos that increase people&#x27;s connections to the past because we&#x27;re afraid they... what, exactly?<p>By all means keep the original and label the reconstructions, but I see no reason to start complaining about them or running around telling people &quot;STOP! Watching these videos might give you WRONG IDEAS about COLORS! What if that BLUE WINDOW was in actuality MAUVE?&quot; This seems more like Victorians having conspicuous cases of the vapors than a real concern.')
