Trump is out of office and wounded, but not destroyed and so able to try to play kingmaker from the sidelines.  A large, centrist portion of the GOP would probably have liked to see the end of Trump, but now they are going to have to wait for his conviction and imprisonment to finally be rid of him.  Some will try to claim the mantle of racist-in-chief but Trump is a jealous god and will now allow another to steal focus from him, so I expect some rather petty knife-fights for a year or two while Trump goes through a few state trials but eventually some minimum security prison will finally take the phone out of his tiny hands (or at least force him to hoop it if he wants to tweet...)')
