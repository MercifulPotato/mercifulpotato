It was a decent linux setup, it had wifi, a browser, standard tools... even a C compiler; much snappier than the XP setup it came with.<p>I couldn&#x27;t tell you how complete&#x2F;solid it was, I was in middle school back then and I doubt I ever did any &quot;work&quot; beyond toy programs on vim, but it was my first contact with linux and a major factor that pushed me towards getting into CS.<p>Glad to see the project is still going strong after all these years.')
