Until the fishing right are denounced by France and the deal vetoed?<p>Honestly, i think they will be a war between Brittany and britain&#x27;s fishermen if the deal is not done correctly. I&#x27;ve heard fishermen cooperative planned their motor issues front of port entries for the next two month, issues that will prevent them to move out the way and prevent England to sell fresh fish (at least around St-Malo, and Malouins are the less obtuse bretons imho, i will probably be worse west of there).<p>I fear this small issue of fishing will be a pain for the next decade')
