That was my dream job since I was 10, prestigious or not, and I loved the first five years there.<p>But the prestige trap is real. My last career move was a big step down in prestige, but a huge step up in job satisfaction. I wish I didn’t, but I do miss working at a company that everyone knows.<p>For me I think the key has been that my friends have a random assortment of cool jobs and don’t care much about working somewhere prestigious. I just don’t click with people who do. Because as much fun as it would be to play the comparison game, I just couldn’t shake that existential angst that none of that stuff fucking matters, and the only thing that matters is to be happy and do good to those around you.')
