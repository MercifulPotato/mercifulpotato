The US couldn&#x27;t even &quot;decapitate&quot; Taliban after 19 years and 1 <i>trillion</i> dollars. Nor could the Soviet Union. Nor could the British before that. You can&#x27;t win a land war in 21st century without turning the place into a glazed desert, which is not going to happen due to the proximity of South Korea and due to the fact that the American people aren&#x27;t totally nuts.
