Some players get paid $100m+ for their talent.<p>Athletes&#x27; unions exist to protect the players at the bottom, who are just talented enough to play at the professional level but aren&#x27;t superstars, like the offensive line in football or the bench players in basketball.<p>Notably: many of the athletes&#x27; unions predate the era of the monopolistic sports leagues. (The modern NFL, MLB, and NBA are all the products of the mergers of smaller leagues, and their players&#x27; unions formed before they achieved monopoly status.)')
