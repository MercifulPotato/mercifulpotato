If the error is nil, then the actual result is sensible; otherwise the actual result is meaningless. This means you can forget to check the error and use a bogus result and, because there are no compiler warnings (another wtf), you will know nothing of this until things fail at runtime.<p>? You can&#x27;t forget to check the error because not checking err is a compiler error unless you forcibly mute it by using _')
