I had never heard of the company either but found they are sellers of B2B contact info.<p>There is no option to request my info be deleted, or even to correct the info so people aren&#x27;t harassing the wrong person (some of the information wasn&#x27;t right, they are selling my parents and families addresses instead of mine). They ALSO have a free app that allows up to 5 contact a day, so they might even be giving this info out for free and I&#x27;m assuming someone is harvesting as much free data as they can.<p>It&#x27;s absurd that there is an entire industry based on selling private info that they themselves acquired from other companies. It&#x27;s disgusting that people have built an industry on buying and selling private information<p>I ended up moving as much data as It&#x27;s disgusting that people have built an industry on buying and selling private informationI could to a private server, but this really isn&#x27;t the solution.
