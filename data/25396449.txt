It is my primary browser for recreational web use.  As an internet user beginning the late 80&#x27;s, I always tried every linemode or text-only browser I heard about.  I think I have possibly used them all.  I used lynx through a public access UNIX system for some years.  It baffles me when people recommend lynx today.  It makes me think they do not actually use a text-only browser much (e.g., once in a while), and that they have not tried them all.  To answer your question, the two biggest reasons I would always choose links over lynx is 1. the way links renders tables \n(this is what initially hoookd me on links) and 2. the source code.  I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of text-only browsers.  Of course, this is not a topic anyone really cares about.  I think links would be the fastest.  Funny how he calls anyone who would use a text-only browser exclusively a &quot;masochist&quot;.  That is how I think of users who use the popular graphical browsers, waiting arbitray amounts of time on every website for pages to &quot;load&quot;, making dozens of unnecessary connections to third party servers.')
