Last time I wrote my own engine pretty much from scratch on top of Pixi.js and while I learned a <i>huge</i> amount, there were a lot of “lessons learned” that I gained manually (or didn’t gain) that Unity has baked in from the start.<p>One thing that’s interesting to me about Unity is AFAIK it bakes the Entity Component System pattern into its core. Any good guides or resources on this?<p>I found Robert Nystrom’s excellent book a good resource for this (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gameprogrammingpatterns.com&#x2F;component.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gameprogrammingpatterns.com&#x2F;component.html</a>) and even wrote my own post on the concept to help crystallize my understanding (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ripplega.me&#x2F;development&#x2F;ecs-ez&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ripplega.me&#x2F;development&#x2F;ecs-ez&#x2F;</a>).
