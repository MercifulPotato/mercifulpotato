How many would, if given the choice, prefer to have the CPUC pre-pay for them a couple of years of cellular hotspot service, and simply refund the remainder of &quot;their&quot; $12,931 in cash, so they can all be assured of making their rent or mortgage payments for a while?  About 588 households, I would guess.<p>My theory: It&#x27;s a subsidy program for the broadband landline industry.  Regulatory capture, as usual.')
