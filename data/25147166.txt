By the nature of my work I often have to suffer the “corporate fog”, a sort of induced stupor caused by multiple layers of middle management, generic performance objectives, knowledge loss due to churn and ineffective information management.<p>This drama sounds like a typical corporate misunderstanding: engineers follow technical specs, no written requirements, management doesn’t understand the subtleties - nor do their care for them and they’re busily enough already with all the other tugs.<p>Eventually shit hits home, PR digests and translates into requirements, management gropes along in the fog.<p>There’s no malice, it’s just a large org, and there’s no SJ that agonizes over the details (and even then, he also let big fuckups slip past, remember the iPhone antenna issue)')
