White privilege simple describes one way in which racism manifests itself. If you can&#x27;t tell the difference between a KKK member and someone says that people with white names getting called back for job interviews more than people with black names is white privilege then you are willfully ignorant. It is not racist to say that someone benefits from white privilege.<p>Also the person you are replying to didn&#x27;t say they destroy peoples lives based on racial hatred. They haven&#x27;t destroyed anyone&#x27;s lives because they&#x27;re white.')
