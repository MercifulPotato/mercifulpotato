Most of the job boils down to getting senior management comfortable with risk so they don&#x27;t walk over one day and give you the infamous &quot;tap on the shoulder.&quot; Management&#x27;s job is to get their bosses (investors in the fund.. often pensions, endowments, UHNW family offices, etc..) comfortable with the risk.<p>Until one day... when end investors pull their money from the fund, and management walks over to the traders with one word: &quot;sell.&quot; Often times both management and the traders know this is the wrong trade, but they have no choice.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand if sell-offs are caused by fundamentals or liquidity... the first part of march was the former, the second part of march was the latter.<p>Complete control of your capital means you don&#x27;t need to be any smarter than the pros, you just need to know when the sell-off is liquidity related and not fundamentals related.<p>Good luck out there :)')
