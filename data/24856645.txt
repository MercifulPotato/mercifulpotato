Bremsstrahlung x-rays are still a problem in terms of heat dissipation but shouldn&#x27;t cut into efficiency too much.<p>EDIT:  Well, I should say that the propellant mass&#x2F;delta-v is really high and that most of the fusion energy will can end up as kinetic energy of the propellant and ship.  But the vast majority of that kinetic energy will be the propellant rather than the ship.  To maximize ship kinetic energy over fuel energy you want the propellant to exit the ship at the same velocity the ship is traveling which is very far from what you see in an Epstein drive.  But fusion provides tons of energy so that isn&#x27;t going to be a figure of merit we care about.')
