The US does plenty of dirty deeds and should be called out for it by the rest of the world.<p>If you havent figured out why &quot;the world&quot; doesnt call out the US, then I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. Perhaps you really do think&#x2F;believe all that defense spending is just to fight brown people who just a year perviously were herding goats or studying. Maybe you think those gunships and M16s are water cannons and squirt guns respectively.<p>I don&#x27;t really know.<p>&gt; so I happen to recognize all those coups and dirty deeds you mention - and they are terrible,<p>Do you though?<p>And who must punish the US and what must the punishment be? Last I checked the US isn&#x27;t accountable to the ICC or the UN. If you can recommend punishment for a sovereign state on the otherside of planet and claim to understand your shortcomings, what punishment do you deserve and how must it be carried out?')
