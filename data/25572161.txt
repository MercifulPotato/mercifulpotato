As mentioned in the article, Homer worked a variety of different jobs throughout the season.<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;s not realistic for a high-school graduate with no additional training to be a nuclear operator. I believe it was part of the &quot;ridiculous&quot; that went towards making the show entertaining, and a job that most people would not have in sight into.<p>My point is that a lack of a specific type of job is not the root cause of the situation the author is describing.')
