Not all, of course, but enough that I think it&#x27;s a big problem.<p>I&#x27;ve literally had auditors ask me whether I&#x27;m actually interested in security or whether I just need the sign-off (&quot;collect dust in a corner&quot;).<p>Not that this is unique to security. Similar things definitely happen with accounting or any industry where you pay the people who audit you (and probably even ones where you don&#x27;t but the auditors still have an interest in not pissing you off, eg a government entity where officials may want to work for your company some day).')
