Item(by='stale2002', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607769107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397117, text='&gt; To reiterate, I was specifically talking about circumstances where people broadcast to mass audiences<p>Ok, and I think that it is important that highly targeted minorities are free to broadcast to mass audiences, without having to worry about being targeted or harrassed.  Anyone who is fighting for civil rights, could become the target of mass hate and harassment, for both themselves and their friends and family, if the hate mob decides to target them.<p>If these groups did not have these protections, then it would only be the privileged, who would be able to express themselves to a wide audience.  Other people, who are more frequently targeted, would no long have a voice.<p>&gt; they should have every right to do so in private.<p>They should have the right to do that in public, as well, to a mass audience, while also being able to take actions to protect themselves from harassment, by being anonymous.<p>&gt; but I haven&#x27;t seen a hate mob running down my street for a while.<p>Women and minorities face a lot of harassment.  It is not about a &quot;physical&quot; mob.  There are more ways that mobs can target and harass people, than just some mob on the street engaging in physical violence.<p>I am not sure what to tell you, if you are not aware of all the threats and harassment that these people can get, from randos.<p>&gt;  So you seem to have a lot of trust in warrants being issued justly<p>Being forced to issue a warrant is another protection.  That is much better, than if some random government official, just has access to that information, and can retaliate against you, without anyone being able to find out about it.<p>&gt; also a great fear that the government will turn against you.<p>It is not just about some totalitarian regime.  Instead it is about the in between stuff.  Things like a no name burocrat, having your information, and using their power to target you, without there being a easy way for them to get caught.<p>Warrets and paper trails make it more difficult for government officials to abuse the information that they would otherwise have access to, if it was all available without a warrent.<p>&gt; Is there nothing you&#x27;d change about it?<p>Yes, I would provide more ways for people to be even more anonymous, and provide stronger methods for people to protect themselves from retaliation, whether that be by random government employees, or random people on the internet.')
