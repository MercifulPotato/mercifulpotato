Excel macros are a type of programming language, and there are many businesses that rely on complex Excel spreadsheets as part of their operations.<p>The fact that these are called macros and not a programming language might be a reason why they are so heavily adopted: to avoid scaring people away from using Excel.  This reminds me of an observation from Richard Stallman&#x27;s speech about Emacs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;gnu&#x2F;rms-lisp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;gnu&#x2F;rms-lisp.html</a>), where secretaries used Emacs Lisp to extend the editor.<p>In a personal computing world that has a sharp distinction between &quot;user&quot; and &quot;programmer,&quot; Excel is one of those exceptions where the distinction between &quot;user&quot; and &quot;programmer&quot; is blurred, since you need to use macros to take advantage of Excel&#x27;s power.  Excel macros are the gateway to learning Visual Basic for Applications, a full-fledged embedded programming language.  Then once you know VBA, then the road to learning other programming languages such as JavaScript and Python becomes easier.')
