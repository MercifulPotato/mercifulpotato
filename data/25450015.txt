Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=[25450792], score=None, time=1608160059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449723, text='&gt; a) My bike on a trainer is really loud.<p>Not that it&#x27;s going to make (b) any better, but do you have purpose-made tyres on it? I&#x27;ve never tried with my road one, I heard it was loud and wore down extremely fast if you did so, so I just bought a smooth (and I think harder?) one designed for use on a trainer off the bat.<p>Could just be marketing and I fell for it, but seemed reasonable.<p>Re (b), and especially if you changed tyre, I suppose if you wanted to do that regularly you&#x27;d soon get a second quick-release rear wheel, so you didn&#x27;t have to faff about switching skewers (and tyres!) - or better a &#x27;direct drive&#x27; trainer (instead of running the bicycle wheel against another wheel, it comes off and you put the chain directly around a sprocket attached to the trainer).')
