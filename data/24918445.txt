Spotify has almost everything, and it&#x27;s just a few major artists that hold out for a &#x27;Tidal exclusive&#x27; or whatever. But generally I think that however much upfront revenue the service provides is probably to the detriment to the bigger picture of &#x27;let people listen&#x27;. But for Â£10 a month, the reality is it&#x27;s pretty phenomenal, especially for someone that (previously) bought a lot of records. I hope this doesn&#x27;t fracture, or we&#x27;ll be back to MP3s and Napster.<p>But yeah, TV and movie streaming is a shambles. Exclusive licensing is terrible - they should move to the same model as the music, licence to everyone and let us all pick the service we prefer. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to happen.<p>Business idea: Distrokid but for SVOD...')
