As in, each service has its own database.<p>Yes.<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t that lead to non-normalisation of the data<p>Yes. But it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds. That is how data on paper used to work, after all.<p>Business rules (at least ones that have been around for more than 5--10 years) are written with intensely non-normalised data in mind.<p>Business people tend to be fine with eventual consistency on the scale of hours or even days.<p>Non-normalised data also makes total data corruption harder, and forensics in the case of bugs easier, in some ways: you find an unexpected value somewhere? Check the other versions that ought to exist and you can probably retrace at what point it got weird.<p>The whole idea of consistent and fully normalised data is a, historically speaking, very recent innovation, and I&#x27;m not convinced it will last long in the real world. I think this is a brief moment in history when our software is primitive enough, yet optimistic enough, to even consider that type of data storage.<p>And come on, it&#x27;s not like the complete consistency of the data is worth <i>that</i> many dollars in most cases, if we actually bother to compute the cost.')
