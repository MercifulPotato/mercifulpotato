At 150-200k&#x2F;year, a lot of people are just going to try and save like crazy. CAPE is high, financial planners are saying that &quot;safe withdrawal rates&quot; are no longer 4% or even 3.25%, but below even 2.5% - even if you&#x27;re not in the very HCOL areas, you&#x27;re looking at needing to save more than three million dollars to retire, which can take a very long time when expecting muted market returns in the future.')
