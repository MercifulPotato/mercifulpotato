The strategy of treating devs as interchangeable cogs is still absolutely thriving in management circles. The only differences now are that it&#x27;s often glammed up with a bunch of lip service that seems to suggest the opposite approach (but no actions to follow that up), and that there&#x27;s very successful pockets not using that approach, that aren&#x27;t representative of the majority of the industry.<p>I don&#x27;t think either approach is necessarily &#x27;wrong&#x27; either, because I&#x27;ve seen tons of companies have great success with staggering numbers of thoroughly mediocre devs and lots of turnover. But you very likely have to commit to one strategy or the other, the absolute shittest places I&#x27;ve worked are the ones where they&#x27;re kidding themselves, unsure what they&#x27;re trying to do, or half way through a transition from one approach to the other.<p>As dumb and unintuitive as it sounds, I think you can run a big bank very successfully with 200 engineers siloed into small teams of experts, or with 3000 engineers shoveled into big &quot;tribes&quot; (or whatever the buzzword of the day is) of distributed responsibility. But I&#x27;m wary of anyone that&#x27;s trying to do it with 800 engineers, especially the &quot;we only hire the best!&quot; variety. (those three numbers obviously scale with the size of the business and a bunch of external factors).')
