Lots of things were legal and constitutional back then that would be a constitutional crisis now.<p>It’s a modern issue because of what’s changed. Now small police forces in on the cut shake people down in rural America like highway robber barons.<p>The institution of asset forfeiture is funky and stale IMO but, that notwithstanding, the modern constitutional crisis is that this literal highway robbery likely violates the due process clause of the 14th amendment.')
