Photos, Yale locks, Fi, WiFi and Nest thermostat can all be poof gone because I made a silly YouTube comment? How is this not regulated?<p>Google photos also &#x27;helpfully&#x27; offers to delete your uploaded photos with &#x27;some guarantee&#x27;!!!<p>If this isn&#x27;t an indication of a giant shitty monopoly that doesn&#x27;t care about its customers at all, I don&#x27;t what is.<p>They have some AI ML fucking crap but can&#x27;t figure basic user trust because that won&#x27;t get anyone promoted nor grow some Director-level person&#x27;s headcount.<p>Large promo-manufacturing teams that casually handle all your data. Pray to God that some L4 didn&#x27;t get promoted doing some impactful work because they sure ain&#x27;t gonna do maintenance work protecting your shit. Their motivations are not users, product nor team: manipulate some metrics to get promoted and move out. Horrible.')
