What OS ships binaries for gcc&#x2F;clang but not python? I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any Linux distros that don&#x27;t have it.<p>&gt;Well that just means CMake has nothing at all going for it, if they are as portable.<p>Sorry, just to be clear, Visual Studio does not have built in support for autotools.
