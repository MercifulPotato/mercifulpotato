From public service announcements that smoking is bad for you to Tom Selleck endorsing reverse mortgages, it seems advertisers pay to &quot;show me ads&quot; believing it will alter someone&#x27;s behavior at least a little. Given the scale of Facebook&#x27;s data and the scale of Facebook&#x27;s audience, advertisers can use Facebook to make small surgical modifications to a vast slice of humanity. To me, this is somewhat compelling argument that Facebooks&#x27; &quot;show me ads&quot; business model really is pay to &quot;influence your behavior&quot;.')
