Will the voice actors hang around forever to modify plot lines? The game doesn&#x27;t react much to your actions. Assuming unfinished systems even make sense in broader context and will interact nicely when fleshed out. If you make civilians properly panic and run away, or call police, won&#x27;t that break some quests? How many cases do you have to handle in a quest if NPCs start wandering around?')
