If the only delivery option is appshare, and if appshare does vertical pizza more than once, I&#x27;m going to stop using that restaurant for delivery.<p>Not because I don&#x27;t like the restaurant or because I want send them a message or something silly like that.  Simply because I will have learned that I can&#x27;t get the food I want from that channel. And if I haven&#x27;t eaten from that restaurant recently, they&#x27;re not top of mind.  Which means I&#x27;m less likely to dine in or do takeout.<p>I may try a different appshare in this scenario. However, drivers usually work for multiple companies, so you&#x27;re not necessarily getting a different driver by using Uber Eats instead of Door Dash.')
