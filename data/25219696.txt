The article discusses a lawsuit on behalf of Primer League and mostly lower league soccer players in England around their &quot;personal data.&quot;<p>&gt; More than 400 current and former players have signed up to pursue gaming, betting and data-processing companies who utilise their personal statistics without consent or compensation.<p>As others have said, at least in the states, facts are not copyrightable. TA also states the lawsuit isn&#x27;t going about this as part of image rights for the players, but doesn&#x27;t say exactly what the argument will be. It makes it seem this is driven by lower league players who obviously don&#x27;t have as lucrative careers.<p>Again IANAL but I don&#x27;t see how if I go to a game and compile statistics myself how that&#x27;s a breach of the players&#x27; data. Maybe if the club had a contact when I bought the ticket, but then I would think the players would need an agreement with the clubs to make that clear, because I&#x27;m not buying the ticket from the player I&#x27;m buying it from the club. Same with TV rights, that&#x27;s league, club, and TV station rights, not player rights.')
