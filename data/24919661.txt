IMO C++ is best approached like C but with convenient data structures in the standard library - and tons of patterns that _may_ be taken into use if they simplify the code.<p>That said, unless you are working in a specific setting where C++ is obviously the best tool, you probably should not use C++. Even at best of times C++ is complex and unproductive. But it offers an unbeatable combination of ecosystem maturity, robustness, close to the metal performance and high level concepts to fit few slots better than anything else.')
