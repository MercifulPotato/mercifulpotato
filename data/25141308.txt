Internships meeting this standard may be unpaid. Student teachers are an ordinary example that happens at scale.<p>The legal strategy here seems to include calling the students “fellows.” Presumably, Lambda School does not meet the educational criteria necessary to provide interns. There’s probably enough fog around “fellow” that retained council applying ask-forgiveness-not-permission would write a memo to cover the forgiveness asking phase not improbable in the future given the similarities between the way this quacks and the unpaid internships Lambda School presumably does not qualify to offer.')
