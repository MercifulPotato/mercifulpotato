Even a comparably &quot;easy&quot; thing with a couple of two-NIC machines (one external, internet-routable, one DMZ) cost me a fucking week.<p>What&#x27;s even worse is when one has to obey corporate restrictions - for example, only having external interfaces on &quot;loadbalancer&quot; nodes:<p>- First of all, MetalLB only has <i>one</i> active Speaker node which means your bandwidth is limited to that node&#x27;s uplink and you&#x27;re wasting the resources of the other loadbalancers.<p>- Second, you <i>can</i> taint your nodes to only schedule the MetalLB speaker on your &quot;loadbalancer&quot; nodes via tolerations... but how the f..k do you convince MetalLB to change the speaker node once you apply that change?!<p>- Third, what do you do when you want to expose N services but only have one or two external IPs? DC&#x2F;OS was way more flexible, you had one set of loadbalancers (haproxy) that did all the routing, and could run an entire cluster on four machines - two LBs, one master, one worker. There is <i>no way</i> to replicate this with Kubernetes. None.')
