That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t hard for everyone else. A few reasons WFH may be difficult for some people:<p>* You have kids at home<p>* You live in a tiny apartment and don&#x27;t have room to set up a proper home office<p>* Your work is very collaborative and Zoom meetings are just not the same<p>* You live by yourself and the loneliness is brutal<p>* You find it hard to stay motivated without the daily camaraderie you had in the office<p>* You&#x27;re <i>in a pandemic</i> that adds a ton of stress to your life<p>And that&#x27;s just off the top of my head. It&#x27;s great that you can successfully work from home, but please realize that your life experiences are not the same as everyone else&#x27;s, and what is a positive experience for you may be dreadful for others. And also remember that <i>we&#x27;re in a pandemic</i> and the current WFH conditions are far from optimal for most people who were forced into it.')
