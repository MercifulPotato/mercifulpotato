It requires scanning of every file at both the source and destination to compute the delta to send.  zfs snapshots and send&#x2F;recv don&#x27;t need to do that.  The delta is already fully described by the snapshots themselves.  zfs is also working with immutable snapshots.  It guarantees the source and destination copies are identical; rsync can&#x27;t do much about the source and destination being modified while it is running since it&#x27;s reliant upon other users of the system not touching the data being synced.<p>That&#x27;s not to say rsync doesn&#x27;t work.  It does.  But it doesn&#x27;t scale well, and the data integrity guarantees aren&#x27;t there.')
