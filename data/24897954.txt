Item(by='acoard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603729876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891066, text='&gt; These seem to be intentional design decisions (marketed as being necessary for security, but really being power-user hostile)<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s an unnecessarily abrasive view: the Wayland protocol designers do not hate power users.<p>For the sake of civility and discourse I just want to point out the quote you&#x27;re responding to does not talk about hating power users.  The OP clearly just says that the &quot;decision [is] power-user hostile.&quot;  That&#x27;s an important difference, as one is talking about substance (i.e. the decisions) and the other is veering into personal attacks.  It&#x27;s easy to conflate the two and I&#x27;ve certainly done it, but I just wanted to point it out to try and de-escalate the conversation a  bit.<p>I also think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that many security decisions in  many contexts are &quot;user hostile.&quot;  Hostile design is an actual thing, where security and  order are prioritized above convenience and functionality, and not simply an attack on &quot;bad design&quot;[0].   This is not to say all user hostile decisions are bad, but it&#x27;s a trade-off.  Asking for your password before every single interaction is user hostile (the user will never get in the flow[1]), but could be the right decision in certain contexts.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hostile_architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hostile_architecture</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flow_(psychology)</a>')
