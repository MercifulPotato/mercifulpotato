There are many characters that were either merged in the process of standardizing traditional Chinese characters or have multiple meanings which are split by standard simplified Chinese.<p>Here&#x27;s a very small sample of a bunch of Traditional -&gt; Simplified examples.<p>乾 -&gt; 乾 (qian2)、干 (gan1) (干 is itself a merger of multiple traditional characters)<p>夥 -&gt; 夥 (huo3)、伙 (huo3)<p>兒 -&gt; 儿 (er2)、兒 (ni2)<p>祇 -&gt; 祇 (qi2)、只 (zhi3) (只 is also itself a merger of multiple traditional characters)<p>&gt; Try for example 發. I bet it&#x27;s not going to be so straightforward.<p>I&#x27;d be pretty shocked if any literate Chinese speaker in the PRC did not recognize that character.<p>I think in general you&#x27;re overestimating the difficulty of learning traditional characters when educated in a system using solely simplified characters.<p>PRC undergraduate courses will sometimes just flat-out assume knowledge of traditional characters. Indeed I have a textbook from a history of Chinese medicine class that&#x27;s entirely in traditional characters. The professor (not unreasonably) just assumed we all already knew traditional characters or would pick it up in a week or two. All subsequent course material (e.g. test materials) was also in traditional characters, although we were allowed to write in simplified characters (and I think everyone in the class did so).<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some corner cases you could use to stump people, but PRC kids consume quite a lot of traditional Chinese material even if they&#x27;re not formally taught it in school. It&#x27;s more mentally taxing than just reading simplified characters, but it&#x27;s still fairly straightforward.<p>In general it&#x27;s pretty easy to pick up either character set if you&#x27;re a fluent reader in the other, at least for reading. Learning how to handwrite both sets is trickier and probably requires dedicated training, but even then only on the order of weeks or at most months.<p>&gt; (to be fair, many probably due to the automated conversion, and some might be an intentional pun)<p>I&#x27;m fairly certain the <i>overwhelming</i> majority are due to automated conversions.')
