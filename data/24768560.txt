What an exciting day.&quot; It feels so weird and artificial. It actually makes them sound less enthusiastic and genuine to me.<p>They also present a lot of features (especially photos), but without comparison I am left wondering, how much better is the new stuff. And why should I buy it...<p>Sounds great with that new glass too; I wondered if they would show how much better it is -- Maybe do something funny, risky, and slightly stupid like the Cybertruck incident. Nope: Just 4x better than before -- Whatever those 4x means. Get some hammers out -- Do something...<p>The A14 is also faster than before. No real-life demo comparison. Wouldn&#x27;t it have been easy to compare the games on the GPUs (stuttering frame rate on one side)? Just something. If you can&#x27;t show us why it is better, it is not good enough.<p>Oh, and why no actual live demos with the phone instead of just 100 great photos and videos of the phone and by the phone?<p>The old keynotes had a slide with the comparison of the mini, normal, pro models and the end. Those actually served as an informative summary at the end. Instead Tim Cook just told us what we had seen, and that &quot;it was the day everybody had waited for&quot;, and then I am left struggling to remember why the pro is more expensive and how much more it was...<p>They may be the best at this, and it does feel (overly) polished, but I feel the old much simpler Jobs keynotes were far ahead in enthusiasm and far more entertaining. Sorry.')
