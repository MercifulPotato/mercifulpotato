This can&#x27;t work, you can&#x27;t ask everybody to stream and receives each video streams. Also, you can&#x27;t ask each client to mix the streams together for the client.<p>You can see the video conferences in Jami more like a mesh between all participants of the call. Some nodes will mix the streams together (for now it&#x27;s the device which receives the calls to merge together, they will need both good CPU &amp; bandwith for sure) and the other nodes will only receives the mixed stream (and sends their stream)<p>So, for the host you can count 1Mbps&#x2F;participant (to get a good h264 video stream) and the receiver the CPU &amp; bandwith will be the same for a conference with 15 participants or 2.<p>We got a lot of conference with 15 people hosted by a x220 (and a lot with a P51, but it&#x27;s a bit more powerful).')
