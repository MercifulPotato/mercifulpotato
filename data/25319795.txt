On the large scale, this will just be a matter of everyday bureaucracy and any competence will revert to the mean.<p>On the large scale, it will be subject to the exact same corruption seen elsewhere.  Certain industries will carve out exceptions to the tax, certain people with influence will get their historical properties excluded, etc.<p>By and large I&#x27;ve heard of LVT being a replacement for Sales&#x2F;VAT style taxes.  Whilst those are often regressive, at least they are relatively simple, 20% VAT is 20% VAT.')
