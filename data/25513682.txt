This &quot;Turbo Drive&quot; part appears to me as essentially unchanged behaviour in Turbo 7.0.0beta1 since from Turbolinks versions 5.x. This component has many years of pedigree and discussion and is very well understood by a large developer community.  The core of this was ported to TS 2 years ago with no change in behaviour.
