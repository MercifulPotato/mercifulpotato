Item(by='sudosteph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605230836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077418, text='I have a copy of &quot;the federalist papers in modern english - indexed for modern political issues&quot; that I used as a companion reference when I first bought the Federalist Papers. It was good for looking up which essays were relevant to my interests, but personally I felt that my comprehension suffered from being a step removed from the primary source when I used the &quot;Modern Language&quot; version. I think there&#x27;s a lot to be said for having access to the subtlety and tone from the author, even if it takes some time to adjust to the language.<p>The upside is that if you get used to reading texts from this era, other writers of the time period become more accessible as well. For example, I recently read many of the sermons of Jon Wesley and found them to be an easier read than I was expecting, perhaps due to my exposure to the federalist papers and others.')
