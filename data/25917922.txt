That&#x27;s why I use my Rubik&#x27;s Cube example. A single glass of water contains enough molecules that if they were each a random Rubik&#x27;s cube then there&#x27;s a mathematical certainty that 512 of them will be perfectly solved (per glass).<p>For molecules that are a linear chain of only 2 possible items in the chain, it becomes a &#x27;brute force search&#x27; of a &#x27;puzzle space&#x27; to find a chain that &#x27;does something like computer code&#x27;, and the earth has the computing power to solve that brute force problem in 30 seconds, not 30 million years.')
