Item(by='ganafagol', descendants=None, kids=[25015329], score=None, time=1604756372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014120, text='You are confusing science with some aspects of academic culture. &quot;Science&quot; is not more after money than &quot;music&quot; or &quot;sunshine&quot; are. Science is the process of applying the scientific method to gain understanding. That would work in a money-less society just as much as they could enjoy music or sunshine.<p>There is rightful critisism at how academia works, especially the areas where results are so directly applicable that real money is made depending on the outcome. There is a lot of money in pharmaceuticals, in fossil fuels and even economic theories. But the majority of scientific endeavor is being done in quiet corners of academic buildings, or have you ever heard about multi-billion dollar grants for research project in mathematical proof theory, ancient western roman history or butterfly species in rural kasachstan.<p>This view of what &quot;science&quot; is similar to when people think that &quot;sports&quot; is just &quot;football, baseball, soccer and basketball&quot;. Yes, there is a lot of money in those, but sports is much more than that.<p>P.S.: DoreenMichele is a lady.')
