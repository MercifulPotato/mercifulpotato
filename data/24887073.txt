I really like the close up on the faces, feels far more personal. Also hearing Nixon agree with Kennedys assessment and then moving on to explain where they disagree was almost surreal when you compare it to the first Biden vs Trump debate. I&#x27;m not sure how the quality of these debates have been historically though if someone can enlighten me? Perhaps this year is just an anomaly?')
