Item(by='mkhalil', descendants=None, kids=[25829761, 25829771], score=None, time=1611026053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829286, text='Don&#x27;t forget, Subscribe and Save. Prime Pantry had a subscription service too, so people were very confused about what to do - Prime Pantry or Subscribe and Save - and what saves the most money. Also, with Subscribe and Save, it was and still is* confusing as to WHO the product is bought from. On low-profit price-flucting products (e.g. Case of Redbull), the price will differ AND sometimes it will be unavialable via the subscibed listing but if you searched for the item, you&#x27;d find it Prime from Amazon. The opposite also happens, when Amazon.com is clearly out of an item, yet somehow your subscribtion still makes it on time.<p>Honestly, just typing all that made me very confused.<p>At the end of the day, I don&#x27;t care from who (as long as they&#x27;re reputable) or how, just get me my product, in this price range, this many times per period.<p>*: I still use Subscribe and Safe for the 15% discount - a nice discount if 5 subscriptions are due in the same month.')
