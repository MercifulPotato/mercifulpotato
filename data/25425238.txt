In these towns, if you have out-of-state plates, you will regularly be pulled over for doing 5mph below the speed limit. You can expect a dog to sniff around your car if the patrol has one. You can feel the desire to just take everything that you own; it&#x27;s palpable. I&#x27;ve gotten enough &quot;warnings&quot; to make a suit out of carbon-copy paper.<p>That&#x27;s to say nothing of racial prejudices in many areas of the US, and you&#x27;ll probably have to stop for CBP checkpoints in states like New Mexico, even in the middle of 80mph+ interstates.<p>It was a bad situation in 2018-2019, and I can&#x27;t see it getting much better when restrictions start to lift in 2021. We badly need our courts to strongly re-assert the 4th Amendment.')
