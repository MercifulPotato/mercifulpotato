I switched the fans to some old 90mm noctuas I had laying around and now it is actually more silent than my SBCs for which I had made very ghetto NAS solution.<p>The i5-6500 runs laps around these boards anyway. And I could sell my SBCs for a lot more than what the prodesk cost me (one pi4 with a PoE hat, one odroid xu4 in a cloudshell and a rock pi 4 with the big heatsink).<p>Unless you actually need the GPIO there is no need to go SBC.')
