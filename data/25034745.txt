Not because &quot;corporations are evil lololol&quot;, but because they aren&#x27;t focused on the what <i>we</i> care about. For instance, when a webpage is bloated with ads&#x2F;trackers the website itself is usually relatively lightweight, but has to embed ads&#x2F;trackers to make money, and the ad&#x2F;tracker companies don&#x27;t care about the user experience. Fundamentally, even if the money <i>ultimately</i> comes from the customer, it comes more directly and more short-termly from businesses, so we focus on meeting business use-cases. So if you cut out indirect payment and get money directly from users, I expect we&#x27;ll have a much healthier ecosystem.<p>But let&#x27;s talk more broadly: Servers. Linux is <i>great</i> for servers. But remind me: who gives a flying fuck about servers? Surely not the FSF, because most real people use <i>personal computers</i> (that means desktop&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;tablet&#x2F;phone&#x2F;smartwatch&#x2F;anything else you the typical user can physically unplug&#x2F;open) and don&#x27;t administer servers, and on top of that the FSF dislike services in the first place! (See: &quot;service as a software substitute&quot;).<p>People don&#x27;t have control over enterprise software in most cases - even at the office, your IT department literally chooses what you can do on &quot;your&quot; computer. So why do we have so much free software aimed at business, and so little aimed at e.g. games? Because that&#x27;s what our money systems are set up to get funding from. Point is, enterprise software being open-source is not an end in itself, it&#x27;s only useful as a means to an end.<p>So while corporations can be a useful tool when our interests align, they should not be our <i>primary</i> pillar of support. That should be the actual users, who pay <i>money</i>.<p>I think the biggest mistake we ever made was leaning into the &quot;free&quot; in free software. It&#x27;s not as hard as you&#x27;d think - let me ask you, why is paying with ads and data-sucking so popular? I&#x27;d say, <i>because they&#x27;re convenient and ubiquitous</i>. Every browser and user on the planet has support for ads&#x2F;tracking, so every webpage supports them. They make PayPal niche in comparison! They&#x27;re also incredibly convenient, having zero-click autopay!<p>Distros should have had payment models built into the OS (<i>available) from the start. There should have been &quot;app stores&quot; selling free software from repositories - it&#x27;s absurd that selling free software is claimed as a way of making money, but distros do absolutely nothing to accommodate such sales and will in fact </i>undercut* potentially sustainable free software by repackaging it and putting it in repositories <i>gratis</i>, so now there&#x27;s not even the slight convenience benefit to buying!<p>Yes, it&#x27;s <i>legal</i> for a distro to do that. It&#x27;s also legal for corporations to be parasitic, that doesn&#x27;t make it moral.<p>Anyway, move towards patreon-style funding or traditionally proprietary models that take money directly from the consumer. Then you won&#x27;t see desktops stagnate due to all the money coming from servers.<p>Relevant xkcd: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;619&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;619&#x2F;</a>')
