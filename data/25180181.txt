It seems to make sense <i>if</i> it&#x27;s actually true that you can&#x27;t compare scores across quintiles. As someone who did above-average and came from the bottom quintile it would have helped me a lot. As someone whose kids will very likely grow up in the top quintile I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want that to happen.')
