There are likely hard upper bounds to its worldwide popularity.<p>Look at Russian. Even when the USSR was the most fashionable country on Earth, when Western intelligentsia (eh) was massively convinced that Russians were showing us the future, people were <i>not</i> queuing up to learn Russian. Often Russian intellectuals had to speak another language to communicate with the &quot;outside&quot; (when they were allowed to). It was simply too different in its alphabet, too complicated. The same happened with Japanese, despite Japan being a massive economic and cultural power for more than 40 years. Japanese is occasionally fashionable but it will never be a <i>lingua franca</i>.<p>English might not be the easiest language in the world or the most regular, but it&#x27;s definitely easier than any Asian language featuring complex glyphs. Its pronounciation rules are relatively easy. Its lineage is markedly European, which keeps it close to French and Spanish and makes it easier to piggyback on their own spread. Even if it were to lose its importance tomorrow, should the US self-nuke or something, chances are that its replacement would still be based on the Latin alphabet. That&#x27;s what is used in South America, Australia, Europe, and large parts of Africa, regardless of whether they speak English, Spanish, French... So that&#x27;s what will likely continue to be entrenched, one way or the other. Chinese will grow in importance for sure, particularly in Asia, but it will never be &quot;the&quot; global language.')
