The basic spirit of the contract between a trade executor and the client does not allow for interference barring regulatory or SEC enforcement.<p>Meaning RH took it on themselves to enforce a rule that its users had no idea of, hence the outrage.<p>If it was well known (with clear warnings on the splash screen of RH highlighting their &quot;special&quot; rule) then the case might be different.<p>If it gets rejected at this level then almost certainly SEC will be involved. If they side with RH then it would certainly destroy the trust of the retail trading industry. We also now seem to be witnessing a political opportunity for the Biden administration (ex. AOC&#x27;s tweet throwing support for WSB).<p>Essentially what we are seeing is a payback by the people who got outsmarted by a bunch of redditors and arguing that they cannot be allowed to fail for their own stupid trades (like shorting over 100% of the stock available), so they pulled all the tricks in the book to once again bend the market to their will like they always have.<p>Anybody who thinks things will go as they have before are mistaken; We are in a very different political environment and stuff like this is the perfect opportunity for the Biden administration.')
