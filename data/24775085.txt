Deploy multiple instances. Route booking requests to a subset of the instances. Route other requests to the other instances.</i><p>Don&#x27;t you now have &quot;microservices&quot; bundled together in a single binary - and deployed together? If each of your component exposes different APIs and each instance only handles certain endpoints, then you kind of have microservices - not literally, but it seems the idea is the same.<p>Simplicity being a benefit, I don&#x27;t really see how the dynamic traffic routing is a huge benefit vs microservices - you can dynamically scale up&#x2F;down microservices too.<p>I am not saying this is a bad approach, by the way, but just that it isn&#x27;t much different from microservices.')
