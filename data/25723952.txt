There wasn&#x27;t. It was all generic, and indistinguishable from the stuff in the other threads. That&#x27;s what tilted me toward merging it: yes, the specific detail of this story was significant, but no one was paying any attention to it. Genericness and repetition are the enemies of curiosity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=generic%20discussion%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=generic%20discussion%20by:dang...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20repetition%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20repetition%20by:da...</a><p>If past experience is any indicator, you needn&#x27;t worry about missing any opportunity to discuss any of this. Nobody is trying to deprive you of that, and from experience I can tell you that the worry is on the other sideâ€”that HN will become inundated and overwhelmed by it. It&#x27;s our job not to let that happen.<p>p.s. If by &quot;three comments&quot; you mean the ones that are still here, they were posted after I merged the original set.')
