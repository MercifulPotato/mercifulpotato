Not super helpful.<p>I think text editor is a good example where you need to be lenient. Furthermore, in that use case, any unnecessary modification of the data in <i>any way</i> is a bad idea. This includes replacing invalid code points with something else, unless they&#x27;re edited by the user. The data might not even be UTF-8 in the first place.')
