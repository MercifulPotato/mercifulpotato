There are still areas with official government GIS data that hasn&#x27;t been imported to OSM. For example Irvine County in CA. I wanted to try it but I don&#x27;t have the GIS skills. It would be nice if someone created a tutorial to teach the bare minimum GIS skills to do an import that is up to OSM standards. Importing whole counties would be a huge boost.')
