Most of them are easily guessable with a little bit of research, and because they can often be used to bypass your password they&#x27;re effectively a backdoor into your account. You&#x27;re generally better off using them as either a backup password (that is, not guessable even given knowledge about you), or simply not using them at all. If you forgot your password then reset it via your e-mail account. In short, don&#x27;t use security questions, they&#x27;re fundamentally broken.')
