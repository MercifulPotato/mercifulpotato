I would ask then...<p>What if, there was in fact an organization comprised of people smarter than you and obviously better than you at figuring out what is true or not - and I would go further - one that can tell you how to make better&#x2F;more optimal decisions than you would have made without them?<p>Would you then cede your decision making to them if it were demonstrably better?<p>Would you argue that you should be free to make measurably worse or less optimized decisions for yourself - by virtue of the value of you being un-baised was more important than you making a better decision?<p>This is probably my favorite topic where optimization and normative economics converge, so I&#x27;m curious the replies here.')
