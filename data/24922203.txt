I have worked with a lot of legacy code where functions depend on and mutate global state, often in fairly subtle ways. as much as possible, I want to see exactly which globals are being read&#x2F;written and in what order. from this perspective, the &quot;whole function&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit on one screen, whether or not sub-functions are factored out, and the name of a function cannot possibly tell me all I need to know about it.')
