Option interest also follows interest in the underlying.<p>In a less traded issue - I guaranty the real price is not $0&#x2F;$5, it is just nobody has bothered to show interest yet (and sometimes brokers do not provide the true market).  Assuming you have a reasonable idea of where the bid should be, low ball it a little and put an order in.  Like magic, you&#x27;ll be joined by a few hundred contracts and in fact, probably out bid.  An offer may also appear too.')
