It really helps to read some critical analysis of the game after playing it to to get a better understanding and appreciation for the historical background that is being referenced.<p>The game is part adventure, part ghost story, part commentary on the fading american dream, and part artwork. It sounds pretentious, but it never felt that way to me. It is really hard to describe the game and the plot.<p>It is my favorite game along with Journey.')
