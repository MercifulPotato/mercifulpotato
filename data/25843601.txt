People don&#x27;t commit code without any tests (because it will break production!) and conversely don&#x27;t stress over manually testing dozens of scenarios, some of which were &quot;one-offs&quot; that may become forgotten - it&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; that your code gets released, so the release is no longer a large, time-consuming and stressful event.<p>If you start with a project where code is brittle and there are no tests, it is indeed extremely hard and time consuming to move to CI&#x2F;CD. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a good idea, just that it won&#x27;t be easy and it&#x27;ll take time (you have to build the whole infrastructure of automated testing, canary deployments, etc.  - but, it&#x27;s a good idea to do that anyway! It&#x27;ll gradually improve the velocity. The alternative is that you end up in a world where everybody is afraid of making changes and the simplest requirement ends up getting estimates like &quot;3 months of work&quot;.')
