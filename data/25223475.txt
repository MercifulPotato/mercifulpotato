It&#x27;s about who is going to stay home with the kids and help them with their remote learning.  Which parent is going to quit their job, and how to deal with the financial impact of that.  Closing a school means that everyone in that district has to immediately adapt, and that hits some people much harder than others.<p>Additionally, 22 million children rely on free or reduced-price lunch at school.[2]  Many schools made those same lunches available for pickup earlier this year, but they&#x27;re not going to be able to reach all of those children.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;famee.nr0.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;famee.nr0.htm</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;free-school-lunch-kids-summer-hunger-2019-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;free-school-lunch-kids-summe...</a>')
