Multiple times over the years I&#x27;ve had to build free-lists in Java to avoid this specific problem.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, but I&#x27;ve generally found free-lists to be a net performance negative in Java libraries. Time and again, I&#x27;ve been called in to &quot;optimize&quot; Java code that uses them, and usually by simply removing them I can get rid of the performance problems entirely.')
