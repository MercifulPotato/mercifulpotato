So, what if we revisit this concept with the <i>actual</i> balance of ethnic power in the United States, as revealed by <i>actual</i> income and status statistics, rather than the WASP bogeyman that may have been true in 1963?<p>Is it no longer possible to be racist toward Brahmin Indian immigrants, second generation children of Chinese and Korean immigrants, Jewish people, and the broadly English&#x2F;Nord stock that comprise the vast bulk of the Mormons?<p>This is great news, because I&#x27;m sitting on a pile of real zingers about Guamanians I couldn&#x27;t use because it used to be racist.
