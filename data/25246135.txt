For example, your text editor&#x27;s undo option might run out of memory. Yet, we have undo in text editors.<p>&gt; But you don&#x27;t directly make calls to the filesystem; deletions or updates are always issued by a process acting on your behalf.<p>Yes, so ideally, any system command (such as &quot;mv&quot;) should write a small journal to some undo system, saying what actions are necessary to undo the command. When those actions are logically grouped, then the undo system&#x27;s journal should reflect that.<p>Of course, it would be even better if the filesystem just worked with nestable transactions, like a database.')
