Bear in mind I am sure there are clauses that Amazon is going to cite against -- we only have access to this document. (It also appears hastily written a bit, which I can guess was the case.)<p>I would hold my breath for Sherman (Anti-trust) Act being applied. (Especially, as there is the whole people stormed Congress elephant in the room.) But in summary, the perception I get is that this is a strictly business to business lawsuit, contracts were signed etc.<p>I am curious if some Washington knowledgeable in the area lawyer can provide any insight and their point of view.<p>P.S. Of course this is just the point of view of one-side and we can not say anything concrete until this is litigated.<p>N.B. I am not a lawyer, not familiar and not licensed to practice in Washington.')
