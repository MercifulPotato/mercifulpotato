I dunno. But I know you will not <i>receive</i> money for it.<p>The question is: Is a song a product or an advertisement?<p>I tend to think it is an advertisement. Every young musician dreams of becoming a star. Not so much to pay their bills but for the fame.<p>I think the free market prices things right. You cannot demand people to pay for watching your advertisements.<p>Nonetheless, I wish artists would put their output on their own websites. This centralization in giant silos where people consume music mindlessly and get showered with additional ads devalues their art even further.')
