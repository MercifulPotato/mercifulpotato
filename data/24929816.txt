Remember sticking forms of &quot;munster&quot;, &quot;mun&quot; or &quot;mun001&quot; in there (the ones that validated it by UK Post code logic were the worst).<p>Later I moved to Dublin which had postcodes but they were more postal districts. So my postcode was &quot;Dublin 8&quot;, which again was rejected by a lot of validators.<p>now we have eircodes so my postcode at that same address is d08 xxxx. We&#x27;re getting on some sites the US style autofill of address based on Eircode as a result. but not everywhere&#x27;s used to it. Just Eat, the largest takeaway ordering site goes sets my address to &lt;house number&gt;, &lt;Street name&gt;, &lt;County Dublin&gt;, but if I leave that as is, some local takeaways, including some very near to me see that as County Dublin as opposed to Dublin City and cancel the order thinking I&#x27;m out of delivery range, so I need to correct the final field to Dublin 8 anyway.')
