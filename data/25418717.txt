I doubt that.<p>This seems like a bad frame to look at the situation from. We don’t know what we don’t know, and don’t always actually know what we want.<p>When I went to university there was a ton that I didn’t know. It took me at least a semester to get accustomed to how the institution ran.<p>If my university responded only to what I wanted and “needed” then I would be quite worried about the education they are serving.<p>Also optimizing for employer preferences seems to make sense you know... if you’re focused as a vocational style institute?')
