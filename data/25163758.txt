I think our fear over exposing our children to topics of sexuality prevent them the chance to develop the appropriate sensibilities to avoid being targeted.<p>There&#x27;s not an easy solution, but I hope that being open with my children about the kind of vile people in this world and the tactics they use to trick and manipulate others will instill enough common sense that I don&#x27;t have to hover over their Roblox sessions. I&#x27;m curious if in hindsight you could have educated her better, or if you think it just didn&#x27;t stick.')
